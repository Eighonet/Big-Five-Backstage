#KEZIA.
Why didn't thee speak?
#OLD JOE.
Nothin' to say, my dear.
#KEZIA.
Thee's not much company, for sure.
#KEZIA.
Cain't thee answer?
#OLD JOE.
To what?
#KEZIA.
Why, to me, of course.
#OLD JOE.
Thee'rt a great beauty, Kezia, sure enough!
#KEZIA.
There you are again; always either grumblin' or jeerin' at me.
#OLD JOE.
I'm not doin' neither, woman. I'm tryin' for to make up for thrawtin' of you this mornin' over they soaked crusties as I gave the cat and ruined the nice clean floor.
#KEZIA.
Now , just when I were forgettin' all about it, of course you must bring it all up again, and you're tryin' now all thee knows how, to make the tablecloth like a dish - clout with thy great greasy fingers!
#KEZIA.
Gracious! that's thee all over. Thee gives up one dirty trick for another. I believe you only married me to clean and tidy after you.
#OLD JOE.
Heart alive! I married you because you are the only woman I've ever met in my life I could never weary of, not even if you tormented me night and day. Love of 'e, my dear, seemly, makes a real fool of me most of my time.
#KEZIA.
You was always one for pretty talk, Joe, but you're not a bit what you were i' deeds lately.
#OLD JOE.
'Cause you snap me up so.
#KEZIA.
There you are again, tryin' to pick a quarrel.
#KEZIA.
Now, Joe, you know I cain't abide that 'baccy smell: it gives me a headache.
#OLD JOE.
It gives me a headache to do without 'baccy.
#KEZIA.
I'm fair wore out.
#OLD JOE.
Kiss us, old girl!
#KEZIA.
Don't be so silly. I don't feel like it at all, and I want to be with mother again.
#OLD JOE.
And married only two years!
#KEZIA.
It seems like six to me.
#OLD JOE.
What ails thee, lass?
#KEZIA.
Don't keep allus askin' questions and bein' so quarrelsome; I'm mazed at the sight of 'e, sure enough. You can sit there as long as you've a mind to, and smoke insides black and blue. I'm going to market a bit, and then I shall go into Blanch Sally and talk to she. She've got a bit of common sense. It's just on eight o'clock, and I shan't be more nor an hour or so.
#OLD JOE.
I'd as soon be a dog as a man, sure enough! They can sit by the fire and be comfortable. Come in!
#MATTHEW.
Hallo, mate!
#OLD JOE.
Oh! you?
#MATTHEW.
Well, brother! Thee looks as if thee'd run out o' speerits and 'baccy both.
#OLD JOE.
I'm moody, like a thing.
#MATTHEW.
Got the hump, mate? Have 'e?
#MATTHEW.
Jaw, I suppose?
#MATTHEW.
Thought so. I met the missus as I came along looking a bit teasy. Women's the devil that way; it's in their breed and bone, like fightin' in we. You began all wrong, like me, mate, and females always takes advantage of honeymoon ways, and stamps on we if we don't take 'em in hand at once.
#OLD JOE.
Drat it all! I never began no different to what I am now. I cain't make things up at all. I'm fairly mazed, never having had dealin's with no female, except mother, who was mostly ill, and never in tantrums.
#MATTHEW.
Cheer up, brother, there's no bigger fool than a man as is sent crazy with a woman.
#OLD JOE.
Women is mazy things.
#MATTHEW.
There's allus 'baccy for to fortify us against them, thanks be.
#OLD JOE.
Kezia 'ates 'baccy in the house.
#MATTHEW.
Smoke all the time then; it's the only way.
#OLD JOE.
You allus forgets I'm bent on pleasin' of Kezia.
#MATTHEW.
The more thee tries to please women, mate, the more crotchety they becomes. Within bounds I keep the peace in our place like a judge, but she've learnt, Jane Ann have, that I'll put my foot down on any out - of - the - way tantrums. Give them their heads and they'll soon have we by the heels.
#OLD JOE.
Sometimes I wonder if we give 'em their heads enough. Perhaps they'd domineer less if we left 'em take their own grainy ways.
#MATTHEW.
You bet! If I gave in to Jane Ann entirely, where the devil do 'e think I should be at all?
#OLD JOE.
I've no notion.
#MATTHEW.
Well! I should be like a cat out in the rain, never certain where to put my feet. As it is, as you do know, I cain't keep no dog for fear of the mess its feet 'ud make on the floor; I cain't have a magpie in a cage 'cause its seed 'ud 'appen fall on the table. I've got to walk ginger like a rooster in wet grass for fear o' disturbin' the sand on the clean floor, and I rubs my feet on the mat afore I goes in to my meals enough to split it in half. I gives in to all things 'cause I was took captive over them, in a manner of speaking, almost afore I'd finished courting, and it takes years to understand women's fancies! It's worse nor any book learnin', is understandin' women; and then, when you think you've learnt 'em off by heart, any man 'ud fail under a first standard examination on 'em. Listen to me, mate! Bein' a real pal to thee, Joe, I'm warnin' of 'e now afore it's too late, for thee's only been wed two years, and there's time to alter things yet.
#OLD JOE.
Matthey!
#MATTHEW.
Yes?
#OLD JOE.
Don't you think it is too late even now?
#MATTHEW.
Fur what? It's no use speakin' i' riddles, man. Trust or no trust - that's my plan. Thee's the only livin' man or woman, for the matter of that, as I've blackened Jane Ann to, and if it'll ease thy mind to tell what's worritin' of thee, you do know it's as safe as if you'd dropt your secret into the mouth of a mine shaft.
#OLD JOE.
Done! Give me a hearing and let's have finished with it.
#MATTHEW.
Sling along. It won't get no easier wi' keeping.
#OLD JOE.
Awkward kind o' work, pullin' your lawful wife to bits.
#MATTHEW.
It'll get easier as thee goes on, man. I'll help thee. What's the row to - day?
#OLD JOE.
Crusties.
#MATTHEW.
It's always some feeble thing like that as makes confusion in a house. Jane Ann began just like that. Dirty boots in the best parlor was my first offense, and it raised hell in our house for nigh on a whole day.
#OLD JOE.
Well, I never! It was just the same thing in a way with me. I soaked the crusties in my tea this mornin' and threw 'em to the cat under the table, and I suppose I must 'ave put my foot in 'em, for Kezia went off like a thing gone mazy. She stormed and said - as she were a fool to take me, and all sorts, and then she cried fit to kill herself, and when I spoke she told me to hold my noise, and when I didn't speak she said I'd no feelin's, and was worse nor a stone. We scarcely spoke at dinner - time. She said she wished she was dead, and wanted her mother, and that, bein' a man, I was worse nor a devil; and when I kept on eatin' she said she wondered the food didn't choke me, and when I stopped eatin' she said I was never pleased wi' nothin' she'd got ready for me. My head is sore with the clang of the teasy things she drove into me, and I'm not good at replies, as you do know.
#MATTHEW.
Women be mysteries, and without little uns they'm worse nor monsters. A child do often alter and soften 'em, but a childless woman is as near a wolf as anything I do know.
#OLD JOE.
That's it, is it?
#MATTHEW.
Iss, mate! That's the mischief. Unless - perhaps she be goin' to surprise 'e by telling 'e she be going to have a little one. That would account for her bein' teasy and moody.
#OLD JOE.
Lor', I should be the first to know that, surely!
#MATTHEW.
Not a bit of it. Women loves secrets of that sort.
#OLD JOE.
No; 'tain't that at all. I only wish it was, if what you say be true of women.
#MATTHEW.
True enough, my son. I did the cutest day's work in my life when I persuaded Jane Ann to take little Joe to help we. I watched the two of 'em together and found he caught his tongueing, too, from she, but it had a sort of nestle sound in it as if she were a - cuddlin' of him. She've been gentler wi' me ever since Joe come back again after his long bout at home.
#OLD JOE.
I don't know of no sister's child to take on for Kezia at all. What's the next remedy, think you? thrashin'. what?
#MATTHEW.
Wallop her just once.
#OLD JOE.
Shame on thee, mate! I feel more like strikin' thee nor a female. I'm sorry I told thee, if thee can offer no more help than that. I'm not much of a chap, but I've never struck a woman yet.
#MATTHEW.
Strike on principle, then.
#OLD JOE.
How?
#MATTHEW.
Like the Almighty strikes when He've got a lesson for we to learn, which we won't learn without strikes and tears. Nothin' is of no avail to stop His chastisement if He do think it's goin' to work out His plan for He and we, and that's what I'm wanting of you to do by your wife for her sake more than for yours. Wives must learn to submit. It's Divine Providence as 'ave ordered it, and women be miserable, like ivy and trailers of all sorts, if they've no prop to bear 'em up. Beat her once and it'll make a man of you and be a life - long warnin' to she.
#OLD JOE.
But I love her, man! The very thought of hurting her makes me creep.
#MATTHEW.
Women likes bein' hurt. It's a real fondlin' to 'em at times.
#OLD JOE.
Lor', I never heard that afore. How can you be sure of that at all?
#MATTHEW.
I've traveled, as you do knaw. I ain't been to Africa for nothin', mate. I've seen a deal o' things, which if I'd happened on afore I courted Jane Ann would have got me through the marriage scrimmage wi' no tiles off of my roof. That's why I'm a warnin' of you afore it's too late. Your woman be worth gettin' i' trim - for she's - well - she's -
#OLD JOE.
She's the best sort of woman a man could 'ave for a sweetheart when her moods is off, and it's only lately her 'ave altered so, and I expect it's really all my fault.
#MATTHEW.
Certainly it is; you've never shown master yet, and you must this very night.
#OLD JOE.
How?
#MATTHEW.
You must thrash her before it is too late. Have 'e a cane?
#OLD JOE.
You'm a fair brute, Matthew Trevaskis.
#MATTHEW.
And you'm a coward, Joe Pengilly. I've given you golden advice, and if only a pal had given it to me years ago I shouldn't be in the place I'm in now, but be master of my own wife and my own chimney - corner.
#OLD JOE.
I cain't stomach the idea at all; it's like murderin' a baby, somehow.
#MATTHEW.
Stuff! You needn't lay on too hard to make bruises nor nothin'.
#OLD JOE.
Good Lord! Bruises! Why, man, she've got flesh like a flower!
#MATTHEW.
I almost envies thee, mate. Why, thee's fair daft wi' love still.
#OLD JOE.
Of course I be! She's more nor meat and drink to me; allus have been since the first I took to she.
#MATTHEW.
All the more reason to beat her, and at once. You'll lose her, sure enough, if you don't. It's the only chance for thee now, and I do knaw I'm speaking gospel truth.
#OLD JOE.
I'll do it. It'll nearly be the finish of me, but if you're certain sure she'll love me more after it I'll shut my eyes and set my teeth and - and - yes, upon my soul, I'll do it! She'm more to me than all the world, and I'll save she and myself with her. But are you sure it will do any good?
#MATTHEW.
I swear it, brother. I've never once known it fail.
#OLD JOE.
Never once in all your travels?
#MATTHEW.
Iss, mate, once, sure enough, but the woman had never cared twopence for the man to start with. After it she left 'un altogether.
#OLD JOE.
Oh! Good Lord!
#MATTHEW.
That was no fair start like a thing. See?
#OLD JOE.
No, to be sure.
#MATTHEW.
Now! Now for it!
#OLD JOE.
Well, what now?
#MATTHEW.
We must go and buy the cane.
#OLD JOE.
Sakes!
#MATTHEW.
Bear up! It'll all be over by this time to - morrow night, and that's a great stand by, isn't it?
#OLD JOE.
I suppose it is. Who'll be spokesman over the buyin'?
#MATTHEW.
Me, my son. How far will 'e go i' price?
#OLD JOE.
It's no odds to me, Matthey; I don't know and don't care!
#MATTHEW.
Will sixpence ruin 'e?
#OLD JOE.
It's all ruin. I'm sweatin' like a bull with fear and shame, and wish I was dead and buried.
#MATTHEW.
It's just on nine o'clock. Kezia will be back afore we start if we don't mind. Don't stop to think when you come back, but rush right in and set at it at once, and she'll have time to come round before you settle for the night. Bein' Saturday night, all the neighbors be mostly i' town shoppin', and if there should be a scream I'll make up a yarn to any one who comes near as 'll stop all gossip. I shan't be far off till I reckon it's all over.
#MATTHEW.
Thee deserves to lose her if thee be real chicken - hearted like this 'ere.
#MATTHEW.
Go round by the croft and then we shan't meet her coming home.
#KEZIA.
I'll do my hair down here. He cain't be long, and it's cold upstairs. Gone for tobacco, I suppose, and he'll want his tea when he comes in.
#KEZIA.
Seen a ghost, Joey, my dear, or is it Kezia come to her senses at last, think you?
#OLD JOE.
What's come to thee, lass?
#KEZIA.
Guess!
#OLD JOE.
Cain't at all.
#KEZIA.
Come close, sweetheart.
#OLD JOE.
Kezia.
#KEZIA.
Joey, my dear! He'll be the dearest little thing a woman ever bore.
#OLD JOE.
Heaven cain't be more desirable than this.
#KEZIA.
To think there'll be three of us soon. You see now why I've been so teasy lately. Now I'll sing all day long so he'll be a happy boy.
#KEZIA.
Thee'rt smiling, Joe! Thee and me 'ave both hungered for the same thing. Did thee guess it at all, I wonder? I've kept it from thee a while to make sure. But, lor'! my dear life! whatever be this that you've got here? Eh! Joe! lad! Thee was always unlike other chaps; that's why I do love thee so. Fancy thee guessing, and going to buy him somethin' right away! Oh! it brings it so near like. Most men would have thought of a cradle or a rattle, but thee! Oh! my dear! Thee thought of the first beatin' we should be forced to give him, for, of course, he'll be a lad of tremenjous spirit.
#OLD JOE.
So he will. Both his father and mother be folk of great spirit, and - the first time as he dirts the tablecloth or frets his mother, I'll lay it on him as, thanks be, I've never laid it on nobody yet.
