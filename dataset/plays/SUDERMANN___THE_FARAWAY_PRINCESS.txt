#FRAU LINDEMANN.
There! Now she can come - curtains, bedding - everything fresh and clean as new! No, this honour, this unexpected honour - ! Barons and counts have been here often enough. Even the Russian princes sometimes come up from the Springs. I don't bother my head about them - they're just like - that! - But a princess - a real princess!
#ROSA.
Perhaps it isn't a real princess after all.
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
What? What do you mean by that!
#ROSA.
I was only thinking that a real princess wouldn't be coming to an inn like this. Real princesses won't lie on anything but silks and velvets. You just wait and see; it's a trick!
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
Are you going to pretend that the letter isn't genuine; - that the letter is a forgery?
#ROSA.
Maybe one of the regular customers is playing a joke. That student, Herr Strübel, he's always joking.
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
When Herr Strübel makes a joke, he makes a decent joke, a real, genuine joke. Oh, of course one has to pretend to be angry sometimes - but as for writing a forged letter - My land! - a letter with a gold crown on it - there! "This afternoon, Her Highness, the Princess von Geldern, will stop at the Fairview Inn, to rest an hour or so before making the descent to the Springs. You are requested to have ready a quiet and comfortable room, to guard Her Highness from any annoying advances, and, above all, to maintain the strictest secrecy regarding this event, as otherwise the royal visit will not be repeated. Baroness von Brook, maid of honour to Her Highness." Now, what have you got to say?
#ROSA.
Herr Strübel lent me a book once. A maid of honour came into that, too. I'm sure it's a trick!
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
Dear, dear, isn't that Herr Strübel now, coming up the hill? To - day of all days! What on earth does he always want up here?
#ROSA.
He's in such favour at the Inn. - He won't be leaving here all day.
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
That won't do at all. He's got to be sent off. If I only knew how I could - Oh, ho! I'll be disagreeable to him - that's the only way to manage it!
#STRUBEL.
Good day, everybody.
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
Charming day.
#STRUBEL.
I say! What's up? Who's been rubbing you the wrong way? May I have a glass of beer any way? Glass of beer, if you please! - Several glasses of beer, if you please. - Pestiferously hot this afternoon.
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
H'm, H'm!
#STRUBEL.
Landlady Linda, dear, why so quiet to - day?
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
In the first place, Herr Strübel, I would have you know that my name is Frau Lindemann.
#STRUBEL.
Just so.
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
And secondly, if you don't stop your familiarity -
#STRUBEL.
"Beer - beer!" - Heavens and earth, how hot it is!
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
If you find it so hot, why don't you stay quietly down there at the Springs?
#STRUBEL.
Ah, my soul thirsts for the heights - my soul thirsts for the heights every afternoon. Just as soon as ever my sallow - faced pupil has thrown himself down on the couch to give his red corpuscles a chance to grow, "I gayly grasp my Alpine staff and mount to my beloved."
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
Bah!
#STRUBEL.
Oh, you're thinking that you are my beloved? No, dearest: my beloved stays down there. But to get nearer to her, I have to come up here - up to your telescope. With the aid of your telescope I can look right into her window - see?
#ROSA.
Oh, so that's why -
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
Perhaps you think I'm interested in all that? - Besides, I've no more time for you. - Moreover, I'm going to have this place cleaned right away. Good - bye, Herr Strübel.
#STRUBEL.
I certainly caught it that time! See here, Rosa, what's got into her head?
#ROSA.
Ahem, there are crowned heads and other heads - and - ahem - there are letters with crowns and letters without crowns.
#STRUBEL.
Letters - ? Are you - ?
#ROSA.
There are maids of honour - and other maids!
#PERMIT ME.
Ow! Ow!
#ROSA.
What's the matter?
#STRUBEL.
Why, your head's on fire! Blow! Blow! And while you are getting some salve for my burns, I'll just -
#LIDDY.
Here's the telescope, mother. Now you can see for yourself.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
What a pity that it's in use just now.
#STRUBEL.
Oh, I beg of you, ladies - I have plenty of time. I can wait.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
AH, THANKS SO MUCH. Waitress! Bring us three glasses of milk.
#LIDDY.
Beyond to the right is the road, mother.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
Oh, I have found the road, but I see no carriage - neither a royal carriage nor any other sort.
#LIDDY.
Let me look.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
Please do.
#LIDDY.
It has disappeared now.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
Are you quite sure that it was a royal carriage?
#LIDDY.
Oh, one has an instinct for that sort of thing, mother. It comes to one in the cradle.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
Are you sleepy, dear?
#MILLY.
No, only tired. I'm always tired.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
Well, that's just why we are at the Springs. Do as the princess does: take the waters religiously.
#MILLY.
The princess oughtn't to be climbing up such a steep hill either on a hot day like this.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
Well, you know why we are taking all this trouble. If, by good luck, we should happen to meet the princess -
#LIDDY.
Oh, there it is again!
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
Where? Where?
#LIDDY.
It's just coming around the turn at the top.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
Oh, now I see it! Why, there's no one inside!
#LIDDY.
Well, then she's coming up on foot.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
See, the princess is coming up on foot, too. And she is just as anæmic as you are.
#MILLY.
If I were going to marry a grand - duke, and if I could have my own carriage driven along beside me, I wouldn't complain of having to walk either.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
I can't see a thing now.
#LIDDY.
You have to turn the screw, mother.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
I have been turning it right along, but the telescope won't move.
#LIDDY.
Let me try.
#STRUBEL.
What are they up to?
#LIDDY.
It seems to me that you've turned the screw too far, mother.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
Well, what shall we do about it?
#STRUBEL.
Permit me to come to your aid, ladies. I've had some experience with these old screws.
#LIDDY.
Listen, mother. If the carriage has almost reached the top the princess can't be far off. Wouldn't it be best, then, to watch for them on the road?
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
Certainly, if you think that would be best, dear Liddy.
#STRUBEL.
This is not only an old screw, but it's a regular perverted old screw!
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
Ah, really? - And if she should actually speak to us at this accidental meeting - and if we could present ourselves as the subjects of her noble fiancé, and tell her that we live at her future home - just imagine what an advantage that would give us over the other women of the court!
#STRUBEL.
There, ladies! We have now rescued the useful instrument to which the far - sightedness of mankind is indebted.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
Thanks, so much. - Pardon me, sir, but have you heard anything about the report that the princess is going to make the journey up here to - day?
#STRUBEL.
The princess? The Princess of the Springs? The Princess of the lonely villa? The Princess who is expected at the iron spring every morning, but who has never been seen by a living soul? Why, I am enormously interested. You wouldn't believe how much interested I am!
#LIDDY.
There - there - there - it is!
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
The carriage?
#LIDDY.
It's reached the top already. It is stopping over there at the edge of the woods.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
She will surely enter it there, then. Come quickly, my dear children,
#SO THAT IT WILL LOOK QUITE ACCIDENTAL.-HERE IS YOUR MONEY.
Here is a bouquet for you and here's one for you. You are to present these to the princess.
#MILLY.
So that it will look quite accidental - oh, yes!
#STRUBEL.
Good heavens! Could I - ? I don't believe it! Surely she sits - Well, I'll make sure right away - Oh, I'll go along with them, anyhow.
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
Have they all gone - all of them?
#ROSA.
All of them.
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
There - there - two ladies and a lackey are coming up the footpath. Mercy me! How my heart is beating! - If I had only had the sofa re - covered last spring! - What am I going to say to them? - Rosa, don't you know a poem by heart which you could speak to the princess? They're coming through the court now! - Stop putting your arms under your apron that way, you stupid thing! - oh dear, oh dear -
#FRAU V. BROOK.
Who is the proprietor of this place?
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
At your command, your Highness.
#FRAU V. BROOK.
I am the maid of honour. - Where is the room that has been ordered?
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
Here - at the head of the stairs - my lady.
#FRAU V. BROOK.
Would your Highness care to remain here for a few moments?
#THE PRINCESS.
Very much, dear Frau von Brook.
#FRAU V. BROOK.
Edward, order what is needed for Her Highness and see that a room next to Her Highness is prepared for me. I may assume that these are your Highness's wishes? CERTAINLY, DEAR FRAU VON BROOK.
#THE PRINCESS.
Mais puisque je te dis, Eugenie, que je n'ai pas sommeil. M'envoyer coucher comme une enfant, c'est abominable.
#FRAU V. BROOK.
Mais je t'implore, chérie, sois sage! Tu sais, que c'est le médecin, qui -
#THE PRINCESS.
Ah, ton médecin! Toujours cette corvée. Et si je te dis -
#FRAU V. BROOK.
Chut! My dear woman, wouldn't it be best for you to superintend the preparations?
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
I AM ENTIRELY AT YOUR SERVICE.
#FRAU V. BROOK.
One thing more. This veranda, leading from the house to the grounds - would it be possible to close it to the public?
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
Oh, certainly. The guests as often as not sit out under the trees.
#FRAU V. BROOK.
WELL, THEN DO SO, PLEASE. We may be assured that no one will enter this place?
#FRAU LINDEMANN.
If it is desired, none of us belonging to the house will come in here either.
#FRAU V. BROOK.
We should like that.
#FRAU V. BROOK.
Really, you must be more careful, darling. If that woman had understood French - You must be careful!
#THE PRINCESS.
What would have been so dreadful about it?
#FRAU V. BROOK.
Oh, my dear child! This mood of yours, which is due to nothing but your illness - that reminds me, you haven't taken your peptonised milk yet - this is a secret which we must keep from everyone, above all from your fiancé. If the Grand - Duke should discover -
#THE PRINCESS.
Well, what of it?
#FRAU V. BROOK.
bride's duty is to be a happy bride. Otherwise -
#THE PRINCESS.
Otherwise?
#FRAU V. BROOK.
She will be a lonely and an unloved woman.
#THE PRINCESS.
Ah!
#FRAU V. BROOK.
What is it, dear? And then think of the strain of those formal presentations awaiting you in the autumn! You must grow strong. Remember that you must be equal to the most exacting demands of life.
#THE PRINCESS.
Of life? Whose life?
#FRAU V. BROOK.
What do you mean by that?
#THE PRINCESS.
Ah, what good does it do to talk about it?
#FRAU V. BROOK.
Yes, you are right. In my soul, too, there are unhappy and unholy thoughts that I would rather not utter. From my own experience I know that it is best to keep strictly within the narrow path of Duty.
#THE PRINCESS.
And to go to sleep.
#FRAU V. BROOK.
Ah, it isn't only that.
#THE PRINCESS.
Look out there! See the woods! - Ah, to lie down on the moss, to cover oneself with leaves, to watch the clouds pass by high above -
#FRAU V. BROOK.
We can do that, too, sometime.
#THE PRINCESS.
Sometime!
#FRAU V. BROOK.
Is everything ready?
#THE PRINCESS.
But I simply cannot sleep.
#FRAU V. BROOK.
TO, FOR MY SAKE. Does your Highness command -
#THE PRINCESS.
YES, I COMMAND.
#STRUBEL.
s Voice. Hullo! What's up! Why is this locked all of a sudden? Rosa! - Open up! I've got to look through the telescope! Rosa! Won't you? - Oh, well, I KNOW HOW TO HELP MYSELF. Not a soul inside? - Well, here we are. What on earth has happened to these people? Everything deserted. Well, it's all the same to me. But let's find out right away what the
#STRUBEL.
Why, how do you do? Wouldn't you like to look through the telescope a while? Please do. Why are you going away? I won't do anything to you.
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh, I'm not going away.
#STRUBEL.
That's right. But - where have you come from? The door was locked. Surely you didn't climb through the window as I did?
#THE PRINCESS.
What? - You came - through the window? -
#STRUBEL.
Of course I did.
#THE PRINCESS.
I HAD RATHER.
#STRUBEL.
Oh, my dear young lady, you just stay right here. Why, before I'd drive you away I'd pitch myself headlong over a precipice!
#THE PRINCESS.
I only wanted to go out into the woods for half an hour.
#STRUBEL.
Oh, then you're a regular guest here at the Inn?
#THE PRINCESS.
Yes - yes, of course.
#STRUBEL.
And of course you drink the waters down below?
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh, yes, I drink the waters. And I'm taking the baths, too.
#STRUBEL.
Two hundred metres up and down every time! Isn't that very hard on you? Heavens! And you look so pale! See here, my dear young lady, don't you do it. It would be better for you to go down there - that is - Oh, forgive me! I've been talking without thinking. Of course, you have your own reasons - It's decidedly cheaper up here. I know how to value a thing of that sort. I've never had any money in all my life!
#THE PRINCESS.
But when one comes to a watering - place, one must have money.
#STRUBEL.
Do I look to you as if I drank iron? Thank Heaven, I can't afford such luxuries! No; I'm only a poor fellow who earns his miserable pittance during vacation by acting as a private tutor - that's to say, "miserable" is only a figure of speech, for in the morning I lie abed until nine, at noon I eat five, and at night seven, courses; and as for work, I really haven't a thing to do! My pupil is so anæmic - why, compared to him, you're fit for a circus rider!
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh, well, I'm rather glad I'm not one.
#STRUBEL.
Dear me, it's a business like any other.
#THE PRINCESS.
Like any other? Really, I didn't think that.
#STRUBEL.
And pray, what did you think then?
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh, I thought that they were - an entirely different sort of people.
#STRUBEL.
My dear young lady, all people are "an entirely different sort." Of course we two aren't. We get along real well together, don't we? As poor as church mice, both of us!
#THE PRINCESS.
Who knows? Perhaps that's true.
#STRUBEL.
Do you know what? If you want to stay down there - I'll tell you how one can live cheaply. I have a friend, a student like myself. He's here to mend up as you are. I feed him up at the house where I'm staying. Oh, but you mustn't be - No, I shouldn't have said it. It wasn't decent of me. Only, let me tell you, I'm so glad to be able to help the poor fellow out of my unexpected earnings, that I'd like to be shouting it from the housetops all the time! Of course, you understand that, don't you?
#THE PRINCESS.
You like to help people, then?
#STRUBEL.
Surely - don't you?
#THE PRINCESS.
No. There's always so much talk about it, and the whole thing immediately appears in the newspapers.
#STRUBEL.
What? If you help some one, that appears - ?
#THE PRINCESS.
I only mean if one takes part in entertainments for charity -
#STRUBEL.
Oh, yes, naturally. In those things they always get some woman of rank to act as patroness, if they can, and she sees to it, you may be sure, that the newspapers make a fuss over it.
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh, not every -
#STRUBEL.
Just try to teach me something I don't know about these titled women! Besides, my dear young lady, where is your home - in one of the large cities, or - ?
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh, no. In quite a small town - really more like the country.
#STRUBEL.
Then, I'm going to show you something that you probably never saw before in all your life.
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh do! What is it?
#STRUBEL.
princess! H'm - not a make - believe, but a real, true - blue princess!
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh, really?
#STRUBEL.
Yes. Our Princess of the Springs.
#THE PRINCESS.
And who may that be?
#STRUBEL.
Why, Princess Marie Louise.
#THE PRINCESS.
Of Geldern?
#STRUBEL.
Of course.
#THE PRINCESS.
Do you know her?
#STRUBEL.
Why, certainly.
#THE PRINCESS.
Really? I thought that she lived in great retirement.
#STRUBEL.
Well, that doesn't do her any good. Not a bit of it. And because you are such a jolly, good fellow, I'm going to tell you my secret. I'm in love with this princess!
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh!
#STRUBEL.
You can't imagine what a comfort it is. The fact is, every young poet has got to have a princess to love.
#THE PRINCESS.
Are you a poet?
#STRUBEL.
Can't you tell that by looking at me?
#THE PRINCESS.
I never saw a poet before.
#STRUBEL.
Never saw a poet - never saw a princess! Why, you're learning a heap of things to - day!
#THE PRINCESS.
H'm - And have you written poems to her?
#STRUBEL.
Why, that goes without saying! Quantities of 'em!
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh, please recite some little thing - won't you?
#STRUBEL.
No, not yet. Everything at the proper time.
#THE PRINCESS.
Ah, yes, first I should like to see the princess.
#STRUBEL.
No, first I am going to tell you the whole story.
#THE PRINCESS.
OH, YES, YES. PLEASE DO.
#STRUBEL.
Well, then - I had hardly heard that she was here before I was dead in love with her. It was just as quick as a shot, I tell you. Just as if I had waited all my life long to fall in love with her. Besides, I also heard about her beauty - and her sorrow. You see, she had an early love affair.
#THE PRINCESS.
What? Are they saying that?
#STRUBEL.
Yes. It was a young officer who went to Africa because of her - and died there.
#THE PRINCESS.
And they know that, too?
#STRUBEL.
What don't they know? - But that's a mere detail - it doesn't concern me. Even the fact that in six months she will become the bride of a grand - duke - even that can make no difference to me. For the present she is my princess. - But you're not listening to me!
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh, yes I am!
#STRUBEL.
Do you know what that means - my princess? I'll not give up my princess - not for anything in all the world!
#THE PRINCESS.
But - if you don't even know her - ?
#STRUBEL.
I don't know her? Why, I know her as well as I know myself!
#THE PRINCESS.
Have you ever met her, then?
#STRUBEL.
I don't know of any one who has ever met her. And there's not a soul that can tell what she looks like. It is said that there were pictures of her in the shop - windows when she first came, but they were removed immediately. In the morning a great many people are always lurking around the Springs trying to catch a glimpse of her. I myself have gotten up at six o'clock a couple of times - on the same errand - and if you knew me better, you'd realise what that meant. But not a sign of her! Either she has the stuff brought to her house, or she has the
#POWER OF MAKING HERSELF INVISIBLE.
After that, I used to hang around her garden - every day, for hours at a time. Until one day the policeman, whom the managers of the Springs have stationed at the gates, came up to me and asked me what on earth I was doing there. Well, that was the end of those methods of approach! Suddenly, however, a happy thought struck me. Now I can see her, and have her near to me as often as I wish.
#THE PRINCESS.
Why, that's very interesting. How?
#STRUBEL.
Yes, that's just the point. H'm, should I risk it? Should I take you into my confidence?
#THE PRINCESS.
You promised me some time ago that you would show her to me.
#WAIT A SECOND.
There she is. Please look for yourself. I AM - Actually, there is the garden as plain as if one were in it.
#STRUBEL.
And at the corner window on the left - with the embroidery - frame - that's she.
#THE PRINCESS.
Are you absolutely certain that that is the princess?
#STRUBEL.
Why, who else could it be?
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh, 'round about a princess like that - there are such a lot of people. For instance, there is her waiting - woman, there's the seamstress and her assistants, there's -
#STRUBEL.
But my dear young lady, if you only understood anything about these matters, you would have been certain at the very first glance that it was she - and no one else. Observe the nobility in every motion - the queenly grace with which she bends over the embroidery - frame -
#THE PRINCESS.
How do you know that it's an embroidery - frame?
#STRUBEL.
Why, what should a princess be bending over if not an embroidery - frame? Do you expect her to be darning stockings?
#THE PRINCESS.
It wouldn't hurt her at all!
#STRUBEL.
Now, that's just one of those petty, bourgeois notions which we ought to suppress. It's not enough that we have to stick in this misery, but we'd like to drag her down, too - that being far above all earthly care -
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh, dear me!
#STRUBEL.
What are you sighing about so terribly? The Princess Tell me, wouldn't you like to have a closer acquaintance with your princess, sometime?
#STRUBEL.
Closer? Why should I? - Isn't she close enough to me, my far - away princess? - for that's what I call her when I talk to myself about her. And to have her still closer?
#THE PRINCESS.
Why, so that you could talk to her and know what she really was like.
#STRUBEL.
Talk to her! Heaven forbid! Goodness gracious, no! Just see here - how am I to face a princess? I'm an ordinary fellow, the son of poor folks. I haven't polished manners - I haven't even a decent tailor. A lady like that - why, she'd measure me from top to toe in one glance. - I've had my lessons in the fine houses where I've applied as tutor. A glance from boots to cravat - and you're dismissed!
#THE PRINCESS.
And you think that I - that this girl is as superficial as that?
#STRUBEL.
"This girl"! Dear me, how that sounds! But, how should I ever succeed in showing her my real self? And even if I should, what would she care? - Oh, yes, if she were like you - so nice and simple - and with such a kindhearted, roguish little twinkle in her eye - !
#THE PRINCESS.
Roguish - I? Why so?
#STRUBEL.
Because you are laughing at me in your sleeve. And really I deserve nothing better.
#THE PRINCESS.
But your princess deserves something better than your opinion of her.
#STRUBEL.
How do you know that?
#THE PRINCESS.
You really ought to try to become acquainted with her sometime.
#STRUBEL.
No, no, no - and again no! As long as she remains my far - away princess, she is everything that I want her to be - modest, gracious, loving. She smiles upon me dreamily. Yes, she even listens when I recite my poems to her - and that can't be said of many people! And as soon as I have finished, she sighs, takes a rose from her breast, and casts it down to the poet. - I wrote a few verses yesterday about that rose, that flower which represents the pinnacle of my desires, as it were.
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh, yes. Oh, please, please!
#STRUBEL.
Well, then, here goes. H'm - "Twenty roses nestling close - "
#THE PRINCESS.
What? Are there twenty now?
#STRUBEL.
My princess would not have interrupted me.
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh please - forgive me.
#STRUBEL.
I shall begin again. Twenty roses nestling close Gleam upon thy breast, Twenty years of rose - red love
#UPON THY FAIR CHEEKS REST.
Twenty years would I gladly give Out of life's brief reign, Could I but ask a rose of thee
#AND ASK IT NOT IN VAIN.
Twenty roses thou dost not need - Why, pearls and rubies are thine! - With nineteen thou'dst be just as fair, And one would then be mine! And twenty years of rose - wreathed joy Would spring to life for me - Yet twenty years could ne'er suffice To worship it - and thee!
#THE PRINCESS.
How nice that is! I've never had any verses written to me b -
#STRUBEL.
Ah, my dear young lady, ordinary folks like us have to do their own verse - making!
#THE PRINCESS.
And all for one rose! - Dear me, how soon it fades! And then what is left you?
#STRUBEL.
No, my dear friend, a rose like that never fades - even as my love for the gracious giver can never die.
#THE PRINCESS.
But you haven't even got it yet!
#STRUBEL.
That makes no difference in the end. I'm entirely independent of such externals. When some day I shall be explaining Ovid to the beginners, or perhaps even reading Horace with the more advanced classes - no, it's better for the present not to think of reaching any such dizzy heights of greatness - well, then I shall always be saying to myself with a smile of satisfaction, "You, too, were one of those confounded artist fellows - why, you once went so far as to love a princess!"
#THE PRINCESS.
And that will make you happy?
#STRUBEL.
Enormously! - For what makes us happy after all? A bit of happiness? Great heavens, no! Happiness wears out like an old glove.
#THE PRINCESS.
Well, then, what does?
#STRUBEL.
Ah, how should I know! Any kind of a dream - a fancy - a wish unfulfilled - a sorrow that we coddle - some nothing which suddenly becomes everything to us. I shall always say to my pupils - "Young men, if you want to be happy as long as you live, create gods for yourselves in your own image; these gods will take care of your happiness."
#THE PRINCESS.
And what would the god be like that you would create?
#STRUBEL.
Would be? Is, my dear young lady, is! - A man of the world, a gentleman, well bred, smiling, enjoying life - who looks out upon mankind from under bushy eyebrows, who knows Nietzsche and Stendhal by heart, and - who isn't down at the heels - a god, in short, worthy of my princess. I know perfectly well that all my life long I shall never do anything but crawl around on the ground like an industrious ant, but I know, too, that the god of my fancy will always take me by the collar when the proper moment comes and pull me up again into the clouds. Yes, up there I'm safe. - And your god, or rather your goddess - what would she look like?
#THE PRINCESS.
That's not easy to say. My goddess would be - a quiet, peaceful woman who would treasure a secret, little joy like the apple of her eye, who would know nothing of the world except what she wanted to know, and who would have the strength to make her own choice when it pleased her.
#STRUBEL.
But that doesn't seem to me a particularly lofty aspiration, my dear young lady.
#THE PRINCESS.
Lofty as the heavens, my friend.
#STRUBEL.
My princess would be of a different opinion.
#THE PRINCESS.
Do you think so?
#STRUBEL.
For that's merely the ideal of every little country girl.
#THE PRINCESS.
Not her ideal - her daily life which she counts as naught. It is my ideal because I can never attain it.
#STRUBEL.
Oh. I say, my dear young girl! It can't be as bad as that! A young girl like you - so charming and - I don't want to be forward, but if I could only help you a bit!
#THE PRINCESS.
Have you got to be helping all the time? Before, it was only a cheap lunch, now it's actually -
#STRUBEL.
Yes, yes, I'm an awful donkey, I know, but -
#THE PRINCESS.
Don't say any more about it, dear friend! I like you that way.
#STRUBEL.
Really you are an awfully strange person! There's something about you that - that -
#THE PRINCESS.
Well?
#STRUBEL.
I can't exactly define it. - Tell me, weren't you wanting to go into the woods before? It's so - so oppressive in here.
#THE PRINCESS.
Oppressive? I don't find it so at all - quite the contrary.
#STRUBEL.
No, no - I'm restless. I don't know what - at all events, may I not escort you - ? One can chat more freely, one can express himself more
#THE PRINCESS.
And you are leaving your far - away princess with such a light heart?
#STRUBEL.
Oh, she! She won't run away. She'll be sitting there tomorrow again - and the day after, too!
#THE PRINCESS.
And so that is your great, undying love?
#STRUBEL.
Yes, but when a girl like you comes across one's path -
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
Oh!
#LIDDY AND MILLY.
Oh!
#STRUBEL.
Well, ladies, didn't I tell you that you wouldn't find her? Princesses don't grow along the roadside like weeds!
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
The infinite happiness with which this glorious event fills our hearts must excuse in some measure the extraordinary breach of good manners which we are committing in daring to address your Highness. But, as the fortunate subjects of your Highness's most noble fiancé, we could not refrain from -
#STRUBEL.
Well, well! What's all this?
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
- from offering to our eagerly awaited sovereign a slight token of our future loyalty. Liddy! Milly! My daughters respectfully present these few flowers to the illustrious princess -
#STRUBEL.
I beg your pardon, but who is doing the joking here, you or - ?
#FRAU V. BROOK.
Pardon me, ladies. Apparently you have not taken the proper steps toward being presented to Her Highness. In matters of this sort one must first apply to me. I may be addressed every morning from eleven to twelve, and I shall be happy to consider your desires.
#FRAU V. HALLDORF.
I and my children, madame, were aware of the fact that we were acting contrary to the usual procedure; but the impulse of loyal hearts is guided by no rule. I shall be glad to avail myself of your very kind invitation.
#FRAU V. BROOK.
What forwardness! - But how could you come down without me? - And what is that young man over there doing? Does he belong to those people?
#THE PRINCESS.
Oh, no! That wouldn't be nice. Not that way -
#FRAU V. BROOK.
What? - What! - Why, your Highness - !
#THE PRINCESS.
Let me be, Eugenie. This young man and I have become far too good friends to part in such an unfriendly, yes, almost hostile, fashion.
#FRAU V. BROOK.
Your Highness, I am very much -
#THE PRINCESS.
You and I will certainly remember this hour with great pleasure, and I thank you for it with all my heart. If I only had a rose with me so as to give you your dear wish! - Eugenie, haven't we any roses with us?
#FRAU V. BROOK.
Your Highness, I am very much -
#THE PRINCESS.
Well, how are we going to manage it?
#STRUBEL.
I most humbly thank - your Highness - for the kind intention.
#THE PRINCESS.
No, no - wait! I have it! - But don't think that I'm joking. - And we'll have to do without scissors! I don't know whether there are just twenty Well? - This rose has the merit of being just as real as the sentiment of which we were speaking before - and just as unfading.
#STRUBEL.
Is this - to be - my punishment? Or does your Highness mean by it that only the Unreal never fades?
#THE PRINCESS.
That's exactly what I mean - because the Unreal must always dwell in the imagination.
#STRUBEL.
So that's it! Just as it is only the far - away princesses who are always near to us.
#FRAU V. BROOK.
Permit me to remark, your Highness that it is high time - SEE, THOSE WHO ARE NEAR MUST HURRY AWAY. Well?
#STRUBEL.
With the far - away princess there - it would have been in harmony, but
#WITH THE-.
No, thanks - I'd rather not.
#THE PRINCESS.
I'm going to ask my fiancé to let me send him a rose.
#FRAU V. BROOK.
Your Highness, I am very much - surprised!
#THE PRINCESS.
Well, I told you that I wasn't sleepy.
