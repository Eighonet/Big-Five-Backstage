#MRS. MONTGOMERY.
Mr. Montgomery.
#MR. MONTGOMERY.
Well, my dear.
#MRS. MERRY.
We must go into the country this summer.
#MR. MUMFORD.
Is it absolutely essential to your happiness?
#MRS. MERRY.
Of course I should enjoy it very much. But I wasn’t thinking of myself. The children need it far more than I do. They are both quite feeble and need fresh air and country living.
#MR. MUMFORD.
I hadn’t noticed that the children were not as well as usual.
#MRS. MERRY.
No, I dare say not. Men never notice such things. But they are both ailing; and if I didn’t doctor them all the time, they’d be down sick.
#MR. MUMFORD.
We can’t afford to pay the extravagant prices charged for country board.
#MRS. MERRY.
I don’t expect to go to a fashionable place. But we might get boarded, at a low rate, at some farm - house where we could get fresh fruits and vegetables, and those things which can only be found in the country. I’m sure it’s better to pay one’s money for such things than to spend it for medicine.
#MR. MUMFORD.
The sea - breeze is better than the country air. You might take a trip with the children to Hingham or Nahant once or twice a week.
#MRS. MERRY.
How foolishly you talk! But then it’s what I might expect. These short trips always fatigue people more than they benefit them. When it’s too late to help the children, perhaps you’ll think of my advice and wish you’d followed it.
#MR. MUMFORD.
If it’s as serious a matter as you suppose, and this is the only remedy, I should say go, by all means.
#MRS. MERRY.
You must judge for yourself.
#MR. MUMFORD.
But I don’t believe it is possible to find such a place as would suit you at a reasonable price.
#MRS. MERRY.
I found an advertisement in last week’s paper describing a place that I thought would be just such us we would like. Here it is.
#MR. MUMFORD.
That sounds well enough. But what proof have you that things are as represented?
#MRS. MERRY.
I wrote to Mr. Jones, and received a very gentlemanly reply. As he says, the terms are quite moderate. Mrs. Livingston pays nearly twice as much.
#MR. MUMFORD.
What are the terms?
#MRS. MERRY.
Thirty dollars per week for you, myself, and the two children.
#MR. MUMFORD.
But are there trains at hours to accommodate me?
#MRS. MERRY.
Yes, I took pains to ascertain that.
#MR. MUMFORD.
Very well, then, make whatever arrangements you choose. We can but give it a trial.
#MRS. MERRY.
That’s one point gained. The next thing is to make preparations for our journey. I was determined not to be cooped up in the city another summer, when all our acquaintances are boarding in the country.
#JONATHAN.
Be yeaou the folks what’s going to the Joneses?
#MRS. MERRY.
Yes, we wish to go to Mr. Jones’, at Honeysuckle Villa.
#JACK.
Honeysuckle Villa. Wal, that’s a good un. Ha, ha, ha!
#MRS. MERRY.
Is it possible that they have deceived me? But I shall soon learn. Is the carriage ready?
#JACK.
Ya—as, the kerridge is waitin’. You can see it from the door
#MRS. MERRY.
I don’t see any carriage. There’s nothing but a farm wagon in sight.
#JACK.
That’s the kerridge that’s come for ye, anyway. Mr. Jones thought mebbe you’d hev a lot of baggage, so he sent the hay - riggin’.
#MRS. MERRY.
But there are no seats.
#JACK.
Yes, there’s a board to put across, after we get loaded up.
#MRS. MERRY.
And we are expected to ride in such a vehicle as that?
#JACK.
There aint no use in callin’ it names. It’s easy enough ridin’ in it.
#MRS. MERRY.
But we cannot all sit on one seat.
#JACK.
The children can set on the trunks.
#GEORGE.
Say, mother, have we got to ride in that old, ricketty wagon? It’ll jolt like everything, I know ’twill.
#MRS. MERRY.
We’ve only got to ride a few steps.
#JACK.
Don’t know ’bout that. I reckon it’s a good mile down there, and the roads aint none of the best.
#MRS. MERRY.
Mr. Jones’ advertisement stated that his house was only five minutes’ walk from the station.
#JACK.
Mr. Jones got the schoolmaster to write that notice for the paper. He came up to the house one night and did it. Jones told him to put it in pretty strong. The marster read it out ’loud after he’d writ it, an’ I declair to goodness, I shouldn’t ha’ knowed ’twas the same place we lived in.
#MRS. MERRY.
Well, if I don’t like the place, we shan’t stay, that’s all.
#JACK.
Oh, mebbe you’ll like it, after all. Folks need a change sometimes.
#FLORENCE.
Mother, I’m thirsty.
#MRS. MERRY.
There isn’t anything to drink here. We’ll soon get to Mr. Jones’.
#FLORENCE.
I want something to drink now.
#MRS. MERRY.
Wait patiently a little longer, and then you can have a drink of nice, fresh milk.
#JACK.
I shouldn’t be a mite surprised if they was disapp’inted in their expectations. I guess they won’t find many delicacies at Joneses. Leastways, I never did. Kerridge is ready, folks.
#MRS. JONES.
Dish up the beans, Patty, and be spry now.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Go and tell your mother dinner’s ready, child.
#FLORENCE.
My name’s Florence Malvina Montgomery.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Yes, I know it. Go and tell your mother dinner is ready.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Dinner’s ready, Mrs. Montgomery. Take that chair if you’re a mind to , and the children can set, one on each side of you. Will you have some baked beans, ma’am?
#MRS. MERRY.
Thank you, no, I never eat them.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Don’t eat beans! Why, they’re the wholesomest victuals there is. I’m sure I don’t know what I can give you to eat, then. I haint got nothin’ else but some cold corned beef, and was savin’ that for dinner to - morrer.
#MRS. MERRY.
I might, perhaps, eat a little of the cold meat.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Patty, bring in the cold beef that was left yesterday.
#PATTY PERT.
Yes’m.
#MRS. MERRY.
Haven’t you any new potatoes yet?
#MRS. JENKINS.
Yes, but we thought, as we had these left, we’d use ’em up first.
#MRS. MERRY.
But these are watery, and not fit to eat.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Oh, they aint bad for the time o’ year. Mr. Jones carried the new potatoes to market this morning. They bring a good price now.
#MRS. MERRY.
Well, I’m sure I cannot eat these. You may give me a piece of pie, if you please.
#GEORGE.
Mother, I can’t cut the pie - crust.
#MRS. MERRY.
I’ll cut it for you.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Let me cut it.
#MRS. MERRY.
Haven’t you any strawberries?
#MRS. JENKINS.
Yes, we’re goin’ to have some on the table Sunday. We send them to market every day, the first of the season, they bring such a good price.
#MRS. MERRY.
I suppose you sell your cream too.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Yes, we find we can make more money that way than by makin’ butter and cheese. So we buy our butter at the store.
#MRS. MERRY.
We came to the country expecting to get fresh fruit and vegetables. But it seems we are more likely to find them in the city. I am half inclined to go directly back; however, I will perhaps remain one week. It depends on how we are treated whether we stop any longer.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Lor’ now, what airs these city people do put on! Seems to me there’s no end to their whims and wants. They don’t have the least thought about economy. Patty, you and Jonathan come to dinner.
#POWERS.
Comin’, ma’am.
#MRS. MERRY.
I can’t stand boarding here much longer, that’s a fixed fact. Mrs. Jones sets a most wretched table, and the children are really growing thinner every day. If it hadn’t been for the name of it I should have left Hillsdale before this. The reputation of going to the country for the summer is hardly sufficient to pay for living in small rooms, sleeping on stifling feather - beds, and enduring such execrable cookery, and not a book but the Farmer’s Almanac to be found in the house.
#FLORENCE.
Oh! oh! I’m so scared.
#MRS. MERRY.
Why, Florence Malvina, what a fright you make of yourself! Pray what is the matter?
#FLORENCE.
I guess you’d be frightened if you’d been where I was. I just went outside of the road to find some blackberries, when I thought I heard somebody coming. I looked round, and there was a great ugly - looking cow running after me. I ran as fast us I could till I couldn’t go any further, and then I crept underneath the bars, and came up through the field.
#MRS. MERRY.
It’s a shame for people to allow their cows to run around the streets in such a way. It’s lucky that you were not killed.
#FLORENCE.
The cow would have taken me up on her horns if she had caught me, I know she would. She held her head down all ready to do it. Why George, did you almost get drowned? Just look, mother. George is just as wet as he can be.
#MRS. MERRY.
Well, George Alexander, this is a pretty plight for you to be in. What have you been doing now?
#GEORGE.
I wasn’t doing anything, only building a dam down by the spring, and pretty soon some boys came along, and they laughed at me, and said they bet I couldn’t jump the ditch there. So I meant to show them I could, and I did do it too; but the ground was all soft and wet the other side, and when I tried to jump back again I fell into the ditch.
#MRS. MERRY.
What boys were they?
#GEORGE.
The Dunn boys. They knew it was wet the other side, and when I fell in, you ought to have heard them laugh.
#MRS. MERRY.
They are nothing but ill - bred country blockheads. But don’t stand there any longer with those wet clothes on. Go and change them at once.
#MRS. MERRY.
What a wretched place this is! If I was obliged to live in such a way at home, I shouldn’t think I could bear it. The family here haven’t even decent accommodations for keeping boarders.
#FLORENCE.
O mother, two men are coming, and they are bringing father in. I’m afraid he’s killed.
#MRS. MERRY.
What do you mean, child? What is the matter, Henry? Has there been an accident?
#MR. MUMFORD.
It isn’t quite as bad as it seems. I was a little tired and thought I’d ride up from the village to - night, instead of walking. But the stage broke down, and I was thrown out. I was a good deal bruised, but I believe there are no bones broken. Dr. Bryant examined me, and said I would be all right in a few days.
#MRS. MERRY.
Well, as soon as you are able to leave, I’m going back to the city. I can’t stay here any longer.
#MR. MUMFORD.
You don’t mean that you are willing to go back to the city, and endure all its discomforts again.
#MRS. MERRY.
I’ve come to the conclusion that there are as many annoyances in the country as in the city.
#MR. MUMFORD.
But you forget that the children cannot have country fare after our return.
#MRS. MERRY.
No, I do not. I find that the country fare we sought is all sent to the city, and we must return there in order to enjoy it. After two weeks’ trial of living in the country, I am thoroughly tired of it, and I think a long time will elapse before I again wish to try the experiment of Boarding on a Farm.
