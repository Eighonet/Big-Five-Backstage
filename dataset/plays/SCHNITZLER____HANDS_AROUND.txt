#MARY.
Hello, my beautiful angel!
#MARY.
Don’t you want to come with me?
#SOLDIER.
Oh, I am the beautiful angel?
#MARY.
Sure, who else? Do come with me. I live very near here.
#SOLDIER.
I’ve no time. I must get back to the barracks.
#MARY.
You’ll get to your barracks in plenty of time. It’s much nicer with me.
#SOLDIER.
That’s possible.
#MARY.
Ps - st! A guard may pass any minute.
#SOLDIER.
Rot! A guard! I carry a saber too!
#MARY.
Ah, come with me.
#SOLDIER.
Let me alone. I have no money anyway.
#MARY.
I don’t want any money.
#SOLDIER.
You don’t want any money? What kind of a girl are you, then?
#MARY.
The civilians pay me. Chaps like you don’t have to pay me for anything.
#SOLDIER.
Maybe you’re the girl my pal told me about.
#MARY.
I don’t know any pal of yours.
#SOLDIER.
You’re she, all right! You know—in the café down the street—He went home with you from there.
#MARY.
Lots have gone home with me from that café… Oh, lots!
#SOLDIER.
All right. Let’s go!
#MARY.
So, you’re in a hurry now?
#SOLDIER.
Well, what are we waiting for? Anyhow, I must be back at the barracks by ten.
#MARY.
Been in service long?
#SOLDIER.
What business is that of yours? Is it far?
#MARY.
Ten minutes’ walk.
#SOLDIER.
That’s too far for me. Give me a kiss.
#MARY.
I like that best anyway—when I love some one.
#SOLDIER.
I don’t. No, I can’t go with you. It’s too far.
#MARY.
Say, come to - morrow afternoon.
#SOLDIER.
Sure. Give me your address.
#MARY.
But maybe you won’t come.
#SOLDIER.
If I promise!
#MARY.
Look here—if my place is too far to - night—there … there…
#SOLDIER.
What’s there?
#MARY.
It’s nice and quiet there, too … no one is around.
#SOLDIER.
Oh, that’s not the real thing.
#MARY.
It’s always the real thing with me. Come, stay with me now. Who knows, if we’ll be alive to - morrow.
#SOLDIER.
Come along then—but quick.
#MARY.
Be careful! It’s dark here. If you slip, you’ll fall in the river.
#SOLDIER.
Would be the best thing, perhaps.
#MARY.
Sh - h. Wait a minute. We’ll come to a bench soon.
#SOLDIER.
You seem to know this place pretty well.
#MARY.
I’d like to have you for a sweetheart.
#SOLDIER.
I’d fight too much.
#MARY.
I’d cure you of that soon enough.
#SOLDIER.
Humph—
#MARY.
Don’t make so much noise. Sometimes a guard stumbles down here. Would you believe we are in the middle of Vienna?
#SOLDIER.
Come here. Come over here.
#MARY.
You are crazy! If we slipped here, we’d fall into the river.
#SOLDIER.
Oh you—
#MARY.
Hold tight to me.
#SOLDIER.
Don’t be afraid…
#MARY.
It would have been nicer on the bench.
#SOLDIER.
Here or there, it doesn’t matter to me… Well, pick yourself up.
#MARY.
What’s your hurry—?
#SOLDIER.
I must get to the barracks. I’ll be late anyhow.
#MARY.
Say, what’s your name?
#SOLDIER.
What’s that to you?
#MARY.
My name is Leocadia.
#SOLDIER.
Humph! I never heard such a name before.
#MARY.
Listen!
#SOLDIER.
Well, what do you want?
#MARY.
Give me just a dime for the janitor.
#SOLDIER.
Humph!… Do you think I’m your meal - ticket? Good - by, Leocadia…
#MARY.
Tightwad! Pimp!
