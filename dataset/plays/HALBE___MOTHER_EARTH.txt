#AUNT CLARA.
Yes, just go and see, Zindel, whether they are coming; see whether you can hear anything.
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
Just so, Miss. I shall be back right off. Whoa! Look out! Don't knock anything over! Or the old man will play us the trick and wake up again.
#AUNT CLARA.
Is it you, Lene?
#LENE.
Heavens and all the saints! Why, I didn't see you at all, Miss! Why, I was so frightened!
#AUNT CLARA.
Why in the world are you frightened? You see, don't you, that I am attending to the chandelier, am doing your work again?
#LENE.
Expect a person not to get scared, when all of a sudden a voice like that comes out of the dark, when, on top of it all, a dead man's in the house. As a rule I'm not afraid, but I won't dare to go to the back part of the house alone any more, it's just as if Mr. Warkentin would turn up right before you.
#AUNT CLARA.
Stuff and nonsense, I suppose you kept the candle burning the whole night in your room again? I am likely to come and get your candle one of these days.
#LENE.
Why Miss Clara is afeared herself. She won't go a step without a light. Ain't it true, Miss Clara, you're a little afeared too. You only won't let on.
#AUNT CLARA.
I shall afear your back before long! I have closed the eyes of many in my day. That's nothing new to me.
#LENE.
But all of a sudden, like Mr. Warkentin?
#AUNT CLARA.
When they get to be about seventy, one knows how it goes, old widower Fritz in Kobieken went that way too. Fell over and was gone, it's the best kind of a death. That comes just as it comes.... Have you arranged the cups?
#LENE.
Everything in order. The young master, the lady , no, the lady on the sofa and the young master here , Miss Clara here and the fourth cup ... I suppose some one else is coming with the young master?
#AUNT CLARA.
Yes, and don't ask so many questions! Come here and hold the light, I want to light the chandelier.
#LENE.
Light the chandelier? Why, it's almost daytime.
#AUNT CLARA.
Do as I say. When the young master arrives, it will still be dark.
#LENE.
Wonder whether the young master'll stay long?
#AUNT CLARA.
Wait and see.
#LENE.
Now don't you fall, Miss!
#AUNT CLARA.
Now then!... One does realize, after all, that the years are coming on! When I was of your age, I jumped from the straw stack. You girls of today! you have no sap, no vim! A girl as strong as a bear, and afraid of going to pieces.
#LENE.
Oh my, but now it's beautiful, Miss Clara! The young master will be pleased when he comes.
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
The deuce, Miss Clara! You're up to the business. I do say, the world must come to an end, in grand style!
#LENE.
Anything else to do, Miss?
#AUNT CLARA.
You may go now. If I need you I'll call.
#LENE.
All right, Miss, the water's been put on for the coffee.
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
I was out on the road. Miss. Not a sound yet.
#AUNT CLARA.
For ten years it has not been lighted, Zindel! Ever since Paul has been gone!
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
Do you know, Miss Clara?
#AUNT CLARA.
Goodness!... What is it?
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
I say, Miss Clara? You'll put in a good word for me with the young master? A fellow does want to know where he's at.
#AUNT CLARA.
Yes, yes.
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
Especially now that the old master is dead, and the young master doesn't know about things, all of the work is on a fellow's shoulders, you see.
#AUNT CLARA.
Don't you hear something, Zindel? It seems to me?
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
Where, pray tell?...
#AUNT CLARA.
No, nothing. It only seemed to me....
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
Heavens, Miss Clara!... Where was it - ?
#AUNT CLARA.
Now they may be here at any time. What time is it, Zindel?
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
Almost seven. Miss. The Berlin train arrives at ten minutes after six.
#AUNT CLARA.
You were outside, Zindel, weren't you; didn't you hear a carriage on the road?
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
The wind's from the other way, Miss. One can hear nothing. And it's cold as the deuce! They'll be nice and cold on the way.
#AUNT CLARA.
I do not know how it comes, but the day seems unwilling to break this morning. How does it look outside?
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
Dark, pitch dark. Not a star, nothing. Only over toward the Sobbowitz woods, it's beginning to dawn a bit.
#AUNT CLARA.
Of course, that's where the sun must rise.
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
We'll not get much of a peep at it today. It's going to be a gloomy day.
#AUNT CLARA.
Possibly it will snow.
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
May be, why it's time. Christmas without snow, I can't remember such a thing for the last few years.
#AUNT CLARA.
No night has ever turned out as long as the present one for me. I haven't closed an eye. I heard the clock strike every time. And all the things that I saw and heard!
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
Don't tell it, Miss!
#AUNT CLARA.
I continually saw the dead man, but he was alive and opened the door and came toward me. And yet I knew he was dead. And when I was about to scream, the clock struck and all was gone.
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
Thunderation! You can put it over a fellow.
#AUNT CLARA.
Five ... six ... seven ... It has struck seven, Zindel. They will surely be here any moment. I believe I hear something now.
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
Here they are. You can hear the carriage on the road.
#AUNT CLARA.
After all they came sooner than we expected! Hurry, Zindel, they are driving up now.
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
This minute, Miss Clara ...!
#AUNT CLARA.
If he really is here, praise and thanks to God!
#LENE.
They are coming, Miss Clara, they are coming!
#AUNT CLARA.
Why are you still there? Out with you and help the guests take off their wraps!
#LENE.
Why, I'm doing that very thing, Miss!
#AUNT CLARA.
And keep the coffee in readiness, when I ring. Well, if it's all right with you, I prefer to go to my room for the present.
#PAUL.
As you please. Aunt Clara will show you the way upstairs. Won't you, Auntie?
#AUNT CLARA.
Yes, I'll be glad to show the gentleman up.
#PAUL.
Or aren't the guest - rooms upstairs any more?
#AUNT CLARA.
Why, my boy, we should certainly not think of changing the rooms around. They are very satisfactory and then they've been there so long.
#PAUL.
Why, of course. They have been there so long!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Shall we go?
#AUNT CLARA.
You will find, Paul, everything here is pretty much as of old. Just make yourself comfortable! I shall be back directly. Please, will you come this way?
#PAUL.
Well, the chandelier in full splendor. The old chandelier. Heavens, how sacred it was to me when I was a boy. It was fine of Aunt Clara to light the chandelier.
#HELLA.
Yes, for a bright morning, the chandelier suggests this, that and what not.
#PAUL.
To me the morning seemed pretty dark, as we were riding along. Didn't it to you?
#HELLA.
Oh yes, you are right. It was even disagreeably dark. I kept on fearing we should fall into the ditch. I don't like to ride in a strange region by night.
#PAUL.
I do not see what objections you can have to the chandelier.
#HELLA.
None whatever, Paul.
#PAUL.
Aunt Clara's intentions were certainly good. One does realize that one was expected.
#HELLA.
But you know that I do not like such occasions. That is simply my disposition. I cannot make myself over.
#PAUL.
I certainly do not demand that. Or have I not always allowed you to have your own way!
#HELLA.
Certainly, certainly, up to the present we have agreed on this point.
#PAUL.
And shall continue in the future.
#HELLA.
I am true to my old self, Paul, remain so too.
#PAUL.
Simply because each one of us has freely gone his own way, nothing has been able to separate us. That is the reason why we have kept together so firmly, all of these years. Don't you think so too?
#HELLA.
It seems to me that I held that point of view long before we were acquainted.
#PAUL.
Rather say, with that point of view, we found each other. For this point of view, I sacrificed my home, Hella!
#HELLA.
Yes, therefore it surprises me all the more, that you suddenly seem to be forgetting all about that ...
#PAUL.
In what respect?
#HELLA.
That you behave like a school boy who is coining home for his vacation.
#PAUL.
Hella!... My father is lying there on his bier. I did not see him again!
#HELLA.
Was it your fault? He forbade you his house! This house!
#PAUL.
I have not been able to come to an understanding with him. I shall never come to an understanding with him! Do you realize what that means?
#PAUL.
Will you take off your things, Hella? I don't know, I am cold.
#PAUL.
But how can you be cold. The fire is roaring in the fireplace. Our good aunt has made such perfect preparations. Who knows when she got up in order that we might be comfortable. It is probably due to the night ride.
#PAUL.
Well, come along! I'll help you!... You will surely not remain in your furs.
#PAUL.
You are acting as if you preferred to leave again at once? Frankly, Paul, that is what I should like to do.
#PAUL.
Hella! I simply do not understand you! I do not understand you, and you do not understand me! That is as broad as it is long.
#PAUL.
I don't know how you can think of going away under the present circumstances.
#HELLA.
Quite simple. I do not demand that you shall go with me. You can remain here as long as you are needed, order your affairs, look about for a purchaser of the estate, and when good luck favors you in finding him, you can come on. For the present I may as well precede you to Berlin. You know that editing cannot be put off, the next number must be out in a week. Both of us can not be absent. At least I am indispensable.
#PAUL.
And for this purpose you made a trip of eight hours from Berlin to this place? Hella!
#HELLA.
Yes, this unfortunate trip!
#PAUL.
Unfortunate trip, yes indeed!
#HELLA.
For I must tell you, Paul ...
#PAUL.
Yes?
#HELLA.
I have a feeling that I am not quite suited to this place.
#PAUL.
Aha! That is at the bottom of this insistence about the new number of Women's Rights, which is all but complete even now.
#HELLA.
I have a feeling that I am not adapted to this environment, and my feelings have rarely deceived me.
#PAUL.
Oh, your feelings, Hella! Your feelings! If you had only followed them solely, many matters would stand better today! Believe me.
#HELLA.
I follow my feelings entirely too much, or I should have remained in Berlin and should not sit here in the presence of peasants where I have nothing at stake.
#PAUL.
But I have, Hella! I have very much at stake here. After all a man does not abandon his inheritance point blank. Do not forget that. Of what concern is that to me! Sell it, why don't you! It's nothing but a dead weight to you anyhow.
#PAUL.
Why, I agree with you, Hella. And I am in favor of selling the estate. But not today nor tomorrow. Such things call for deliberation.
#HELLA.
But I simply cannot wait that long. Just confess it, Paul, my place is in the world. You surely don't expect me to desert my post. Our whole cause is hazarded, if I throw up the game now. Particularly at this moment. You are demanding too much!... Do you expect me to give up my life work, simply because you cannot break away from your clod, on account of a stupid loyalty?
#PAUL.
It seems to me, Hella, that we have a career in common. You are acting as if you alone had a career.
#HELLA.
We have had, up to this day. You are the one who is retreating! Not I!
#PAUL.
Hella! You have been my friend! My comrade in stress and tribulation, I may say. We have builded our life on our own resources, our new life, when the old life had renounced us. We have stood together in the combat, for ten years! Are you willing to forget that now?
#HELLA.
Goodness, Paul ...
#PAUL.
For years you have come to me with your wishes. Now I am coming to you! Now your friendship is to assert itself. Answer me!
#HELLA.
Do not fall into tragedy, Paul!
#PAUL.
You are to tell me whether you can leave me alone at this time, whether you can bring yourself to that point. Only a word!
#HELLA.
Am I not here? What else do you expect? And I shall remain here. At least for the immediate present.
#PAUL.
Oh, then all will turn out well! You will remain here! Thank you for that! Now everything may turn out well after all. Mad as it may sound, Hella, under these circumstances. I am almost merry!
#HELLA.
Paul! Paul! Childishness! From one extreme to the other! When will you come to reason. Take an example in me!
#PAUL.
Hella!... This is the soil which nurtured my youth. Do you expect me not be happy?
#AUNT CLARA.
Now then, Paul, here I am again. Have you made yourself at home? Is it warm enough in the hall for both of you? You probably got good and cold on the way. You had the wind to face, didn't you?
#PAUL.
Yes, pretty much! I think it was from the east.
#AUNT CLARA.
It did take me rather a long while, didn't it, Paul?
#PAUL.
You probably had some other matters that required attention? And how Aunt Clara has dressed up! Well, well, Auntie. Still so vain, in your years?
#AUNT CLARA.
Why, Paul, this old dress! I have worn it so many years. Don't you remember at all?
#PAUL.
Yes, yes, now ...
#AUNT CLARA.
I was wearing it when your mother died. That is the time I had it made.
#PAUL.
Oh yes. That has been a long time, to be sure!
#AUNT CLARA.
In waiting for you, I had quite forgotten that I still had on my morning dress. So I quickly put on something else.
#HELLA.
That is exactly what I intend to do, dear Miss Clara.
#PAUL.
Yes, Auntie, you see, I don't even know where you have quartered us? Possibly you would show Hella ...?
#AUNT CLARA.
Right next door, dear Mrs. ... Mrs. - Doctor!
#HELLA.
Well then, please do not go to any trouble.
#PAUL.
May I relieve you of something? Or can I help you in any other way? Unlock the trunk, for instance?
#HELLA.
Do drop these courtesies, Paul! That kind of thing is certainly not in vogue with us.
#PAUL.
As you please!
#PAUL.
So you have lodged us next door? Over there, I suppose ...?
#AUNT CLARA.
Yes, over there, Paul, there ... the body lies.
#PAUL.
Shall we not go in. Aunt Clara?
#AUNT CLARA.
Why, not at once, my boy! You certainly must have something to eat first! Refresh yourself a little. I'll just call Lene, and have her bring the coffee!
#PAUL.
I think we had better wait until Hella and the gentleman are ready.
#AUNT CLARA.
Now you're not cold at all, Paul?
#PAUL.
No, Auntie, I am not cold here. Just look at the fine fire in the fireplace, how it flickers and crackles! I believe it too is glad that I am here again. But who is gladdest of all, well, Auntie, just guess who that may be?
#AUNT CLARA.
Why, I can't know that. I can't guess any more with this old head of mine.
#PAUL.
That she doesn't know! Oh Auntie, Auntie! Why, you yourself, you good old soul!
#AUNT CLARA.
I did light the chandelier for you, Paul.
#PAUL.
Of course, the chandelier! Do you suppose I did not notice that you were at the bottom of that, Auntie? Come give me your hand; thank you very much, Auntie!
#AUNT CLARA.
I'm going to give you a kiss, my boy. Your wife will take no offense at that.
#PAUL.
Oh my wife! That needn't ...
#AUNT CLARA.
Do you still remember, Paul, how I would hold you on my knees and rock you when you were a little fellow?
#PAUL.
Yes, yes, how all of that comes back again! How it is resurrected from its sleep!...
#AUNT CLARA.
Right there, where you are sitting now, my boy, you often read fairy tales to me, about Snow - White and Cinderella and about the wolf and the old grandmother ...
#PAUL.
Fairy tales, yes indeed!
#AUNT CLARA.
You sat here, and I here, and you held up your fairy tale book and acted as if you were grown up ...
#PAUL.
I suppose that's the way one felt too!
#AUNT CLARA.
And papa and mamma were out in society or in the city ...
#PAUL.
Yes, quite so, that's it. For, on the whole, as I remember, I was not in this hall frequently. There was always a little fear mixed up with it. Quite natural! The pictures, the spaciousness, the emptiness and all that! Later that did disappear. The last time that I was in this room, when may it have been ...?
#AUNT CLARA.
It was Christmas Eve, ten years ago, Paul.
#PAUL.
Christmas Eve ten years ago! You may be right. I remember it was a short time before I had ... the crash with father. I had come home at Christmas just because I imagined that that was the best time to come to an understanding with father about all of those matters, my future and other affairs, and I also recall that I wanted to allow the holidays to pass before I dared to come out with my projects, the founding of my journal and my marriage and all the beautiful surprises! Oh it was postponed as long as possible. One did have an inkling of what it would lead to. Of course no one had an idea how it would really turn out!
#AUNT CLARA.
No, Paul, no one had an idea that that would be the last Christmas Eve that we should celebrate together. Your father least of all. All of us were as merry as ever. There stood the tree and the chandelier was lighted ...
#PAUL.
Correct, correct! And Antoinette ... wasn't Antoinette present too? Why of course? That's what complicated the matter so terribly for me. There she sits, my father has invited her, I know that he intends her for me, I am to marry her, I'm to become engaged to her right under the Christmas - tree, as nearly as I can tell. The word is expected from me. All of you are waiting, and I ... why I simply can't. I simply cannot, because I have forged quite different plans for my future, because I too have obligations, in short, simply because it is impossible. Because it was impossible, Aunt Clara! Because I imagined I could not stand it in the country, was destined for something better than a sturdy estate owner and family father, simply because Hella was putting such bees in my bonnet and because, in my stupidity, I believed it all! Just as if the world had been waiting for me to come and set it right! Ridiculous! But at that time I was convinced of it. At that time I had to make a clean breast of it or it would have cost me my life. But, oh, how I did suffer in those days!
#AUNT CLARA.
If you had only told me about it, Paul! But I didn't know a thing about it. Not until it was too late ...
#PAUL.
Yes, then it came quickly. I could not conceal it any longer. It simply burst forth. It can have been only a few days later ...
#AUNT CLARA.
Three days, my boy ...
#PAUL.
Three days, yes, very likely. To me, to be sure, they seemed like eternity. And strangely enough: terrible as the clash with father was, when he found out what intentions I had and that I did not want to remain with him and marry Antoinette and take over the estate some day. Believe me. CLARA, it was a relief in a sense, after all, when it had been said, and father had forbidden me the house and I sat in the carriage and drove away and was free for good. Yes for good! That is what I made myself believe at the time and I fairly breathed with relief and imbibed the crisp air! That must have been approximately this time of the year. Why, certainly! Just about. It was at Christmas.
#AUNT CLARA.
Third holiday is when it was, Paul. I can still see you get into the carriage. It gave me such a shock. I thought I'd fall over.
#PAUL.
Good soul that you are! Yes you always took my part ... Third holiday, you say, it took place? Why that is today. Ten years ago today!
#AUNT CLARA.
This very day!
#PAUL.
I say ... I say ... Ten years! Horrible!
#AUNT CLARA.
And you see, my boy, all this time these candles have not been lighted! Just as they were put out on Christmas Eve, they are in their places today.
#PAUL.
So that is why you lighted the chandelier, Auntie?
#AUNT CLARA.
Yes, now that you are here again, it occurred to me that the candles ought to be lighted again.
#PAUL.
I think we shall let that suffice. Broad daylight is already peering through the shutters. Now then, let us put them out!
#AUNT CLARA.
Praise the Lord! After all it has become daylight once more.
#PAUL.
What do you mean by that. Aunt Clara?
#AUNT CLARA.
I was forced to think so much, because it was the first night that your father has been dead and has been lying there in the corner room.
#PAUL.
Will you not tell me how father died?
#AUNT CLARA.
Oh, Paul what is there to tell about that? Didn't I telegraph to you? Heart failure, is what Doctor Bodenstein said. He went to bed at ten o'clock that night, as always; it was night before last, the first holiday.
#PAUL.
Didn't he call at all? Did he not succeed in making himself heard at all?
#AUNT CLARA.
Not a word! From that time on, no mortal heard another sound from him.
#PAUL.
Do you think he still thought of me?
#AUNT CLARA.
The departed thought of you very often especially lately when thoughts of death were coming to him, I am certain of that.
#PAUL.
And did he not want to see me once more?
#AUNT CLARA.
He said nothing about that.
#PAUL.
Nothing, Aunt Clara? Nothing? Think!
#AUNT CLARA.
He said nothing.
#PAUL.
But he thought it. And did not have time to do it! Now he is taking it down into his grave with him.
#AUNT CLARA.
I was going to ask you, Paul ...?
#PAUL.
Well?
#AUNT CLARA.
What kind of a man can that be who came with you?
#PAUL.
Glyszinski?
#AUNT CLARA.
Why yes, the one I took up stairs, the young man?
#PAUL.
Heavens, he is a friend of ours. Particularly of Hella.
#AUNT CLARA.
Of your wife? Why, Paul!
#PAUL.
Oh, Auntie! There is no danger in him. You need not have any scruples about that. Hella indeed crams her head with thoughts quite distinct from love. She never did suffer from that.
#AUNT CLARA.
But to think that he just came along? Did you invite him?
#PAUL.
Well, what is a man to do? He lives with us.
#AUNT CLARA.
He lives with you?
#PAUL.
We keep house together, yes. And so he wanted to come with us, and Hella was also of the opinion that we could not exactly desert him. He is likely to do some fool thing. You know he is always doing fool things ... It wasn't very agreeable to me, I must confess. But it would not do to leave him at home. When Hella takes a thing like that into her head ...
#AUNT CLARA.
Don't be offended, Paul, I can't get that through my head ... Aren't you the master of your house?
#PAUL.
Master of my house?... No, Auntie, Hella would never put up with that and on that point I am forced to agree with her.
#AUNT CLARA.
The things that one does get to hear in one's old age! I'm too dense for that.
#PAUL.
Well you see. Aunt Clara, these are views that are not exactly understood in the country. One has to work up to that gradually.
#AUNT CLARA.
Are you really happy with them, Paul?
#PAUL.
Why I have fought almost fifteen years for these views! Surely a man will not do a thing like that without serious consideration.
#AUNT CLARA.
So you held those very views at the time when you had your quarrel with your father, who is now dead and gone?
#PAUL.
That's the very reason I went away, Auntie. Do you understand now why it was impossible for me to remain?
#AUNT CLARA.
And do you sometimes still think of Antonie, Paul?
#PAUL.
Antoinette?... Oh yes, sometimes.
#AUNT CLARA.
Now do be frank, Paul! Has the thought never come to you that you would really like to have Antonie?
#PAUL.
Who? I have her?
#AUNT CLARA.
Why Paul? You have her and she have you! Didn't you really care for each other a bit?
#PAUL.
Do you think so? That is so long ago? Possibly. What do I know about it?
#AUNT CLARA.
We were always in the habit of saying they'll make a fine couple when they are big, you and Antonie.
#PAUL.
You see, Auntie, what mistakes one can make. Nothing can be determined beforehand. But I almost think you are right. I liked her quite well, once upon a time. Something like that begins to dawn on me. A big, stupid, love - sick lubber. That's me. And she ... What was she? A remarkably beautiful, sweet young thing with ashy - blond braids. Yes, yes, something like that dawns upon me. She did have splendid ashy - blond hair and dark eyes.
#AUNT CLARA.
How well you still remember that.
#PAUL.
Yes, strange, as it comes to me now. But at that time, you know, when I came back as a student, the aforesaid Christmas, it was all gone, as if obliterated, not a trace of it left. Then my head was filled with things of quite another nature. My home had become strange to me, that is it, Auntie. Hella was in my mind. For that reason nothing could come of it, the match between Antoinette and me.
#LENE.
Shall I bring the coffee. Miss Clara?
#AUNT CLARA.
Yes, and don't forget the pound - cake!... But no, wait, I'll get it myself. Just a moment, Paul!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Here I am!
#PAUL.
Yes, here you are!... You have spent much time on your toilet.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Why, not more than usual.
#PAUL.
To be sure! That's correct. Well it did pay for the trouble. You are fit for a ball.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Where is your wife?
#PAUL.
Also busy with her toilet. But will surely be here directly. It doesn't take her half as long as it does you. Meanwhile, sit down!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Ah, here comes madam! May I conduct you to the table, madam?
#HELLA.
Why, is it time?
#GLYSZINSKI.
Please, here in the place of honor.
#HELLA.
Is it absolutely required that I should occupy the sofa? Will you not sit here, Paul?
#GLYSZINSKI.
Please, please, madam. You are to preside!
#PAUL.
Don't be embarrassed!
#HELLA.
I am not particularly in love with this old uncomfortable furniture. I distinctly prefer a pretty modern fauteuil.
#LENE.
Miss Clara will bring the pound - cake directly. Shall I fill the cups?
#HELLA.
You may go. We shall attend to that. Seems to be a regular country hussy. Did you notice the stupid expression?
#GLYSZINSKI.
Upon her brow the Lord did nail a brazen slab!
#HELLA.
Paul, can't you stop that everlasting marching?
#PAUL.
I find it agreeable after the night's travel. Have you any objections?
#HELLA.
Yes, it makes me nervous, especially here in this awful hall, where every step reverberates ten times over, because you do not even have the proper carpets. Isn't there another room, where one can sit with some comfort.
#PAUL.
No, not at present!
#HELLA.
Then at least do me the favor to sit down, your coffee is getting cold, anyhow.
#PAUL.
Very well! I shall sit down then.
#GLYSZINSKI.
And I, madam? Am I to have none?
#HELLA.
Have you forgotten our household regulations, dear sir?
#GLYSZINSKI.
But he got some, didn't he?
#HELLA.
I have allowed an exception in Paul's case today. Just take the pot and help yourself.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Too bad! Too bad!
#AUNT CLARA.
Children, here comes the pound - cake! Fresh from the oven. It's fairly steaming still. You surely haven't taken your coffee already?
#HELLA.
You are really going to too much trouble, dear Miss Clara.
#AUNT CLARA.
Trouble, well, well. But now do help yourself! PAUL, Do you know, Hella, I do almost feel as I did as a schoolboy, when I came home for the Christmas vacation. In those days we would also sit in the hall and over there the fire would burn and the pound - cake would stand on the table exactly as today. Only that my mother had done the baking.
#AUNT CLARA.
Now you must imagine: I am your mother, Paul. How do you like it?
#PAUL.
Just as much as in the old days. It seems to me as if it were today.
#AUNT CLARA.
Then eat away, my boy!
#HELLA.
You have really had very good luck with this pound - cake, my dear Miss Clara. Accept my compliments.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Delicious! A work of art!
#PAUL.
You may well feel set up about that, Auntie. Glyszinski knows all about cake.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Yes in such matters we Poles are connoisseurs.
#HELLA.
Their whole nourishment is made up of desserts.
#GLYSZINSKI.
I consider sweets a thousand times more elegant than that brutal alcohol, which deadens all finer instincts.
#AUNT CLARA.
I suppose the gentleman was also born in this region.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Yes, mademoiselle, I am a Pole. Pole, and attended the gymnasium in Berlin!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Unfortunately I got away too early. Nevertheless I shall remain what I always was.
#AUNT CLARA.
Do you remember Laskowski, Paul?
#PAUL.
From Klonowken?
#AUNT CLARA.
Yes, quite nearby! He owns the neighboring estate.
#PAUL.
Why, of course! He is even a relative in a sense. What makes you think of him. Aunt Clara?
#AUNT CLARA.
It just occurred to me, simply because he is also a Polander and gets along with his German so well.
#PAUL.
Why, I even attended school with him for a while. He was a fox if there ever was one.
#AUNT CLARA.
Aren't you glad, Paul, that your father held on to Ellernhof for you?
#PAUL.
How so? Why?
#AUNT CLARA.
He might have sold the estate to Laskowski or some one else.
#HELLA.
I cannot see in what sense that would have been a misfortune.
#PAUL.
If Ellernhof had gone over into the hands of strangers? You are simply judging from your point of view. Then I should never have seen my childhood home again.
#HELLA.
But what are we to do with it. We have it on our hands and can't help but be glad to get rid of it at any price.
#AUNT CLARA.
What is your wife saying? You intend to go away, intend to sell?
#HELLA.
Why, certainly! As soon as possible! What else is there for us to do?
#AUNT CLARA.
You intend to sell the estate that has been in the family over two hundred years?
#HELLA.
That can be of no possible advantage to us. Do you expect us to settle down here? Do you suppose I have the least inclination to degenerate out here in the country?
#AUNT CLARA.
And you, Paul, what have you to say to that?
#HELLA.
Paul fully agrees with me.
#PAUL.
Don't torment me with that now, good people, I beg of you. I am really not in the proper mood. There is certainly no hurry about that matter.
#AUNT CLARA.
Don't you realize that you will commit a sin, if you sell the fine estate that your father maintained for you?
#HELLA.
Oh sin! Sin! Do you not, from your point of view, consider the manner in which Paul's father behaved toward us a sin? I am unable to see any difference. There was no compunction about locking the door upon us. I was treated as a nondescript, bringing disgrace to the family! As if my family could not match up with the Warkentins any day! After all, I am the daughter of a university professor, my dear Miss Clara. You possibly fail to appreciate that a bit. Therefore I repeat to you, Paul hasn't the slightest reason to be ashamed of me! And he hasn't been. But Paul's father was. He forced us to earn our daily bread! And now that we have been successful, now that we have won a place for ourselves, now they begin to think of us, simply because they need us. Now they are becoming sentimental. No, dearest! You did not concern yourselves about us! Now we shall not concern ourselves about you! Now we shall simply pay it all back! That's the sin that you were talking about. Ellernhof has no claims upon us,
#GLYSZINSKI.
Madam, your hand!
#HELLA.
Oh do let us dispense with that for the present, doctor!
#PAUL.
That is quite correct, Hella, but there is one thing that you must not forget. I really did provoke my father at the time. I was young and inexperienced. I felt compelled to tell him at the outset, even before I went to the university, that I did not believe that I should be able to endure life in the country later on.
#HELLA.
And the fact that he expected you to marry any woman that suited him; you don't seem to think of that at all.
#PAUL.
Yes, yes, you are right ...
#AUNT CLARA.
Tell me, Paul?
#PAUL.
Yes, Auntie.
#AUNT CLARA.
What in the world have you to do in Berlin that prevents you from staying here?
#PAUL.
Oh, Aunt Clara, that is a difficult matter! I publish a journal. journal? Hm!
#HELLA.
We publish a feminist journal which we ourselves have founded and simply cannot desert.
#AUNT CLARA.
Well is that so very necessary, Paul?
#HELLA.
Is it necessary?
#PAUL.
Oh Hella!
#HELLA.
Yes it is necessary. If you are able to forget it, I am not!
#PAUL.
I shall not quarrel now, the hour does not seem fitting to me. I want to go in. Would you care to go with me?
#HELLA.
You want to see him?
#PAUL.
Yes, I want to see him.
#HELLA.
Excuse me, Paul! I am really not in the frame of mind.
#PAUL.
As you think best.
#HELLA.
You know very well that I spare myself the sight of the dead, whenever I can. I did not even see my father.
#AUNT CLARA.
I'll go with you, my boy, brace up!
#PAUL.
I'm all right.
#HELLA.
I cannot look at the man who has forbidden me his house! Never!
#GLYSZINSKI.
How I admired you, madam!
#HELLA.
I cannot bring myself to that!
#GLYSZINSKI.
How you sat there! How you spoke! Every word a blow! No evasion! No retreat! Mind triumphing over matter! The first time I ever had this impression of you, Hella, do you recall, the large meeting when you stood on the stage and your eye controlled thousands? Then and there my soul rushed out to you! Now you possess it.
#HELLA.
If I really possess your soul, dear doctor, listen to my request.
#GLYSZINSKI.
I am your slave, command me!
#HELLA.
It concerns Paul. You see how matters stand with him.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Paul is not a modern man. I knew that long ago.
#HELLA.
Let us avoid all digressions now! Paul must ... not ... remain here! Do you understand?
#GLYSZINSKI.
What can I do in the matter?
#HELLA.
You must help me get him away from here as soon as possible!
#GLYSZINSKI.
And you would ask me to do that?
#HELLA.
Why shouldn't I?
#GLYSZINSKI.
Expect me to help reestablish the bond between you? Don't be inhuman, Hella!
#HELLA.
But you surely realize the relations that obtain between you and me, doctor. You are my co - worker, my friend!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Is that all, Hella?
#HELLA.
Why, do you demand more? Beyond friendship I can give you nothing! No, it will be better for you to help me plan how we can get him away most readily. Rather today than tomorrow.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Even if I were willing; why he pays no attention to me. Sometimes he strikes the pose of the man of thirty and treats me like a schoolboy. If it were not for you, Hella!
#HELLA.
I see it coming! I see it coming! Irresistible! I have been watching it for a year. Something is working on him. The old spirits have been revived in him. They are restless to assert themselves. That calls for prompt action. He must not remain here. He must absolutely not remain in this atmosphere, which unsettles the mind, this funereal atmosphere. Oh! I can't stand it! Come on, doctor, I must have some fresh air! Get my things!
#GLYSZINSKI.
I am on the wing!
#HELLA.
But no, wait a moment! We can go right through our rooms. A door leads to the garden from there. Isn't that Paul, now? Do you hear?
#GLYSZINSKI.
It seems to be.
#HELLA.
Quickly! I do not care to see him now! I don't want to hear about the dead man. I can't endure it. Do hurry!
#AUNT CLARA.
Compose yourself, Paul! What's the good of it! Your father is past all trouble.
#PAUL.
Yes, he's beyond it all.
#AUNT CLARA.
All of us may be glad when we are that far along.
#PAUL.
When we are that far along, yes, yes, Aunt Clara! When we are all through with it, this incomprehensible, senseless force!
#AUNT CLARA.
Your dead father enjoys the best lot after all. It's not at all an occasion for weeping, Paul.
#PAUL.
You caught the meaning, Auntie.
#AUNT CLARA.
I am old, my boy. I know what is back of life. Nothing.
#PAUL.
You have caught the meaning.
#AUNT CLARA.
When you are as far along as I am, you will think so too.
#PAUL.
I am tired, Aunt Clara! Tired enough to die!
#AUNT CLARA.
That is due to the journey, Paul.
#PAUL.
That is due to the journey. You are right, Aunt Clara. To the long journey and the long, long way.
#AUNT CLARA.
Now you will take a rest, my boy.
#PAUL.
That's what I should like to do, Aunt Clara. Take a real rest after all of the wild years! And they do say the best rest is to be found at home.
#AUNT CLARA.
Do you see how good it is for you to be at home again.
#PAUL.
How calmly he lay there. How great and serene! Not the vestige of a doubt left! Everything overcome. All the questions solved!... Father, father, if I were only in your place!
#AUNT CLARA.
Paul, what's the matter!
#PAUL.
Nothing, Aunt Clara, it's over now.
#AUNT CLARA.
No, no, my boy, there's something wrong with you. You needn't tell me. I know well enough.
#PAUL.
You know nothing at all.
#AUNT CLARA.
And you can't talk me out of it. It's your wife. What I know, I know. Your wife is to blame! And if you do say no ten times over!
#PAUL.
I repeat, Aunt Clara, you know nothing about it! I do not want to hear one word about that, please remember. I do not want to hear of it!
#AUNT CLARA.
Paul, Paul, if you had only taken Antonie!
#PAUL.
Be quiet, Aunt Clara!... Do you want to make me even more miserable than I am?
#AUNT CLARA.
My poor, poor boy!
#HELLA.
These awful visits of condolence all day yesterday! If calls of that kind continue today, I'll simply lock myself in and fail to appear. Let Paul settle it as he may.
#GLYSZINSKI.
And yet! How easily and graciously you can dispose of the good people. I can't get over my astonishment.
#HELLA.
Yes and then to feign a sadness that one does not remotely feel, cannot feel! What an idea!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Do you know what makes me glad?
#HELLA.
No, possibly you will tell me.
#GLYSZINSKI.
That the dead man is out of the house!... I suppose they took him to the church?
#HELLA.
Yes, quite early this morning. The coffin is to be there till tomorrow. I suppose you were afraid? GLYSZINSKI, Why you know that I sometimes see things.
#HELLA.
You modern creature, you! Look at me! I try to see things by daylight. I can battle with them! Not with the other kind.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Oh you don't realize how I have envied you for that.
#HELLA.
Why don't you follow my example then? Do not lose yourself deeper and deeper in your riddles. Enter the conflict! Just as I do!
#GLYSZINSKI.
You, Hella ...! I cannot vie with you.
#HELLA.
Don't be a weakling! Try it! You are old enough.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Too old.
#HELLA.
Too old! Ridiculous. When Paul was of your age he was already in the fray, founding our Women's Rights. And I, I helped him.
#GLYSZINSKI.
You must have been of firmer fiber than we of the younger generation.
#HELLA.
Possibly! I was scarcely twenty at the time, but I felt strong enough to throw down the gauntlet to the whole world, when it was a question of my rights. I had an uncontrollable thirst for freedom, and it is not too much to assert that I gave Paul the incentive for all that followed.
#GLYSZINSKI.
That's just like you, Hella! I suppose he would simply have remained in his old trot if it had not been for you.
#HELLA.
I should not go that far. He had already freed himself, but did not know in what direction to move. He was still groping. He might have followed an utterly wrong course, might have fooled away his time with literature and impractical things like that. His rescue from all that was my work. I guided him! You know he was a pupil of my father. When we became acquainted, I had no difficulty in showering things upon him. You see I had spent my whole childhood in this intellectual atmosphere. And he ... well, you can see from where he had come. That is just why I was ahead of him.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Why was I not born ten years earlier? Then I should have found what he now has and fails to value!
#HELLA.
Yes it was a joyous time! All of us young, vigorous and certain of victory!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Are you so no longer, Hella?
#HELLA.
I?... More than ever ... But I have become tired, Doctor!
#GLYSZINSKI.
I do suppose it requires more than mortal strength to hold out, in this fashion, a whole life long.
#HELLA.
Yes, if one did not know that he is going to prevail, that he will carry out his demands; one can rest assured only when he has the better arguments in his favor. Not until then.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Hella! Hella!...
#HELLA.
Not an hour before that, I tell you. Do you understand the terrible aspect of my present position now? My nails fairly tingle. Whenever I hear the clock strike out there, something seems to drive me away. Another hour gone, and life is so short. It cries within me, go to your post, and I am forced to remain! I must remain on account of Paul!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Oh he doesn't deserve to have you sacrifice yourself for him! If you called me in this manner ... I should follow you to the scaffold!
#HELLA.
What was your impression of Paul today, Doctor? Be frank!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Why do you ask me about that? I scarcely caught sight of him before he rode away.
#HELLA.
It seemed to me that he was more cheerful, freer. Possibly because the body was out of the house.
#HELLA.
May be all will turn out for the best after all. Where in the world are you, Doctor?
#GLYSZINSKI.
I am watching the snow.
#HELLA.
I suppose you are surprised that I am hopeful again?
#GLYSZINSKI.
Since I have been in your company nothing surprises me!
#HELLA.
But Paul must listen to reason. My position is clearly correct. You do not know him as I do. Paul is tender - hearted; all that is necessary is to know how to deal with him. Possibly I did not always know how to do that.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Don't belittle yourself, Hella!
#HELLA.
And there shall be a change. But first of all he must get away from here. Of course we shall have to wait till after the funeral. But then I shall not allow myself to be kept here any longer. I'll get in and ride away and Paul will be forced to come along. When I once have him in Berlin again ...
#GLYSZINSKI.
And the estate?
#HELLA.
I'll simply sell that.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Hella!
#HELLA.
Well?
#GLYSZINSKI.
Are you going to leave Paul?
#HELLA.
How so? What is the matter with you?
#GLYSZINSKI.
Can't you leave Paul! My life is at stake.
#HELLA.
Dear friend, don't stake your life so foolishly! And release my hand. I do not want to leave Paul! I haven't the slightest reason to do so. We agree very well.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Then I was mistaken, after all.
#HELLA.
Yes, it seems so to me also. You simply do not know what Paul has been to me. I want to go to work, I still have much to do. The editorial work is crowding.
#PAUL.
Good morning, you stay - at - homes! Just see how I look.
#HELLA.
You are bringing winter in with you, Paul.
#PAUL.
That's what I'm doing. I'm bringing winter in with me. Regular country winter, with ice and snow, such as the city knows only by hearsay. Don't you envy me?
#HELLA.
How so? For what?
#PAUL.
For what, she asks! Why for all the snow in which I have been stamping about! For this honest winter mood, that I have not had for so many years!
#HELLA.
Where in the world have you been!
#PAUL.
Far, far away, I can tell you.
#HELLA.
One can tell that. You are in a beautiful condition.
#PAUL.
I rode a great, great distance!... To the border of our possessions!
#HELLA.
Is that so very far?
#PAUL.
Very far!... At least it seemed so to me when I was a child.
#HELLA.
Yes, of course, to a child everything seems larger.
#PAUL.
But this time it was no delusion! It was really quite a distance. And I did remain away long enough too.
#HELLA.
Are you not boasting, Paul? I believe you were riding around in a circle.
#PAUL.
And so I did. Criss cross over the fields, taking ditches, helter skelter as it were, right through the dense snow.
#HELLA.
Can you really ride, Paul? Well, I should say! I supposed I had forgotten how, during all of these empty years, but when I had mounted, for a moment I was unsteady, but only for a moment, then I felt my old power. The bay realized that I still know how, and off we were like destruction itself.
#GLYSZINSKI.
I should like to try it myself sometime.
#PAUL.
And curiously enough Hella, strange as the way had naturally become to me, I nevertheless got along easily. After all, one does not forget the things with which one has once been familiar, and, you see, my father took me with him often enough in my boyhood. Possibly in order that, some day in the future, I might get my bearings in the old fields! At last I got into the forest and when I was out of that, I saw the houses of Klonowken, all covered with snow ...
#HELLA.
Klonowken, you say! Isn't that the estate where - what is his name? - your relative lives?
#PAUL.
LASKOWSKI, you mean?
#HELLA.
Quite right, LASKOWSKI ... But you did not call on him, did you?
#PAUL.
No, then I came back.
#HELLA.
The ride has certainly agreed with you. Your color is much better than yesterday.
#PAUL.
Is it?... Well that is just the way I feel.
#HELLA.
Then you can see more clearly today, what you wish to do and what is necessary?
#PAUL.
Much more clearly, Hella! As I trotted along in the snowstorm, many things dawned upon me. My head has became clear, Hella.
#HELLA.
I am glad for you and both of us!
#PAUL.
Yes, for both of us. We must come to an agreement, Hella!
#HELLA.
I hope we are agreed. And, moreover, you know how we can remain so!
#PAUL.
Well, as I rode along, strange! So many years of desk work, I thought to myself, and nothing but desk work. My bones have almost become stiff as a result and, after all, what has come of it? Little enough! You surely must admit that. I can not admit that, Paul.
#PAUL.
But we do live in a continual turmoil, Hella, in an everlasting struggle the outcome of which we can not foresee and from which we shall reap no rewards. We are working for strangers, are sacrificing our best years and have forgotten to consider ourselves. Do you suppose they will thank us some day when we are down and out? Not a soul!
#HELLA.
Nor do I demand gratitude and recognition. I do what I have recognized to be correct; that constitutes my happiness.
#PAUL.
But not mine. I want more, Hella! I am at an age when fine words no longer avail me. And see, here is a world in which I have what I need, what I am seeking, here at last I can follow myself up, can see what is really in me and not what has merely been imposed upon me. I am on the crest of my life, Hella. Possibly past it. Do not take it amiss! I need rest, composure ...
#HELLA.
And for that you are going to the end of the world?
#PAUL.
I had got to the end of the world! Now I shall begin all over again. Would the attempt not be worth while? Tell me, comrade!
#HELLA.
I can't answer you now, Paul.
#PAUL.
Very well! If you can not at present ... There is plenty of time.
#HELLA.
Isn't there? You will give me time. I should like to put it off only a few days longer.
#PAUL.
Why as long as you please. Till then I shall be assured of you and meanwhile you will get acclimated?
#HELLA.
Only a few days, Paul. Possibly I can make a definite proposition to you by that time.
#PAUL.
Hella, my clever, unusual Hella!
#HELLA.
What are you doing, Paul! Don't you see how wet you are?
#PAUL.
Snow - water! Clear snow - water. What harm will that do! Give me a kiss, Hella!
#HELLA.
You do have notions at times!... So here is your kiss!
#PAUL.
Oh, no! Today I must have something unusual!
#HELLA.
Do stop that, Paul! I beg you urgently!
#PAUL.
But why not, Hella! Just for today ...!
#HELLA.
Why Glyszinski is sitting there.
#PAUL.
What is Glyszinski to me? It's surely all right for a husband and wife to kiss each other.
#HELLA.
But not before strangers! I can't bear that, Paul!
#PAUL.
Calm down! It never happens anyhow!
#HELLA.
Because it is really not proper for two people who are as old as we have become. People should become sensible sometime.
#PAUL.
You always were! Why, I don't know you any other way.
#HELLA.
You must have liked it well enough.
#PAUL.
Yes I probably did ...! At that time! Because I was a fool!
#HELLA.
Now you are becoming abusive! Good - by, I have work to do!
#PAUL.
Hella! I am coming to you with an overflowing heart! I have a yearning to be alone with you, once, only once; I am almost desperate for a heart to heart talk ...
#GLYSZINSKI.
If I'm disturbing you, you only need to say so ...
#HELLA.
Do not be funny, doctor. You do know that I wanted to go to my room some time ago. Please let me pass, Paul!
#PAUL.
You have plenty of room! Hella is quite right. There is no longer any occasion for you to go.
#HELLA.
Paul!
#HELLA.
Paul!
#PAUL.
That's all right!
#HELLA.
Oh, is it! Very well! I wish to work, so please do not disturb me.
#PAUL.
Hella! As you please, then!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Hella has locked the door.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Am I disturbing you?
#PAUL.
I have already told you, no! Not any longer, now!
#GLYSZINSKI.
So I have been disturbing you?
#PAUL.
I'll leave that to you.
#GLYSZINSKI.
You would like to have me go away?
#PAUL.
Dear Glyszinski, don't ask such stupid questions!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Well, I should have gone long ago ...
#PAUL.
Indeed?
#GLYSZINSKI.
I can see very well how irksome I am to you.
#PAUL.
You are not at all irksome, dear Glyszinski, neither now nor formerly. You are only funny.
#GLYSZINSKI.
You two admitted me to your household.
#PAUL.
Excuse me! Hella admitted you.
#GLYSZINSKI.
That is what I was going to say. Upon Hella's express invitation ...
#PAUL.
Correct.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Indeed I may say upon her wish ...
#PAUL.
Also correct.
#GLYSZINSKI.
I came into your house.
#PAUL.
That was very kind of you.
#GLYSZINSKI.
And so I can leave it only upon her invitation. Not before! I should be offending Hella, and that I cannot take upon myself. I revere her too much for that.
#PAUL.
Sensitive soul that you are!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Of course my views may not agree with all the conventional rules of society, but there are still other, higher duties.
#PAUL.
And you honor them?
#GLYSZINSKI.
Yes, it is my duty to protect Hella.
#PAUL.
Protect Hella?... Do you know! One is impelled to feel sorry for you!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Well!
#PAUL.
Yes, you have no idea how far you are off the track. That's the reason.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Thanks for your sympathy!
#PAUL.
You are badly off the track, and will hardly get on again, unless you are warned in time. Whether or not that will do you any good, is your affair.
#GLYSZINSKI.
But what does all of this mean? I don't understand you.
#PAUL.
In a word, that means: look out for women who are like Hella! Look out for that ilk! That tells the whole story! The whole story!
#GLYSZINSKI.
And you expect me to follow that advice?
#PAUL.
Do not follow it, but don't be surprised later on if you find yourself in the position in which I am today. It has taken me ten to twelve years to arrive at it. Half of that time will suffice for you.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Why that is sheer nonsense! Your position is estimable enough.
#PAUL.
I am a bankrupt! That's all!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Imagination, pure imagination! You have your position! You have a name in the movement!
#PAUL.
Oh yes! This movement!
#GLYSZINSKI.
I wish I were that far along!
#PAUL.
Possibly you are, without knowing it. But as for myself, when I was of your age and began to fly the track, the aforesaid track, I was quite another fellow! Today as I rode through the snow knee - deep, that became quite clear to me! I saw myself as I had been once upon a time and then realized what had later become of me! All the strength! All the life! All the color! All lost! All gone!... Colorless and commonplace! That is the outcome!
#GLYSZINSKI.
And you blame Hella for all that?
#HELLA.
Glyszinski! Doctor! Why don't you come in! I want you to help me write a number of letters. I shall dictate to you.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Immediately, madam.
#PAUL.
You have been warned!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Some other time! I have no time now!
#PAUL.
He is going the same course! : The Warkentins bring no luck!... And they have no luck!...
#PAUL.
Well, Aunt Clara?
#AUNT CLARA.
It is well that you are here, my boy!
#PAUL.
Is there anything?...
#AUNT CLARA.
Why a person can't talk to your wife. And that young man ... There's something about him too. Where in the world are the two now?
#PAUL.
There, in the other room, Aunt Clara.
#AUNT CLARA.
Do you suppose she will hear us?
#PAUL.
Oh no, Auntie! They are in the green room. The sun - parlor lies between. And then ... when Hella is working, she doesn't hear anyhow.
#AUNT CLARA.
Those two! I do say! They just have to stay together the whole day! But I was going to say ... Laskowskis ...
#PAUL.
What about Laskowski?
#AUNT CLARA.
Wonder whether we ought to send them an announcement?
#PAUL.
I don't care! Although I do not exactly consider it necessary.
#AUNT CLARA.
Just on account of the wife.
#PAUL.
Whose wife?
#AUNT CLARA.
Well, Mrs. Laskowski. Why, don't you know?
#PAUL.
Not a thing! Is Laskowski married?
#AUNT CLARA.
Why, Paul! Didn't he marry Antonie?
#PAUL.
Antoinette ...? Our Antoinette? And I am just finding out about that!
#AUNT CLARA.
Well, I didn't know whether you cared to hear anything about Antonie.
#PAUL.
Why, Auntie, one is interested in the people who were once near and dear.
#AUNT CLARA.
Then, you didn't ask about her yesterday!
#PAUL.
Goodness, Aunt Clara! I didn't want to ask!... After all, I'm finding out soon enough!... Poor Antoinette!... Wasn't she able to find any one else?...
#AUNT CLARA.
You had been gone a year and a half, Paul, and then they got married.
#PAUL.
Well, well ...! That long ago? Then it has really ceased to be news! How does she look? I suppose quite...?
#AUNT CLARA.
Don't say that, Paul! She can vie with the youngest and most beautiful of them! She is in her very prime now! Just set her over against your wife!
#PAUL.
Well, well! Hella is not exactly obliged to conceal herself, it seems to me.
#AUNT CLARA.
But oh, you should see Mrs. Laskowski!
#PAUL.
Well, then old Laskowski may thank his stars. How in all the world did Antoinette run into that fellow? I could never bear him!
#AUNT CLARA.
Have you forgotten every thing Paul? Why, he was forever after her, even when you were still here.
#PAUL.
Why, he is the greatest crook on God's green earth!
#AUNT CLARA.
At first Antonie didn't care a thing in the world for him, but later she took him just the same, when it was all over with you.
#PAUL.
Of course he had his eye on her estate, the sly rogue! I'd vouch for that.
#AUNT CLARA.
Her estate, Grosz - Rukkoschin, went to him right at her marriage. You know that belongs to her from her father's side. You might have that now, Paul.
#PAUL.
Well, and how do the two get along? He and Antoinette?
#AUNT CLARA.
Oh, Paul, what do I know about it? They have no children.
#PAUL.
They haven't any children either? Well!
#AUNT CLARA.
They did have one, a girl! But they lost her.
#PAUL.
Lost her ... Well, well!... Hm! Antoinette!... Antoinette Rousselle as Mrs. von Laskowski!... Could I have dreamed such a thing when I was a sophomore with old Heliodor! Well, of course, we shall send the Laskowskis an announcement. We'll attend to that at once!
#AUNT CLARA.
Never mind, Paul! I have sent it. Yesterday. I was certain it would be all right with you.
#PAUL.
Well, what do you think of Aunt Clara!...
#AUNT CLARA.
It's only on account of the neighbors. Now that you are here and they live right next to us, if we should not even invite them to the funeral....
#PAUL.
Yes, yes, quite right!
#AUNT CLARA.
For you'll have to observe a bit of neighborliness with the estate - owners around here, my boy ...
#PAUL.
Oh, Aunt Clara, here's the same old question again!
#AUNT CLARA.
Now really, Paul, don't you know yet what you are going to do, whether you intend to remain?
#PAUL.
Aunt Clara! I shall never be able to induce Hella. That is becoming clearer and clearer to me!
#AUNT CLARA.
If Ellernhof is sold, I shall not survive it! I have been here thirty - three years! I have carried you all in my arms, you and your brothers and sisters. All of the rest are dead. You are still here, Paul. I closed your mother's eyes for her. I witnessed the death of your father. In all of my days I have known only Ellernhof. At the cemetery I've selected a place for myself where all of them are lying. Shall I go away now at the very end? At least, wait until I am dead!
#PAUL.
Don't make it so desperately hard for me, Aunt Clara!
#AUNT CLARA.
Here they all hang on the walls, those who were once active here ... PAUL, Do you hear? The door - bell.
#AUNT CLARA.
Callers.
#PAUL.
Callers! Again!
#AUNT CLARA.
Probably to express their condolences.
#PAUL.
Just at the most inopportune moment!
#AUNT CLARA.
I shouldn't be surprised if the Laskowskis were coming!
#PAUL.
Antoinette ...? Why, that ...! And I in my riding boots! Do see who it is!
#AUNT CLARA.
Why, of course it is! I can hear him from here ... Shall I bring them in, Paul? PAUL, Can't we take them somewhere else?
#AUNT CLARA.
Where, pray tell?
#PAUL.
Hella, open the door! I want to change my clothes. There are callers.
#AUNT CLARA.
Why, never mind, you are all right!
#PAUL.
It wouldn't do any good anyhow. Hella does not hear me. Go ahead then! Bring them right along.
#PAUL.
This way, if you please. We are very glad to see you!
#LASKOWSKI.
Glad to see you, old chap! Think of seeing you again.
#PAUL.
Unfortunately on a sad occasion!
#ANTOINETTE.
Be assured of our heartfelt sympathy, doctor!
#PAUL.
Thank you very much, madam!
#AUNT CLARA.
Will you not be seated? Antonie, please take the sofa!
#PAUL.
Yes indeed, madam, please! Or would you prefer to sit at the fire? You have been riding.
#ANTOINETTE.
Thank you! I am quite warm. I'll sit down here.
#LASKOWSKI.
Think of my wife sitting at the fire! It would have to come to a pretty pass! One who knocks about in the open all day long, like her!
#PAUL.
Do you do that, madam?
#ANTOINETTE.
Just as it comes! A little horseback, skating ... Whatever winter pastimes there may be!
#PAUL.
And in summer?
#LASKOWSKI.
Oh, in summer something else is doing again! Then there is rowing, fishing and swimming to beat the band!
#ANTOINETTE.
Fortunately we have the lake right near our place.
#PAUL.
Very well, Auntie, bring us that!
#ANTOINETTE.
Don't go to any trouble, Miss Clara. We can't stay long.
#LASKOWSKI.
Well, well, we'll remain a bit longer. I'll still have to go to the inn to take a look at that gelding.
#PAUL.
So bring it along!
#AUNT CLARA.
Very well, boysie, I'm going.
#PAUL.
So you have a lake? Where is it? Surely not at Klonowken?
#ANTOINETTE.
If we only did have that at Klonowken! We have nothing at all there.
#LASKOWSKI.
Heaven knows! The fox and the wolf do the social stunt there!
#ANTOINETTE.
The lake is at Rukkoschin.
#LASKOWSKI.
That is the estate that my dearie brought to me.
#PAUL.
Yes, yes.
#LASKOWSKI.
That's a different layout from the sandy blowouts of Klonowken! Prime soil! And a forest, I tell you, cousin! Over two thousand acres! One trunk as fine as another! Each one fit for a ship's mast! If I ever have them cut down! That will put grease into the pan! Yes, yes, Rukkoschin is a catch that's worth while. We did a good job of that, didn't we, dearie?
#PAUL.
I suppose, dear Laskowski, that no one has ever doubted your slyness.
#LASKOWSKI.
Do you see, Doc, now you say so yourself, and at school you gave me the laugh. That fool Laskowski, so you thought, he'll never get beyond pounding sand in a rat - hole. Have I come up a bit in your eyes? How's that, old boy? Shake hands. Pretty damned long since we have met!
#ANTOINETTE.
We received the announcement this morning, Mr. Warkentin. We thank you very much.
#PAUL.
It was no more than our duty, madam.
#LASKOWSKI.
Yes, we were very glad, my wife and I ...
#ANTOINETTE.
Not to be forgotten!...
#LASKOWSKI.
You hit the nail on the head, that's what you did, dearie! You go on and talk. A fellow like myself isn't so handy with his tongue! But he feels it just the same!
#PAUL.
Rather sudden, was it not, madam?
#ANTOINETTE.
The best thing that one can wish for!
#PAUL.
Do you think so? I don't know.
#LASKOWSKI.
Of course. Heart failure's the thing to have!
#ANTOINETTE.
It grieved me very much.
#PAUL.
Yes, madam.
#ANTOINETTE.
You see, he was my guardian.
#PAUL.
I know it.
#ANTOINETTE.
Of course we had not seen each other for some time ...
#LASKOWSKI.
Goodness, dearie, that's the way it goes sometimes! This fellow's busy and then that fellow's busy ... It's not like in the city. But everybody knows how you feel about it, just the same. And then if you do meet in the city, or at the stockyards, or somewhere else, the jollification is twice as big. Just lately I met your father in just that way. It's not been four weeks. Met him at the station just as I was going to town. And the old gent crossed my path and acted as if he didn't see me. It was right at the ticket window. Of course, I called him! Good morning, major, says I! Howdy? Chipper, and up and coming as ever? Oh, says he, not particularly! Those very words! I can still see him as he stood there!
#ANTOINETTE.
Why you didn't tell me a thing about that.
#LASKOWSKI.
Guess I forgot to. Who'd think it would be the last time. When I heard that he was dead, day before yesterday, it came to me again. Then we rode in the same compartment and he kept telling me a lot about you, Doc. PAUL, Really?
#LASKOWSKI.
He was pretty much bothered, what would become of the place, when he'd be dead and gone ...
#PAUL.
You don't say!
#LASKOWSKI.
On my honor, Doc.! Expect me to fib to you. Of course I talked him out of it, and told him not to bother about it. First of all that it wasn't up to him yet, and if it was, I was still in the ring.
#PAUL.
Very kind of you.
#LASKOWSKI.
With all my heart! You and me, Doc., h'm? We understand each other! We'll come to terms all right. Old chap! Old crony! How tickled I am to see you right here before me again! How often I have said if Paul was only here now. Didn't I, dearie!
#ANTOINETTE.
Yes, yes.
#LASKOWSKI.
Well, what have you been doing all this time, Doc.?
#PAUL.
All kinds of things.
#LASKOWSKI.
Regular old Socrates. It makes a fellow's wheels buzz to think of what he's got in his head all the time! Do you remember, old chap, how you used to help me out when we were juniors?
#PAUL.
Sophomores, dear Laskowski! You failed to make junior standing.
#LASKOWSKI.
Damn it all! Did you remember that? I see, old chap, that a fellow has to be on his guard with you.
#PAUL.
If you think ...
#LASKOWSKI.
These fellows from Berlin. They are up to snuff! That's the place! If they ever come out into the country, look out, boys. They'll not leave a shirt on your back! Guess you made a good deal of spondulics in Berlin, didn't you, Doc.?
#PAUL.
Why?
#LASKOWSKI.
Goodness, a fellow will ask about that. You don't need it, of course. Ellernhof is worth sixty, seventy thousand dollars any day, and a fellow can live off of that. If you can only find a buyer ...
#PAUL.
I haven't the least desire, dear Laskowski.
#LASKOWSKI.
It's a hard thing too, now - a - days. Buyers are scarce and times are hard for the farmer.
#ANTOINETTE.
You have gone to all this trouble, after all, Miss Clara.
#AUNT CLARA.
Not at all worth mentioning!
#LASKOWSKI.
Why, what have you brought here, Miss?
#PAUL.
You drink port, don't you, madam?
#LASKOWSKI.
If you don't care for it, dearie, I drink for you.
#ANTOINETTE.
You may pour me one glass. You're sure it won't hurt you, dearie?
#ANTOINETTE.
Why should it? I drink on other occasions.
#LASKOWSKI.
Because you are always getting a headache.
#ANTOINETTE.
I?
#LASKOWSKI.
Now don't get mad right off! Can't a fellow crack a joke? Don't you see that it's a joke? Drink ahead, dearie! I'm drinking too. And then I must be going too.
#PAUL.
Must you; where?
#LASKOWSKI.
Of a forenoon, there's nothing up to a glass of port.
#PAUL.
Why don't you drink, Aunt Clara!
#AUNT CLARA.
Oh, I don't care much for wine, my boy, as you may remember.
#LASKOWSKI.
Well, did you like it, dearie?
#PAUL.
May I give you some more, madam?
#ANTOINETTE.
No, thank you. It would go to my head.
#LASKOWSKI.
I'll take another glass. Then I must be going. It's a quarter of eleven.
#PAUL.
What else have you in mind?
#LASKOWSKI.
Well, since it just fits in, we being here today, I just want to go over to the inn. They've advertised a gelding there. Take a look at him. If he can be had cheap ... Haven't put one over on anybody for some time! Your old gent did invest in a cellar! There ain't a thing, Doc., that I envy you as much as that cellar!
#ANTOINETTE.
I shall wait till you return. Come back soon!
#LASKOWSKI.
On the spot, dearie. I'll only take a vertical whisky over at the inn! Good - by, dearie! Good - by, Doc.!
#AUNT CLARA.
Mercy, my dinner! You can't depend upon these girls! First thing, it'll be burned.
#ANTOINETTE.
Did you not bring Mrs. Warkentin with you, Doctor?
#PAUL.
Yes, Auntie, please tell Lene to go around and tell my wife we have callers. This door is locked. She cannot get through here.
#AUNT CLARA.
Very well, Paul, I shall see to it.
#PAUL.
You are not cold, are you, madam? Or I will put on some more wood.
#ANTOINETTE.
Not on my account! I am accustomed to the cold.
#PAUL.
Strange! As hardened as all that.
#ANTOINETTE.
Completely! PAUL, Antoinette ...? Doctor? PAUL, Once my name was Paul. Don't you remember?
#ANTOINETTE.
I have forgotten it!
#PAUL.
Well then, madam, may I speak to you?
#ANTOINETTE.
Will you not call your wife?
#PAUL.
May I not speak to you?
#ANTOINETTE.
I don't know what you could have to say.
#PAUL.
Something that concerns only you and me and not another soul!
#ANTOINETTE.
I do not care to hear it.
#PAUL.
Antoinette!
#ANTOINETTE.
Don't!
#PAUL.
Then why have you come?
#ANTOINETTE.
Don't, I tell you!
#PAUL.
Then why have you come, I ask of you?
#ANTOINETTE.
They fairly dragged me here!
#PAUL.
So you did not come of your own accord?
#ANTOINETTE.
No!... I should never have come!
#PAUL.
Antoinette ... Is that the truth?
#PAUL.
Then to be sure ...!
#ANTOINETTE.
Why in the world doesn't your wife come in?
#PAUL.
Very well! Let her come!
#LENE.
Mr. Warkentin ...?
#PAUL.
What is it?
#LENE.
Mrs. Warkentin says that she has no time now, she'll come directly.
#PAUL.
Very well!... You may go!
#LENE.
Thank you, Mr. Warkentin!
#PAUL.
As you see, it is not to be, madam!
#ANTOINETTE.
It would seem so.
#PAUL.
I have had to endure much, Antoinette, very much!
#ANTOINETTE.
Possibly I have too.
#PAUL.
Why, Antoinette, you are weeping?
#ANTOINETTE.
I? Not at all!
#PAUL.
You are weeping, Antoinette!
#ANTOINETTE.
I can't help it.
#PAUL.
Come, madam! Let me conduct you to the sofa.
#ANTOINETTE.
I can go alone. Why do you concern yourself about me at all?
#PAUL.
Antoinette! Don't be stubborn at this moment! Our time is short. Who knows whether we shall ever speak to each other again as we now do.
#ANTOINETTE.
All the better!
#PAUL.
Our time is awfully short. I cannot let you go away so! We must make use of the moment! The moment that will possibly never return.
#ANTOINETTE.
Do permit me to go by myself! I do not need you! I need no one!
#PAUL.
Very well! I shall not molest you! As you please!
#ANTOINETTE.
You see I am quite calm. It was only a temporary indisposition.
#PAUL.
May I sit down near you, Antoinette?
#ANTOINETTE.
What have you to say to me? PAUL, I am forced to look at you, Antoinette! Pardon me! I am forced to look at you again and again!
#ANTOINETTE.
Do save up these compliments for your wife, doctor!
#PAUL.
No compliments, Antoinette! The moment is too precious!
#ANTOINETTE.
Then why don't you spare yourself the trouble?
#PAUL.
Didn't you feel it, the very moment you came in, Antoinette; I could not keep away from you.
#ANTOINETTE.
Quite flattering!
#PAUL.
Antoinette! Now you must listen to me to the very end.
#ANTOINETTE.
Goodness! What do you expect of me?
#PAUL.
Or you should not have come!
#ANTOINETTE.
Why in the world did I do it?
#PAUL.
Antoinette! You are so wonderful! More wonderful than I have ever seen you before!
#ANTOINETTE.
Oh, indeed ...! Possibly you are even sorry.
#PAUL.
For shame, madam. Such expressions are not suited to you! Leave them to others!
#ANTOINETTE.
Your own fault! You have brought mo to this!
#PAUL.
You have become unfeeling, Antoinette!
#ANTOINETTE.
I am simply no longer that stupid little creature that you can wind around your finger as once upon a time. Do you still remember that Christmas Eve, Doctor Warkentin?
#PAUL.
I remember it all, Antoinette. Why on that evening my life was decided.
#ANTOINETTE.
So was mine. In this very hall. I sat at this very place and you before me as now. There is such a thing as providence. I have always believed in that! But now I see it with my own eyes. God in heaven will not be mocked! On my knees I have prayed to him ...!
#PAUL.
Antoinette!
#ANTOINETTE.
On my knees I prayed for him to punish you.
#PAUL.
Toinette, you are mad! What awful injury did I inflict upon you?
#ANTOINETTE.
You upon me? Oh, none at all! Did you know about me at all? You scorned me! What, that stupid little thing wants me, the great man! Who am I and what is she! Off with her.
#PAUL.
Toinette!
#ANTOINETTE.
Yes, off with her. And I did throw myself away! I knew all the time it would spell misfortune for me if I married this ... this man.
#PAUL.
Is that the way matters stand?
#ANTOINETTE.
Yes, indeed, that's the way they stand. I don't think of making a secret of it. The whole world knows it. It is shouted from the house - tops!
#PAUL.
The dog!
#ANTOINETTE.
It's easy for you to use strong terms now. You hounded me into it! I owe it all to you. But one consolation has remained for me. I have become unhappy. But so are you! And that is why I have come.
#PAUL.
What does this mean, Antoinette?
#ANTOINETTE.
Heavens! Simple enough! You do take an interest in the woman that has been preferred to you. You would like to make the acquaintance of such a marvel.
#PAUL.
You are malicious, madam!
#ANTOINETTE.
Not at all. I only wanted to see, with my own eyes, how happy you are. But I am quite sufficiently informed. One only needs to take a look at you.
#PAUL.
Are you satisfied now?
#ANTOINETTE.
Yes.
#PAUL.
Are you compelled to detest me?
#ANTOINETTE.
Do you expect me to thank you?
#PAUL.
Does it really make you happy to talk to me in this manner, Antoinette?
#ANTOINETTE.
Happy or not, what I have vowed before the altar, I shall not fail to keep.
#PAUL.
I am the last person to hinder you, Toinette! But I surely may look at you? Will you forbid that?
#ANTOINETTE.
Don't talk to me in this manner!
#PAUL.
Just look into your face, Antoinette, the few moments that remain! Stamp upon my mind how much I have lost! Look into your eyes, just once more! Into your wonderful eyes!
#ANTOINETTE.
Don't talk to me in this manner, I say. I haven't deserved it!
#PAUL.
Antoinette, I have found none of the things that I was seeking. I have been miserably deceived! Are you satisfied now?
#PAUL.
Why aren't you glad?
#PAUL.
Weep, Antoinette! Weep! I wish I could.
#ANTOINETTE.
I must go! Where is my husband? I must have fresh air! My head!
#PAUL.
Yes, fresh air, Toinette, there we shall feel less constraint. It is fine outside, the snow is falling. Everything is white. Everything is old. Just as both of us have become, Toinette.
#ANTOINETTE.
I am so afraid! So terribly afraid!
#PAUL.
You will feel better. Snow is soothing. Come and I will tell you about my life. Possibly you will forgive me then, Antoinette?
#ANTOINETTE.
Possibly!...
#PAUL.
Thank you, Toinette! Thank you!... And now come.
#ANTOINETTE.
Where shall we go?
#PAUL.
To the park, Toinette, to the brook, do you remember, to the alders?
#ANTOINETTE.
To the alders, I remember.
#PAUL.
Out into the snow, to seek our childhood.
#AUNT CLARA.
Are all of the knives and forks properly arranged back there?
#LENE.
Everything's in order, Miss Clara.
#AUNT CLARA.
Why, then we are through.
#LENE.
They can come right along now.
#AUNT CLARA.
I can't help but think that it's time for the bell.
#LENE.
It's striking twelve.
#AUNT CLARA.
You're certain, are you, that the roast is being basted properly?
#LENE.
Oh, Lizzie's looking after things.
#AUNT CLARA.
The sermon seems to be pretty long.
#LENE.
Oh, he can never find his finish. Miss Clara.
#AUNT CLARA.
Let him talk, for all I care! Only I might have put off the dinner.
#LENE.
Now the bell is ringing.
#AUNT CLARA.
Yes, they are ringing. Then it is over.
#LENE.
Now the coffin's in the ground, ain't it, Miss Clara?
#AUNT CLARA.
God grant him eternal peace!
#LENE.
Amen!
#AUNT CLARA.
And light everlasting shine for him!
#LENE.
Amen!
#AUNT CLARA.
I should have been glad to pay him the last honor, but it was impossible. What would have become of the roast? We shall see each other in the next world anyhow. It will not be very long!
#LENE.
Oh, Miss Clara.
#AUNT CLARA.
Don't stand there! Do your work! They will surely be here directly, Six ... eight ... twelve ... sixteen ... eighteen ... twenty ... twenty - two ...
#LENE.
That's the number. There are eight sleighs.
#AUNT CLARA.
Go and open the door of the green room!
#LENE.
What will Mrs. Warkentin say to that?
#AUNT CLARA.
I will attend to that. It can't be helped today. We shall have to use the rooms for our coffee later.
#LENE.
She'll make a nice fuss!
#AUNT CLARA.
Off with you now. They are coming. Take the ladies and gentlemen into the front rooms until we have the dinner on the table. Then you can go and call them.
#LENE.
Very well, Miss Clara.
#HELLA.
What is the matter with my room? Why are the doors open?
#AUNT CLARA.
The guests certainly must have some place where they can relax a bit, later on.
#HELLA.
In my rooms?
#AUNT CLARA.
They surely can't sit around in this one place the whole afternoon. They must take their coffee somewhere.
#HELLA.
Why I do say ...! Really! All of my books are gone!
#AUNT CLARA.
I put things to rights a bit, madam. Why I couldn't leave them as they were. I took the books upstairs.
#HELLA.
Upstairs! Very well, then that's where I will go.
#PAUL.
Where are you going?
#HELLA.
I am going upstairs.
#PAUL.
Where are you going!
#HELLA.
Upstairs. I can't find a nook down here today where I might rest.
#PAUL.
So you really refuse to dine with us?
#HELLA.
Spare me the agony, Paul! You know I can't endure so many strangers. It will give me a headache.
#PAUL.
Stay a short time at least! Show that much consideration!
#HELLA.
Consideration ... No one shows me any consideration!
#PAUL.
Nice mess, when not even the nearest relatives ...
#HELLA.
Why, you are to be present.
#PAUL.
But you must be present! I desire it, Hella!
#HELLA.
And what if I simply cannot?
#PAUL.
Why not?
#HELLA.
Because I cannot. Because I hate these feeds!
#PAUL.
That is correct. So do I! But what can we do about it? It is the custom.
#HELLA.
Custom, Paul, custom!... Have we founded our life upon old customs?
#PAUL.
If we only had!
#HELLA.
Do you think so?
#PAUL.
Yes, possibly we should have fared better.
#HELLA.
And then, my dear, I will tell you one thing more. You are compelling me to do so.
#PAUL.
And that is?
#HELLA.
I don't care to lie.
#PAUL.
What do you mean by that?
#HELLA.
I don't care to feign, to these people, feelings that are entirely absent. That is why I am going upstairs.
#PAUL.
Does that refer to ... the dead?
#HELLA.
Yes, it does! I did not know him and he did not know me! Did not care to know me. What obligations remain for me? None at all.
#PAUL.
Are you serious?
#HELLA.
In all seriousness. Now it is out.
#PAUL.
Very well, then go!
#HELLA.
I'll see you later.
#PAUL.
Hella! For my sake ... Do not go. Stay here!
#HELLA.
No, Paul, one should not force himself to do such things. Put the responsibility upon your father! I am not to blame. I am only acting as I must. You would do the same.
#PAUL.
It's well that you are reminding me of that.
#AUNT CLARA.
Shall I remove your wife's plate?
#PAUL.
Yes, take the plate away.
#AUNT CLARA.
Have you seen the Laskowskis?
#PAUL.
Yes, at the cemetery, Auntie. I shall go now and call the guests.
#LENE.
What is it. Miss Clara?
#AUNT CLARA.
Have the soup brought in! It will take me some time to fill all of the plates, anyhow.
#LENE.
Very well!
#AUNT CLARA.
Now where are you to serve? And where is the coachman to serve? You haven't forgotten?
#LENE.
I am to serve on the right and the coachman on the left. Is that right?
#AUNT CLARA.
Yes, you may go! And don't forget, all serving is to be done by way of the green room! Be sure not to come in from this side!
#PAUL.
Come in, ladies and gentlemen! In this way!
#RAABE. SR.
I don't know, but that cemetery put a stitch into my side.
#SCHNAASE.
Yes, that was a nasty, cold snow. If we only get something to eat soon!... So we can warm up!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Ought to be a bit careful of yourself at your age, Mr. Raabe!
#RAABE.
Why, how old am I? Seventy!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Not worth mentioning, eh? Prime of life!... How old was Warkentin?
#SCHNAASE.
Why we just heard about that in the sermon, sixty - two!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Not very old!
#RAABE.
Yes, that's the way they go ...
#SCHNAASE.
To the grand army, eh Raabe, old boy? Who knows when we will get our orders.
#RAABE.
It will be our turn next.
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Don't say that! It is not a matter of age! Look at Warkentin, did he give evidence of his end?
#SCHNAASE.
The affair with his son put him over, or he would be here today.
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Why, where is the young man?
#SCHNAASE.
Pretty nice fellow in other respects!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
He will have a deuce of a time if he intends to farm here. You can't pick that up helter skelter. Has any one heard? Does he intend to take it on? Or is he going to sell?
#RAABE.
In the old days the son always followed in the footsteps of his father. The son of a land - owner became a land - owner. That's all out of style now. Everybody goes to school.
#SCHNAASE.
Well, your son is doing that very thing, Raabe.
#RAABE. JR.
Good morning, Mr. Schnaase!
#SCHNAASE.
Good morning, brother student!
#RAABE. JR.
Well, pa?
#RAABE.
Well, my son?
#SCHNAASE.
Keeping right after beerology, young man?
#RAABE. JR.
Purty well, thanks! A fellow guzzles his way through.
#SCHNAASE.
How many semesters does this make, Mr. Raabe?
#RAABE. JR.
Mebbie you'd better not ask about that.
#RAABE.
How many semesters? Twelve! Isn't that it, my son?
#RAABE. JR.
Astoundingly correct!
#SCHNAASE.
Then I suppose you'll tackle the examinations one of these days, Mr. Raabe?
#RAABE. JR.
There's plenty of time.
#RAABE.
Just let him study his fill! I'm not at all in favor of too much hurry! He'll get office and emoluments soon enough.
#SCHNAASE.
I know one thing, my boy will not get into a gymnasium! The agricultural school for him, till he can qualify for the one year's service and off with him. No big notions for him!
#RAABE.
Outch, there's my stitch again!
#RAABE. JR.
Take a whisky, pa! Shall I get us a couple? few fingers might not do any harm.
#SCHNAASE.
Have the girl before you kiss her, according to Lehmann.
#RAABE. JR.
What'll you bet? I can get some!
#RAABE.
Divvel of a fellow!
#SCHNAASE.
Well now, I'd just like to see.
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
That is not exactly extraordinary.
#MRS. SCHNAASE.
Oh, I don't know, Elizabeth, I find it quite pretty.
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
And the wife does not seem to be much in evidence.
#MRS. SCHNAASE.
Yes, she seems a bit high toned.
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
Quite a bit. I wonder what kind of notions she has about the society that she has encountered here!
#MRS. SCHNAASE.
Do you think they will stay here?
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
Such creatures blow in from Berlin, puff up like a turkey gobbler. I'd hate to know about her past!
#MRS. SCHNAASE.
Mrs. Laskowski looks pretty interesting today.
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
Do you think so? Well, perhaps she has her reasons.
#MRS. SCHNAASE.
You don't say! Do tell.
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
Don't you know about it at all?
#MRS. SCHNAASE.
Why no, what? I don't get out very much, you know.
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
It was before your day. You were not here then. I have a dim recollection, when I was quite a young girl.
#MRS. SCHNAASE.
Is it possible? What was it?
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
She had an affair with him ...
#MRS. SCHNAASE.
With whom, pray tell?
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
The man with whom she is standing there.
#MRS. SCHNAASE.
Why that is young Mr. Warkentin.
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
Pst. They are coming. Later she married her husband out of spite, because she did not get him!
#MRS. SCHNAASE.
To think that she would still talk to him!
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
Heavens, what does she care! Doctor, just a word!
#DR. BODENSTEIN.
At your service, madam!
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
I only wanted to ask about a trifling matter, Doctor.
#DR. BODENSTEIN.
I shall be delighted, madam.
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
But no one must hear us.
#MERTENS.
If you are willing to put up with me for the present, madam?
#MRS. SCHNAASE.
Oh, thank you very much! But I might ...
#MERTENS.
Please, please, madam! May I offer you my arm?
#JOSUPEIT.
Too late! Just my luck! I was about to report!
#MERTENS.
You will have to get up a bit earlier the next time, my dear fellow; I shall take you to the table, madam.
#JOSUPEIT.
Take me to the table dear, good madam! I'll tell you something quite interesting too.
#PAUL.
We shall eat immediately, Mr. Mertens.
#MERTENS.
Please, please, as concerns me!
#JOSUPEIT.
My heartfelt sympathy, Mr. Warkentin! PAUL, I thank you!
#JOSUPEIT.
Another man of honor gone. Terribly sudden!
#PAUL.
But I must not detain you, Mr. Josupeit!
#JOSUPEIT.
Once more, my heartfelt sympathy!
#PAUL.
You see, madam, that's the way of it! Just back from the cemetery. One buried forever, and the next moment all of their thoughts somewhere else. Joyous and of good cheer.
#ANTOINETTE.
Yes, that's the way of it!
#PAUL.
Life rolls on merrily. The dead are dead. We shall have the same fate some day, madam.
#ANTOINETTE.
Of course we shall. It is immaterial to me.
#PAUL.
Really?
#ANTOINETTE.
It does not matter to me, whether it comes today or tomorrow. Sometime I shall have to go! So the quicker the better. It is all over with me!
#PAUL.
Antoinette!
#ANTOINETTE.
You may believe me, I am quite serious!
#PAUL.
How calmly you say that! In the very bloom of life! I cannot think of you thus.
#ANTOINETTE.
How?
#PAUL.
Cold and dead.
#ANTOINETTE.
But I can. Very well indeed. I am so now!
#PAUL.
That isn't true, Antoinette. Your eyes tell a different story!
#ANTOINETTE.
Never mind my eyes!
#PAUL.
But I can't help it. I must look into them! I feel as if I must find something there.
#ANTOINETTE.
Don't go to any trouble!
#PAUL.
Indeed, indeed, Antoinette!
#ANTOINETTE.
What in the world could you find?
#PAUL.
.. Possibly my lost life?
#ANTOINETTE.
Why do you speak so to me, Paul?
#PAUL.
Do I hear it from your lips, Paul, Paul, as of old?
#ANTOINETTE.
Paul! Paul! Desist!
#PAUL.
It has been a long time since I have heard that sound!
#ANTOINETTE.
Desist, at least for today, I beg of you! It seems like a sin to me!
#PAUL.
Why like a sin?
#ANTOINETTE.
You were just remarking about the rest, and now you are doing the same thing, forgetting the dead.
#PAUL.
I - forget him? I am thinking of him incessantly! And of his last words, before we parted forever! Do you know what they were, Toinette?
#ANTOINETTE.
Tell me!
#PAUL.
"Go! Some day you will be sorry!" ... Possibly he was right, the dear old man! Today it kept resounding from his open grave, as the clods and lumps of snow rumbled down on his coffin. "Are you sorry now? Are you sorry now?" ... I have tried to get rid of it, but it refuses to go. It keeps pursuing me and cries into my ears!
#LASKOWSKI.
Well, dearie, how are you? What are you doing?
#ANTOINETTE.
Oh, it's you!
#LASKOWSKI.
Who would it be? Ain't it up to me to look after my dearie now and then. Shan't we eat? They are all sitting down.
#PAUL.
Your husband is quite right, madam. We are the last. Unfortunately Mrs. Warkentin is not very well. May I request you to play the part of the hostess a bit?
#ANTOINETTE.
If it must be, Doctor ...
#PAUL.
Yes, there is no help for it, madam.
#LASKOWSKI.
And I, old boy. Where am I to go?
#PAUL.
Wherever you please! The world is wide and there is room for all.
#LASKOWSKI.
I guess the shortest way is the best! I'm going to sit right here.
#KUNZE.
Ladies and gentlemen! Before sitting down at the board, to regale ourselves with food and drink, does it not involve upon us to devote a few words to the memory of the beloved deceased, whose mortal remains we have today conducted to the last resting place. And how can we do that more fittingly, ladies and gentlemen, than by recalling the words recorded in holy writ. Ladies and gentlemen, what are the words of the psalmist? The days of our years are three - score years and ten; and if, by reason of strength, they be four - score years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off and we fly away! Ladies and gentlemen! He who no longer dwells in our midst in the body, but whose spirit is looking down upon all of us, the beloved deceased, may he rest in peace.
#LASKOWSKI.
A soup like that does warm a fellow up.
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Especially when you have been out in your sleigh for nearly two hours.
#LASKOWSKI.
And then a full hour at the cemetery on top of it.
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
But the sermon was really touching. From the very heart. Any one who had known the dead man ...
#LASKOWSKI.
Not a soul kept from crying!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Yes, remarkably beautiful! fellow forgot all about being hungry.
#MRS. BOROWSKI.
Are they talking about the sermon?
#PAUL.
Yes, Mrs. Borowski.
#MRS. BOROWSKI.
I didn't understand very much.
#PAUL.
At your age, Mrs. Borowski!
#MERTENS.
Who is she?
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
It's the widow of the former teacher at the estate here.
#MERTENS.
She seems to hail from the days of the French occupation!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Does she? She has at least eighty years on her back.
#MERTENS.
But is well preserved.
#MRS. BOROWSKI.
I say, Mr. Warkentin, I knew your father when he was no bigger than ...
#PAUL.
Fifty years ago?
#MRS. BOROWSKI.
Oh, it's longer than that. Almost sixty. I saw them all grow up. Now I'm almost the only one left from those times.
#LASKOWSKI.
Well, here's to you Auntie!... You don't drink very much any more I suppose?
#MRS. BOROWSKI.
Oh, indeed! I am still able to take a glass.
#PAUL.
Come, Mrs. Borowski, let me help you.
#MRS. BOROWSKI.
When I was young I never caught sight of wine. Now that I'm old I have more than I can drink.
#LASKOWSKI.
Drink ahead, Auntie! Drink ahead! Wine makes you young!
#MRS. BOROWSKI.
You know, your good wife is always sending me some.
#LASKOWSKI.
I do say, dearie, why, I don't know a thing about that.
#LASKOWSKI.
Makes no difference, dearie, no difference at all! Just send ahead! We do have a lot of it.
#ANTOINETTE.
There is surely enough for us to spare a little for an old lady.
#LASKOWSKI.
Sure, dearie!
#MRS. BOROWSKI.
Do you remember, pet, how you used to come and call with your parents, now dead and gone? A little bit of a thing you were, Paul would lift you on the horse and you didn't cry at all, you sat there just like a grown - up ... I remember it very well.
#ANTOINETTE.
I don't. Such things are forgotten.
#PAUL.
Have you really forgotten that, madam?
#ANTOINETTE.
Heavens, I haven't thought of it again.
#MRS. BOROWSKI.
Just wait and see, pet, when you are old you will think of it again.
#ANTOINETTE.
Not all people grow to be as old as you, dear Mrs. Borowski.
#LASKOWSKI.
Dearie, you'll grow as old as the hills! I can prophesy that much. Haven't you the finest kind of a time! ... Of course!
#LASKOWSKI.
What do you lack!... Nuthin'!... Children's what you lack!
#ANTOINETTE.
Never mind, please!
#LASKOWSKI.
Well, well, don't put on so, dearie!
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
Have you any children, Doctor?
#PAUL.
No, I'm sorry to say, madam.
#VON TIEDEMANN.
We're better off in that respect, Bess, aren't we? Three lusty bairns!
#MRS. SCHNAASE.
And we, with our five!
#LASKOWSKI.
Do you see, dearie! What am I always tellin' you! An agriculturalist without children ...
#KUNZE.
Abraham scored one hundred when the Lord bestowed his son Isaac upon him.
#LASKOWSKI.
But a fellow like me can't wait that long - stuff and nonsense. What if I die and ...
#PAUL.
You will take care not to do that.
#LASKOWSKI.
Don't say that, brother! I'm going to die young! I'm sure of it. An old woman once told my fortune, and she said I wouldn't see more than fifty. But, do you know what, dearie?
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
I suppose you frequently came to Ellernhof in the old days, Madam von Laskowski?
#ANTOINETTE.
Why, the departed was my guardian, you know, Mrs. Von Tiedemann.
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
Oh yes. I had forgotten that.
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Do you ride horseback as much as ever, madam?
#ANTOINETTE.
Now and then, for pastime!
#LASKOWSKI.
Now don't you say a word, dearie! Why, you're pasted on a horse all day long, and then from horseback right into the cold, cold water. Did anybody ever hear the like of it?
#PAUL.
Yesterday I had a horseback ride again too, madam. Have I told you about it? The first time in years. And, what is more, I got quite near your place. I was even able to see the houses of Klonowken.
#ANTOINETTE.
Did you ride through the forest?
#PAUL.
Of course, through the pine forest of Klonowken, yesterday morning. Right through the snow.
#ANTOINETTE.
Why, I was out at the same time.
#PAUL.
You were, madam? Too bad! Why did we not chance to meet?
#ANTOINETTE.
I suppose it was not ordained so.
#LASKOWSKI.
I say, dearie, one of these days when I die, do you know what I'll do?
#MERTENS.
If one of us dies, I'll go to Karlsbad, eh, Laskowski?
#LASKOWSKI.
Listen, dearie! You'll inherit all I have an' marry another fellow!
#PAUL.
Control yourself a bit, Laskowski.
#LASKOWSKI.
Ain't that true, dearie? Tell me that you'll come to my grave! Promise me that much, dearie! Then I'll die easy. You'll come along and sit down and cry a few tearies on my grave.
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Well, here's to our friend, departed in his prime.
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
Why, Fritz!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
H'm! Well ... Didn't think of that. One forgets. Pardon me!
#ANTOINETTE.
Will you not help yourselves, ladies and gentlemen? Serve around once more!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
My favorite dish, veal - roast!... What do you say, Doctor, you are so quiet?
#DR. BODENSTEIN.
Do whatever you do, with a will! I am now devoting myself to culinary delights!
#MERTENS.
I regard this sauce a phenomenal achievement.
#MRS. SCHNAASE.
There are tomatoes in it, I think.
#MERTENS.
I must ask for the recipe.
#RAABE. JR.
Here's to you!
#VOICES.
Here's to you! Your health!
#LASKOWSKI.
Here's to everybody!
#VOICES.
Here's to you, Laskowski!
#SCHROCK.
Here's to you, old rough - neck!
#PAUL.
Don't drink so much, Laskowski!
#LASKOWSKI.
Let me drink, brother! Drink and forget your pain, says Schiller. Ain't that it, old chap, ain't it, now? You're a kind of a poet yourself, ain't you?
#VON TIEDEMANN.
He's tanking up again!
#ANTOINETTE.
Awful!
#PAUL.
Oh, don't mind him.
#LASKOWSKI.
Let me drink, old fellow. I'm not going to live long anyhow. It's on my chest ... Do you hear it rattle, old boy? Listen! Just listen! Listen to me, not to my dearie. When we're dead, we're out of it! We'll not get another drop! An' then we'll sleep till judgment day in the pitch - dark grave. Then you'll be rid of me, dearie!
#ANTOINETTE.
Excuse me, Doctor!
#PAUL.
Are you ill, madam?
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
Now it is getting a bit uncanny.
#MRS. BOROWSKI.
Are they talking about the judgment day?
#KUNZE.
On the judgment day when the Lord will return to judge the quick and the dead.
#PAUL.
How are you, Antoinette!
#ANTOINETTE.
I am all right again.
#MRS. SCHNAASE.
Would you like a glass of water?
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
Yes, water!
#ANTOINETTE.
No, thank you! This awful heat!... Don't let me disturb you. PAUL, Shall I take you out, madam?
#ANTOINETTE.
No, thank you, I shall remain!
#LASKOWSKI.
Just stay here, dearie! Just stay here!
#PAUL.
Now do be quiet, Laskowski. Ain't I quiet, brother? Quiet!... Quiet!... Quiet!... Quiet as the grave! Damn it all. I wonder how your father feels now.
#KUNZE.
We are happy, but he is happier.
#ANTOINETTE.
Help yourselves, ladies and gentlemen! Mr. von Tiedemann, don't be backward!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
I'm getting my share.
#MERTENS.
So am I. I don't let things affect my appetite.
#LASKOWSKI.
Jinks, do you have to die, young as you are ... young as ...
#MRS. BOROWSKI.
Now it has come, just as the departed always wished.
#PAUL.
How so, Mrs. Borowski?
#MRS. BOROWSKI.
That you would be back, Paul, and that everything about the estate would go right on as before! If he could only look down upon that.
#PAUL.
Yes!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Settled fact is it, Mr. Warkentin? Really going to get into the harness?
#LASKOWSKI.
Can't do it, old chap! Come on!... Can't begin to do it!
#PAUL.
I do intend to, Mr. von Tiedemann.
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Well, you'd better think that over! Not every one can match your father as an agriculturalist.
#PAUL.
With a little honest effort ...
#VON TIEDEMANN.
If that were all! To begin with, you can't match your father physically. You have to be accustomed to such things. In all kinds of weather! And then ... No child's play to farm now - a - days! Starvation prices for grain! Simply a shame! If that continues I'll vouch that all this blooming farming will go to the devil within twenty years!
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
To think of having you speak that way, Fritz!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Of course, if a fellow has a few pennies to fall back on, it's not so bad. But how many are there who have. The rest will go broke!
#LASKOWSKI.
The Count of Luxemburg has squandered all his cash ... cash ... cash ...
#VON TIEDEMANN.
And who will have the advantage? The few who have money. They will buy for a song and some day, when times are better again, they will sell for twice as much. Some day they are likely to roll in wealth!
#LASKOWSKI.
Has squandered all his cash ... In one old merry night ... ha, ha!
#ANTOINETTE.
My husband is no longer conscious of what he is saying!
#LASKOWSKI.
Me? Not conscious?... Don't I know. Word for word! Shall I tell you, dearie? What you said and what I said and what Paul said to you ... Antoinette, how are you?... How are you Antoinette? Well, do I know, dearie? Did I hold on to it?
#PAUL.
One must excuse you in your condition.
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Don't worry about him, madam. He's one of these fellows with a big purse. He may chuckle! I can foresee that he will buy up the whole county some day!
#LASKOWSKI.
Just what I'll do. What's the price of the world! Five bits a fling!... We can still raise that much. The more foolish the farmer, the bigger his spuds!
#MERTENS.
His sugar - beets!
#LASKOWSKI.
I say, boys!... Do you know how many tons of sugar - beets I raised to the acre! Last round?
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Now, don't Spread it on!
#LASKOWSKI.
Fellows! My word of honor! I'm not lying! Thirty - five tons an acre! Who can match that? Nobody can! I can! I'm a devil of a fellow, I've always said so, ain't I, dearie? You know!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Thirty - five ton per acre! Ridiculous!
#MERTENS.
I can honestly swear to the contrary!
#LASKOWSKI.
And your dad, I tell you he was mad! He just couldn't look at me! But I don't bear him any grudge! I'm a man of honor! Shake hands, old chap! You say so, ain't I a man of honor? Put 'er there! Man of honor face to face with man of honor. But you must look at me, man alive! Or I won't believe you!
#PAUL.
Never mind! Just believe me.
#LASKOWSKI.
Dearie, don't make such a face! Eat! Eat!... So you can get strong, so you can survive your poor Heliodor!
#DR. BODENSTEIN.
Incipient delirium!
#PAUL.
You really haven't taken a thing, madam!
#ANTOINETTE.
I am not hungry. But will the ladies and gentlemen not take something more? A little more of the dessert, perhaps.
#VON TIEDEMANN.
No, thanks, madam! I can't eat another thing! Not if I try! Or I'll burst!
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
Fritz!
#DR. BODENSTEIN.
Albumen! Fat! Carbo - hydrates! In hoc signo vinces.
#MERTENS.
And now a little cup of coffee!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
And a cock - tail!
#DR. BODENSTEIN.
To retard metabolism!
#PAUL.
The coffee will be here directly!
#LASKOWSKI.
You know what I'de done, Paul, if I'd been your dad?
#ANTOINETTE.
Miss Clara tells me that the coffee is in the next room. Whenever the ladies and gentlemen are so disposed ...
#LASKOWSKI.
If I'de been your father, old chap, I'd drunk all of my claret before my wind - up! I wouldn't 'a left a drop! Greedy gut!
#RAABE JR.
Here's to you!
#DR. BODENSTEIN.
Ladies and gentlemen! Let us dedicate a glass to the memory of the departed, according to the beautiful tradition of our fathers; that we must not mourn the dead, that we should envy them! Our slumbering friend lives on in the memory of those who were near to him! To immortality, in this sense, all of us may, after all, agree in a manner!
#PAUL.
The doctor is right! Let us drink to his memory, madam! May the earth rest lightly on him!
#PAUL.
Aren't yon going to respond?
#PAUL.
To the memory of my father.
#ANTOINETTE.
Your father!
#PAUL.
To that of our parents, madam! A silent glass!
#LASKOWSKI.
Just cry ahead, dearie! Cry your fill! That's the way they'll drink to your Heliodor some day!
#DR. BODENSTEIN.
And so they will drink to all of us some day!
#KUNZE.
For man's life on earth is like unto the grass of the field, on which the wind bloweth. It flourisheth for a season and withereth and no one remembereth it. So also the children of men.
#DR. BODENSTEIN.
This goblet to the departed, one and all!
#PAUL.
The departed on these walls! I drink to you! and RAABE. :
#GLYSZINSKI.
Ubi jam fuere!
#MERTENS.
Now the pot is boiling!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
That's the way a funeral should be! No airs! The dead won't become alive again anyhow!
#MERTENS.
Many a man might object to that anyhow!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
The devil take it. A fellow doesn't want to give up what he once has!
#MERTENS.
Wasn't Laskowski superb again!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Always is, of late! Never see him any other way!
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
And then Mrs. Laskowski? Did you watch, Gretchen?
#MRS. SCHNAASE.
I don't exactly see, Elizabeth!
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
You didn't, how they kept on whispering together? She hasn't a bit of modesty!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
I'll bet my head Laskowski will plant himself here some day. The young man surely can't make it go in the long run. Why he can't hold on to the estate.
#MRS. VON TIEDEMANN.
Didn't she bat her eyes again!
#MERTENS.
She does have eyes!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Does she!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Just go ahead and propose to her, the togged - out thing!... Come on Gretchen!
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Bang!
#MERTENS.
What do you think of that?
#VON TIEDEMANN.
Let's see if we can find a cocktail! Come on Mertens!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Without a doubt, madam, a beautiful, sensitive soul will, above all, find expression in the hand. So would you, perhaps, let me have your hand for a moment....
#ANTOINETTE.
For what purpose?
#GLYSZINSKI.
Only to imprint a kiss upon these beautiful, soft, delicate, distinguished, aristocratic finger - tips!
#ANTOINETTE.
I beg your pardon, sir!
#LASKOWSKI.
Boys, let me go! SCHROCK, RAABE, and OTHERS. Stay right here, old boy.
#LASKOWSKI.
Let me go, I say ... I want to get to my dearie!
#SCHROCK.
Dear old chap! I'll ... not ... let you!... Let's have another drink first!
#LASKOWSKI.
I want to get to my dearie!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Ravishing creature! I must follow her!
#PAUL.
That you will not do!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Let me pass!
#PAUL.
That way, please!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Brutal fellow!
#PAUL.
A rare team!
#LASKOWSKI.
Old chap!... Are you a Pole? Pole! Yes, indeed! von Glyszinski!
#LASKOWSKI.
Your name is Glyszinski! Mine is Laskowski! Come to my heart, fellow countryman!
#RAABE.
Boys, such a thing as that calls for a drink.
#LASKOWSKI.
Drink, fellow countryman! Drink and kiss my wife. Do you want to kiss my wife?
#GLYSZINSKI.
Sir!
#LASKOWSKI.
You may. Nobody else. A Pole may. Ain't she beautiful, that dearie of mine?
#GLYSZINSKI.
Beautiful as the starry sky!
#LASKOWSKI.
Brother! Come along!
#SCHROCK.
Your health, you ... jolly ... brothers!
#LASKOWSKI.
Brotherhood? Yes, we'll drink to our brotherhood, my fellow countryman.
#RAABE.
There's lots of good stuff in there. Come, be quick about it. Too bad to waste your time here!
#LASKOWSKI.
Poland is not lost forever!
#AUNT CLARA.
Won't you go and have some coffee, Paul?
#PAUL.
No, not now, Auntie! Later! I need a little rest! Will you soon be through?
#AUNT CLARA.
Directly, my boy!... Hurry now! There is plenty of work ahead!
#PAUL.
Leave me alone for a little while, Auntie!
#AUNT CLARA.
I'll be going, Paul!
#AUNT CLARA.
Have a good chat, Paul!
#PAUL.
No occasion!
#PAUL.
Antoinette!
#ANTOINETTE.
My God!... My God!
#PAUL.
You poor ... poor child! Sweet ... sweet Toinette!
#PAUL.
I fairly worship you! Won't you look at me, Antoinette? Please, please, Toinette! Let me see your eyes! Just let me see your eyes!
#ANTOINETTE.
Dearest!... Dearest Paul!
#PAUL.
Sweetheart!... Now you are mine!... Sweetheart!
#ANTOINETTE.
God! Great God!... What have I done?
#PAUL.
No retreat, Antoinette. No retreat is possible!
#ANTOINETTE.
Let me go, Paul!
#PAUL.
I shall not let you go, Toinette. And if it is a matter of life and death.
#ANTOINETTE.
Paul! PAUL, Do you want the people to come in? Then call them! Let them find us!
#ANTOINETTE.
I had an intimation of this.
#PAUL.
Did you? You too?
#ANTOINETTE.
Both of us, Paul! Kiss me, my friend!... My beloved! thousand times over!
#ANTOINETTE.
And I, you a thousand times over!
#PAUL.
My dear, tell me that you love me!
#ANTOINETTE.
You know I do, dear! ... Why have me tell you?
#PAUL.
Please, please tell me!
#ANTOINETTE.
I do love you, Paul!
#PAUL.
Tell me again! I have never heard the word! Say it once more!
#ANTOINETTE.
I have always loved you, Paul!
#PAUL.
Always? Always? Always?
#ANTOINETTE.
Always!
#PAUL.
And I failed to realize it all!... Fool, fool, fool!
#ANTOINETTE.
Don't think of it! Not now!
#PAUL.
You are right, dear! Our time is short!
#ANTOINETTE.
Forget all! Forget! Forget!
#PAUL.
I cannot forget! It was too long!
#ANTOINETTE.
Indeed it was long! But I knew that you would return.
#PAUL.
And you took the other man?
#ANTOINETTE.
And you the other woman!
#PAUL.
Do not remind me of it!
#ANTOINETTE.
I took the other man while I was thinking of you! I waited for you!
#PAUL.
Waited for me, and I was not conscious of it. Missed my happiness. Staked my life for nothing! For a delusion! Some one had to die before I could realize what I might have enjoyed! Too late, too late, too late!
#ANTOINETTE.
Forget, my love! Forget! Forget! Lay your head upon my breast!
#PAUL.
A good resting place.
#ANTOINETTE.
Sleep, beloved! Sleep! PAUL, Antoinette!...
#ANTOINETTE.
Mine again, lover of my youth!
#PAUL.
Dearest!... Dearest!
#ANTOINETTE.
Cruel, cruel man!... Mine after tireless seeking.
#PAUL.
Idol of my heart!... Safe in my arms at last!
#PAUL.
Is this still sinful, sweetheart?
#ANTOINETTE.
Still! And will remain so.
#PAUL.
Not to be forgiven?
#ANTOINETTE.
Not to be forgiven!
#PAUL.
And yet you consent, with all your piety?
#ANTOINETTE.
I do consent! I have no other choice!
#PAUL.
Never to be forgiven, Antoinette?
#ANTOINETTE.
Possibly! In heaven.
#PAUL.
Your God is inexorable, Antoinette.
#ANTOINETTE.
You are my god! I have ceased to have another!
#PAUL.
And would you follow me, even unto death?
#ANTOINETTE.
Unto death and beyond!
#PAUL.
Even to damnation, I dare say?
#ANTOINETTE.
These terrors have lost their force for both of us!
#PAUL.
Do you think so? Have you already come to this?
#ANTOINETTE.
We have had our damnation here on earth!
#PAUL.
Here on earth! But not one hour more! Now the end is at hand!
#ANTOINETTE.
Come, dear, sit down with me.
#PAUL.
Yes, let us ponder what we are to do now.
#ANTOINETTE.
Not now! Not today! Promise me!
#PAUL.
When, when, Toinette? It must come to an end.
#ANTOINETTE.
It shall! But let me determine the hour, dearest!
#PAUL.
You? ANTOINETTE, Yes, the day and the hour, do you hear?
#PAUL.
Antoinette, if you put the matter in this way ... I cannot refuse, whatever you may ask!
#ANTOINETTE.
Only one more day! Then I will write or come and tell you. Will you be ready?
#PAUL.
Then I shall be ready for anything! Then we shall have a reckoning. Then life shall begin all over again.
#ANTOINETTE.
Yes, another life!
#PAUL.
Even though the sun is already sinking.... Possibly there is still time.
#ANTOINETTE.
I shall do anything for you and you will do anything for me.... We agree to that!
#PAUL.
Do you remember, Toinette, on this very spot ...?
#ANTOINETTE.
Ten years ago? I do! I do!
#PAUL.
How strangely all has come about and how necessary nevertheless! So predestined! So inexorable! Fate! Fate!
#ANTOINETTE.
I hung upon your lips and you ignored me! I had ceased to exist for you!
#PAUL.
And so we lost each other.
#ANTOINETTE.
But today, today we have found each other once more, oh lover of my youth!
#PAUL.
Late, Toinette, so late!
#ANTOINETTE.
Heavens, how stupid I was in those days!
#PAUL.
Stupid because you loved me, Toinette?
#ANTOINETTE.
No, because I did not tell you.
#PAUL.
And I did not suspect it! Now who was worse?
#ANTOINETTE.
Both of us, dear! We were too young!
#PAUL.
And today I am an old man!
#ANTOINETTE.
And what of me ... An old woman!
#PAUL.
Beloved!... Young and beautiful as ever. How young you have remained all of these years!
#ANTOINETTE.
For your sake, dear. I knew that I must remain young till you would return! That is why I insisted upon riding like a Cossack ...
#PAUL.
That is why?
#ANTOINETTE.
And swimming like a trout in the stream! And rowing like a sailor!
#PAUL.
And all in order to remain young and beautiful?... You vain, vain creature!
#ANTOINETTE.
And in order to forget, you foolish, foolish fellow!
#PAUL.
In order to forget!
#ANTOINETTE.
Don't think of it! Don't think of it! Now we have found each other again. That too is past!
#PAUL.
Yes, all is past! I have you and shall never leave you!... Yes, look down upon me out of your frames! Father and mother, envy me! Venerable hall, rarely have you beheld such happiness!...
#ANTOINETTE.
Happiness and death in one, lover!
#PAUL.
Possibly they are one and the same! Paul, are you here?
#PAUL.
We are here. Aunt Clara!
#AUNT CLARA.
Our guests are about to go, Paul.
#ANTOINETTE.
Very well! Then we'll go too.
#HELLA.
Paul!
#PAUL.
Is it you, Hella?
#HELLA.
As you see! I beg your pardon, madam!
#ANTOINETTE.
Please!
#PAUL.
What do you wish?
#HELLA.
Where is Glyszinski? I need him!
#PAUL.
There, if you please. If you will take the trouble to step into the next room ...
#LASKOWSKI.
Brother! Polish brother! Don't leave me in the lurch ... Help me find my dearie!
#ANTOINETTE.
Here I am.
#LASKOWSKI.
Why dearie, where have you been? Have you had a long talk with Paul?
#ANTOINETTE.
Good - by, Doctor!
#PAUL.
Good - by, madam! We shall see each other again!
#ANTOINETTE.
We shall see each other again.
#LASKOWSKI.
Shan't we go, dearie? Why, it's almost evening.
#ANTOINETTE.
Yes, almost evening. I am ready.
#HELLA.
What does this mean, Paul?
#PAUL.
A woman whom I knew in the old days!... Good - by.
#HELLA.
Paul! What does this mean?... Paul!
#PAUL.
So no letter has come, Aunt Clara?
#AUNT CLARA.
No, no, my boy.
#PAUL.
And no messenger either?
#AUNT CLARA.
From where do you expect one?
#PAUL.
Great God, from where? From where? From anywhere? Some tiding! Some word! A letter!
#AUNT CLARA.
Why I can't tell. Are you expecting anything from some source or other?
#PAUL.
Would I be asking, Aunt Clara?
#PAUL.
Incomprehensible! Incomprehensible! Two days without news! Two full days!
#AUNT CLARA.
I do not comprehend you either, my boy!
#PAUL.
This stillness! This death - like stillness!
#AUNT CLARA.
Isn't it good, when peace prevails?
#PAUL.
As you look at it. Certainly it is good! But first of all one must be at peace himself! Must have become calm and clear about the matters that concern one. Know what one wants to do and is expected to do and what one is here for in this world.
#AUNT CLARA.
But every one knows that, Paul.
#PAUL.
Uncanny, this silence all around one. Doubly and three - fold one feels, how it seethes and boils within, without one's getting anywhere. One can hear himself think! No no, Aunt Clara, people who have closed their account, belong in the country. Others do not! The rest need noise, diversion, human beings about them. One must have something in order to be able to forget! Some narcotic to put one to sleep! There are people, who do that all of their lives and are quite, happy, who never come to themselves, are continually living in a kind of intoxication and leave this world without attaining real consciousness. You see, Auntie, the city is the proper place for that. There you can dull your feelings and forget.
#AUNT CLARA.
I could not stand the city.
#PAUL.
Yes, you, Aunt Clara! You are a child of the country.
#AUNT CLARA.
Well, aren't you, Paul?
#PAUL.
True! But you have never been alienated from the soil! I tell you the man who has once partaken of that poison, can not give it up, he is forced to go back to it again and again.
#AUNT CLARA.
One simply can't understand you, Paul. When you arrived, you said one thing and now you are saying another. The very idea!
#PAUL.
You fail to understand that, you good old soul! Of course, you do not know what has come to pass since then. At that time I was not at odds with myself ...
#AUNT CLARA.
At that time! When, pray tell? You came on the third holiday and this is New Year's eve. You have been here for five days.
#PAUL.
Today it's quite a different matter. Quite different!
#AUNT CLARA.
What on earth has happened, pray tell!
#PAUL.
Much, much, Aunt Clara!
#AUNT CLARA.
I suppose because they were a bit boisterous at the funeral! That's the way of it, you know, when they get to drinking.
#PAUL.
Good heavens, no!... No!
#AUNT CLARA.
That's the way they always act at funerals. I know of funerals where there was dancing.
#PAUL.
Yes, yes, that may be!
#AUNT CLARA.
And then they all were so friendly with you.
#PAUL.
Oh, yes. With the friendliest kind of an air, they told me not to take it into my head that I know how to farm.
#AUNT CLARA.
Why, Paul. You only imagine that!
#PAUL.
The good neighbors. At bottom they are right! How should an old man be able to learn the things that call for the efforts of a whole life, just as any other career does! Ridiculous! Why that simply must have lurid consequences.
#AUNT CLARA.
I should never have thought that you would act this way, Paul!
#PAUL.
Act what way? I am only checking over the possibilities. Every business man does that! And I tell you, the prospects are desperately bad! I can fairly see Laskowski establish himself here after I have lost the place!
#PAUL.
What a beautiful day! The snow is glittering in the sunlight. The trees stand so motionless.
#AUNT CLARA.
Awfully cold out - doors, my boy!
#PAUL.
I know it. Aunt Clara, but the light is refreshing after all of the dark days. The old year is shining forth once more in its full glory.
#AUNT CLARA.
The days are getting longer again.
#PAUL.
Didn't you tell me, once upon a time, Auntie, that the time between Christmas and New Year is called the holy season?
#AUNT CLARA.
The time between Christmas and Epiphany, Paul. If anyone dies then ...
#PAUL.
Finish it, Aunt Clara! If some one dies then, another member of the family will follow him. Isn't that the purport?
#AUNT CLARA.
Why Paul, I don't know! Purport of what? Who would believe in all of those things?
#PAUL.
Of course not!
#AUNT CLARA.
Do you hear the whips crack, Paul?
#PAUL.
Faintly, yes. It seems to be out in front.
#AUNT CLARA.
The young folks are lashing the old year out. They always do that on New Year's Eve when the sun goes down.
#PAUL.
I know. I know. I have heard it many a New Year's Eve. When the sun was setting.
#AUNT CLARA.
Another one gone!
#PAUL.
Just so it stood between the trees, and kept on sinking and sinking, and I was a little fellow and watched it from the window. And at last it was down and twilight came on.
#AUNT CLARA.
Thank God, Paul, this year is over.
#PAUL.
Who knows what the day may still have in store for us! Things are taking their course.
#AUNT CLARA.
Tonight we shall surely all take punch together, Paul?
#PAUL.
If we have time and the desire to do so, yes.
#AUNT CLARA.
How you are talking, Paul! Don't make a person afraid!
#PAUL.
Now it is directly over the pavilion. Now we shall not enjoy it much longer. I greet thee, sun! Sinking sun!
#AUNT CLARA.
I was going to ask you, in regard to the pavilion ...
#PAUL.
Yes I'm glad that I've thought of it!
#LENE.
Did you ring, sir?
#PAUL.
Yes. My trunks, books, all of my things are to be taken over to the garden - house. Understand?
#LENE.
To the garden - house?
#PAUL.
Yes, to the pavilion. Put the rooms in proper order. Don't forget to make a fire. I suppose there's a bed there for the night?
#AUNT CLARA.
Everything, my boy. Only it will have to be put to rights, because no one has put up there this many a day.
#LENE.
Are the madam's things also to be ...?
#PAUL.
No they are not! They are to stay here!
#LENE.
Shall I do so immediately ...?
#PAUL.
Is madam still asleep?
#LENE.
I think so.
#PAUL.
Then wait till madam is up, and go there afterward.
#LENE.
What if madam should ask ...?
#PAUL.
Then tell her that I requested you to do so.
#LENE.
I'm to say that Mr. Warkentin has requested ...
#PAUL.
And you are to do what I have requested. Do you understand me?
#LENE.
Very well, sir!... And I was going to say, the inspector has been here.
#PAUL.
Has he? Back from town already? Did he possibly have a letter for me?
#LENE.
I don't know. I think he only wanted to know about the work ...
#PAUL.
And there hasn't been a messenger? Say, from Klonowken?
#LENE.
No, nothing.
#PAUL.
Then you may go. Oh yes, when the inspector returns, you might call me.
#PAUL.
Nothing yet? Nothing yet? And the day is almost gone!
#AUNT CLARA.
What's the matter with you, Paul? Something is brewing here!
#PAUL.
That may be very true!
#AUNT CLARA.
And then, that you insist upon changing your quarters today! It does seem to me ...!
#PAUL.
You can only take pleasure in that. You see by that, that I have resolved to stay at Ellernhof. Or I should certainly not go to the trouble.
#AUNT CLARA.
Yes, yes, but your wife?
#PAUL.
Who? Hella? All the better if the matter comes to a head. The issue is dead ripe!
#AUNT CLARA.
Paul, Paul! This will not come to a good end.
#PAUL.
Quite possible. That is not at all necessary!
#AUNT CLARA.
And I am to blame for all.
#PAUL.
You? Why?
#AUNT CLARA.
I got you into it! No one else!
#PAUL.
Innocent creature! Individuals quite apart from you got me into it. It has taken a whole lifetime to bring it about! You are as little to blame for that as you are for the fall of Adam and the existence of the world and the fact that some day we shall all have to die!
#AUNT CLARA.
I told you about Antoinette! For she is at the bottom of it! I'll stake my head on that!
#PAUL.
Don't torture me, Aunt Clara!
#AUNT CLARA.
She is at the bottom of it! And I, in my stupidity, cap the climax by leaving the two of you alone at the funeral day before yesterday.
#PAUL.
I shall be grateful to you for that all of my life, Aunt Clara!
#AUNT CLARA.
My notion was for you to have a little talk together, and then to think what it has led to! May God forgive what I have done.
#PAUL.
She promised me to come. And she is not coming! She promised me to write. And she does not write. Not a word. Not the remotest token! How do I know, but everything was a delusion? Childish fancy and nothing more? The intoxication of a moment which seized her and vanished again when she sat in her sleigh and rode away in the winter night? Do I know?
#AUNT CLARA.
Paul, what are you talking about? Tell me!
#PAUL.
No!... Then farewell Ellernhof! Farewell my home and everything!
#AUNT CLARA.
Do be quiet! What in the world is the matter?
#PAUL.
At that time I deceived her, deceived her without knowing and wishing to. What if she deceives me now? What if she pays me back?
#AUNT CLARA.
What a calamity! What a calamity!
#PAUL.
No! No! No!... it cannot but come out right.
#AUNT CLARA.
Do you see, my boy?
#PAUL.
Don't rejoice prematurely, Auntie! It seems to me that this house fosters misfortune! All that you need to do is to look at those faces! They all have a suggestion of melancholy and gloom. Just as if the sun had never shone into their hearts, you know. No air of hopefulness, no suggestion of light and freedom! So chained to the earth! So savagely taciturn? Can that be due to the air and soil? It will probably assert itself in me too, after I have been here for some time. Possibly it would have been better, Auntie, if I had never returned to this house! I should have continued that life of mine, not cold, not warm, not happy, not unhappy! I should never have found out what I have really missed and yet can never find. Possibly it would have been better.
#LENE.
The inspector is here, sir. Shall he come in? He is lunching just now.
#PAUL.
No, never mind. One moment, Auntie!
#HELLA.
I thought Paul was here.
#AUNT CLARA.
Paul will surely be back any minute.
#HELLA.
Will he? Then I shall wait.
#AUNT CLARA.
Madam ... Doctor ...?
#HELLA.
Were you saying something?
#AUNT CLARA.
Keep an eye on Paul, madam!... That's all I have to say!
#HELLA.
How so?
#AUNT CLARA.
I am simply saying, keep an eye on Paul!
#HELLA.
What is going on?... CLARA, Talk to him yourself. I can't fathom it.
#HELLA.
Then I will tell you. Do you think I am blind? Do you suppose that I am unable to see through the situation here? I know Paul and I know you, all of you who are turning Paul's head!
#AUNT CLARA.
Mercy me! I, turn Paul's head!
#HELLA.
Yes, you, and all of you around here! I will tell you to your face! You are trying to set Paul against me!
#AUNT CLARA.
I never set nobody against no one! Nobody ever said such a thing about me! God knows! You are the first person to do that! And on top of it all, I have the best intentions! I even want to help you! Well, I do say ...!
#HELLA.
You help me?... H'm! You wanted to get rid of me, and that is why you started all this about the estate, and staying here, and who knows what else. But I declare to you, once and for all! Don't go to any trouble! You will not succeed in parting Paul and me!
#AUNT CLARA.
May be not I!
#HELLA.
Not you?... Oh indeed!... Not you!
#AUNT CLARA.
No! Not I! Of course not! Even if you have deserved it, ten times over!
#HELLA.
Not you?... Well, well! So it's some other woman! Some other woman is trying to separate us, Paul and me? Is that it? Yes or no?
#AUNT CLARA.
I haven't said a thing. I know nothing about it.
#HELLA.
I thought so! And now I grasp the whole situation!... That accounts for Paul's behavior, this strange behavior! Well, well! But you shall not succeed! No, no! You shall not succeed! We'll just see who knows Paul better, you or I!
#AUNT CLARA.
Madam, I am an old woman, you may believe me or not, I tell you, don't carry matters too far with Paul!
#HELLA.
So it was she?... The Polish woman, of course! Didn't I know it?
#AUNT CLARA.
Don't carry matters too far! Remember what I say.
#HELLA.
Where is Paul?
#AUNT CLARA.
What is the matter?
#HELLA.
I must speak to Paul.
#AUNT CLARA.
Merciful God! Now I see it coming!
#HELLA.
Yes, I am going away and Paul is going with me. That is the end of the whole matter. I suppose that is not just exactly what you had expected.
#AUNT CLARA.
And you are going to desert Ellernhof!
#HELLA.
It will be a long time before the estate sees us again. Prepare for that. As for the rest, we shall see later.
#AUNT CLARA.
Then I might as well order my grave at once, the sooner the better.
#HELLA.
Don't worry! You will be cared for.
#AUNT CLARA.
Not a soul needs to care for me henceforth, madam! My way is quite clear to me. It will not be very long. Look at the men and women on these walls, they all followed this course. Now I shall emulate their example. What is coming now is no longer suitable for me.
#HELLA.
No, what is coming now is the new world and new men and women! New men and women! Yes! Yes, we are ready to fight for that!
#PAUL.
What ails you, Auntie? How you do look!
#AUNT CLARA.
Don't ask me, my boy. I have lived my life!
#PAUL.
What did she say?... Lived my life?... A soothing phrase! A cradle - song! No more pain, no more care! All over!... Lived my life!
#HELLA.
Paul!
#PAUL.
And?
#HELLA.
Be a man, Paul! I beg of you.
#PAUL.
That is just what I intend to do.
#HELLA.
For two days you have been walking around without saying a word. That surely cannot continue.
#PAUL.
That will not continue, I am sure.
#HELLA.
Why don't you speak? What have I done to you?
#PAUL.
You to me?... Nothing.
#HELLA.
See here, Paul, I stayed here on your account, longer than I had intended and than seems justifiable to me.
#PAUL.
Why did you? I did not ask you again.
#HELLA.
Quite right. I did it of my own accord. Now don't you think that counts for more, Paul?
#PAUL.
Up to the day before yesterday anything would have counted with me. Today no longer, Hella!
#HELLA.
I remained because I kept in mind that it might be agreeable to you to have me near you. I have given you time to come to yourself again. I know very well what is going on in you.
#PAUL.
Hardly!
#HELLA.
Indeed, Paul, indeed! You have seen the soil of your boyhood home again. You have buried your father. I understand your crisis completely.
#PAUL.
Really! All at once!
#HELLA.
From the very beginning!
#PAUL.
I did not realize very much of it!
#HELLA.
Simply because I thought it would be best to let you settle that for yourself. That is why I have not interfered; allowed you to go your own way, these days. Does all this fail to convince you?
#PAUL.
Drop that, Hella.
#HELLA.
What does this mean, Paul! We must have an understanding!
#PAUL.
That is no longer possible for us, Hella!
#HELLA.
It certainly has been, up to the present. How often we have quarreled in these years, and sailed into each other, and we have always found our way back to each other again for the simple reason that we belong together! Why in the world should that be impossible now?
#PAUL.
Because ... Because ...
#HELLA.
Well, because?... Possibly because I did not care to stay down here, day before yesterday, did not dine with your guests when you asked me to do so? Is that it?
#PAUL.
That and many other things.
#HELLA.
Paul, don't be petty! I really can't bear to hear you talk in this manner. Are you so completely unable to enter into my feelings? I could not share your sorrow. Your father did not give me any occasion for that. I do not wish to speak ill of him, but I cannot forget it. After all, that is only human!
#PAUL.
So the dead man stands between us. Why don't you say so frankly!
#HELLA.
If you insist, yes. At least, for the moment! I was not able to stay with you. I had to be alone.
#PAUL.
Then blame yourself for the consequences! You deserted me at a moment when simply everything was unsettling me ...
#HELLA.
Oh, you suppose I don't know what you mean?
#PAUL.
Well?
#HELLA.
Shall I tell you?
#PAUL.
Please!
#HELLA.
Dear Paul! Just recall the lady with the ashy - blonde hair, for a moment!
#PAUL.
What lady?
#HELLA.
Why, Paul? The one with whom I saw you after the banquet, day before yesterday. Your aunt was there too, wasn't she?
#PAUL.
You seem to refer to Madam von Laskowski.
#HELLA.
Quite right. The Polish beauty! Was it not that?
#PAUL.
Hella?
#HELLA.
Don't become furious, Paul! There's no occasion at all for that! I am not reproaching you in the least! On the contrary, I am of the opinion that you were quite right!
#PAUL.
What are you trying to say? What does all this mean?
#HELLA.
We had quarreled, you were furious, wanted to revenge yourself, looked about for a fitting object and naturally hit upon ... whom?
#PAUL.
Why it's simply idiotic to continue answering such questions!
#HELLA.
Hit upon whom?... With the kind of taste that you do seem to have ...
#PAUL.
Hella, I object to that!
#HELLA.
Why, I am absolutely serious, Paul! You can't expect me to question your taste! I should compromise my own position. No, no, I really agree with you, of all those present she was decidedly the most piquant. The typical beauty that appeals to men! Of course you hit upon her, probably courted her, lavished compliments upon her, all the things that you men do when you suppose that you are in the presence of an inferior woman ...
#PAUL.
Hella, now restrain yourself! Or I may tell you something ...
#HELLA.
Very well, let us even suppose that you fell in love with her for the time and she with you, that you went into ecstasy over each other and turned each other's heads, then you parted and the next day the intoxication passed off, and, if not on the next day, then on the following one ... Am I not right? Do you expect me to be jealous of such a thing as that? No, Paul!
#PAUL.
You are a demon! demon!
#HELLA.
I am your friend, Paul! Believe me! I desire nothing but your own good, simply because I care for you and because, I'll be frank with you, I should not want to lose you. You may be convinced of it, Paul, conceited as it may sound, but you will never find another woman like me! One with whom you can share everything! I don't know what you may have said to the Polish woman or what she may have said to you, but do you really suppose that she still knows about that today, even though the most fervent vows were exchanged?
#PAUL.
Hella, Hella, you do not know what you are saying.
#HELLA.
Would you teach me to know my own sex? They aren't all like me, dear Paul. You have been spoiled by me. Very few, indeed, have attained maturity as yet, or even know what they are doing. You can depend upon very few of them. It seems to me that we are in the best possible position to know that, Paul, after our years of work. And I am to fear such competition? Expect me to be jealous of a Polish country beauty? Me, - Hella Bernhardy!... No, Paul, I have been beyond that type of jealousy for some time!
#PAUL.
Would it not be better to say that you have never had it?
#HELLA.
Possibly! There are some who consider that an advantage.
#PAUL.
Theorists, yes! The kind that I was, once upon a time. But now I know better! Now I know that the absence of jealousy was nothing but an absence of love.
#HELLA.
That is not true, Paul. I always cared for you!
#PAUL.
Cared! Cared! A fine word! HELLA, Why should you demand more than that? I respected you, Paul, valued you as my best friend!
#PAUL.
All but a little word, a little word ...
#HELLA.
What is that?
#PAUL.
Imagine!
#HELLA.
I know what you are thinking of! I am not a friend of strong words, but if you insist upon hearing it, I have loved you too!
#PAUL.
You ... me!
#HELLA.
Yes, I have loved you, Paul, for what you were, the unselfish idealist ...
#PAUL.
Oh, indeed!
#HELLA.
Yes, Paul! Do not forget about one thing! I am not one of these petty little women, to whom men are the alpha and omega! If you assumed that, of course you have been mistaken.
#PAUL.
To be sure! And the mistake has cost me my life!
#HELLA.
You knew it beforehand, Paul!
#PAUL.
Because I was blinded! HELLA, And yet I tell you, say what you please, leave me for instance, but you will not find another woman who can satisfy you after you have had me! I know it and will stake my life on it!
#PAUL.
Do you rate yourself so highly?
#HELLA.
I am rating you highly, Paul!
#PAUL.
Do you mean to say I am ruined for happiness?... Possibly you are right.
#HELLA.
Whoever has once become accustomed to the heights of life, will never again descend.
#PAUL.
Will never again descend.
#HELLA.
You are too good for a woman of the dead level! See here, Paul, I have at times made life a burden to you, I now and then refused to enter upon many things just because my head was full of ideas, possibly I have been too prone to disregard your emotional nature.
#PAUL.
Hella, do not remind me of that!
#HELLA.
We must come to an understanding, Paul! All of that may be true. And there shall be a change. There will be a change, that much I promise you today, but show me the kindness, pack your things and come with me! Today rather than tomorrow!
#PAUL.
Hella! Hella!
#HELLA.
Look into my face, Paul! Are you happy here?
#PAUL.
Do not ask me, Hella!
#HELLA.
Then you are not! Didn't I know it? I am proud of you for that, Paul!
#PAUL.
Hella, do not exult! I cannot go back again!
#HELLA.
Yes you can! Are these people here meant for you? Do you mean to say that you are suited to these peasants? You, with your refined instincts? You would think of degrading yourself consciously! Nobody can do that, you least of all! I tell you once more, you are too good for these rubes! PAUL, Give me time till this evening, Hella! Then I will give you a full explanation!
#HELLA.
Not thirty minutes, Paul! You are to decide at once! As I have you at this moment, I shall possibly never have you again. Pack your trunk and come with me! Have some one manage the estate. We will go back tomorrow morning and begin the new life with the new year. Thank your stars when you are once more out of this stuffy air. It induces thoughts in you that can never make you happy. Say yes, Paul, say that we are going!
#PAUL.
Do you hear, Hella?
#HELLA.
What in the world is that!
#PAUL.
I have an idea, the people of the estate, coming to proclaim Saint Sylvester,
#GLYSZINSKI.
Do you hear that instrument, madam? That's what they call a pot harp, very interesting!
#HELLA.
Interesting or not. Why must you disturb us just now?
#GLYSZINSKI.
If I had known this, I should not have come!
#PAUL.
Stay right here, dear Glyszinski! You haven't disturbed us up to the present! I do not see that you are disturbing us now!
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
Sir, the people are outside with the pot harp and want to sing their song.
#HELLA.
Oh, tell them to go and be done with it!
#PAUL.
No, please, Hella, that won't do. That is an old custom here on New Year's eve. Let them sing their song. Besides, I like to hear it. I heard it many a time in my boyhood days.
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
Shall I leave the door open, sir?
#PAUL.
Please!
#HELLA.
Paul, do not listen to that nonsense out there! Don't let them muddle your head!
#PAUL.
My head is clearer than ever, Hella! Don't go to any further trouble! I can see my way quite plainly now.
#HELLA.
And now that old trumpery must interfere too!
#HELLA.
Will that continue much longer, Paul?
#HELLA.
One moment, Doctor!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Were you calling me?
#HELLA.
Why, yes, now that you are here, I might as well make use of the occasion.
#GLYSZINSKI.
What can I do for you, madam?
#HELLA.
Dear friend, do not be startled. We shall have to part.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Part? We?...
#HELLA.
Yes, Doctor, it must be!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Why, who compels us to? No one!
#HELLA.
My decision compels us, dear friend! Is that sufficient for you?
#GLYSZINSKI.
Your decision, Hella? You are cruel.
#HELLA.
Yes, I myself am sorry, of course. I shall probably miss you quite frequently!
#GLYSZINSKI.
Hella!
#HELLA.
Especially in connection with my correspondence. You have certainly been a real help to me there. I shall have to carry that burden alone again, now. But what is to be done about it? No other course is possible. We must part.
#GLYSZINSKI.
But why? At least, give me a reason! Don't turn me out in this fashion.
#HELLA.
It is necessary on account of my husband, dear friend! I must make this sacrifice for him.
#GLYSZINSKI.
The monster!
#HELLA.
You know, it cannot be denied that Paul can't bear you, that he is always annoyed when he sees you ...
#GLYSZINSKI.
Do you suppose the reverse is not true?
#HELLA.
Yes, you men are exasperating. No one can eradicate your jealousy! That makes an unconstrained intercourse impossible! But what is to be done? Paul is my husband, not you. And so I am compelled to request you to yield.
#GLYSZINSKI.
Kill me, Hella, but don't turn me out.
#HELLA.
A pleasant journey. You will be able to find comfort.
#GLYSZINSKI.
I shall be alone, Hella!
#HELLA.
All of us are!
#GLYSZINSKI.
May I ever see you again, Hella?
#HELLA.
Possibly later! And now go! I do not care to have my husband find you here when he comes. Why here he is now.
#PAUL.
Are you still here? If you wish to talk together, I'll go out.
#HELLA.
Please stay, Paul! has just been telling me that he is going to take the night train back to Berlin and he is asking you for a sleigh. Isn't that it, Doctor?
#PAUL.
What's the use of this farce?
#HELLA.
Not a farce, Paul! It is really true! When we get to Berlin tomorrow evening, you will no longer find Glyszinski at our rooms! Are you satisfied now? Have I finally succeeded in pleasing you, you grumbler!
#PAUL.
Oh, well!
#HELLA.
Look into my face, Paul, old comrade! Tell me if you are pleased with your comrade.
#HELLA.
Now isn't that a proof to you of my fidelity and sincerity?
#PAUL.
Do not torment me, Hella. My decision is final!
#HELLA.
I don't know what you mean! Surely the matter is settled. We are going, aren't we?
#PAUL.
That is not settled! I shall remain!
#HELLA.
You are going to remain?
#PAUL.
I shall remain ... And no power on earth will swerve me from my purpose! Not even you, Hella!
#HELLA.
Are you trying to play the part of the stronger sex? Eye to eye, Paul! No evasions now! Are you playing the farce of the stronger sex?
#PAUL.
I do what I must do!
#HELLA.
What you must?... Well so must I.
#PAUL.
I know that, and I am not hindering you!
#HELLA.
And do you realize that that practically means separation for us?
#PAUL.
I have already told you, Hella, I am prepared for anything.
#HELLA.
And what if I stay also, Paul, what then?
#PAUL.
If you also ...? You are not serious about that!
#HELLA.
Assume that I am!... If I should remain also, for your sake?
#PAUL.
Don't jest, Hella! It is not the proper moment!
#HELLA.
I am certainly not jesting! I am your wife! I shall keep you company. Aren't you pleased with that?
#PAUL.
The dead man stands between us, as you have said. Very well, let that be final! You have wished it so! The bond between us is broken. We have come to the parting of our ways.
#HELLA.
To the parting of our ways? If I consent, I say!... If I consent!
#PAUL.
As I was saying, have the bay saddled in case I should still want to take a ride.
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
Very well, sir! Immediately?
#PAUL.
In about thirty minutes.
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
Shall the coachman bring out the bay or will you come to the stable?
#PAUL.
Have it brought out! Good - by.
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
Good night, sir!
#HELLA.
Are you here, Paul?
#PAUL.
Hella, you?
#HELLA.
Yes, it is I, Hella! Who else? Were you expecting some one else?
#PAUL.
Why do you still insist upon coming? Don't make it unnecessarily hard for both of us.
#HELLA.
I am waiting for an explanation from you. Since you will not give it to me of your own accord, I am compelled to get it. It seems to me I have a right to claim it.
#PAUL.
You certainly have.
#HELLA.
Please, then!
#PAUL.
Hella, what is the purpose of this? You do know everything now!
#HELLA.
I know nothing. I should like to find out from you.
#PAUL.
Very well, then I will tell you.
#HELLA.
I assume that the Polish woman is mixed up in this affair.
#PAUL.
So you do know! Why in the world are you going to the trouble of asking me?
#HELLA.
So it's really true? I am to stand aside for a little goose from the country! A little goose from the country?... Hella, control your tongue!
#HELLA.
If it were not so ridiculous, it would be exasperating!
#PAUL.
The woman under discussion is not a little goose from the country, my dear, just as little as you are one from the city.
#HELLA.
Thank you for your flattering comparison.
#PAUL.
That woman has had her struggles and trials as much as you have, and in spite of it has remained a woman, which you have not!
#HELLA.
Well, well. Are you now asserting your real nature? Are you throwing off the mask? Go on! Go on!
#PAUL.
That is all! I am only standing up for one who is dear to me!
#HELLA.
Ha, ha! Dear! Today and tomorrow!
#PAUL.
You are mistaken, Hella! I believe in Antoinette, and I shall not swerve from that.
#HELLA.
Antoinette ... Antoinette ... Why that name ...
#PAUL.
Let me assist you, Hella. Antoinette is the friend of my youth ...
#HELLA.
The friend of your youth? PAUL, Indeed, Hella, I have known her longer than I have known you.
#HELLA.
The one whom you were to marry once upon a time? Is it she?
#PAUL.
Whom I was to marry, whom I refused on your account, Hella.
#HELLA.
You met her again here?
#PAUL.
As Mrs. von Laskowski, yes, Hella!
#HELLA.
And you kept that from me?
#PAUL.
Why you did not give me a chance to speak, when I tried to tell you.
#HELLA.
So that was the confidence you had! Well, of course, then, of course!
#PAUL.
Oh, my confidence, Hella! Don't mention that. That had died long before!
#HELLA.
To be deceived so shamefully.
#PAUL.
Blame yourself! You have killed it systematically! What else, pray tell!
#PAUL.
Yes, by forever considering only yourself and never me! That could not help but stifle all my feelings in time. I fought against it as long as I could, Hella, but it had to come to an end some time.
#HELLA.
And I went about without misgivings, while behind my back a conspiracy was forming ...
#PAUL.
Who conspired?
#HELLA.
All of you! This whole owl's nest of a house was in league against me! You had conspired against me, you and your ilk, simply because I was superior to you, that's the reason why you wanted to shoulder me off! Do you suppose I don't realize that? Very well, let baseness prevail! I am willing to retreat!
#PAUL.
It always has been your trick, Hella, to play the part of offended innocence! It is well that you are reminding me of that in this hour! You are making the step easier for me than I had hoped.
#HELLA.
This is the thanks!
#PAUL.
Thanks!... How in the world could you expect thanks?
#HELLA.
Because I made a human being of you!
#PAUL.
Hella, you are making use of words!
#HELLA.
Yes, made a human being of you. I will repeat it ten times over!
#PAUL.
Won't you kindly call in the whole estate with your shrieking.
#HELLA.
The whole world, for all I care! What were you when you came into my hands? A crude student, utterly helpless, whom I directed into the proper channels, I, single handed! Without me you would have gone to the dogs or you might have become one of those novelists whom no one reads! I was the first one to put sound ideas in your head, roused your talent and pointed out to you all that is really demanded. Through me you attained a name and reputation, and now that you are fortunate enough to be that far along, you go and throw yourself away upon a Polish goose, you ... you?
#PAUL.
There are limits to all things, Hella, even to consideration for your sex! Do not assume that you still have me in your power. It has lasted fifteen years. It is over today. Do you suppose I ought to thank you for sapping everything from me, my will - power, my strength, my real talents, all the faith in love and beauty that was once in me, which you have systematically driven out with your infernal leveling process? Where shall I ever find a trace of all that again? I might seek for a hundred years and not strike that path again! I might have become an artist, at life or art itself, who cares! And you have made me a beggar, a machine, that reels off its uniform sing - song day after day! You have cheated me out of my life, you imp!... Give it back to me!
#HELLA.
Why did you allow yourself to be cheated. It's your own fault!
#PAUL.
That is a profound word, Hella! Why have you ... allowed ... yourself to be cheated!
#HELLA.
You had your will - power just as I had mine. Why did you not make use of it?
#PAUL.
You, with your ideas, would say that, Hella?
#HELLA.
Yes, one or the other is stronger, of course! Why should we women not be stronger?
#PAUL.
That is sufficient, Hella. We are through with each other. There is nothing more to say.
#HELLA.
As you may decide. So it is really all over between us?
#PAUL.
Why did you allow yourself to be cheated? Terrible! Terrible! Why must this conviction come too late?
#HELLA.
I suppose you are going to the other woman now?
#PAUL.
We are going together!
#HELLA.
If I release you, you mean!
#PAUL.
I suppose you will be compelled to!
#HELLA.
Who can compel me?
#PAUL.
Hella, then ... Then ...
#HELLA.
Well? Then?
#PAUL.
Then we shall see who is the stronger.
#ANTOINETTE.
Paul!
#PAUL.
Antoinette!
#ANTOINETTE.
I am here, Paul.
#PAUL.
Thank you, thank you, dear!
#HELLA.
Who are you, and what do you want here?
#PAUL.
Hella ... If you please ...
#ANTOINETTE.
I am not afraid, Paul. Just continue, madam.
#HELLA.
Who has given you the right to intrude here?
#ANTOINETTE.
Ask yourself, madam. Who was here earlier, you or I?
#HELLA.
I shall not quarrel with you, I shall simply show you the door!
#PAUL.
Well, well. We are standing on my soil now, Hella! Remember that!
#HELLA.
Oh, I suppose you are insisting upon your rights! PAUL, Why I simply must. You are forcing me to do so!
#HELLA.
Very well. I am doing that very thing!
#PAUL.
Really now! You will not change your mind?
#HELLA.
I will not change my mind. I shall not release you. Now do as you please!
#PAUL.
You will not release me?
#HELLA.
No! PAUL, You!... You!...
#ANTOINETTE.
Be quiet, dear! No mortal can interfere with us.
#HELLA.
How affectionate! You probably suppose that you have him already? That I shall simply go and your happiness is complete! Don't deceive yourself! You shall not enjoy happiness when I am compelled to battle.
#ANTOINETTE.
Did I not battle?
#HELLA.
Your little battle. Simply because you did not happen to get the man that you wanted! We have had battles of quite other dimensions!
#ANTOINETTE.
Do not believe for a moment that you have a right to look down upon me! I shall pick up your gauntlet in the things that really count.
#HELLA.
You? My gauntlet? Ha, ha!
#ANTOINETTE.
You too are only a woman, just as I am, and although you may rate yourself ever so much higher, you will remain a woman nevertheless!
#HELLA.
Woman or not! I shall show you with whom you have to deal! I shall not retreat and that settles it! Under the law, you shall never get each other. Now show your courage.
#ANTOINETTE.
I shall show you my courage!
#HELLA.
Dare to do so without the law! Bear the consequences! Suffer yourself to be cast out by all the world! Have them point their fingers at you! That is the absconded wife who is living with a run - away husband! Take that ban upon you! Do you see now? I should. I should scorn the whole world! Can you do the same?
#HELLA.
You can't do that! I knew it very well.
#ANTOINETTE.
What I can and what I cannot do is in the hand of God. That is all that I have to say to you.
#HELLA.
That is all I need to know! I wish you a happy life!
#PAUL.
Hella, one last word!
#HELLA.
It has been spoken!
#PAUL.
Do you remember what we agreed to do once upon a time?
#HELLA.
I don't remember anything now!
#PAUL.
Hella, remember! On our wedding day we agreed, if either one of us, from an honest conviction, should demand his freedom, he should have it, our compact should be ended. That occasion is here. Remember!
#HELLA.
I don't remember a thing now. You certainly do not.
#ANTOINETTE.
Don't say another word, dear!
#HELLA.
It would certainly do no good! Good - by! As for the rest, we shall see!
#PAUL.
We shall.
#PAUL.
Now the bridges are burned behind us!
#ANTOINETTE.
They are, dear. Do you realize it?
#PAUL.
What now? What now?
#ANTOINETTE.
Paul! My Paul!
#PAUL.
It was a long time before you came, Toinette.
#ANTOINETTE.
But now I am here, and shall leave you no more.
#PAUL.
You will not leave me, beloved?
#ANTOINETTE.
I shall never leave you.
#PAUL.
And I shall not leave you.
#ANTOINETTE.
And you will not leave me.
#PAUL.
Why did you stay so long, Toinette?
#ANTOINETTE.
Much was to be set in order, dear.
#PAUL.
I was almost beginning to doubt you.
#ANTOINETTE.
You wicked man. Then I should have been forced to go alone.
#PAUL.
Alone? Where would you have gone, you poor, helpless, little soul
#ANTOINETTE.
Do not think that! I have the thing that will help me. That is why I am so late!
#PAUL.
Antoinette!
#ANTOINETTE.
Don't be frightened, dear! Two drops and all is over.
#PAUL.
You would?
#ANTOINETTE.
Yes, I will. Are you going with me?
#PAUL.
Toinette! Toinette!
#ANTOINETTE.
Think of her words, she will not release you!
#PAUL.
Is Hella right? You haven't the courage?
#ANTOINETTE.
Courage I have, Paul. To the very end!
#PAUL.
Very well, then we shall undertake it in spite of them all.
#ANTOINETTE.
The absconded wife! The runaway husband! Did you forget those words? Those terrible words! They keep on ringing in my ears. Are we to live in the scorn of people. I cannot, Paul.
#PAUL.
You do not want to.
#ANTOINETTE.
No, I do not want to! I do not care to descend into the mire! I have hated it all of my life. They shall not be able to reproach us for anything.
#PAUL.
Is it to be? Is it to be?
#PAUL.
Kiss me, kiss me, beloved!
#ANTOINETTE.
Here on your brow, my lover! Are you content?
#PAUL.
Content in life or death. Are you weeping, sweetheart?
#ANTOINETTE.
Why, you are, too, Paul!
#PAUL.
All over! Tell me what you think now, dear!
#ANTOINETTE.
It is this, dear, our time is short. I rode away from my husband! He was riding ahead of me in the sleigh. I had told him that I would follow and I mounted my horse and came to you.
#PAUL.
Courageous soul! Rode through the forest?
#ANTOINETTE.
Right on through the forest. The sun was already going down, when I set out.
#PAUL.
The sun of New Year's Eve ... Did you see it too?
#ANTOINETTE.
When it was down, the gloaming afforded me light, and later the snow.
#PAUL.
Dearest, when the sun is down, there is nothing left to give light.
#ANTOINETTE.
Indeed, my beloved, indeed! Then come the stars. They are finer.
#PAUL.
Do you believe in the stars?
#ANTOINETTE.
You heretic, I believe!...
#PAUL.
Still believe in heaven and hell?
#ANTOINETTE.
No longer for us. For us, the stars.
#PAUL.
Do you think so? For us?
#ANTOINETTE.
For us and lovers such as we are!
#PAUL.
How do you know that?
#ANTOINETTE.
Since I have you!
#PAUL.
Then I believe it too!
#ANTOINETTE.
My friend! My beloved! My life!
#PAUL.
My beloved! My wife!
#ANTOINETTE.
Don't you hear steps?
#PAUL.
Where, pray tell.
#ANTOINETTE.
Out in the garden. It seemed so to me.
#PAUL.
I hear nothing. All is still.
#ANTOINETTE.
I am afraid, Paul.
#PAUL.
Afraid? Of what?
#ANTOINETTE.
That he will come and get me. Our time is short.
#PAUL.
Then I will protect you.
#ANTOINETTE.
Paul, I don't want to see him again! I don't want to see another soul!
#PAUL.
How beautiful you are now, Toinette!
#ANTOINETTE.
Am I beautiful? Am I beautiful. For you, my Paul, for you!
#PAUL.
For me.
#ANTOINETTE.
I am still beautiful and young and yet I shall cast it away. I am not afraid.
#PAUL.
We are not afraid!
#ANTOINETTE.
Out into night and death together with you!
#PAUL.
It is not worth living! We have realized that!
#ANTOINETTE.
Haven't we, Paul, we two lost creatures?
#ANTOINETTE.
Do you remember, dear, what you used to do when you were a little boy?
#PAUL.
No, sweetheart, tell me!
#ANTOINETTE.
Try to recall, dear. What did you do when your mother gave us bread and cake.
#PAUL.
I took the bread first, is that what you mean, and then finished up with the cake.
#ANTOINETTE.
Kept the cake for the end, you crafty fellow!
#PAUL.
Kept the best part for the end! Yes that's what I did.
#ANTOINETTE.
Just wait, you rogue. Now I'll make you answer. Tell me, what am I now, bread or cake!
#PAUL.
My last, my best, my all, that's what you are to me!
#ANTOINETTE.
There can be no joy beyond this. Shall we become old and gray and withered? Come, my dear, come!
#PAUL.
Do you know of what you remind me now?
#ANTOINETTE.
Of what, Paul?
#PAUL.
That is just the way you stood in our park when you were a girl, out there under the alders, and beckoned to me when you wanted me to come and play with you.
#ANTOINETTE.
Come on, Paul. Come on. Isn't that it?
#PAUL.
Just so! Just so!
#ANTOINETTE.
Catch me, Paulie!... Catch me!
#PAUL.
Now I have you, you rogue?
#ANTOINETTE.
Have me and hold me fast!
#PAUL.
New Year's Eve! New Year's Eve!... Is it here?
#ANTOINETTE.
It's no longer necessary for us to cast lead to find out how long we are to live. We know!
#PAUL.
Soon we shall know nothing!
#ANTOINETTE.
Soon we shall know all!
#PAUL.
On your stars, do you mean?
#ANTOINETTE.
On our star, my lover, you and I shall meet again.
#PAUL.
There we shall meet again!
#ANTOINETTE.
Do you hear?
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
The bay is bridled, sir, and stands out here.
#ANTOINETTE.
The bay bridled? Is my gray there, too?
#INSPECTOR ZINDEL.
It is, madam!
#ANTOINETTE.
Very well. Stay with the horses. We shall be there immediately!
#PAUL.
What is it, dear? What do you intend to do?
#ANTOINETTE.
To our horses, dearest! To our horses!
#PAUL.
Out into the world, after all?
#ANTOINETTE.
Out with you into the night ... the night of Saint Sylvester!
#PAUL.
Stay here, Toinette! Why begin the farce anew! Let it end upon this soil, that nurtured our childhood!
#ANTOINETTE.
Come, dearest, to our horses! Let us ride to my home.
#PAUL.
To your home?
#ANTOINETTE.
To Rukkoschin, the house of my fathers.
#PAUL.
Do you wish to go there?
#ANTOINETTE.
I wish to see it once more!
#PAUL.
And then we shall be ready?
#ANTOINETTE.
The house lies secluded and empty and dead.
#PAUL.
Only the spirits of your fathers are stirring.
#ANTOINETTE.
But I know of one room where I played as a child, that has suffered no change.
#PAUL.
To our horses! To our horses!
#ANTOINETTE.
The night is clear. Many thousands of stars will light the way. We shall ride through the forest. Right across the lake. The ice is firm.
#PAUL.
Farewell, Hella! Your reign is over!... We are returning to Mother Earth!
