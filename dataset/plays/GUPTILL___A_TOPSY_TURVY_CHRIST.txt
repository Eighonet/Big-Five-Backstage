#FRANK.
What’s the matter, Alice?
#ALICE CHASE.
I’m mad.
#FRANK.
So I see. What about?
#ALICE CHASE.
What are you mad about, yourself? You look like a thunder cloud.
#FRANK.
I’m not mad.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, you are, too. I know. What is the matter, truly?
#FRANK.
Nothing, I tell you. What were you screeching so for?
#ALICE CHASE.
’Cause I was mad, I tell you.
#FRANK.
What for?
#ALICE CHASE.
Say, I’ll tell you what I was mad at, if you will, too. Will you?
#FRANK.
Perhaps - well, yes, I suppose I could. You first, though.
#ALICE CHASE.
No, you.
#FRANK.
Ladies first, always.
#ALICE CHASE.
There, that’s it, exactly. That “always.” Why should a thing always be just the same? You must always say “ladies first,” and both of us must offer each other the biggest piece, when we want it ourselves, and always mind what the grown - ups say, and shut the door, and a whole lot of nonsense. Why shouldn’t the grown - ups mind us part of the time?
#FRANK.
Is that what you are mad at?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, it is. My mother thinks I ought to mind everything she says, and never talk back, and when I said I was going over to Kitty’s she said I couldn’t, and when I - argued a little about it, she said I was saucy, and spanked me. I wish I could find a place where mothers had to mind their children a while, and see how they like it.
#FRANK.
So do I. My teacher kept me after school because I couldn’t answer every question in my geography lesson. Why don’t she answer some of them? We scholars have to do all the work, and the teacher just listens and watches for something to find fault with, all the time.
#ALICE CHASE.
I know. Why don’t they let us ask the questions? It would be much the best way, I’m sure. And rules. I’m so sick of rules. You mustn’t do this and you mustn’t do that, and if you do, some one will punish you. I’d like to live where there weren’t any rules at all, and where children were the biggest for a spell. Wouldn’t I teach them a thing or two?
#FRANK.
There isn’t any such place, I’m afraid. I never learned about it in my geography.
#ALICE CHASE.
You’ve never been way through it yet. Perhaps there is, now. Let’s hunt for it.
#FRANK.
All right, let’s.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh dear. I can’t read half fast enough. It would take most a year to read all that, and two more years to study all the maps. Let’s go ask one of the High School boys or girls. They’ve learned it all.
#FRANK.
No, let’s don’t. They’d only laugh at us. The big ones always do. Let’s go look for it ourselves. We’ll have adventures on the way, most likely, and it will be great sport.
#ALICE CHASE.
All right, let’s. Shall we start now?
#FRANK.
Sure. Shall I go this way and you that, like Red Riding Hood and the wolf, or shall we go together?
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, together. I’d be afraid to go alone, I’m sure. Hark! What was that?
#FRANK.
Sounded like a very little bit of a bell.
#ALICE CHASE.
Listen, and see if it comes again.
#ALICE AND FRANK TOGETHER.
Oh!
#FAIRY.
I’m the Fairy Tinkle Bell, of Everywhere. I heard two little children wishing for a new land, and I’ve come to show them the way.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh goody, goody. Won’t I have to mind there?
#FAIRY.
No.
#FRANK.
And are things different than they are here?
#FAIRY.
Yes, indeed.
#ALICE CHASE.
Then we’ll go. Take us now, good Fairy, do.
#FRANK.
How far is it?
#FAIRY.
So far that you never could find the way alone, but I can take you there in one moment. You have only to do as I say.
#BOTH CHILDREN.
Oh, we will, we will.
#FAIRY.
Then take hold of hands, close your eyes, and go round three times, saying “Topsy Turvy” three times, slowly. Then say “Here we are” and open your eyes. That is all.
#FRANK.
What next? Why, where is she?
#ALICE CHASE.
Why, why, everything is different. It’s not the same place at all. Where are we?
#KNARF.
You’re in Topsy Turvy land, of course.
#ECILA.
Isn’t that where you wanted to be?
#DERF.
’Cause you’re here, whether you want to be or not.
#FRANK.
So I see. Well, perhaps it is where we wanted to be. At any rate, Fairy Tinkle Bell brought us here, when we were trying to find a place in the geography.
#ECILA.
I never heard of that place.
#FRANK.
I never named any place. How do you know you never heard of it?
#ECILA.
Why, yes you did, too. You told the country you were journeying in, to find some town. I heard you.
#FRANK.
I did not.
#KNARF.
Yes, you did. You said you were looking there for this place you wanted.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, in the geography. A geography isn’t a place. It’s a book about places.
#DERF.
What’s a book? book? Gee! Don’t you have books here?
#ECILA.
His name isn’t Gee. It’s Derf.
#ALICE CHASE.
That’s a queer name. What’s yours?
#ECILA.
It’s Ecila. What’s yours?
#ALICE CHASE.
Mine is Alice. And what’s his name?
#ECILA.
It’s Knarf.
#FRANK.
Oh, Frank. Same as mine.
#KNARF.
No, not same as yours. It’s not Frank at all. It’s Knarf.
#FRANK.
How do you spell it?
#KNARF.
Spell it? I don’t know what you mean.
#FRANK.
Well, write it. Here.
#KNARF.
What are they for.
#FRANK.
To write with, of course. This way. See. F - R - A - N - K. That’s Frank. That’s my name. Write yours.
#KNARF.
I can’t. I never heard of such a thing. Is Frank the name of that thing now? And haven’t you any name left, at all?
#FRANK.
Well, of all the silly questions. Of course it’s my name just the same. The name of that thing is paper. And if I spell it backward, it’s Knarf, just like yours. I’ve done it for fun, lots of times.
#ECILA.
Can you separate yourself from your name, that way?
#ALICE CHASE.
Can I write it, you mean? Why, yes. See!
#A-L-I-C.
E, spells Alice.
#ECILA.
Could you do mine?
#ALICE CHASE.
Why, I guess so. Say it again.
#ECILA.
It’s Ecila.
#ALICE CHASE.
It ought to be E - S - I - L - A. Why, if I spell it with a C instead of an S, it will be Alice backward. Guess this is Topsy Turvy Land all right. What’s your name?
#ECILA.
It’s Derf. Do his on the white thing.
#ALICE CHASE.
D - E - R - F. Why, that’s Fred, backward. That’s my little brother’s name.
#ECILA.
Yes, and that’s my little brother.
#FRANK.
Little brother! He’s a heap bigger than you are.
#KNARF.
No such thing. It will be a long time before he grows to my size. He’s only three.
#FRANK.
Three. Three what, I wonder? He’s taller than my father.
#ECILA.
Your father must look funny. How old are you? I’m ten.
#ALICE CHASE.
Why, so am I, but I’m not nearly so tall. And Frank is twelve.
#ECILA.
So is Knarf. But he’s bigger than I am, and your brother is smaller than you.
#FRANK.
Well, either I’m dippy, or you are. You say everything topsy turvy.
#KNARF.
Of course. This is Topsy Turvy Land. How big is your little brother? As small as Derf?
#FRANK.
He’s three, and about so tall.
#ECILA.
So when you say small, or little, you mean big. And your father? He’s not as little as Derf, you say. How little is he?
#DERF.
My Daddy’s big, real big. Big as that.
#ALICE CHASE.
He must be tiny. I’d like to see him.
#KNARF.
I’ll call him.
#ALICE CHASE.
Maybe he’s busy, or perhaps he wouldn’t like to be called just to be looked at.
#KNARF.
Well, when my own father can’t come when he’s called, or don’t want to be shown off to my friends, I’ll see about it. Dad!
#ALICE CHASE.
Why, we say that, sometimes. Oh, I see, it’s the same both ways.
#DAD.
Did you call me, Knarf?
#KNARF.
Yes, I wanted to show you to these - children, they say they are - just our ages.
#DAD.
Your ages? They’re awful big.
#ECILA.
Take off your hat, at once, and stop staring. And making personal remarks, too. That’s three points for Friday.
#DAD.
Oh, I forgot, Ecila. I beg your pardon. Please excuse me this time.
#KNARF.
No indeed. And before company, too.
#DAD.
But -
#KNARF.
Answering back, too. Be quiet, sir. That’s four for Friday.
#DERF.
He sweared, I fink, under his breff. I sawn his lips a - movin’.
#KNARF.
That’s six for Friday.
#ECILA.
Where’s Mom?
#DAD.
I don’t know. Dressing her doll, I think.
#ECILA.
Mom! Mom!
#MOM.
What is it? Oh! Happy to see you.
#ECILA.
You see, I have her well trained. Does your mother mind as quick?
#ALICE CHASE.
My mother? I have to mind her; she doesn’t mind me. But is she really your mother?
#ECILA.
Of course. She wouldn’t mind anyone else as quick, would she?
#MOM.
What’s the matter, dear?
#KNARF.
He’s in disgrace. Don’t talk to him.
#DERF.
Her petted him, her did. One for Fiday.
#ECILA.
Come away, Mom, at once. Show the company what a pretty behaved mother is like, now. Sing for them. Mom - I’ve got a cold.
#ECILA.
Nonsense! Stand up at once, and sing. Sing “Loora - laddy.”
#FRANK.
Don’t make her show off. I know how she feels, I hate it awfully, myself, don’t you?
#ECILA.
Why, I don’t know. I never tried. I’m not big enough yet. Come, sing! Sing up, now, at once. There’s a lot piling up for Friday.
#KNARF.
There! Next time do as you’re told. One for Friday for crying. Now, Dad, you whistle.
#DERF.
Oh, Mom made a face, her did. One for Fiday.
#FRANK.
Are you their father, really?
#DAD.
Of course. You think I mind ’cause I like it, do you?
#ECILA.
Have you a Marg. Marg. What’s that?
#ECILA.
Why, my Marg was Dad’s mother. Some children have two. Have you any?
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, I see! A grandmother! We do call ours Gram. She likes it. You don’t make her mind, do you?
#ECILA.
Of course. Marg! Marg! Where in Topsy Turvydom is she? Mom, go find her.
#DERF.
I’ll find her.
#KNARF.
Do you mind your father, truly?
#FRANK.
Of course. I have to.
#KNARF.
Don’t you like to? Then what makes you?
#FRANK.
He does. No. I don’t always like to, but I like it better than I should treating him that way.
#KNARF.
How funny.
#DERF.
Her was a playin’ blocks, and her wouldn’t come. Her’s a naughty, naughty Marg. Two, fee, for Fiday.
#ECILA.
Naughty Marg! She must come when Ecila calls her. Come here.
#DERF.
Dere’ll be a lot of fees for Fiday, if her don’t stop ’at noise.
#ECILA.
Now Knarf, you shouldn’t spoil her that way! Only good Margs ought to have candy. Naughty Margs don’t deserve any.
#MARGARET.
I’d give you some, Girl, but it’s all gone. Are you cross to your Marg? Do you always make her mind quick?
#FRANK.
Of course not. Our dear Gram does as she pleases, and we all try to please her.
#MARGARET.
Why, how nice! Is she as tall as I am?
#ECILA.
She’s as tall as Knarf.
#MARGARET.
And a Marg! How very strange!
#KNARF.
Don’t talk so much, Marg. Grown - ups should be seen and not heard.
#DERF.
It’s Fiday, it’s Fiday. Here comes the Spankety Man!
#FRANK.
It isn’t Friday, either. It’s Wednesday.
#DERF.
’Tis Fiday. Spankety Man’s a - coming.
#ALICE CHASE.
But it was Wednesday a few minutes ago, and we haven’t been to bed yet.
#ECILA.
What’s that got to do with it?
#ALICE CHASE.
Why, it’s got to be night before it’s another day, hasn’t it?
#ECILA.
Not in Topsy Turvy Land. What a strange country you must live in! Here we jumble our days up more. We don’t go by rules; we hate them. We have a lot of days together, and then, when we get sleepy enough, we have a few nights.
#FRANK.
But Thursday has to come before Friday, doesn’t it?
#KNARF.
Why should it have to? Things don’t go by rule here. And it is Friday, for here comes the Spankety Man.
#SPANKETY MAN.
Good Friday, Sir. I believe we haven’t met before. Any parents or grand - parents?
#FRANK.
Yes.
#SPANKETY MAN.
Spanking done every Friday. One spank for each point. Settlement every New Year’s Day, at so much a hundred. Discount for specially naughty ones. Want to open an account?
#FRANK.
No.
#ALICE CHASE.
We wouldn’t want Papa and Mamma spanked; nor Gram, either. The idea!
#SPANKETY MAN.
You’ll spoil’em, Ma’am, spoil’em. Better patronize me. It’s necessary, I assure you.
#ALICE CHASE.
No, indeed.
#DERF.
Tum, sing your song, and get to work. Marg’s awful bad.
#SPANKETY MAN.
Tune: “Michael Roy.” Chorus.
#ALICE CHASE.
I think you’re horrid!
#SPANKETY MAN.
Ma’am?
#ALICE CHASE.
I said I think you’re horrid.
#SPANKETY MAN.
I only do my duty, Ma’am, and earn an honest living. You wouldn’t want to have to do all your own spanking, would you?
#ALICE CHASE.
I don’t believe in spanking, at all.
#SPANKETY MAN.
Oh, if you’re an unbeliever, it’s no use to argue, but “Spare the spanks and spoil the Dads” is a true maxim, just the same. Well, we’ll begin with Marg, as usual. How many points? And which spanker?
#DERF.
Dis one.
#ECILA.
Seventy - two, I’m sorry to say. Come, Marg. Why, where is she?
#ALICE CHASE.
You shan’t spank that dear little grandmother. The idea!
#SPANKETY MAN.
Business is business, Ma’am. Please step aside.
#ALICE CHASE.
I shan’t. You shan’t touch her.
#FRANK.
No indeed, you sha’nt. Let her alone.
#SPANKETY MAN.
Will you move aside?
#ALICE CHASE.
No.
#SPANKETY MAN.
Then it will have to be postponed till next Friday, for here comes the Teacher.
#FRANK.
I’m glad of it. She’ll make you behave.
#KNARF.
No, she won’t. She’s a he, and we make him behave. Get your ruler ready.
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you know your lessons?
#MARGARET.
I don’t have to. I don’t have to ask the questions, nor answer them. The children ask them and the Teacher answers them. If he misses, he’s punished.
#FRANK.
Just as I’ve always wished it might be. I’ll ask the first one.
#KNARF.
You may. You’re company.
#KNARF.
Begin. Ask him one.
#FRANK.
What’s the capital of Massachusetts?
#SPANKETY MAN.
Oh, I say, that isn’t fair. You must ask questions that mean something.
#FRANK.
Why, I did.
#TEACHER.
Then two of the words were in a foreign language. I’m the Common Teacher. Foreign languages come in High.
#FRANK.
Well, I had to learn it, and a lot more like it.
#ECILA.
You ask one. Ask a fair one.
#ALICE CHASE.
How much are two and two?
#TEACHER.
Twenty - two.
#KNARF.
Right. Where did these children come from?
#TEACHER.
From - from - from the farthest dominions of Topsy Turvy Land, I should say.
#KNARF.
Is that right?
#FRANK.
Why, no. We came from -
#TEACHER.
There’s no such place.
#FRANK.
There is, too. It’s in the United States of America.
#TEACHER.
There’s no such place as that, either.
#ALICE CHASE.
Why, everyone knows the United States, all over the earth.
#SPANKETY MAN.
Did you come from the earth?
#FRANK.
Of course. Did you think we came from Mars?
#TEACHER.
No, for this is Mars. But it isn’t fair to ask me questions about the Earth. All our most learned men have been able to discover about the earth is that it is a very slow - moving, dull star which turns on itself once every month or two, and takes about a century to get around the sun. The winters are so long and cold that no life is possible. It is supposed to be a worn out planet.
#FRANK.
The idea! It’s every bit wrong.
#ECILA.
Keep points, Mr. Spankety Man. How did they get here?
#TEACHER.
I don’t know.
#DERF.
Him don’t know. Dat’s five points, or fee, which is it? It’s my turn. What’s the biggest nanimal in Topsy Turvy Land?
#TEACHER.
The Wincheopactylus. He is very large and fierce, and lives on new inhabitants, whom he eats raw. His voice is a high trill, and he gives warning of his presence -
#KNARF.
He certainly does. There’s one coming now. Run, everybody, run!
#ALICE CHASE.
There! Just look at this room! I pick up and pick up, and the minute I go out, when I come back it’s all to do over again. I never was so sick of anything in all my life, as I am of this Topsy Turvy Land!
#FRANK.
I wish I could get hold of that Fairy for a few minutes, that’s what!
#ALICE CHASE.
What could you do with a fairy, I’d like to know? She’d do something to you before you could say “Jack Robinson.” I do wish, Knarf, you’d learn to knock!
#KNARF.
And I do wish, Alice, that you’d remember that our music teacher has told us over and over, never to knock, even if you do request it, since it is a bad breach of good manners to do so.
#ECILA.
Don’t you like company, really, Alice?
#ALICE CHASE.
Why, I like you, Ecila, as well, or better, than anything else in this awful place. But - Oh, I’m so homesick, and so tired of everything being topsy turvy! If I could go home, I’d never complain about minding again, or rules, either!
#KNARF.
Well, of course it is too bad that you haven’t any grown - ups to make mind.
#ALICE CHASE.
I don’t want to make anyone mind. I want my own dear mother and father and grandma, too. I’d be glad to mind them, if I could only get a chance.
#ECILA.
If you could only find the Fairy who brought you here -
#FRANK.
Well, we can’t. We’ve hunted and hunted, but we never seem to get anywhere when we start out.
#KNARF.
Of course not. All roads lead to nowhere in Topsy Turvy Land. Did yours lead somewhere?
#FRANK.
Of course they did. And our teachers knew something. They made you study and learn your lessons, instead of calling you a hopeless little blockhead because you didn’t ask them a lot of foolish questions about nothing in particular.
#ALICE CHASE.
And that music teacher is just the limit. Manners, indeed! The things he calls manners are the most impolite things imaginable. And dancing! To walk slowly here and there, and sit down every so many steps isn’t dancing!
#KNARF.
What is it, then?
#FRANK.
Tomfoolery. And what he calls whistling is nothing more than buzzing! Music teacher! He doesn’t teach a bit of music!
#KNARF.
Why, manners and dancing and whistling are music.
#ALICE CHASE.
They are not! The only thing the least bit like music that I’ve heard since I came here is that measly little song the Spankety Man sings every Friday.
#ECILA.
That isn’t music! That queer noise he makes! And all the Moms know loora - laddy. I should think you’d call that music.
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, I don’t. And I don’t even know what time of year it is. Your days and nights are so mixed up that one can’t keep track of them at all. We shan’t even know when the Christmas holidays come.
#KNARF.
Yes, you will, for they’re here now, just as soon as Gother Moose gets here.
#DERF.
Gother Moose is a - coming, now.
#ALICE CHASE.
Mother Goose, I bet it is. Is she real?
#DERF.
’Course her is!
#ECILA.
Why shouldn’t she be?
#ALICE CHASE.
Why, our Mother Goose is just a book of rhymes and jingles - sort of stories, you know.
#DERF.
Dat’s what Gother Moose does - tells stories. Here her comes.
#GOTHER MOOSE.
Well, well, whom have we here?
#DERF.
Erf chilluns.
#GOTHER MOOSE.
Earth children! I’m afraid they belong under the jurisdiction of my sin twister, who tells her stories in a queer, jerky sort of fashion. Call in the others, and I’ll be about my task, for I must journey on to make the Christmas holidays begin in the other places. I’m late, as it is.
#GOTHER MOOSE.
What shall I tell you this time?
#DERF.
Hackey Jorner.
#GOTHER MOOSE.
Hackey Jorner was a very little boy, no bigger than Derf. One time he sat down in the middle of the room, where the sides came together, and put his foot into the oven, which was very cold. He pulled out a very small pie, all piping hot, and held it neatly on his knuckles. Then with his fingers on the other hand, he began to eat it. He took a bite, then he took another, then he took another, then he took another, then he took another, then he took another, then he took another, then he took another, then -
#FRANK.
Oh, go on! Never mind so many bites.
#GOTHER MOOSE.
But he has only had eight bites. That would be too large a pie, and this was a small one. So he took another bite, and then he took another, and then he took another, and then he took another, and then he took another, and then he took another, and then he took another, and then he took another, and then he took another, and then he took another, and then he took another, and then he took another, and then - what do you think?
#FRANK.
Oh, he took another, probably.
#ALICE CHASE.
No, he found a plum. plum? What a queer word! No he found no plum, he found - that he couldn’t take another, because his pie was gone.
#DERF.
Tell anodder. Dat was a fine one. Wasn’t it, Alice?
#FRANK.
Very nice indeed - quite all of a sameness.
#GOTHER MOOSE.
Ecila may choose this time.
#ECILA.
Little Po Beeb.
#GOTHER MOOSE.
Little Po Beeb had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, woolly cats. One night Po Beeb did not go to sleep at all, but sat up watching her woolly cats, and as she watched, they trotted off, down the hill to the very top, then out of sight, and -
#ALICE CHASE.
She couldn’t tell where to find them.
#GOTHER MOOSE.
Certainly she could. They were just under the top of the hill, behind a very small tree. Po Beeb and the Spankety Man walked after them, and they all came right back. They had gone for a drink of water.
#ALICE CHASE.
So they all came home, wagging their tails behind them.
#GOTHER MOOSE.
Certainly not. They did not come home, they went home, and they had no tails at all. Cats never have any tails. And no animal in Topsy - Turvy Land, except the terrible Wincheopactylus, ever wears its tail behind it. It always dangles gracefully forward over the left shoulder. But I must hurry on, to tell the Christmas stories to other Topsy Turvy children. Badgye. Watch for Clanty Sauce.
#KNARF AND ECILA.
We will.
#DERF.
Yes, us will.
#ALICE CHASE.
Clanty Sauce! Oh, Frank, perhaps he’s our own dear Santa Claus, and will take us home.
#FRANK.
You can’t catch Santa Claus. Haven’t we tried, lots of times and did we catch even a glimpse of him?
#ECILA.
What a shame! So you never got any presents?
#ALICE CHASE.
Of course we did. But - what are these?
#DERF.
The Greenies! The Greenies!
#FRANK.
That’s what you’d call whispering. What would a shout be like, I wonder?
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, I shan’t watch for him. He doesn’t like it.
#GREENIES.
Then you won’t get no presents, nor nothing, not never.
#FRANK.
What grammar.
#ALICE CHASE.
It’s Topsy Turvy language, I suppose. But how about the presents?
#ECILA.
Why - Marg, you are the biggest. You tell the little girl about the presents.
#MARGARET.
Why, old Clanty Sauce always brings a whole lot of them.
#FRANK.
Sure. On his back.
#MARGARET.
Why, no. In a big box in his arms. And if you see him, he’ll give you some.
#DERF.
And if you don’t see him, you won’t det none, not nany tall.
#KNARF.
What you doing?
#FRANK.
Writing him a letter, to tell him what I want.
#KNARF.
Well, you just stop it.
#FRANK.
Why?
#KNARF.
Last place, because he couldn’t make tail nor head of it any way.
#DERF.
Next pace, ’cause taint no good manners to tell what you want.
#ECILA.
First place, ’cause he always knows what you want, anyway, and brings the nicest things you can think of.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, it must be our own dear Santa. Perhaps we really will see him. Perhaps not.
#MARGARET.
Perhaps we will.
#CLANTY.
Step out and fetch the box.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, it isn’t our Santa at all!
#ECILA.
Have you something for earth children too, Clanty dear?
#MARGARET.
Open box, shut box. This is Marg who loudly knocks.
#MARGARET.
You’re welcome Clanty Sauce.
#MOM.
You’re welcome, Clanty Sauce.
#DAD.
You’re welcome, Clanty Sauce.
#FRANK.
That’s not the way.
#DAD.
Hush, you mustn’t talk!
#DERF.
You’re welcome, Clanty Sauce. Dese are dandy presents.
#FRANK.
I should think so! Hope mine won’t be like them.
#BOTH.
Thank you, Santa Claus. But we may exchange presents, mayn’t we?
#ALL.
You’re welcome, Clanty Sauce, you’re welcome!
#ECILA.
Why don’t you eat your orange?
#KNARF.
And the candy’s great. It’s sweet as can be!
#ALICE CHASE.
It’s awful sour!
#FRANK.
Sourer than a lemon.
#KNARF.
Sweeter than a lemon, you mean. Don’t you know sweet from sour?
#ALICE CHASE.
Is it all what you call sweet?
#DERF.
’Course. Candy’s always sweet. Don’t you like it, Girl?
#ALICE CHASE.
No, I don’t. You may have the whole bagful.
#KNARF.
Give me yours, old chap, if you don’t like it.
#FRANK.
No, Marg may have mine. She’s little.
#KNARF.
I should think she was!
#ECILA.
Try the orange. Perhaps you’ll like that better.
#ALICE CHASE.
Is that sweet, too?
#ECILA.
No.
#FRANK.
Is it sour?
#ECILA.
Why, no. It’s - just orangy tasting.
#FRANK.
Do you call pepper orangy tasting?
#KNARF.
Aren’t they like yours?
#ALICE CHASE.
Why, no. They’re hot with pepper.
#ECILA.
I don’t know what pepper is, but oranges here always taste like that. They’re good, I think.
#ALICE CHASE.
Then you may have mine Oh, Frank, don’t swing her by one leg, like that!
#FRANK.
Well, what do I want of the thing? And if we can’t swap -
#ALICE CHASE.
We can play with each other’s things.
#ECILA.
You mustn’t. No one can touch another’s Christmas presents. If they do, they’ll get caught by the Wincheopactylus, and eaten for his Christmas dinner.
#FRANK.
Well, of all the mean Christmases! That gun and engine are dandy, if only I had ’em, though! What are those good for?
#KNARF.
Why, they’re kites.
#FRANK.
Kites. We call ’em rocks, or stones. You can’t fly them, I know.
#KNARF.
Oh yes, I can. You know that tall place you called a well? They’ll fly clear to the top of that, if I drop ’em.
#FRANK.
And see that one skate! Where’s the mate to it?
#DAD.
It doesn’t need a mate. You only skate on one foot at a time, you know.
#FRANK.
I should think you’d look pretty, balancing on one skate on the ice.
#ALL.
Why, we don’t skate on ice!
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, I want to go home. I want to go home! It’s a dreadful Christmas! Oh, I’d be so good if I could only go home!
#FRANK.
So would I. No more grumbling for this young chap.
#FAIRY.
So you’ve come to your senses?
#FRANK.
Yes, indeed we have, dear Fairy. If you’ll only take us home, we’ll mind our teachers and parents, and be willing to keep rules, and learn lessons.
#FAIRY.
You will? And you, Alice?
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, take us home, dear Fairy, do! I’ll be so good, if you will.
#FAIRY.
And you’ll remember the lessons you’ve learned?
#BOTH.
We will. We couldn’t help it.
#FAIRY.
Then close your eyes, take hold of hands, and turn around three times, saying, “Home again, home again, never to return again,” then open your eyes, and you’ll see what you’ll see.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh we are, we are, back again! There’s the schoolhouse!
#FRANK.
And I’m glad to see it. Think of that! What a dreadful place Topsy Turvy Land was!
#ALICE CHASE.
I’m sure we’ll remember our promise. Only think if we had to go back again!
#FRANK.
There’s just one thing I wish I’d seen - that awful wild beast of theirs.
#ALICE CHASE.
It might have eaten you up. I’m glad we didn’t see it. No more Topsy Turvy things for me. I think it was all dreadful.
#FRANK.
And the worst of all was that Topsy Turvy Christmas!
#ALICE CHASE.
Let’s run home and find out if Christmas has really come here.
#FRANK.
Let’s hope it hasn’t.
#BOTH.
But no Christmas at all would be better than a Topsy Turvy Christmas!
