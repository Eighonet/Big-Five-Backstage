#VIRGINIE.
This is the thirty - sixth time that I’ve been to the door.... Another beggar! Well, what is it?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Let me in.
#VIRGINIE.
No, you’re all over mud. Stay there. What do you want?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I want to come in.
#VIRGINIE.
What for?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
To bring Mademoiselle Hortense back to life.
#VIRGINIE.
Bring Mademoiselle Hortense back to life? Get out! Who are you?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Saint Anthony.
#VIRGINIE.
Of Padua?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
The same.
#VIRGINIE.
Lord bless me, it’s true! Saint Anthony, pray for us! Blessed Saint Anthony, look down upon us! Saint Anthony, pray for us!
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Shut the door.
#VIRGINIE.
Wipe your feet on the mat. No, that won’t do: rub them hard, rub them hard.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
She is laid out in there.
#VIRGINIE.
Yes, but how did you know? It’s wonderful! She’s there, in the drawing - room.... The poor dear lady! She was only seventy - seven. That’s no age at all, is it?... She was a very pious and deserving lady, you know. She suffered a great deal.... And she was very rich. They say she’s left two million francs. That’s a lot of money.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Yes.
#VIRGINIE.
It all goes to her two nephews, Monsieur Gustave and Monsieur Achille. And she’s left legacies to the Rector, to the church, to the beadle, to the sacristan, to the poor, to the Curate, to fourteen Jesuits and to all the servants, according to the length of time that they were with her. I get most. I’ve been in her service for thirty - three years, so I shall have three thousand three hundred francs. That’s a good sum.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
It is.
#VIRGINIE.
She owed me nothing; she always paid me my wages regularly. You can say what you like, you won’t find many mistresses who would do as much, after they were dead and gone. She was one of the best of women. And we’re burying her to - day.... Everybody has sent flowers. You ought to see the drawing - room. It’s a glorious sight. There are flowers on the bed, on the table, on the chairs, on the piano. And nothing but white flowers: it’s perfectly beautiful. We simply don’t know where to put the wreaths. Here are two more. Aren’t these lovely? Just hold them a minute till I finish my work. They’re taking her to the cemetery this afternoon. Everything has to be nice and clean; and I’ve only time to....
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Take me to the corpse.
#VIRGINIE.
Take you to the corpse? Now?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Yes.
#VIRGINIE.
No, it can’t be done. You must wait a bit; they are still at lunch.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
God bids me hurry; there is no time to lose.
#VIRGINIE.
What do you want with her?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I’ve told you: I want to bring her back to life.
#VIRGINIE.
You want to bring her back to life? Seriously, do you want to raise her from the dead?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Yes.
#VIRGINIE.
But she’s been dead three days.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
That’s why I wish to raise her from the dead.
#VIRGINIE.
For her to live again as before?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Yes.
#VIRGINIE.
But then there won’t be any heirs?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Of course not.
#VIRGINIE.
But what will Monsieur Gustave say?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I don’t know.
#VIRGINIE.
And will she take back the three thousand three hundred francs which she gave me because she was dead?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Yes, of course.
#VIRGINIE.
That’s a nuisance.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Have you no other money, no savings?
#VIRGINIE.
Not a farthing. I have an invalid sister who takes every penny I earn.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Well, if you are afraid of losing your three thousand francs....
#VIRGINIE.
Three thousand three hundred francs....
#SAINT ANTHONY.
If you’re afraid of losing the money, then I won’t raise her from the dead.
#VIRGINIE.
Couldn’t I keep the money and you bring her back to life just the same?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
No, you must take it or leave it. I came down in answer to your prayers: it’s for you to choose.
#VIRGINIE.
Well, then, bring her back to life all the same. What’s the matter with you now?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
You have pleased me.
#VIRGINIE.
And then does that lantern thing light up?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Yes, of itself.
#VIRGINIE.
That’s funny.... But don’t stand so near the lace curtains, or you’ll set them on fire.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
There’s no danger: it’s celestial flame.... Take me to the body.
#VIRGINIE.
I’ve told you: you must wait. I can’t disturb them now. They’re still at lunch.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Who?
#VIRGINIE.
Why, my masters, of course! The whole family! First her two nephews, Monsieur Gustave and Monsieur Achille, with their wives and children, Monsieur Georges, Monsieur Alberic, Monsieur Alphonse and Monsieur Désiré.... And cousins, male and female, and the Rector and the Doctor and I don’t know who besides: friends and relatives from a distance, whom I’d never seen. They’re very rich people.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Really?
#VIRGINIE.
Did you notice the street?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
What street?
#VIRGINIE.
Why, ours, of course! The one in which our house stands.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Yes.
#VIRGINIE.
It’s a handsome street. Well, all the houses on the left - hand side of the street, except the little one at the end, the baker’s shop, belong to Mademoiselle Hortense. Those on the right - hand side are Monsieur Gustave’s. There are twenty houses. That means money.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
No doubt.
#VIRGINIE.
Look, your lantern thing is going out.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Yes, I’m afraid....
#VIRGINIE.
Doesn’t it keep burning very long?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
It all depends upon the thoughts that feed it.
#VIRGINIE.
Yes, they own woods ... and farms ... and houses galore! Monsieur Gustave has a starch - factory: Gustave’s Starch, you’ve heard of it, I expect! Oh, they’re an amazingly well - off family. There are four of them who live on their incomes and do no business at all. That’s splendid, that is!... And such friends and acquaintances and tenants!... Well, they’ve all come to the funeral, some of them from ever so far. There’s one, I’m told, who travelled two days and two nights to get here in time. I’ll show him to you: he has a lovely beard.... They’re lunching here. They haven’t finished yet. We can’t disturb them. It’s a great lunch: there are twenty - four of them sitting down to it. And I’ve seen the bill of fare: there’s oysters, two soups, three entrées, crayfish in jelly, and trout à la Schubert. Do you know what that is?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
No.
#VIRGINIE.
No more do I. They say it’s very good; but it’s not for you and me. There’s no champagne, because of the mourning; but there’s every other kind of wine. Mademoiselle Hortense had the best cellar in the town. I’ll try and get you a good big glass, if they leave any; then you’ll see the sort of thing.... Wait, I’ll go and look what they’re doing. I think they’re beginning the trout, the trout à la Schubert. Oh, there’s Joseph moving the pine - apple. They’ve a good two hours before them. You’d better take a seat. No, no, not there, you’re much too dirty! Sit on the stool. I must get on with my work. Look out! Lift up your feet; I’m going to splash the water.... No, don’t stay there; you’re in my way; and it’s not cleaned yet.... Go over there in the corner; push the stool against the wall. There, now you won’t get your feet wet. Aren’t you hungry?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
No, thank you, but I’m rather in a hurry; so go and tell your masters.
#VIRGINIE.
You’re in a hurry? What have you got to do?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Two or three miracles.
#VIRGINIE.
I can’t tell them anything while they’re at lunch. We must wait till they’ve had their coffee. Monsieur Gustave might be very angry.... I don’t know what sort of reception he’ll give you; he doesn’t like having poor people in the house. You don’t look over - prosperous.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
No, saints are never prosperous.
#VIRGINIE.
They have money given them, though.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Yes, but not everything that’s given to the saints reaches heaven.
#VIRGINIE.
You don’t mean it? Then do the priests take what we give? I’ve heard it said; but I wouldn’t believe.... There now, I’ve got no water left!... I say!
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Yes?
#VIRGINIE.
Do you see a brass tap on your right?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Yes.
#VIRGINIE.
There’s an empty pail beside it. Would you mind filling it for me?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
With pleasure.
#VIRGINIE.
You see, I’ll never get all this cleaning done if some one doesn’t help me. And there’s nobody to help me: they’re all losing their heads.... It’s a terrible job, a death in the house! You know that as well as I do. good thing it doesn’t happen every day.... Monsieur Gustave will make a fuss if everything isn’t clean and shining when his guests come through here.... He’s not easy to please.... And I still have all the brass to do.... There, turn the tap; that’s right.... Bring me the pail.... Aren’t your feet cold? Tuck up your gown or it’ll get wet.... Mind the wreaths; put them on the stool.... That’s right, that’s capital. Thanks, you’re very kind.... I want one more. Listen! What’s that? I’ll go and see. Hallo, the master has got up! What can it be? Have they quarrelled?... No, the others are eating.... Joseph is filling up the Rector’s glass.... They are finishing the trout.... The master is coming to the door.... Why, I might speak to him as he comes out and tell him that you....
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Yes, do, please; tell him at once.
#VIRGINIE.
Very well. Put down the pail; I don’t want it. Here, take this broom. Not like that! You’d better sit down again. Hi, what are you doing? You’re sitting on the wreaths!
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I beg your pardon. I’m a little short - sighted.
#VIRGINIE.
Clumsy! They’re a pretty sight now! And what Monsieur Gustave will say when he sees those two wreaths!... Thank goodness, they’re not so bad after all! We can put them right. Sit down over there; take them on your knees; and keep quite quiet. I have a favour to ask you.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Speak, don’t be afraid.
#VIRGINIE.
Give me your blessing, while we are by ourselves. When the company comes out, I shall be sent away; and I sha’n’t see you any more. Give me your blessing for myself alone. I am old and need it badly.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I bless you, my daughter, for you are good, simple of heart and mind, faultless, fearless, guileless in the presence of the great mysteries and faithful in the performance of your little duties. Go in peace, my child. Go and tell your masters....
#GUSTAVE.
What’s all this? Who are you? What do you want?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I am Saint Anthony.
#GUSTAVE.
Are you mad?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Of Padua.
#GUSTAVE.
What sort of joke is this? I am in no mood for laughing. Have you been drinking? Come, what are you here for? What do you want?...
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I want to raise your aunt from the dead.
#GUSTAVE.
What? Raise my aunt from the dead? He’s drunk. Why did you let him in? Look here, my man, be sensible: we have no time for jesting. My aunt is to be buried to - day; you can call again to - morrow. Here. Here’s a trifle for you.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I must raise her from the dead to - day.
#GUSTAVE.
All right, presently, after the ceremony! Come, here’s the door.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I shall not leave until I have brought her back to life.
#GUSTAVE.
Look here, I’ve had enough of this! You’re getting tiresome! My guests are waiting for me. Here’s the door. Look sharp, please!
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I shall not leave until I have brought her back to life.
#GUSTAVE.
Oh, won’t you? We’ll see about that. Joseph!
#JOSEPH.
Yes, sir?
#GUSTAVE.
What’s that?
#JOSEPH.
The partridges, sir.
#GUSTAVE.
Give the dish to Virginie and turn this drunken fellow out of doors. And be quick about it.
#JOSEPH.
Very good, sir. Come on, old fellow, didn’t you hear? It’s all very well getting tight; you’ve got to pull yourself together now. Come on! Get out of this! You’d better come quietly, or you’ll regret it: I can be pretty rough when I like. You won’t? You just wait! Open the door, Virginie....
#GUSTAVE.
Wait, I’ll open it.
#JOSEPH.
That’s it; we’ll soon get rid of him now. I’m going to show you what’s what. Sir!
#GUSTAVE.
What’s the matter?
#JOSEPH.
I don’t know, sir. He seems fixed. I can’t get him to budge.
#GUSTAVE.
I’ll help you. Well, upon my soul! He’s dangerous. Be careful. He has the strength of a Hercules. Let’s try being gentle with him. Listen to me, my friend. You understand, don’t you, that, on a day like this, when we’re burying my aunt, my poor dear aunt....
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I have come to raise her from the dead....
#GUSTAVE.
But you understand, surely, that this is not the moment.... The partridges are getting cold, the guests are waiting. Besides we are not in the mood for laughing.
#ACHILLE.
What’s the matter, Gustave? What’s up? We’re waiting for the partridges.
#GUSTAVE.
Our friend here refuses to go away.
#ACHILLE.
Is he boozed?
#GUSTAVE.
Well, of course.
#ACHILLE.
Kick him out and have done with it. I don’t see why our good luncheon should be spoilt for the sake of a dirty drunkard.
#GUSTAVE.
He won’t go.
#ACHILLE.
What’s that? Won’t go? We’ll soon see about that!...
#GUSTAVE.
All right, you try.
#ACHILLE.
I’m not going to tackle a dirty tramp like him. But there’s Joseph, there’s the coachman.
#GUSTAVE.
We have tried; it’s no use; and, short of employing absolute violence....
#A GUEST.
What’s it all about?
#ANOTHER.
What are you doing, Gustave?
#ANOTHER.
What does the fellow want?
#ANOTHER.
Where has he sprung from?
#GUSTAVE.
He won’t go away. It’s another of Virginie’s blunders. As soon as she catches sight of a beggar, she loses her head. It’s really too silly. She let this madman in; and he insists on seeing Aunt Hortense and raising her from the dead.
#A GUEST.
You should send for the police. Why don’t you?
#GUSTAVE.
No, no; no scandal! I don’t want the police in the house on a day like this.
#ACHILLE.
Gustave.
#GUSTAVE.
Well?
#ACHILLE.
Have you noticed that two or three of the flags are cracked, over there on the left, at the end of the hall?
#GUSTAVE.
Yes, I know. It doesn’t matter; I’m going to have a mosaic floor to take the place of the flags.
#ACHILLE.
That’ll look more cheerful....
#GUSTAVE.
And, better still, more modern. Instead of that door, with the lace curtains, I thought of having a painted window illustrating Hunting, Industry and Progress, with a garland of fruit and game.
#ACHILLE.
Yes, that will be very nice.
#GUSTAVE.
As for my office, I intend to have it in there , with the clerks’ office opposite.
#ACHILLE.
When shall you move in? few days after the funeral. It would not do to come in the very next day.
#ACHILLE.
No. But meanwhile we must get rid of this chap.
#GUSTAVE.
He’s made himself quite at home.
#ACHILLE.
Won’t you have a chair?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
No, thank you. I’m not tired.
#ACHILLE.
Leave him to me. I’ll soon dispose of him. Come, my friend, tell us who you are.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I am Saint Anthony.
#ACHILLE.
Yes, yes, you’re right. He sticks to it, but he’s quite harmless. And here’s the Rector; he knows you, and wants to pay you his respects. Saints are your business, Father: I know more about ploughs and traction - engines. Here’s an emissary from heaven, Father, great Saint Anthony in person, who would like a word with you. We want to get him quietly to the door, without letting him know. Once he is outside, good - bye.
#THE RECTOR.
Great Saint Anthony, your humble servant bids you welcome to this world, which you have deigned to honour with your celestial presence. What does your Holiness wish?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
To raise Mademoiselle Hortense from the dead.
#THE RECTOR.
It’s true that she’s dead, poor lady! Well, the miracle should present no difficulty to the greatest of our saints. The dear departed had a particular devotion to you. I will take you to her, if your Holiness will be good enough to come with me. This way, please.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
No, that way, in there....
#THE RECTOR.
Your Holiness will pardon me if I venture to contradict you, but the corpse, because of the influx of visitors, has been removed to the house opposite, which, I may mention, also belonged to the dear departed.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
She is in there.
#THE RECTOR.
Let me beg your Holiness, in order to convince yourself to the contrary, to accompany me for a moment into the street, where you will see the candles and the black hangings....
#SAINT ANTHONY.
That is where I shall go.
#A GUEST.
Did you ever hear any one like him?
#GUSTAVE.
He’s going a trifle too far.
#A GUEST.
Let us open the door and all of us push him out together.
#GUSTAVE.
No, no; no scene! He might lose his temper. He’s very dangerous; he’s enormously strong. Keep your hands off him. Joseph and I, who are no weaklings, either of us, couldn’t make him move an inch. It’s funny, but he seems rooted to the soil.
#ACHILLE.
But who told him that the corpse was in there?
#GUSTAVE.
Virginie, of course; she’s been babbling for all she’s worth.
#VIRGINIE.
Me, sir? Excuse me, sir, not me; I was attending to my work. I answered yes and no, nothing else.... Didn’t I, Saint Anthony? Well, can’t you answer when you’re asked a civil question?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
She did not tell me.
#VIRGINIE.
There, you see! He’s a saint; he knew it all beforehand. I tell you, there’s nothing he doesn’t know.
#ACHILLE.
Now then, my fine fellow, come on; put your best foot forward, what!
#THE GUESTS.
Will he go, or won’t he?
#ACHILLE.
I have an idea.
#GUSTAVE.
What’s that?
#ACHILLE.
Where’s the doctor?
#A GUEST.
He’s still at table; he’s finishing up the trout....
#GUSTAVE.
Go and fetch him. You’re right, he’s a madman; it’s the doctor’s business.
#THE DOCTOR.
What’s up? Is he mad? Is he ill? Is he drunk? Why, it’s a beggar! I’m of no use in his case. Well, my friend, are things going badly? Is there something we want?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I want to raise Mademoiselle Hortense from the dead.
#THE DOCTOR.
Ah, I see you’re not a medical man! May I have your hand? Any pain?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
No.
#THE DOCTOR.
And here? Does it hurt when I press my finger?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
No.
#THE DOCTOR.
Excellent, excellent! Do you ever feel giddy?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Never.
#THE DOCTOR.
And in the past ... no accident, at any time? Let’s have a look at your chest. Say “Ah!” That’s right. Once more; deep breath. Deeper, deeper. That’s right.... And what is it you want, my man?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
To go into that room.
#THE DOCTOR.
What for?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
To raise Mademoiselle Hortense from the dead.
#THE DOCTOR.
She’s not there.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
She is there. I see her.
#GUSTAVE.
He sticks to it.
#ACHILLE.
Couldn’t you give him a hypodermic injection?
#THE DOCTOR.
What for?
#ACHILLE.
To send him to sleep. Then we would put him in the street.
#THE DOCTOR.
No, no; no nonsense. Besides, it’s dangerous.
#ACHILLE.
That’s his look out, not ours. We’re not paid to take care of madmen, tramps or drunkards.
#THE DOCTOR.
Shall I give you my opinion?
#GUSTAVE.
I wish you would.
#THE DOCTOR.
We have to do with a madman, a rather feeble - minded and quite harmless monomaniac, who may become dangerous, however, if we thwart him. I know the type.... We are among ourselves; moreover, strange though the experiment which he proposes may seem, it involves no lack of respect for the dear departed.... That being so, I don’t see why, in order to avoid any scandal and since he’s asking such a simple thing, we shouldn’t allow him to go into the room for a moment.
#GUSTAVE.
Never! What’s the world coming to, if the first person that comes along can force his way like this into a respectable household, under the ridiculous pretext of bringing back to life a dead woman who has never done him any harm?
#THE DOCTOR.
As you please; it’s for you to decide. On the one hand, you have an inevitable scandal, for nothing will make him give up his idea; on the other, a small concession which costs you nothing.
#ACHILLE.
The doctor’s right....
#THE DOCTOR.
There’s nothing to be afraid of. I’ll take the whole responsibility. Besides, we shall all be there and we shall go in with him.
#GUSTAVE.
Very well, then, let’s have done with it.... But, whatever happens, don’t let this ludicrous incident get about, will you?
#ACHILLE.
Aunt Hortense’s jewels are put out on the mantelpiece....
#GUSTAVE.
I know. I’ll keep an eye on them, for I confess that I don’t trust him. It’s this way, come in. But be quick about it; we haven’t lunched yet.
#GUSTAVE.
Here is the body of the dear departed. As you see, she’s quite dead. Are you satisfied?... And now leave us. Let us cut short the experiment. Show the gentleman out by the garden - door.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Allow me. Arise!
#GUSTAVE.
There, that’ll do! We can’t stand by and allow a stranger to outrage our most sacred feelings; and I ask you once more, for the last time....
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Allow me, please! Arise!
#GUSTAVE.
That’s enough! We’ll end by quarrelling.... Come, this way: the door’s over here.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Allow me!... She is very far away. Mademoiselle Hortense, return and arise from the dead.
#VIRGINIE.
Mademoiselle Hortense! She’s alive! Look, she’s scratching at a bit of candle - grease; she’s feeling for her glasses.... Here they are! Here they are!... Saint Anthony! Saint Anthony!... A miracle! A miracle!... On your knees! On your knees!
#GUSTAVE.
Come, come, be still!... Don’t talk nonsense!... This is no time for....
#ACHILLE.
There’s no denying it, she’s alive.
#A GUEST.
But it’s not possible! What has he done to her?
#GUSTAVE.
You can’t take it seriously. She’ll have a relapse.
#ACHILLE.
No, no, I assure you. Just see how she’s staring at us.
#GUSTAVE.
I don’t believe it yet. What are we coming to? Where are the laws of nature? Doctor, what do you say?
#THE DOCTOR.
What do I say? What would you have me say? It doesn’t concern me, it’s not my business. It’s absurd and, at the same time, quite simple. If she’s alive, then she was never dead. There’s no reason to be amazed and proclaim a miracle.
#GUSTAVE.
But you yourself said....
#THE DOCTOR.
I said, I said.... To begin with, I said nothing positive; and I would have you observe that I have not signed the death - certificate. I even had very serious doubts, but I would not tell you of them, lest I should raise false hopes.... In any case, all this proves nothing; and it is very unlikely that she will live long.
#ACHILLE.
Meanwhile we must accept the evidence, the happy evidence, of our senses.
#VIRGINIE.
Yes, yes, we must believe it! There’s not a doubt left! I told you he was a saint, a great saint! Just look at her! She’s alive and as fresh as a rose in June!
#GUSTAVE.
Aunt, my dear aunt, is it really you?
#ACHILLE.
Do you know me, aunt? I am Achille, your nephew, Achille. And me, auntie? I am your old niece Léontine.
#VALENTINE.
And me, my dear godmother, do you know me? I am little Valentine, to whom you left all your silver.
#GUSTAVE.
She’s smiling.
#ACHILLE.
Not at all, she looks displeased.
#GUSTAVE.
But she recognizes us all.
#ACHILLE.
Listen! She’s going to speak.
#VIRGINIE.
Heavenly Father!... And she has seen God!... She’ll tell us about the delights of Paradise!... On your knees! On your knees!
#ACHILLE.
Listen! Listen!
#MADEMOISELLE HORTENSE.
Who is this person? Who has dared to let a bare - footed tramp into my drawing - room? He’s dirtied all the carpets as it is!... Put him out at once!... Virginie, how often have I told you not to let beggars....
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Silence!
#GUSTAVE.
You must forgive her, she does not yet know how much she owes you. But we, we know. There’s no question but that what you have done was more than most people could have done. It may have been an accident or ... something else; upon my word, I don’t know. But what I do know is that I am proud and happy to shake you by the hand.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I should like to go, please. I have work to do.
#GUSTAVE.
Oh, don’t be in such a hurry! We can’t let you go like this. You shall not leave empty - handed. I don’t know what my aunt will give you: that’s her affair: I cannot promise anything in her name. But, for my part, I will consult my brother - in - law; and, whether it be a coincidence or ... something else, we will pay for the coincidence without quibbling about the amount; and you shall have no reason to regret what you have done. That’s so, Achille, isn’t it?
#ACHILLE.
Certainly, you will not regret it, on the contrary.
#GUSTAVE.
We are not tremendously well off; we have wives and children and we have had our disappointments; but, after all, we know how to recognize a kindness; and, if it were only for the honour of the family, it would never do to have it said that a stranger, however poor, came and did us a service without receiving a reward, a decent reward, the best reward that in us lies, a reward in proportion to our means, which, I repeat, are limited.... Oh, I know, there are services which nothing can repay and which are not paid for: you need not tell me that! I know it, I know it: don’t interrupt me. But that’s no reason why we should not do something.... Come, what do you think we owe you? Name your own figure. Of course, you must not ask for anything excessive; we couldn’t give it you; but whatever seems reasonable you shall have.
#ACHILLE.
My brother - in - law is right: but, while the matter is arranging, I propose to make a little collection among ourselves. That won’t prejudice you in any way and will keep you going for a time.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I want to go away, please. I have other work to do.
#GUSTAVE.
Other work to do! Other work to do! What work can you have to do?... No, I can’t have that; and it’s not nice of you to suggest it. What would people say if they heard that we let you go like this after restoring the dear departed to us? If you won’t take money—and I understand your delicacy of feeling and approve of it—at least you will do us the pleasure of accepting a little keepsake? Oh, don’t be afraid: just a trifle, a cigar - holder, or a tie - pin, or a meerschaum pipe. I could have your name and address and the date engraved on it.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
No, thank you. I can accept nothing.
#GUSTAVE.
Do you mean that?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I do.
#ACHILLE.
At any rate, you will do us the pleasure of smoking a cigar with us. You can’t refuse that.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Thank you, I do not smoke.
#GUSTAVE.
You’re most discouraging. Still, what would you like? You must have a wish of some sort. You have only to speak, for everything is yours in this house, which you have filled with gladness. It’s all yours. I can’t say more than that. At least, all that one can honestly part with.... Why, it’s an insult to leave us like this!
#ACHILLE.
Look here, I have an idea that’s not half bad. As our friend won’t accept anything—and, like my brother - in - law, I understand his delicacy, of which, I am sure, we all approve; for life can’t be paid for and has no price—well, since he has shown a disinterested nature which at once makes him our equal, what I want to know is this: why should he not do us the honour of sitting down with us and helping us finish a luncheon which he has so happily interrupted!... What do you all say?...
#GUSTAVE.
That’s it! The very thing! That settles everything! How clever of you to think of it!... Well, what do you say?... By squeezing a bit, we can easily make room for you. You shall have the seat of honour. The partridges will be cold, but no matter: you have a good appetite, I feel sure!... Well, that’s arranged, eh? There will be no ceremony: we’re decent people and easy - going, as you see....
#SAINT ANTHONY.
No, really. You must excuse me. I’m sorry, I can’t. I’m expected elsewhere.
#GUSTAVE.
Oh, come, you can’t refuse us this! Besides, who’s expecting you?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Another corpse. corpse! Another corpse! It won’t run away! Surely you’re not going to put a corpse before us! To throw us over for a corpse!
#ACHILLE.
No, I see what it is. You would rather go down to the kitchen, wouldn’t you? You’d feel more comfortable there.
#GUSTAVE.
Then he can come up afterwards for coffee.
#ACHILLE.
Ah, he’s not refusing! He prefers that! I understand. Virginie, leave your mistress—she doesn’t need you now—and take the gentleman down to your kitchen. Give him some of everything. Ha, ha! You and Virginie are going to have a jolly good time together! I guessed right, didn’t I, you old rogue you! You old sly - boots!
#VIRGINIE.
Sir!
#GUSTAVE.
What is it?
#VIRGINIE.
I don’t know, but Mademoiselle Hortense has lost her speech again.
#GUSTAVE.
What? She’s lost her speech?
#VIRGINIE.
Yes, sir, look.... She’s opening her mouth and moving her lips and working her hands but her voice has gone.
#GUSTAVE.
What is it, aunt? Is there something you want to tell us? And you can’t? There, there, make an effort; it’s a temporary paralysis, that’s all. It will soon pass. What’s the matter with you? What do want? What’s the meaning of this?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
She will never speak again.
#GUSTAVE.
She will never speak again? But she has been speaking. You heard her. She even gave you a piece of her mind.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
It was an oversight on my part. She won’t have her voice again.
#GUSTAVE.
Can’t you restore it to her?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
No.
#GUSTAVE.
And when will it come back?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Never.
#GUSTAVE.
What! Will she remain dumb to the end of her days?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Yes.
#GUSTAVE.
Why?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
She has beheld mysteries which she may not reveal.
#GUSTAVE.
Mysteries? What mysteries?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
The mysteries of the dead.
#GUSTAVE.
The mysteries of the dead? This is a fresh joke. What do you take us for? No, no, my lad, this won’t do! She spoke; we all heard her; we have witnesses. You have, of malice prepense, deprived her of her power of speech, with an object which I am beginning to see through. You’ll just restore it at once, or....
#ACHILLE.
It was really not worth while bringing her back to life, to give her to us in this condition.
#GUSTAVE.
If you could not give her back to us as she was before your stupid and clumsy interference, you would have done better not to have meddled.
#ACHILLE.
It was a bad action.
#GUSTAVE.
An abuse of confidence.
#ACHILLE.
An abuse of confidence: that’s what it was. There is no excuse for it.
#GUSTAVE.
You’re expecting to blackmail us, perhaps?
#ACHILLE.
I suppose you think you’re dealing with a pack of fools?
#GUSTAVE.
Who asked you to come? I hate saying it, but I would rather see her dead than have her back in this state. It’s too cruel, too painful for those who love her. You can’t come like this, under the pretence of working a miracle, and disturb the peace of the people who have done you no harm, bringing unhappiness upon them! A nice thing. But he laughs best who laughs last!
#THE DOCTOR.
Allow me. Calm yourselves. The man has done wrong, there’s no doubt of that; but we must not blame him: he is probably unaccountable for his actions. Just let me examine your eyes, my friend. That’s it: I knew it! I would not interfere while everybody was thanking him, much too cordially, for the miraculous resurrection which he had wrought. I did not wish to appear to meddle with what does not concern me. I knew what was what; and you see, as I do, that she was not dead at all. There is nothing supernatural or mysterious about all this. It simply means that the fellow possesses rather unusual hypnotic powers; and he has abused them, in order to indulge in a hoax which may be self - interested and which, in any case, is out of place. He came at the right moment, that is all; and it is highly probable that, had he not been here, you and I would have worked the miracle, if miracle there be.
#GUSTAVE.
Well, what are we to do?
#THE DOCTOR.
Why, prevent him from doing further mischief by having him locked up! The man’s dangerous!
#GUSTAVE.
You’re right; we must put a stop to this; besides, I’ve had enough of it.... Joseph!
#JOSEPH.
Sir?
#GUSTAVE.
Run to the police - station at the corner; fetch two policemen; tell them to bring a pair of handcuffs with them. He’s a dangerous fellow and capable of everything, as he has shown us only too plainly.
#JOSEPH.
Very well, sir.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I beg leave to withdraw.
#GUSTAVE.
That’s right, old chap, play the innocent. It’s time you did. Yes, you can withdraw; and with a first - class escort. You just wait and see.
#THE SERGEANT.
Is this the criminal?
#GUSTAVE.
That’s the man.
#THE SERGEANT.
Where are your papers?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
What papers?
#POLICEMAN.
You haven’t any? I knew it. What’s your name?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Saint Anthony.
#THE SERGEANT.
Saint what? Saint Anthony? That’s no name for a Christian. I want the other, your real name.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I have no other.
#THE SERGEANT.
Keep a civil tongue in your head, will you? Where did you steal that dressing - gown?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I didn’t steal it. It’s mine.
#THE SERGEANT.
Then it’s I who am lying? Is that what you mean? Say it; don’t mind me!
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I don’t know. I think.... Perhaps you are mistaken.
#THE SERGEANT.
I’m making a note of your impertinent observations.... Where do you hail from?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
From Padua.
#THE SERGEANT.
Padua? Where’s that? What department?
#GUSTAVE.
It’s in Italy.
#THE SERGEANT.
I know, I know. I wanted to make him say it. So you’re an Italian. I thought as much. Where did you last come from?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
From Paradise.
#THE SERGEANT.
What Paradise? Where is that land of malefactors?
#SAINT ANTHONY.
It is the place to which the souls of those who have died in the Lord ascend after their death.
#THE SERGEANT.
I see, I see, I understand! You’re coming the artful over me! You’re pulling my leg! First you’re impudent and now you’re being clever! Very well, your case is quite clear: we’ll soon settle it.... Let’s hear what he has done. What has he stolen?
#GUSTAVE.
I can’t yet say for certain that he has stolen anything; I haven’t had time to take stock of things; and I don’t like to accuse him without being sure. We must be just before all things. But he has done something more serious.
#THE SERGEANT.
I never doubted it.
#GUSTAVE.
You know the loss which we have suffered. While we were mourning the dear departed and finishing our lunch, he made his way into the house under some pretext or other, with intentions which you can easily guess. He took advantage of the maid’s simplicity and credulousness to have the door opened of the room where the body was laid out. He obviously hoped to turn our disorder and grief to account in order to fish in troubled waters and make a haul. He may have learnt through an accomplice that our aunt’s jewels and silver were put out on the mantelpiece. Unfortunately for him, our aunt was not dead. And, suddenly, seeing this repellent figure in her room, she woke up, cried out and spoke to him roundly and pluckily. Then, to take revenge for his discomfiture, I don’t know how—the doctor will explain—he deprived her of the use of her speech; and, notwithstanding our entreaties, he refuses to restore it to her, naturally hoping to make us pay through the nose. Mind you, I am making no accusations; I am simply stating the facts. As for the rest, you can ask the doctor.
#THE DOCTOR.
I will furnish all the necessary explanations before the Commissary; if he wishes it, I will draw up a report.
#ACHILLE.
Meanwhile, there’s no mistake about it: he’s either a criminal or a madman, perhaps both. In any case, he’s a dangerous person who must absolutely be locked up.
#THE SERGEANT.
That’s quite clear. We’ll get rid of him for you. Rabutteau!
#POLICEMAN.
Yes, Sergeant.
#THE SERGEANT.
The handcuffs.
#GUSTAVE.
Sergeant, it was very good of you and your mate to come round. Before leaving us, you must do us the pleasure of taking a glass of something with us.
#THE SERGEANT.
We won’t say no to that, eh, Rabutteau? Especially as the prisoner looks like a tough customer.
#GUSTAVE.
Joseph, bring a bottle and some glasses. We will all drink to my aunt’s recovery.
#THE SERGEANT.
It’ll do us no harm in this weather.
#GUSTAVE.
Is it still raining?
#THE SERGEANT.
In torrents. I’ve only come the length of the street; look at my cape.
#POLICEMAN.
You can’t tell if it’s raining or snowing, but it’s worse than either.
#THE SERGEANT.
Ladies and gentlemen, your very good health!
#GUSTAVE.
Sergeant, your health! Have another?
#THE SERGEANT.
I don’t mind. That’s good wine, that is!
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I’m thirsty. I should like a glass of water.
#THE SERGEANT.
A glass of water! D’ye hear him? You shall have some water, my lad; you wait till we’re outside; it’ll come pouring into your mouth.... Come, we’ve hung around long enough.... Rabutteau, the handcuffs; and you, put out your hands....
#SAINT ANTHONY.
But I haven’t....
#THE SERGEANT.
What! Resistance and protests! That’s the last straw! They’re all alike! ring at the bell! What’s the time? Perhaps it’s the first guests.
#ACHILLE.
Hardly. It’s not three yet. Hallo, it’s Monsieur Mitrou, the Commissary of Police!
#THE COMMISSARY.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I heard... Why, I thought as much: it’s Saint Anthony himself, the great Saint Anthony of Padua!...
#GUSTAVE.
You know him, then?
#THE COMMISSARY.
Know him? I should think I did know him! It’s the third time that he’s escaped.... You know, he’s a little.... And at each escape he does the same tricks: he cures the sick, heals cripples, practises medicine without a license—in short, commits a number of illegal actions.... Yes, it’s he.... Or at least.... But he has changed a good deal since his last escapade.... Anyway, if it’s not he, it must be his brother.... There’s something that’s not quite clear to me. We’ll look into it at the police - station. Come along, I’m in a hurry; come along, lads, quick, to the station, to the station!
#GUSTAVE.
Better let him out this way, through the garden; it’ll attract less notice.
#ACHILLE.
Brrr, what weather! It’s raining, snowing, hailing!
#VIRGINIE.
But, sir, the poor man!... Look, he’s bare - footed!
#GUSTAVE.
Well, what of it? Do you want us to send for a carriage? Or a shrine, perhaps?
#VIRGINIE.
No, I’ll lend him my sabots. Take them, Saint Anthony; I have another pair.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
Thank you.
#VIRGINIE.
And are you putting nothing on your head? You’ll catch cold.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
I haven’t anything.
#VIRGINIE.
Take my little shawl. I’ll run and fetch you my umbrella.
#ACHILLE.
The old fool.
#GUSTAVE.
This is all very well, but meanwhile we’re standing in the devil of a draught.... Come, take him to the station and let’s have an end of this.
#VIRGINIE.
Here’s my umbrella.
#SAINT ANTHONY.
They’ve fastened my hands.
#VIRGINIE.
I’ll hold it for you.
#GUSTAVE.
At last! good riddance to bad rubbish!
#GUSTAVE.
Well, aunt?
#ACHILLE.
What’s the matter with her? She’s sinking, she’s falling back on the bed!
#THE DOCTOR.
I don’t know.... I’m afraid....
#GUSTAVE.
Aunt, aunt!... Well?
#THE DOCTOR.
This time she is really dead. I told you so.
#GUSTAVE.
Impossible!
#ACHILLE.
But, doctor, look here! Is there nothing to be done?
#THE DOCTOR.
Nothing at all, I fear.
#GUSTAVE.
What a day!...
#ACHILLE.
Hark to the storm!...
#GUSTAVE.
After all, we were a little unkind to the poor beggar. If you come to think of it, he really did us no harm!
