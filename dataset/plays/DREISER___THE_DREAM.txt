#SYPHERS.
Well, I turn off here. That was an interesting discussion we had, eh? The fact is, Mitchell, as I told you the other day, I have passed out of my old materialistic point of view to a certain extent - not entirely - but now I see more order in things than I once did - a necessary if mechanistic order. It seems more or less inescapable to me, doesn’t it to you?
#MITCHELL.
Well, yes, I might say - only - of course -
#BARRETT.
I do not see how any one can doubt law. Everything obeys law of one kind and another.
#SYPHERS.
Quite so! Quite so! Law, of course. Everything obeys a law or laws of one kind and another. Nevertheless, there are so many confusing contradictions. Laws seem to conflict at times, don’t you think, even in chemical and sidereal space. You don’t deny that, do you?
#BARRETT.
Still, more knowledge might prove them to be anything but contradictory.
#SYPHERS.
Well, I admit that, too. Only I was merely suggesting that I see more definite order than I once did. A few years ago I could see nothing but disorder, chaos, the inexplicable clashing of forces. Of late I am not so sure. This matter of orthogenesis now; it appeals to me very much as demonstrating an intellectual if not a spiritual order, some great controlling force somewhere. I seem to see a definite tendency to order in things. Life has certainly built itself up through the ages in a very intelligent way indeed, don’t you think?
#BARRETT.
Ye - es, of course, only there have been many errors and conflicts there too - sudden stoppage of plans in various directions.
#MITCHELL.
True, as I was about to point out.
#SYPHERS.
I admit that. I admit that. What I am getting at is this: all life, as we know it, is based on the cell - cell origination, cell multiplication, cell arrangement. That is an old story. Now here is something which is my own idea - it’s a mere theory, of course - that the whole thing may have been originated, somehow, somewhere else, worked out beforehand, as it were, in the brain of something or somebody and is now being orthogenetically or chemically directed from somewhere, being thrown on a screen, as it were, like a moving - picture, and we mere dot pictures, mere cell - built - up pictures, like the movies, only we are telegraphed or telautographed from somewhere else, like those dot pictures that are now made electrically, built up dot by dot, millions of them coming rapidly by wireless or wire and being thrown on a screen of some kind - ether, the elements - you know what I mean. You have seen the telautograph pictures I mean, of course?
#BARRETT.
Yes, of course. Very ingenious. Very ingenious. But how do you prove the origination of the cell in the fashion that you want?
#MITCHELL.
A rather slow movie, I should say, considering the length of time it has taken to build it up.
#SYPHERS.
Well, in this way - it has its drawbacks, of course; you remember the experiments of that Irish scientist Burke, don’t you? He generated what he called a radiobe - a single cell in a plasm culture which he had hermetically sealed and which he kept under the influence of radium. I do not recall the exact facts of the case at the moment, and I do not believe that his deductions have since been accepted, but that is neither here nor there. That idea of his illustrates mine very well. If we could prove that one cell, one radiobe, had been or could be originated or generated by an outside influence of this kind - radium, if you wish, in a plasm of that kind - we would have to admit that the whole thing might be built up in some such fashion. Why, you could base a new philosophy on that, Mitchell. One radiobe generated in a plasm culture under radium or something else, some autogenetic force manifesting itself through a thing like radium, and there you are. After that you would have to grant the possibility of millions and billions of cells coming in that fashion, whole nations constructed of cells, as they have been.
#MITCHELL.
My dear Syphers!
#BARRETT.
There was some hitch in that experiment, however. The chain wasn’t quite complete.
#SYPHERS.
I know - I know. I grant you that. All I’m insisting on is that if one cell, one radiobe, say, can be generated by a synthesis of energy, why not millions? And if millions, why not billions, the whole human family, in short, since we are a synthesis of cells - this whole visible scene in all its details? I know it sounds wild, but I have heard you yourself say that you thought it might be possible that we were all a part of some invisible psychic body, force body, in the mechanism of which we function in some way, just as the cells do in ours.
#MITCHELL.
Yes, I have said as much.
#SYPHERS.
Well, then, why may not my theory be true?
#BARRETT.
May? May? Of course it may. But how are you going to prove it? I myself have suggested that Mitchell’s larger psychic body, as he calls it, may be nothing more than a fetus, a secondary creature being built in the womb of a still larger organism, but what of it? All of us, everything that we see here, may be nothing more than parts of organs that are being constructed in some huge womb. This so - called higher psychic body may not even be complete yet, not ready to be born in its realm. But how do we know? There’s nothing to prove it.
#SYPHERS.
Just the same, if I had a few hundred thousand dollars I would enlarge my laboratory and pursue this subject. I believe that something may be discovered. I believe that I could prove it in the course of time. Why, snow crystals, tree and flower forms, everything, gives us a hint, sometimes instantaneously. Why do snow crystals assume almost instantaneously and out of nothing their beautiful forms? The controlling impulse is certainly artistic, isn’t it, and outside of anything we know? Well, good night. Glad to see you two at the meeting to - night. It was interesting, wasn’t it?
#BARRETT.
Very. He’s a terrible bore.
#MITCHELL.
Delightful. I’m glad he’s done.
#SYPHERS.
Dolts! Fogies! That’s always the way, dull and cautious.
#BARRETT.
An ingenious theory, but dangerously speculative. He ought to read Stromeyer on “Impulse.”
#MITCHELL.
I often wonder about his work and just how sound he is.
#SYPHERS.
A great idea. I’m sure of it. Along this line is coming a scientific revolution. If I had enough radium and stromium, why - but they cost so much. Life is really a dream. We are all an emanation, a shadow, a moving picture cast on a screen of ether. I’m sure of it.

There goes that blamed machine again “Professor George Paul Syphers, 621 West 115th Street, New York City. Your uncle, Edward Fillmore, died at eleven to - night. By the terms of his will you are the sole heir to the bulk of his fortune, three hundred thousand dollars. Come at once. A. J. Larywind, Counsellor,” I wish someone would leave me three thousand cents. Here, Patsy. Take this up to 115th Street.
#PATSY LAFERTY.
Sure, it’s just de night to keep busy. It’s goin’ to rain, an’ it’s me late watch. Oh, well, dere’s nuttin’ like bein’ poor an’ honest.
#SYPHERS.
The curious thing is: why should any dominant force outside this seeming life wish to create it - the smallness, the pettiness, the suffering? I must write a book about that. Here I am - It’s going to rain, I do believe. There, it’s thundering already.
#PATSY LAFERTY.
It’s funny, dese mokes wot git messages at one in de mornin’. I’ll lay a even bet I don’t git nuttin’, neider. If you’d come wit a million dollars after twelve o’clock dere’s guys wot’d git sore.
#SYPHERS.
I must try to find the psychic impulse which originates and directs the cell. That is the great thing. We’re all shadows, I say, shadows - adumbrations - impalpable nothings - rumors - dreams. If our ills become too great we might be able to wake up or drive them away by thinking of this. It may be that that’s what we do when we die - wake up. But that’s Christian Science, isn’t it? Bah!
#PATSY LAFERTY.
A fine night, dis. An’ he won’t be in. Dat’s my luck.
#SYPHERS.
Radiobes! Radiobes! Flying radiobes as big as houses - monsters -
#SYPHERS.
War! And fighting men! That is a machine gun. Now I am in real danger. How did I come here, anyhow?
#PATSY LAFERTY.
Wot a swell night! Wot a swell night! Now it’s startin’ to pour an’ I’ll have to stand here aw’ile, I guess. Holy Cripes, dem drops is as big as marbles!
#THE PROFESSOR.
Ah, the horror of war! What was I thinking? - ah, yes! If one had some method of waking up. Then there would be no more war, no horrors. It is entirely possible, now that we know this existence of ours is a dream. I may be dreaming now - who knows? If so, I could wake up and all my ills would vanish - or would they? How horrible this is!
#PATSY LAFERTY.
T - r - r - r! T - r - r - r - r! T - r - r - r - r - r! Wot’s de matter wit dis bell? W’y don’t de guy answer?
#THE PROFESSOR.
War! War! How terrible! How did I come here? How does there happen to be war? Those are fighting men over there! They are killing each other! Horrors! But the great thing is to escape. That fire is dreadful. It means death.
#PATSY LAFERTY.
Well, dis is some sleeper, all right. Or else dere ain’t nobody home. I’ll kick, I will. Come to! I ain’t supposed to stand here all night.
#SYPHERS.
And here comes a file of soldiers - I hear them tramping - a great company. Merciful heavens, they see me!
#THE FILE OF DREAM SOLDIERS.
Halt!
#THE PROFESSOR.
Great God! I haven’t a place to hide! Oh, Lord, what shall I do? As I live, here is a stone hut among thick trees! I’ll hide in it. Perhaps they won’t see me.
#A SCORE OF DREAM SOLDIERS.
Knock! Knock! Knock!
#PATSY LAFERTY.
Knock! Knock! Knock! Gee, wot a night! Dese raindrops look like spits. An’ dat lightning! Dat last one looked like a telegraph pole standin’ straight in de air!
#SYPHERS.
Oh, Lord! My life is worth nothing! Here I lie hiding in an empty stone hut, and those men at the door want my life. What is life? A dream! A dream! - but, oh, such a precious dream! I would not want to disappear - not yet! No, no! I would not want to wake up. I don’t want to die - not yet. Not yet!
#FIRST DREAM SOLDIER.
We’ll easily get him out of there. Can’t you see him lying there, close by the wall? Bring a battering ram. No, bring a cannon. We’ll blow him out. He thinks we can’t get him, but we can.
#THE PROFESSOR.
Ah, if I could only escape! I was thinking a while ago that life was a shadow of something else, an adumbration, a thing built up point by point like the dots of a telautographed picture. Now if that were so I could get out of here. It would be a dream. I could wake. I could cry “Avaunt!” I could stir and it would all disappear and become as nothing. But here! Here -
#THE CAPTAIN OF THE DREAM SOLDIERS.
Position! Load! Fire!
#PATSY LAFERTY.
Gee, dat las’ crack was a bold! If he kin sleep troo dat he soitenly won’t hear me - or maybe he ain’t home. Well, I might as well stand here. I can’t go back in dis.
#THE PROFESSOR.
Help! Help! Oh, save me! Save me!
#FIRST DREAM OFFICER.
Once, more, men! Another shell here! Fire!
#THE CANNON.
Poof! Boom!
#PATSY LAFERTY.
I don’t know wedder I’d better stay here. I don’t wanna get killed.
#THE PROFESSOR.
I am lost! I know it. Oh, if my idea were only true! What if all this turmoil and agony were a figment of the mind merely, a cell or dot picture? Here I am in this hut; these soldiers are about to destroy me. If I could just cry “Avaunt!” “Disappear!” - or if I could know that I am not real, and disappear myself. I wonder if I might not try it?
#A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.
Click - Sssssss!
#A CLAP OF REAL THUNDER.
Boom - !
#THE PROFESSOR.
I defy you! Do your worst! You’re not real! I’m not real! This whole thing is a dream! I’m a dream, or I’m dreaming! I defy you!
#FIRST DREAM SOLDIER.
Is that so? You defy me, do you? I’ll show you whether I’m real or not.
#SECOND DREAM SOLDIER.
Yes, kill him. That’s the way!
#THE PROFESSOR.
Wait a moment! Don’t! I - I’m not sure!
#FIRST DREAM SOLDIER.
But I will, just the same. You say I’m not real? I’ll show you whether I am or not! How does that feel?
#THE PROFESSOR.
Oh, God, I’m shot! And now I’ll die! This whole scene, real or not real, will pass away and I will never know - or will And yet once I was a man, and it was good to be alive. Oh! Oh! Oh! Dying! Alas! I’m dying! Never will I see this wonderful world any more! Or will I? What’s this - I’m not dying, after all! They’re not real! I’m only dreaming. How astonishing! You’re not real, after all. You’re mere shadows, thin air. I’m dying, but you’re not real. This house isn’t real. It couldn’t have holes in it if it were, or at least I couldn’t have seen through it in the first place if it hadn’t. You’re shadows, tissues of nothing, a mere fancy of the brain. Oh, wonderful!
#FIRST DREAM OFFICER.
Are we? Well, you’re a fool! Wait! You may be waking into another state, but you’ll be dead to this one. But we won’t. Ha! Ha! We’ll still be here, alive. He thinks he’s not real. He thinks we’re not real. He thinks he’s not going to die, but wake up into something else! Ha! Ha! When he passes out of this won’t he be dead to this, though?
#THE PROFESSOR.
What is this? Am I dying, or waking up? Which is it? Are there various worlds, one within another? Are those soldiers really real? Great heavens! How strange! I am waking up, and yet this world in which I am is real enough. I died there. I certainly did, or I am dying there.
#PATSY LAFERTY.
I’ll give dis guy one more spin an’ den I’ll quit. I ain’t gonna stand here all night, rain or no rain. Clump! Clump! Clump!
#THE PROFESSOR.
Oh, blessed heaven! What is that? I’m not dead, after all! I am really alive! It was a dream, all of it. How glad I am to be awake! But those soldiers! They argued with me about it! They did! They made fun of me! Isn’t that amazing! This dream is a call to me to seek out this mystery. If ever I get money enough to do it that is certainly what I will do. I shall devote all my life to solving this mystery. If only I could find somebody who would endow a laboratory for this purpose. Yes, yes! I’m coming!

A miracle! $300,000! Just what I need for that laboratory! It’s a sign! The dream is a portent, a call! My poor dear, good uncle! What moved him to leave me that? Now I know the dream was an omen. And yet - should I really do that? Three hundred thousand are three hundred thousand, and where would I ever get that much again? We could live beautifully on that. I’m not so sure. Perhaps I could get some one else to furnish that money. But that poor boy! I forgot to give him a penny, and it’s storming. Dear, dear, dear! I should have given him a dime, anyhow - bringing such a fortunate message. But I must think about this laboratory, though, and this money. I must not act too hastily or inadvisedly. Three hundred thousand are three hundred thousand, and -

Wot did I say? Wot did I say? Dey never comes across wit nuttin’ after twelve - nuttin’. Not if you handed dem a million.
