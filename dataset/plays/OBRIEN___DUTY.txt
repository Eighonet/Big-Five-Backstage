#PADNA.
Fill 'em again, ma'am, please.
#MRS. COTTER.
Fill 'em again, is it? Indeed I won't do any such thing.
#MICUS.
Indeed you will, Mrs. Cotter.
#MRS. COTTER.
Don't you know that 'tis Sunday night, an' that the police might call any minute?
#MICUS.
The police!
#PADNA.
Bad luck to them! Amen!
#MRS. COTTER.
This will be the last drink that any one will get in this house to - night.
#MICUS.
'Tis a nice state of affairs to think that dacent men, after a hard week's work, can't have a drink in pace and quietness in the town they were born and reared in, without bein' scared out o' their senses by the police!
#PADNA.
'Tis the hell of a thing, entirely! I don't see what's gained be closin' the pubs at all, unless it be to give the police somethin' to do.
#MICUS.
The overfed and undertaught bla'gards!
#PADNA.
As far as I can see, there's as much drink sold as if the pubs were never closed.
#MICUS.
There is, an' more; for if it wasn't forbidden to drink porter, it might be thought as little about as water.
#PADNA.
I don't believe that, Micus. Did you ever hear of a pint or even a gallon of water makin' any one feel like Napoleon?
#PADNA.
There ye are, ma'am.
#MRS. COTTER.
Hurry now like good boys, for forty shillin's is a lot to pay for a pint o' porter, an' that's what 'twill cost ye if the police comes in an' finds ye here. An' I'll lose me license into the bargain.
#MICUS.
One would think be the way the police are talked about that they had charge of the whole Universe!
#PADNA.
An' who else has charge of it but themselves an' the magistrates, or justices o' the pace, as they're called?
#MICUS.
They're worse than the police.
#PADNA.
They're as bad anyway, an' that's bad enough.
#MICUS.
Justices o' the pace!
#PADNA.
Micus!
#MICUS.
What?
#PADNA.
There's no justice in the world.
#MICUS.
Damn the bit! Sure 'tisn't porter we should be drinkin' a cold night like this!
#PADNA.
'Tis well to have it these times.
#MICUS.
The world is goin' to the dogs, I'm afraid.
#PADNA.
'Tisn't goin' at all, but gone.
#MICUS.
An' nobody seems to care.
#PADNA.
Some pretend they do, like the preachers, but they're paid for it. I do be often wonderin' after readin' the newspapers if God has forgotten about the world altogether.
#MICUS.
I wouldn't be surprised, for nothin' seems to be right. There's the police, for instance. They can do what they like, an' we must do what we're told, like childer.
#PADNA.
Isn't the world a star, Micus?
#MICUS.
Of course it is.
#PADNA.
Then it must be the way that it got lost among all the other stars one sees on a frosty night.
#MICUS.
Are there min in the other stars too?
#PADNA.
So I believe.
#MICUS.
That's queer.
#PADNA.
Sure, everythin' is queer.
#MICUS.
If the min in the other stars are like the peelers, there won't be much room in Hell after the good are taken to Heaven on the last day.
#PADNA.
The last day! I don't like to think about the last day.
#MICUS.
Why so?
#PADNA.
Well, 'tis terrible to think that we might be taken to Heaven, an' our parents an' childer might be sent with the Protestants.
#MICUS.
If the Protestants will be as well treated in the next world as they are in this, I wouldn't mind goin' with 'em meself.
#PADNA.
I wouldn't like to be a Protestant after I'm dead, Micus.
#MICUS.
The same again, Mrs. Cotter.
#MRS. COTTER.
Indeed, ye won't get another drop.
#MICUS.
This will be our last, ma'am. Don't be hard on us. 'Tis only a night of our lives, an' we'll be all dead one day.
#MRS. COTTER.
Ye ought to be ashamed o' yerselves to be seen in a public house a night like this.
#MICUS.
We're ashamed o' nothin,' ma'am. We're only ourselves an' care for nobody.
#MRS. COTTER.
Well, this is the very last drink ye'll get then.
#PADNA.
Women are all alike.
#MICUS.
They are, God forgive them.
#PADNA.
They must keep talkin'.
#MICUS.
An' 'tis only a fool that 'ud try to prevent 'em.
#MRS. COTTER.
Hurry up, now, an' don't have me at the next Petty Sessions.
#MICUS.
Nothin' like a good pint o' "Dundon's."
#PADNA.
'Tis great stuff.
#MICUS.
May the Lord spare them long, an' they buildin' houses for the poor an' churches for God!
#PADNA.
An' all out o' the beer money?
#MICUS.
Of course. What else could ye make money at in a country like this?
#PADNA.
'Tis a thirsty climate!
#MICUS.
If all those who made money built houses for the poor an' gave employment, there 'ud soon be no poor at all.
#PADNA.
You're talkin' what's called socialism now, an' that's too delicate a plant, like Christianity, to thrive in a planet like this. So I heard one o' them preacher chaps sayin' the other evenin'.
#MICUS.
Well, be all accounts, we're no better off than those who heard St. Peter himself preachin'. The poor still only get the promise of Heaven from the clergy.
#PADNA.
That's all they'll ever get.
#MICUS.
The world must surely be lost, Padna.
#PADNA.
Nothin' surer!
#MICUS.
If God ever goes rummagin' among the stars an' finds it again, there'll be bad work, I'm thinkin'.
#PADNA.
I wonder will it be a great fire or another flood?
#MICUS.
Tis hard to tell!
#MRS. COTTER.
Who's there?
#HANK.
Police.
#PADNA.
May ye freeze there!
#MICUS.
Or trip over the threshold and break ye'r neck!
#MRS. COTTER.
Quick! quick! quick! This way, boys!
#MRS. COTTER.
Wait a minit! Wait a minit! I'm comin', I'm comin'.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
You took a long time to open the door, ma'am.
#MRS. COTTER.
I know I did, but it wasn't me fault, Head. I had the house locked up for the night, an' couldn't find where I left the kay.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
'Tis all right, ma'am. I can lose things meself. 'Tis a lonesome thing to see the house so empty.
#MRS. COTTER.
'Tis Sunday night, Head.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Of course, of course! All the same I'd prefer to see it full - of bona - fide travellers, I mean.
#MRS. COTTER.
Thank ye, Head. How's Mrs. Mulligan an' the childer?
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Wisha, purty fair. How's the world usin' yourself?
#MRS. COTTER.
Only for the rheumatics I'd have no cause to grumble.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
'Tis well to be alive at all these times. An' Ballyferris isn't the best place to keep any one alive in winter time.
#MRS. COTTER.
Or summer time ayther. Whin the weather is good trade is bad.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
That's always the way in this world. We're no sooner, out o' one trouble before another commences. I always admire the way you bear your troubles, though, Mrs. Cotter.
#MRS. COTTER.
I does me best, Head.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Just like meself! Just like meself! The Government makes laws an' I must see that they're not broken. 'Tis a cold night, an' no doubt about it.
#MRS. COTTER.
Bad weather is due to us now.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Everythin' bad is due to some of us. Only for that shark of an Inspector 'tis little trouble I'd be givin' a dacent woman like yourself a night like this.
#MRS. COTTER.
He's very strict, I hear.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
He's strict, disagreeable, a Protestant, a teetotaler, an' a Cromwellian to boot!
#MRS. COTTER.
The Lord protect us! 'Tis a wonder you're alive at all!
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Wisha, I'm only half alive. The cold never agrees with me. That's not a very dangerous fire, an' I'm as cold as a snowball.
#MRS. COTTER.
There's a fine fire up - stairs in the sittin' - room.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Thank ye, ma'am, but 'tisn't worth me while goin' up - stairs. As I said before, I wouldn't trouble you at all only for the Inspector, an' like Nelson, he expects every one to do their duty.
#MRS. COTTER.
'Tis a hard world.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
An' a cold world too. I often feels cold on a summer day.
#MRS. COTTER.
That's too bad! Is there no cure for it?
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
They say there's a cure for everything.
#MRS. COTTER.
I wonder if ye took a drop o' "Wise's" ten - year - old! It might help to warm ye, if ye sat be the fire up - stairs.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Now, 'pon me word, but that's strange! I was just thinkin' o' the same thing meself. That's what's called telepattery or thought transference.
#MRS. COTTER.
Tella - what, Head?
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Telepattery, ma'am. 'Tis like this: I might be in America -
#MRS. COTTER.
I wish you were -
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
What's that, ma'am?
#MRS. COTTER.
I wish for your own sake that you were in a country where you would get better paid for your work.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Thank ye, ma'am. I suppose min like meself must wait till we go to the other world to get our reward.
#MRS. COTTER.
Very likely!
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Well, as I was sayin', I might be in America, or New York, Boston, Chicago, or any o' thim foreign places, an' you might be in this very house, or up in your sister's house, or takin' a walk down the town, an' I'd think o' some thought, an' at that very second you'd think o' the same thought, an' nayther of us would know that we were both thinkin' o' the same thing. That's tellepattery, ma'am.
#MRS. COTTER.
'Tis a surprisin' thing, surely! Is it hot or cold you'll have the whiskey, Head?
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Cold, if ye please.
#MRS. COTTER.
Will I bring it up - stairs for you?
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Indeed, I'm givin' you too much trouble as it is. I'll try an' take it where I am. That is good stuff.
#MRS. COTTER.
I'm glad you like it.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Who wouldn't like it?
#MRS. COTTER.
I don't know the taste of it.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
May ye be always so, though there's nothin' like it all the same. I think I'll have a little drop from meself this time.
#MRS. COTTER.
Will I bring it up - stairs?
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Erra, don't bother! I'm beginnin' to feel meself again.
#MRS. COTTER.
Did you bring your overcoat with you, Head?
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Why so, ma'am?
#MRS. COTTER.
Because the cold o' the rain is there. I wouldn't make any delay but go home immediately. You might get a wettin'.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
This wouldn't leave in a drop o' rain in a hundred years, ma'am.
#MRS. COTTER.
Who's there?
#HANK.
Police!
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Police, did I hear?
#MRS. COTTER.
'Tis the Sergeant's voice.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Glory to be God! I'm ruined! If he finds the smell o' whiskey from me, he'll tell the Inspector, an' then Head Constable Mulligan is no more!
#MRS. COTTER.
Is he as bad as that?
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
He has no conscience at all. He's a friend o' the Inspector's. Don't open that door till I tell you - that's if you don't want to find a corpse on the floor.
#MRS. COTTER.
Sure, I must open the door.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Time enough. He's paid for waitin'. Have you such a thing as an onion in the house?
#MRS. COTTER.
I didn't see an onion for the last three weeks.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
What the blazes will I do? Whist! I'm saved. I'll go in here until he's gone. You can open now, but get rid of him as soon as you can.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
So you opened at last. Well, better late than never!
#MRS. COTTER.
I'm sorry for keepin' you waitin', Sergeant. I don't open the door for any one on Sunday nights, an' whin you said "Police," I thought it was one o' the boys tryin' to desaive me.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
I see! I see! There's a lot o' desaitful people in the town, ma'am.
#MRS. COTTER.
There are, Sergeant.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
There are indeed. I'm sick an' tired o' the place altogether.
#MRS. COTTER.
I thought it agreed with you. You're lookin' very well, anyway.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
I'm not feelin' well at all thin. There's nothin' more deceptive than looks at times.
#MRS. COTTER.
True.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
'Tis in me bed I should be instead of troublin' dacent people like yourself a night like this. But duty is duty, an' it must be done. If I didn't do what I'm told, that bla'gard of a Head Constable would soon have another an' maybe a worse man in my place.
#MRS. COTTER.
The Lord save us!
#SERGEANT HEALY.
But as herself says: There's no use in the Government makin' laws if the people don't keep them.
#MRS. COTTER.
That's so.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Keepin' the world in order is no aisy business, ma'am.
#MRS. COTTER.
'Tis a great responsibility.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
'Pon me word I'm tired an' cold too.
#MRS. COTTER.
Wouldn't ye go home and go to bed, Sergeant?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
If I went to bed at this hour, the Head would send a report to his chum the Inspector, statin' that I was drunk.
#MRS. COTTER.
That's a bad cough. How long is it troublin' ye?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Only since supper time. I was eatin' a bit o' cold meat, an' a bone or somethin' stuck there.
#MRS. COTTER.
An' what did ye do for it?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
What could I do for it?
#MRS. COTTER.
Ye could take a drink o' somethin' an' wash it down.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
I tried some cold tea.
#MRS. COTTER.
I wonder would a bottle of stout do any good.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
'Twould be no harm to try.
#MRS. COTTER.
Will ye have a bottle?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
To tell ye the truth, I don't like bein' disobligin', ma'am.
#MRS. COTTER.
Ye might as well come up - stairs, Sergeant. There's a fine fire in the sitting - room.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
I'm first rate where I am. Thank you all the same.
#MRS. COTTER.
How do you feel now?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
'Tis gone! I mean the bone. I feel meself again.
#MRS. COTTER.
I'm glad of that. 'Tis gone half - past ten, Sergeant.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Plenty o' time. We'll be a long time dead, an' happy I hope.
#MRS. COTTER.
Amen!
#SERGEANT HEALY.
'Tis my belief that we should all try to do good while we're alive.
#MRS. COTTER.
There's a lot o' good people in the world, Sergeant.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
There is, ma'am, but nearly every one o' them thinks that they're better than what they are. That's what annoys me.
#MRS. COTTER.
Sure 'tis imagination that keeps the world movin'.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Yes, an' ambition. All the same, 'tis a good job that people can't see themselves as they really are.
#MRS. COTTER.
They wouldn't believe that they were themselves if they could.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
I suppose not.
#MRS. COTTER.
Won't ye come up to the fire in the sittin' - room?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Don't be worryin' about me. I'm all right. That was good stout.
#MRS. COTTER.
The best!
#SERGEANT HEALY.
'Tis a cure for nearly everythin'. Only for takin' a little now an' again, I'd never be able to stand all the hardships o' me profession.
#MRS. COTTER.
Hard work isn't easy.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
True! But a good drop o' stout, or better still "spirits" makes many things easy. 'Tis the seed o' pluck, so to speak. I'm feelin' just a little queer about the nerves. I think I'll have a drop o' "Wise's."
#MRS. COTTER.
That's like the noise of a row down the road.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Erra, let 'em row away! The Head is prowlin' about. Let him separate 'em. 'Tis about time he did somethin' for his livin'. 'Tis a damn shame to have the poor rate payers supportin' the likes of him.
#MRS. COTTER.
I wouldn't be talkin' like that, Sergeant.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Why wouldn't I talk? There's as many Head Constables as clergy in the country, an' only for the sergeants an' an odd constable 'tis unknown what 'ud happen!
#MRS. COTTER.
The Head is a dacent gentleman.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
You don't know anythin' about him. Grumblin' about havin' to shave himself he does be now, an' only for havin' a bald patch on one side of his face, he'd let his whiskers grow altogether.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
What noise is that?
#MRS. COTTER.
That's only the cat in the coal hole.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
He must be suffocatin'. I'll open the door an' let him out. Under the grate he should be a cold night like this. Heavens be praised! 'Tis the Head himself!
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
'Tis the Head an' every inch an' ounce of him too that stands before ye.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
I thought 'twas y'er ghost I saw.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
What the blazes would me ghost be doin' in a coal hole?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
What I'd like to know is what y'erself have been doin' there.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
That won't take me long to tell. Waitin' and watchin' to catch the likes o' you is what took me there.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Now, Head, with all due respects, I'd try an' tell the truth if I were you.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Sergeant Dooley, sir, anythin' you'll say or be likely to say 'll be used in evidence against you.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
An' anythin' that you say or don't say may be used in evidence against you.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Sergeant Dooley!
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Yes, Head.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Do you know that y'er addressin' y'er superior officer?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
The less said about superiority the better.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
You can't deny that I found you drinkin' on these licensed premises while on duty.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
I might as well tell you candidly that you have no more chance o' frightenin' me or desaivin' me than you have of catchin' whales in Casey's duck - pond.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
I'll - I'll - I -
#SERGEANT HEALY.
You'll have a drink from me, an' we'll say no more about the matter. I wouldn't blame any man for takin' a drop a cold night like this. I suppose 'twill be "Wise's" the same as the last? That's if me sense o' smell isn't out of order.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Is it as bad as that?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
I smelt it the instant I came in, an' wondered where 'twas comin' from.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
I only took it to avoid catchin' cold.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Just like meself. We must avoid catchin' cold at any cost. Two glasses o' "Wise's," ma'am."
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Wait, an' I'll wipe that black spot off ye'r nose.
#MRS. COTTER.
The fire up - stairs is blazing away, an' there's no one sittin' by it.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
We're all right. Here's long life to us!
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Health an' prosperity!
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
We must have another, for I'm not feelin' too well, an' 'tis better be on the safe side. 'Twas through neglect that some o' the best min died.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
We must not forget that!
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
The same again, Mrs. Cotter.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
I saw be the papers last night that the Royal Irish Constabulary are the finest in the world.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Sure every one knows that!
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
I wonder what kind are all the others?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
That's what I'd like to know.
#MRS. COTTER.
Will I bring them up to the sittin' - room, gentlemen?
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
We're first class as we are, ma'am.
#MRS. COTTER.
Who's there?
#HANK.
Police!
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
'Tis the constable!
#SERGEANT HEALY.
The bla'gard surely!
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
What'll we do?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Take the drinks first, an' consider after.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
I suppose we had better hide in the coal hole. He has a better nose than yourself, an' one word from him to the Inspector would soon deprive us o' both stripes an' pensions.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
I suppose the coal hole is the best place, though it does offend me dignity to go there.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Wisha, bad luck to you an' ye'r dignity. Come on here!
#CONSTABLE.
Thanks very much for openin' the door, ma'am.
#MRS. COTTER.
I'm sorry for keepin' you waitin', Constable. I was sayin' me prayers up - stairs before goin' to bed.
#CONSTABLE.
If I had known that, I wouldn't have disturbed you. I hope you said one for me.
#MRS. COTTER.
Of course I did. I always ses a prayer for the police.
#CONSTABLE.
An' right too, ma'am, for 'tis little time we have for prayin'. There's no rest for a man once he joins the Force. Whin y're not kept busy thinkin' o' one thing, y're kept busy thinkin' o' somethin' else.
#MRS. COTTER.
Thinkin' is worse than workin'. hundred times. 'Tis a long time since first Mass this mornin'. Saturday! Sunday! Monday! 'Tis all the same whin y're in the Force. On y'er feet all day, an' kep' awake be the childer all night. An' whin pay day comes, all y'er hard earnin's goes to keep the wolf from the door.
#MRS. COTTER.
God help us!
#CONSTABLE.
Say what ye will, but life is an awful bother.
#MRS. COTTER.
We must go through it.
#CONSTABLE.
Well, 'tis a good job we don't live as long as the alligators. We might have to support our grandchilder if we did, an' I may tell you it gives me enough to do to support me own.
#MRS. COTTER.
How many have you now, Constable?
#CONSTABLE.
Seven, an' the wife's mother.
#MRS. COTTER.
I thought she was dead.
#CONSTABLE.
Dead! There's five years more in her!
#MRS. COTTER.
You seem to be in a very bad humor to - night.
#CONSTABLE.
An' why not? When I have to put up with that bla'gard of a Sergeant - not to mention the Head - constable!
#MRS. COTTER.
We all have our troubles.
#CONSTABLE.
Some of us get more than our share. An' 'tis far from troublin' a dacent woman like you I'd be, only for the Sergeant, ma'am.
#MRS. COTTER.
Excuse me, Constable. I can't keep me eyes open with the sleep.
#CONSTABLE.
I'm sorry for troublin' you. But duty is duty, an' it must be done whether we give offence to our best friends or not. Sure, 'tis well I know that you have no one on the premises.
#MRS. COTTER.
We can't please everybody.
#CONSTABLE.
Who would try? I wonder is it snow we're goin' to have?
#MRS. COTTER.
If you're cold, come up to the fire in the sittin' - room. Or if I were you, I'd take a good walk.
#CONSTABLE.
I'm tired o' walkin', an' the cold gives me no trouble. 'Tis the pains I have here that affects me.
#MRS. COTTER.
What sort are they?
#CONSTABLE.
Cramps - of the worst kind.
#MRS. COTTER.
Gracious me! Have you taken anythin' for them?
#CONSTABLE.
What would be good for 'em?
#MRS. COTTER.
Hot milk an' pepper.
#CONSTABLE.
I tried that.
#MRS. COTTER.
Anythin' else?
#CONSTABLE.
Nothin' except a smoke.
#MRS. COTTER.
Maybe a little drop o' "Wise's" would do some good?
#CONSTABLE.
I'd try anythin' that 'ud lessen the pain, though I'd rather not be troublin' ye.
#MRS. COTTER.
'Tis no trouble at all.
#MRS. COTTER.
Drink that up, go straight home, bathe ye'r feet in mustard an' water, an' ye'll be as strong as a Protestant in the mornin'!
#CONSTABLE.
Thank ye, ma'am.
#CONSTABLE.
What's that?
#MRS. COTTER.
Oh, that's nothin'.
#CONSTABLE.
Well, if that nothin' isn't somethin', I'm dotin'.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
'Tis all your fault with your blasted sneezin'.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Now, maybe you'll believe that I've a cold.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Don't be botherin' me. I can't believe meself not to mind a liar like you.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Now, sir, what have you got to say for yourself? 'Twill be useless for you to deny that meself an' the Sergeant here have caught you drinkin' on these licensed premises durin' your hours o' duty.
#CONSTABLE.
An' what about me catchin' the pair o' ye hidin' in the coal hole o' the same licensed premises, an' a strong smell o' whiskey from ye?
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
'Tis from yourself that, you smells the whiskey.
#CONSTABLE.
I defy you or any one else to find the smell o' whiskey from me.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Well, don't that beat Banagher?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
The Devil himself couldn't do better.
#CONSTABLE.
Well, gentlemen, I'm sorry for troublin' ye, but duty is duty. I'll now place ye under arrest an' send for the Inspector.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
No more o' this nonsense! You'll pay for this night's work, believe me.
#CONSTABLE.
I'll pay for a drink for both o' ye for the sake of old times, an' the less said about this night's work the better. Well, are ye goin' to have the drink?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
We might as well take it, for 'tis the first time he ever offered to stand, an' it may be the last.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Very well, then, I'll have a drop o' the best.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
An' I'll have the same.
#CONSTABLE.
Three glasses o' "Wise's," Mrs. Cotter. Certainly, Constable.
#CONSTABLE.
'Tisn't worth our while, ma'am. We have our work to do. Slainthe!
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
What's that?

"We are the boys of Wexford Who fought with heart an' hand To burst in twain the galling chain, An' free our native land."
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
I'll have the kay of that door, ma'am.
#MRS. COTTER.
What kay, Head?
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
The kay o' that door, ma'am.
#MRS. COTTER.
Erra, Head, what's the matter with ye? That door is nailed up this seven years. That singin' comes from the next house.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Glory be to God! Do any one alive tell the truth? If you don't give me he kay, I'll burst open the door.
#MRS. COTTER.
I have no kay, Head.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Once more I demand the kay in the name of His Majesty the King, before I puts the legs o' the chair flyin' through the ledges.
#MRS. COTTER.
Oh, wisha, what'll I do at all?
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
You'll be told that later on, ma'am.
#MRS. COTTER.
They are only two neighbors like y'erselves. Can't ye go away an' lave 'em alone?
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Not a word now, ma'am, for anythin' that you will say or won't say must be used in evidence ag'inst ye.
#PADNA.
"Who fears to speak of Ninety - eight? Who blushes at the name? When cowards mock the patriots' fate, Who hangs his head for shame? He's all a knave or half a slave, Who slights his country thus: But true men, like you, men, Will drink your glass with us."
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
That's a nice song to be singin' on a licensed premises, ma'am. 'Twould cause a riot if there was enough o' people about. No less than raidin' the police barracks would satisfy the likes o' that songster if he was left at large. What are ye doin' here?
#PADNA.
What the devil is that to you?
#MICUS.
Or to any one else either?
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Do ye know that this is a licensed premises?
#PADNA.
Of course we do.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
An' do ye know that this is Sunday night an' that I'm the Head Constable, an' that one o' these min here is the Sergeant an' the other is the Constable?
#PADNA.
An' do ye know that I'm Padna Sweeney from Clashbeg?
#MICUS.
An' that I'm his old pal Micus Goggin from Castleclover?
#PADNA.
Don't mind him, Micus. He's drunk.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
What's that you're sayin'? Who's drunk?
#PADNA.
Be jaikus, ye're all drunk.
#MICUS.
Come on away home, Padna, an' don't mind them. They're a bad lot.
#PADNA.
The smell o' drink from 'em is awful.
#MICUS.
'Tis disgustin'. I wouldn't be seen in their company. Padna. Come on away.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Arrest these min!
#PADNA.
Do ye hear that, Micus?
#MICUS.
I do, but I won't be insulted be the likes o' them.
#PADNA.
Nayther will I!
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Why don't ye arrest these min, I say? and MICUS. Arrest us, is it? Come on, now, and arrest us!
#PADNA.
I'll take the best man.
#MICUS.
An' I'll take the lot.
#MRS. COTTER.
O boys, for my sake, an' for the sake o' ye'r wives an' families, have no crossness but lave the house quietly.
#PADNA.
Don't fret, ma'am. We'll have no crossness. All we want is to wipe the police from the face o' the earth altogether.
#MICUS.
That's all. We'll have no crossness.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Take these min to the Barrack.
#PADNA.
"When boyhood's fire was in my blood, I read of ancient freemen For Grace and Rome who bravely stood, Three hundred men and three men. And then I prayed I yet might see Our fetters rent in twain, And Ireland, long a province, be Nation once again."

"Found drunk an' disorderly on the licensed premises o' Mrs. Cotter, Ballyferris, during prohibited hours. Using bad an' offensive language. Resistin' arrest, assaultin' the police, an' doin' sayrious damage to their garments. Singin' songs of a nature likely to cause rebellion an' threatenin' to exterminate the whole Royal Irish Constabulary."
#MRS. COTTER.
Oh, Head, you won't be hard on a lone widow, will ye? Don't prosecute thim poor min. Sure, they have done no more harm than y'erselves.
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
Mrs. Cotter, ma'am! I'm surprised at you.
#MRS. COTTER.
For what, Head?
#HEAD CONSTABLE.
To think that you'd dare attempt to interfere with me in the discharge o' me duty!
#MRS. COTTER.
DUTY!
