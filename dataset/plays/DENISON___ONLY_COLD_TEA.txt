#MRS. SELWYN.
Alice, I’m afraid Dick Plyer takes a little too much wine.
#ALICE CHASE.
I begin to think so myself. At that dinner at the Brown’s he came pretty near making a show of himself.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Go slow, Alice, don’t get too fond of him.
#ALICE CHASE.
Leave that to me. I am decided on one thing and that is I shall never marry a tippler. There may be enough trouble in the family already.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Sister, what do you mean by that, neither of our brothers drinks.
#ALICE CHASE.
No, thank heaven, but you don’t have to go so far as that.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Alice, what do you mean?
#ALICE CHASE.
I mean your husband, Mr. Bob Slightly.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Alice, this is unkind of you. Robert never was intoxicated in his life. He says so himself.
#ALICE CHASE.
Before long he may not be able to say that. Sister, you don’t hear what people say, as I do.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Alice, what do they say?
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, they say that since Mr. Bob Slightly’s old chum, Dick Plyer, has returned from the west, that both are taking a great deal more liquor than is good for them.
#MRS. SELWYN.
But Robert is so kind and so good natured he can’t refuse, and his business requires it, you know.
#ALICE CHASE.
I know it doesn’t. How does brother John get along in the same business, without constant treating?
#MRS. SELWYN.
But Robert never was drunk in his life. He has often told me so. He never told me a lie yet.
#ALICE CHASE.
But he forgets that he has a liking for it, and that his appetite will grow.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Alice, you alarm me, this is dreadful. Oh, anything but a drunkard! But why do you encourage Dick Plyer, if he is so dangerous?
#ALICE CHASE.
Encourage him! I never encouraged him. I wanted to be sure of his character, and now that I know his weakness I shall decline his company.
#MRS. SELWYN.
But what can I do for poor Bob?
#ALICE CHASE.
Take the wine off your own table.
#MRS. SELWYN.
I never thought of that. But then Robert wishes it. It is necessary for his digestion he says.
#ALICE CHASE.
If put to the test which would he prefer? You or the wine?
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh me, of course. He is so fond of me.
#ALICE CHASE.
That is what all wives say. Listen to me. Dick Plyer has written me a note that he will call this very evening. He’ll come up with Bob and you will set out refreshments. The men will make a pretense of eating, but they will drink a great deal more. For some men the word refreshments means drink. They don’t care a snap about the eating.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh goodness! I’ve noticed some men eat enough for a family.
#ALICE CHASE.
Take my advice and observe them closely.
#MRS. SELWYN.
But what can I do?
#ALICE CHASE.
I have a plan. To show your husband the effects of intoxication in its true light just get drunk yourself.
#MRS. SELWYN.
I get drunk! Horrors! Alice, are you crazy?
#ALICE CHASE.
Not a bit of it. That’ll teach him a lesson he won’t forget soon.
#MRS. SELWYN.
I shan’t do it, that would be disgraceful.
#ALICE CHASE.
Just pretend, you goose. Did you think I wanted you to march down the middle of Broad street swinging your hat and singing “We wont go home till morning?”
#MRS. SELWYN.
You are ridiculous.
#ALICE CHASE.
Seriously, try it.
#MRS. SELWYN.
When?
#ALICE CHASE.
Now, this very evening.
#MRS. SELWYN.
It would be a great joke. But I can’t act a part as you can.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, it’s easy. Just stagger a little and look silly and say idiotic things. You’ve seen men drunk.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Do you think Robert would get angry?
#ALICE CHASE.
He might, but it’ll set him to thinking. Of course he mustn’t find out the trick.
#MRS. SELWYN.
I’ll do it just for a lark, all to ourselves.
#ALICE CHASE.
It’ll be a capital joke. I’ll pretend not to know what ails you.
#MRS. SELWYN.
How shall we proceed? Robert will be home pretty soon to take his bicycle ride before dinner.
#ALICE CHASE.
I’ll fill a wine bottle with cold tea and put glasses on the table.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Alice is so full of mischief. I’m afraid I can’t do it right. I’ll have to stagger and hiccup I suppose and be quarrelsome. That is the way drunken men always act in plays.
#ALICE CHASE.
“Veuve Clicquot.” How’s that?
#MRS. SELWYN.
Goodness, he’ll think I’ve been drinking champagne.
#ALICE CHASE.
So much the better. Muss up your hair. Look silly.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, Alice, I can’t do it.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes you can. There he comes. Sing a song!
#MRS. SELWYN.
Poor Bob! it’ll be such a shock!
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Hello Pussie, I’m home early, you see. Why Puss, what ails you? Another spell, dear?
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, Bob! you dear old—goodness me.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Why, she is sick! Alice, what ails her?—why didn’t you telephone for me?
#MRS. SELWYN.
Bob, you’re a trump!
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Oh, she’s out of her head!
#ALICE CHASE.
I guess not.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
I say she is very sick. She’s in a fever! How long has she been taken? Why do you sit there so unconcernedly. Puss—Puss. When was she taken?
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, I found her that way when I came in. She said she wasn’t sick.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
But don’t you see she is sick? Can’t you do something?
#ALICE CHASE.
Do something yourself. She’s your wife.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Heartless creature! put that book away.
#ALICE CHASE.
That’s manners, Mr. Slightly!
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Do something, for heaven’s sake. She’s in a high fever, she’ll faint. Get the salts, quick! You stand like a post. Rub her hands. I’ll call Dr. Gagg.
#ALICE CHASE.
Get up you ninny, you are not half playing it.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Poor Bob, it is too bad, it distresses him. I can’t do it right.
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, I could. Sing, dance!
#MRS. SELWYN.
Why Alice, you shock me!
#ALICE CHASE.
Then upset the table, break something, stagger. That’s it, throw something at his head.
#MRS. SELWYN.
I’ll upset the table!
#ALICE CHASE.
Do it!
#MRS. NEVERDUN
I’ve been ringing half an hour!
#ALICE CHASE.
That horrid Mrs. Neverdun!
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Dear me! Is she sick?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, one of her fainting spells! Call some one please, quick!
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Well I never! Them bottles looks awful suspicious. This is pretty goins - on for respectable people.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, Mrs. Neverdun, please do something. The salts are on the side - board. Call Mr. Slightly.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
She’s drunk! Champagne, too! That’s a matter for the church. I s’pose I’ll have to testify.
#ALICE CHASE.
Mrs. Neverdun, don’t let her fall. Go to her.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
I guess she aint very bad!
#ALICE CHASE.
I’ll call Robert.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Don’t excite yourself, dearie!
#MRS. SELWYN.
Hold your tongue, woman!
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Laws a me! She’s gittin’ sassy, jist like a man!
#MRS. SELWYN.
I wont be insulted in my own house!
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Dear me suz! Who’s insultin’ you, I’d like to know?
#MRS. SELWYN.
You are, you know it, too!
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Highty tighty, that’s the best proof in the world of your condition. You are a real nice lady when ye’re sober.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Do you mean to say, Mrs. Neverdun, that I am not sober? You are a gossip!
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Oh, don’t go a callin’ names. I aint a callin’ any.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh dear, it’ll be all over town before night.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
An’ s’posin’ it is? What kin women expect that goes an’ gits full o’ that nasty champagne. An’ it goes right to the head, too, an’ stays there.
#MRS. SELWYN.
How do you know?
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Bob Slightly has had enough experience to tell his wife better.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, Mrs. Neverdun, don’t speak that way. You are mistaken, I can explain it all.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
I aint askin’ no explanations.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Please say nothing about this. I’ve been foolish. Be my friend, will you?
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Good land, haint I always been yer friend? I haint an enemy in the world as I knows of. An haint I been active in the sewin’ society an’ didn’t I give them as nice refreshments as anybuddy? If I am nobuddy but Ole Missus Neverdun, aint I as good as the best of ’em. I aint no fool, I kin tell ye.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Yes, but—
#MRS. NEVERDUN
I don’t care a tuppence fur their talk. My tea an’ my coffee an’ my doughnuts aint beat nowhere.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Yes, but I—
#MRS. NEVERDUN
I don’t care a rap. Mrs. Hartley wears dimons and lace and she sets a mighty poor table, an’ I aint afraid to tell her so. They all eat at my house till I thought they’d bust. You kin laugh Mrs. Slightly, but I won’t be put on. An’ I’ll have my say when it comes to that. Sallie Neverdun aint the kind to be put on an say nothin’.
#MRS. SELWYN.
But Mrs. Neverdun—
#MRS. NEVERDUN
I aint castin’ no reflections on your table, fur it was bang up, an’ I sez right there, to Marier Wilkins, sez I, “this layout beats Mrs. Hartley’s with her dimons an’ her kerridges an’ she—”
#MRS. SELWYN.
But, Mrs. Neverdun, haven’t I always been your friend?
#MRS. NEVERDUN
I’ve nothin’ agin you, Mrs. Slightly. Haven’t I just said that many’s a time? I said to Marier Wilkins that your table beat Mrs. Hartley’s all holler, with her dimons an’ two niggers to dish salat an’ turn coffee. Why, her salat—
#MRS. SELWYN.
But Mrs. Neverdun—
#MRS. NEVERDUN
There! it’s goin’ to her head agin. Lay down a spell.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Goodness! do let me say a word.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
An’ haint ye been talkin’ all the time, I’d like to know!
#MRS. SELWYN.
Please don’t say a word of what happened here this afternoon. I can explain it all.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
I aint askin’ no explanations, I tell ye. Everybody must think Sallie Neverdun is an inimy o’ mankind goin’ round devowerin’. The whole town knows I wouldn’t harm a worm o’ the arth. But s’posin’ it gits out an’ the church hauls me up as a witness, I reckon they’d make me tell.
#MRS. SELWYN.
I’ve made a pretty mess of things. Robert! Alice! Where can they be?
#ALICE CHASE.
Get rid of her.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Hist, we must explain all. Where is Robert?
#ALICE CHASE.
I don’t know. The cook says he went tearing down the street bare - headed.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
No wonder he’s tearin’ round. It’s enough to make any man tear round!
#ALICE CHASE.
Go and look for Bob.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh goodness, what shall I do?
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Don’t excite her, young woman! Lie down, dearie.
#MRS. SELWYN.
I am perfectly well.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Indeed you are not, you are dreadfully flushed! Are ye sick at the stummick? You must lie down. Alice, arrange the cushions.
#ALICE CHASE.
Now the fat’s in the fire.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Are you better, darling?
#MRS. SELWYN.
I think so. I didn’t need Dr. Gagg, dear.
#KAHLENBERG.
Nothing like precaution, madam. Some fever. Any vertigo?
#MRS. SELWYN.
Yes.
#KAHLENBERG.
Mr. Slightly, your wife’s nerves are unstrung!
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Well, I should think so.
#KAHLENBERG.
She must have quiet. She’ll be all right to - morrow.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Knowed that much myself.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
What is the matter, doctor?
#KAHLENBERG.
Old complaint with complications. Her nerves are unstrung. Observe the abnormal action of the levator labiæ superioris, the orbicularis oris and the levator palpebrarum.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Land o’ rest! jist hear that!
#KAHLENBERG.
I think there is a slight difficulty, too, in the decussation of the medulla oblongata which has established a sympathetic action with the solar plexus and the pneumogastricus.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Say, Dr. Gagg, what does all that rigmarole mean? hysterics?
#KAHLENBERG.
The science of medicine, madam, has made many advances since you were a child.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Ye don’t say! An’ I s’pose it’ll keep on a - dancin’ till a doctor knows when a person’s—
#KAHLENBERG.
That woman is exciting your wife. Get rid of her.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
How the——what can I do with her?
#DICK.
I say, old boy, I was just going past— I beg pardon. Is Mrs. Slightly indisposed?
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Only a slight nerve attack.
#DICK.
I’m very sorry if I disturb her.
#MRS. SELWYN.
It is nothing at all. I am glad to see you, Mr. Plyer. Alice, please show Dick a chair.
#ALICE CHASE.
Take this seat, Mr. Plyer.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
I say, Dick, wont you go into the smoking room? I’ll join you as soon as I can leave my wife.
#DICK.
Oh, certainly, I’m awful sorry! Can’t I be of any use?
#KAHLENBERG.
Just one moment, Mr. Slightly. Take this prescription to be filled at once! Make haste! Dose every half hour, till patient finds relief. Miss Alice, wet a cloth with vinegar and place it on her forehead. The solar plexus is dangerously disturbed.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
That’s an anatomy I never heerd tell of.
#ALICE CHASE.
Robert, I wish to speak with you, if Mr. Plyer will step into the smoking room meanwhile.
#DICK.
Certainly! At your service.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Excuse me a moment, Dr.
#KAHLENBERG.
A word with you, madam. You appear for some reason to excite the patient. You had better go at once.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Oh, I kin take a hint.
#KAHLENBERG.
I mean for her sake, you know.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
You needn’t palaver. What ails her?
#KAHLENBERG.
A very strange case, madam. Very strange. It would baffle the skill of a young practitioner. The eye of science madam—
#MRS. NEVERDUN
I ’low it takes the eye o’ science to see through a grindstone when there aint no hole in it.
#KAHLENBERG.
Exactly! I’ve had in my lifetime just three such cases, all since la grippe came. I may say, in fact, that I have discovered a new disease.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Doctor Gagg, you are a wise man. compliment madam?
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Nonsense! Did you smell her breath?
#KAHLENBERG.
I, no indeed! Why should I?
#MRS. NEVERDUN
You’ve made a fool of yourself. She’s drunk, that’s all!
#KAHLENBERG.
A fool! Drunk! Why madam, this is scandalous.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Oh, keep cool. You’ll get well paid to say nothin’. But didn’t I see the bottles on the table?
#KAHLENBERG.
But it is impossible.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Didn’t I see her stagger? If you don’t b’lieve, look at the puddles of wine on the table. Smell it.
#KAHLENBERG.
True! Why, this is an insult to my profession.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Dr. Gagg, I wish a word in the smoking room.
#KAHLENBERG.
I have a word, too, sir. You have insulted my profession, sir.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
But hold, I’ll explain.
#KAHLENBERG.
I’ll not hold. I am the victim of a hoax. Your wife is not sick at all.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Why didn’t you find that out at first, then?
#DICK.
Yes, the eye of science, solar plexus, vinegar and water, etc. That’s great stuff. There’s nothing like science.
#KAHLENBERG.
You are offensive, sir. I’ll have nothing to say to you. Now, Mr. Slightly, your conduct is most inexcusable.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
But I’m trying to explain that it was all a little joke between my wife and her sister. She was only pretending.
#KAHLENBERG.
And I am to be the victim of other people’s jokes. You shall pay for this, sir.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Send in your bill.
#KAHLENBERG.
Bill! Who cares for the paltry fee! My professional feelings have been outraged. The profession is not to be trifled with. Mr. Slightly, I’ve a mind to sue you for damages. fig for your dignity!
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, Robert!
#DICK.
Let him sue. Get me on the jury.
#KAHLENBERG.
I shall consult my attorney at once.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Save the trouble and the fee! Let lawyers alone! Make your bill as large as you please. I prefer to be plucked by one man rather than by two. Your professional dignity will at least insure silence.
#KAHLENBERG.
Humph! My feelings are nothing! Madam, let me say to you that you are a meddling old fool!
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Dr. Gagg, while ye’re at it say there’s a pair of us. Bob Slightly may pull the wool over your eyes, but he can’t fool me. Didn’t I see champagne bottles, and didn’t I see her stagger, an’ didn’t—
#MRS. SELWYN.
Mrs. Neverdun, this is too much—
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Easy my dear!
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, Mr. Plyer, can’t you do something?
#DICK.
I’ll try. Mrs. Neverdun, let me say a word. I’ve always maintained that you can set a better table any day than Mrs. Hartley.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Well, I should say!
#DICK.
Now, when I stand up for people I want them to stand up for me.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Them’s my principles!
#DICK.
Now, I can clear this matter up in just a minute. Miss Alice, bring in those bottles and glasses. We’ll clear up this mystery in short order. I guess I’ve seen enough of champagne to know it when I see it.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Dear me suz, I reckon nobody’ll deny that.
#DICK.
Now this is only cold tea. Smell it, Dr. Gagg, smell it, Mrs. Neverdun. Look! there’s a tea leaf in it. If any body wants to smell the table do so.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Well I vum!
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Dick’s a trump!
#DICK.
Now mum’s the word all round. Just a little joke of the ladies.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Good land, I aint a tellin’ anything!
#DICK.
It must be quits, is mum the word?
#BOB CRATCHIT.
My dear, what a lesson, I’ll never touch another drop.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, you dear Bob.
#DICK.
Mrs. Neverdun, I still stick up for your table.
#MRS. NEVERDUN
I reckon you will. It’s the best in town.
#DICK.
I am going to Mrs. Hartley’s to dinner next Wednesday, and—
#MRS. NEVERDUN
Land o’ Goshen! Then jist come to my house Thursday an’ I’ll show ye a dinner ’at’ll be a dinner. What do I care for Mrs. Hartley an’ her kerridge an’ dimons an’ fiddle faddle—
