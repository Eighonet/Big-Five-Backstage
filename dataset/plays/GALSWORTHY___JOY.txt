#MRS. HOPE.
I told Molly in my letter that she'd have to walk up, Tom.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Walk up in this heat? My dear, why didn't you order Benson's fly?
#MRS. HOPE.
Expense for nothing! Bob can bring up her things in the barrow. I've told Joy I won't have her going down to meet the train. She's so excited about her mother's coming there's no doing anything with her.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
No wonder, after two months.
#MRS. HOPE.
Well, she's going home to - morrow; she must just keep herself fresh for the dancing tonight. I'm not going to get people in to dance, and have Joy worn out before they begin.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I don't like Molly's walking up. great strong woman like Molly Gwyn! It isn't half a mile.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I don't like it, Nell; it's not hospitable.
#MRS. HOPE.
Rubbish! If you want to throw away money, you must just find some better investment than those wretched 3 per cents. of yours. The greenflies are in my roses already! Did you ever see anything so disgusting? Where's the syringe? I saw you mooning about with it last night, Tom.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Mooning! There's an account of that West Australian swindle. Set of ruffians! Listen to this, Nell! "It is understood that amongst the share - holders are large numbers of women, clergymen, and Army officers." How people can be such fools!
#MRS. HOPE.
I simply won't have Dick keep his fishing things in the tree; there's a whole potful of disgusting worms. I can't touch them. You must go and take 'em out, Tom.
#MRS. HOPE.
What on earth's the pleasure of it? I can't see! He never catches anything worth eating.
#MRS. HOPE.
Don't put them near me!
#MISS BEECH.
Don't hurt the poor creatures.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Hallo, Peachey? What are you doing round there?
#MRS. HOPE.
Tom, take the worms off that seat at once!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Good gad! I don't know what to do with the beastly worms!
#MRS. HOPE.
It's not my business to look after Dick's worms. Don't put them on the ground. I won't have them anywhere where they can crawl about.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Dash!
#MISS BEECH.
Give them to me.
#MRS. HOPE.
Yes, give them to Peachey.
#MISS BEECH.
Poor creatures!
#MRS. HOPE.
Well, it's beyond me how you can make pets of worms - wriggling, crawling, horrible things! What about Miss joy's frock, Rose?
#ROSE.
Please, 'm, I can't get on with the back without Miss Joy.
#MRS. HOPE.
Well, then you must just find her. I don't know where she is.
#ROSE.
If you please, Mum, I think Miss Joy's up in the -
#MRS. HOPE.
What is it, Peachey?
#MISS BEECH.
Pricked meself!
#MRS. HOPE.
Let's look!
#ROSE.
If you please, Mum, it's below the waist; I think I can manage with the dummy.
#MRS. HOPE.
Well, you can try. Here's Molly about her train.
#MISS BEECH.
Is there a letter for me?
#MRS. HOPE.
No, Peachey.
#MISS BEECH.
There never is.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
What's that? You got four by the first post.
#MISS BEECH.
Exceptions!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Why! You know, you get 'em every day!
#MRS. HOPE.
Molly says she'll be down by the eleven thirty. She'll be here in half an hour! "MAURICE LEVER is coming down by the same train to see Mr. Henty about the Tocopala Gold Mine. Could you give him a bed for the night?"
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Of course we must give him a bed!
#MRS. HOPE.
Just like a man! What room I should like to know!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Pink.
#MRS. HOPE.
As if Molly wouldn't have the pink!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I thought she'd have the blue!
#MRS. HOPE.
You know perfectly well it's full of earwigs, Tom. I killed ten there yesterday morning.
#MISS BEECH.
Poor creatures!
#MRS. HOPE.
I don't know that I approve of this Mr. Lever's dancing attendance. Molly's only thirty - six.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
You can't refuse him a bed; I never heard of such a thing.
#MRS. HOPE.
"This gold mine seems to be a splendid chance. I've put all my spare cash into it. They're issuing some Preference shares now; if Uncle Tom wants an investment" - Well, I suppose I shall have to screw him in somehow.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
What's that about gold mines? Gambling nonsense! Molly ought to know my views.
#MRS. HOPE.
Oh! your views! This may be a specially good chance.
#MISS BEECH.
Ahem! Special case!
#MRS. HOPE.
I 'm sick of these 3 per cent. dividends. When you've only got so little money, to put it all into that India Stock, when it might be earning 6 per cent. at least, quite safely! There are ever so many things I want.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
There you go!
#MRS. HOPE.
As to Molly, I think it's high time her husband came home to look after her, instead of sticking out there in that hot place. In fact I don't know what Geoff's about; why doesn't he find something in England, where they could live together.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Don't say anything against Molly, Nell!
#MRS. HOPE.
Well, I don't believe in husband and wife being separated. That's not my idea of married life. Ah, yes, she's your niece, not mime! Molly's very -
#MISS BEECH.
Ouch!
#MRS. HOPE.
Well, if I couldn't sew at your age, Peachey, without pricking my fingers! Tom, if I have Mr. Lever here, you'll just attend to what I say and look into that mine!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Look into your grandmother! I have n't made a study of geology for nothing. For every ounce you take out of a gold mine, you put an ounce and a half in. Any fool knows that, eh, Peachey?
#MISS BEECH.
I hate your horrid mines, with all the poor creatures underground.
#MRS. HOPE.
Nonsense, Peachey! As if they'd go there if they did n't want to!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Why don't you read your paper, then you'd see what a lot of wild - cat things there are about.
#MRS. HOPE.
I can't put Ernest and Letty in the blue room, there's only the single bed. Suppose I put Mr. Lever there, and say nothing about the earwigs. I daresay he'll never notice.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Treat a guest like that!
#MRS. HOPE.
Then where am I to put him for goodness sake?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Put him in my dressing - room, I'll turn out.
#MRS. HOPE.
Rubbish, Tom, I won't have you turned out, that's flat. He can have Joy's room, and she can sleep with the earwigs.
#JOY.
I won't.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
God bless my soul!
#MRS. HOPE.
You wretched girl! I told you never to climb that tree again. Did you know, Peachey? She's always up there, spoiling all her frocks. Come down now, Joy; there's a good child!
#JOY.
I don't want to sleep with earwigs, Aunt Nell.
#MISS BEECH.
I'll sleep with the poor creatures.
#MRS.
HOPE, Well, it would be a mercy if you would for once, Peachey.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Nonsense, I won't have Peachey -
#MRS. HOPE.
Well, who is to sleep there then?
#JOY.
Let me sleep with Mother, Aunt Nell, do!
#MRS. HOPE.
Litter her up with a great girl like you, as if we'd only one spare room! Tom, see that she comes down - I can't stay here, I must manage something.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
You heard what your aunt said?
#JOY.
Oh, Uncle Tom!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I shall have to come up after you.
#JOY.
Oh, do, and Peachey too!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Peachey, you talk to her. What'll your aunt say to me if I don't get you down?
#MISS BEECH.
Poor creature!
#JOY.
I don't want to be worried about my frock.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Well, I shall catch it.
#JOY.
Oh, Uncle Tom, your head is so beautiful from here!
#MISS BEECH.
Disrespectful little toad!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
You'll fall out, and a pretty mess that'll make on - my lawn!
#JOY.
There's Dick calling you, Uncle Tom.
#DICK.
Ernie's waiting to play you that single, Colonel!
#JOY.
Quick, Uncle Tom! Oh! do go, before he finds I 'm up here.
#MISS. BEECH.
Secret little creature!
#JOY.
I'm coming down now, Peachey. Look out! I'm dropping on your head.
#MISS BEECH.
Don't hurt yourself! Let's see!
#JOY.
Ugh!
#MISS BEECH.
What's the matter with the poor creatures?
#JOY.
They're so wriggly!
#MISS BEECH.
Five years.
#JOY.
Was she as bad to teach as me?
#MISS BEECH.
Worse! She was the worst girl I ever taught.
#JOY.
Then you weren't fond of her?
#MISS BEECH.
Oh! yes, I was.
#JOY.
Fonder than of me?
#MISS BEECH.
Don't you ask such a lot of questions.
#JOY.
Peachey, duckie, what was Mother's worst fault?
#MISS BEECH.
Doing what she knew she oughtn't.
#JOY.
Was she ever sorry?
#MISS BEECH.
Yes, but she always went on doin' it.
#JOY.
I think being sorry 's stupid!
#MISS BEECH.
Oh, do you?
#JOY.
It isn't any good. Was Mother revengeful, like me?
#MISS BEECH.
Ah! Wasn't she?
#JOY.
And jealous?
#MISS BEECH.
The most jealous girl I ever saw.
#JOY.
I like to be like her.
#MISS BEECH.
Yes! you've got all your troubles before you.
#JOY.
Mother was married at eighteen, wasn't she, Peachey? Was she - was she much in love with Father then?
#MISS BEECH.
About as much as usual.
#JOY.
They don't get on now, you know.
#MISS BEECH.
What d'you mean by that, disrespectful little creature?
#JOY.
They haven't ever since I've known them.
#MISS BEECH.
Don't talk about such things.
#JOY.
I suppose you don't know Mr. Lever? He's such a cool beast. He never loses his temper.
#MISS BEECH.
Is that why you don't like him?
#JOY.
No - yes - I don't know.
#MISS BEECH.
Oh! perhaps you do like him?
#JOY.
I don't; I hate him.
#MISS BEECH.
Fie! Naughty Temper!
#JOY.
Well, so would you! He takes up all Mother's time.
#MISS BEECH.
Oh! does he?
#JOY.
When he comes I might just as well go to bed. And now he's chosen to - day to come down here, when I haven't seen her for two months! Why couldn't he come when Mother and I'd gone home. It's simply brutal!
#MISS BEECH.
But your mother likes him?
#JOY.
I don't want her to like him.
#MISS BEECH.
I see!
#JOY.
What are you doing, Peachey?
#MISS BEECH.
Letting the poor creatures go.
#JOY.
If I tell Dick he'll never forgive you.
#MISS BEECH.
Ah - h - h! You've done your hair up; so that's why you wouldn't come down!
#JOY.
I didn't want any one to see before Mother. You are a pig, Peachey!
#MISS BEECH.
I thought there was something!
#JOY.
How does it look?
#MISS BEECH.
I've seen better.
#JOY.
You tell any one before Mother comes, and see what I do!
#MISS BEECH.
Well, don't you tell about my worms, then!
#JOY.
Give me my hat! Look out! Dick!
#MISS BEECH.
Oh! dear!
#JOY.
I hope the worms will crawl up your legs!
#DICK.
The Colonel's getting licked. Hallo! Peachey, in the swing?
#JOY.
Swing her, Dick!
#MISS BEECH.
Little creature!
#JOY.
Swing her!
#MISS BEECH.
It makes me sick, young man.
#DICK.
All right, Peachey.
#MISS BEECH.
Could you get me my sewing from the seat? Just behind Joy.
#JOY.
If you do, I won't dance with you to - night.
#JOY.
Look what she's got behind her, sly old thing!
#MISS BEECH.
Oh! dear!
#JOY.
Dance with her, Dick!
#MISS BEECH.
If he dare!
#JOY.
Dance with her, or I won't dance with you to - night.
#DICK.
Come on then, Peachey. We must.
#JOY.
Dance, dance! Oh, Peachey, Oh! No, no! I won't!
#MISS BEECH.
Dance, dance with the poor young man! La la - la - la la - la la la!
#DICK.
By Jove, Joy! You've done your hair up. I say, how jolly! You do look -
#JOY.
I did n't mean you to see!
#DICK.
Oh! didn't you? I'm awfully sorry!
#JOY.
Oh, you old Peachey!
#MISS BEECH.
Oh! dear!
#JOY.
She's been letting out your worms. Look!
#DICK.
Hang the worms! Joy, promise me the second and fourth and sixth and eighth and tenth and supper, to - night. Promise! Do! It's not much to ask.
#JOY.
I won't promise anything.
#DICK.
Why not?
#JOY.
Because Mother's coming. I won't make any arrangements.
#DICK.
It's our last night.
#JOY.
You don't understand! Mother's coming, Mother's coming!
#DICK.
I wish - Promise, Joy!
#JOY.
Sly old thing! If you'll pay Peachey out, I'll promise you supper!
#MISS BEECH.
I hear you.
#JOY.
Pay her out, pay her out! She's let out all your worms!
#DICK.
I say, is it true that Maurice Lever's coming with your mother? I've met him playing cricket, he's rather a good sort.
#JOY.
I hate him.
#DICK.
Do you? Why? I thought - I didn't know - if I'd known of course, I'd have -
#JOY.
Oh! Dick, hide me, I don't want my hair seen till Mother comes.
#ERNEST.
The ball was out, Colonel.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Nothing of the sort. good foot out.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
It was not, sir. I saw the chalk fly.
#ERNEST.
I was nearer to it than you.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I don't care where you were, I hate a fellow who can't keep cool.
#MISS BEECH.
Fie! Fie!
#ERNEST.
We're two to one, Letty says the ball was out.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Letty's your wife, she'd say anything.
#ERNEST.
Well, look here, Colonel, I'll show you the very place it pitched.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Gammon! You've lost your temper, you don't know what you're talking about.
#ERNEST.
I suppose you'll admit the rule that one umpires one's own court.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Certainly not, in this case!
#MISS BEECH.
Special case!
#ERNEST.
Well, of course if you won't play the game!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
If you lose your temper like this, I 'll never play with you again. Do you mean to say that ball was out, Letty?
#LETTY.
Of course it was, Father.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
You say that because he's your husband. If your mother'd been there she'd have backed me up!
#LETTY.
Mother wants Joy, Dick, about her frock. don't know where she is.
#MISS BEECH.
Ahem!
#LETTY.
What's the matter, Peachey?
#MISS BEECH.
Swallowed a fly. Poor creature!
#ERNEST.
Why I know the ball was out, Colonel, was because it pitched in a line with that arbutus tree.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Arbutus tree! Where's your mother?
#LETTY.
In the blue room, Father.
#ERNEST.
The ball was a good foot out; at the height it was coming when it passed me.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
You're a - you're aa theorist! From where you were you could n't see the ball at all. Where's your mother?
#LETTY.
In the blue room, Father!
#ERNEST.
Your old Dad'll never be a sportsman!
#LETTY.
I wish you wouldn't call Father old, Ernie! What time's Molly coming, Peachey?
#ERNEST.
Your old Dad's only got one fault: he can't take an impersonal view of things.
#MISS BEECH.
Can you find me any one who can?
#ERNEST.
Well, Peachey!
#MISS BEECH.
Oh! of course, there's you!
#ERNEST.
I don't know about that! But -
#ROSE.
Please, Miss, the Missis says will you and Mr. Ernest please to move your things into Miss Peachey's room.
#ERNEST.
Deuce of a nuisance havin' to turn out for this fellow Lever. What did Molly want to bring him for?
#MISS BEECH.
Course you've no personal feeling in the matter!
#ROSE.
The Missis says you're to please move your things into the blue room, please Miss.
#LETTY.
Aha, Peachey! That settles you! Come on, Ernie!
#ERNEST.
Personal, not a bit! I only think while Molly 's out at grass, she oughtn't to -
#MISS BEECH.
Oh! do you?
#ROSE.
The Missis says you're to take all your worms and things, Sir, and put them where they won't be seen.
#DICK.
Have n't got any!
#ROSE.
The Missis says she'll be very angry if you don't put your worms away; and would you come and help kill earwigs in the blue - ?
#DICK.
Hang!
#ROSE.
Please, Miss Joy, the Missis says will you go to her about your frock.
#JOY.
No - o!
#ROSE.
If you did n't come, I was to tell you she was going to put you in the blue. Oh, Miss joy, you've done your hair up! Please, Miss, what shall I tell the Missis?
#JOY.
Anything you like.
#ROSE.
I shall be drove to tell her a story, Miss.
#JOY.
All right! Tell it.
#DICK.
Joy! I wanted to say something I shan't see you again you know after to - morrow till I come up for the 'Varsity match.
#JOY.
But that's next week.
#DICK.
Must you go home to - morrow? I shall miss you so awfully. You don't know how I - Do look at me! Oh! Joy!
#JOY.
Don't!
#DICK.
Oh, Joy! Can't you -
#JOY.
Oh! don't.
#DICK.
It's - it's - so -
#JOY.
Don't, Dick!
#DICK.
But I can't help it! It's too much for me, Joy, I must tell you -
#JOY.
It's Mother - oh, Mother!
#MRS. GWYN.
How sweet you look with your hair up, Joy! Who 's this?
#JOY.
Dick Merton - in my letters you know.
#MRS. GWYN.
How do you do?
#DICK.
How d 'you do? I think if you'll excuse me - I'll go in.
#MRS. GWYN.
What's the matter with him?
#JOY.
Oh, nothing! Mother! You do look such a duck. Why did you come by the towing - path, was n't it cooking?
#MRS. GWYN.
Mr. Lever wanted to go into Mr. Henty's.
#JOY.
Oh! Is he - is he really coming here, Mother?
#MRS. GWYN.
If Aunt Nell's got a room for him - of course - why not?
#MRS. GWYN.
You are a quaint child - when I was your age -
#JOY.
Oh! Mother, you must have been a chook!
#MRS. GWYN.
Well, I was about twice as old as you, I know that.
#JOY.
Had you any - any other offers before you were married, Mother?
#MRS. GWYN.
Heaps!
#JOY.
Oh!
#MRS. GWYN.
Why? Have you been having any?
#JOY.
N - o, of course not!
#MRS. GWYN.
Where are they all? Where's Peachey?
#JOY.
Fussing about somewhere; don't let's hurry! Oh! you duckie - duckie! Aren't there any letters from Dad?
#MRS. GWYN.
Yes, one or two.
#JOY.
Can't I see?
#MRS. GWYN.
I didn't bring them. Help me to tidy - I'm so hot I don't know what to do.
#JOY.
How lovely it'll be to - morrow - going home!
#MRS. GWYN.
London's dreadfully stuffy, Joy. You 'll only get knocked up again.
#JOY.
Oh! but Mother, I must come.
#MRS. GWYN.
Oh, well, if you must, you must! Don't rumple me again. Here's Uncle Tom.
#JOY.
Mother, we're going to dance tonight; promise to dance with me - there are three more girls than men, at least - and don't dance too much with - with - you know - because I'm - jealous.
#MRS. GWYN.
You are funny!
#JOY.
I haven't made any engagements because of you.
#MRS. GWYN.
Well, Uncle Tom?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Why, Molly! What made you come by the towing - path?
#JOY.
Because it's so much cooler, of course.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Hallo! What's the matter with you? Phew! you've got your hair up! Go and tell your aunt your mother's on the lawn. Cut along! Cracked about you, Molly! Simply cracked! We shall miss her when you take her off to - morrow. Sit down, sit down, you must be tired in this heat. I 've sent Bob for your things with the wheelbarrow; what have you got? - only a bag, I suppose.
#MRS. GWYN.
That's all, Uncle Tom, except - my trunk and hat - box.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Phew! And what's - his - name brought a bag, I suppose?
#MRS. GWYN.
They're all together. I hope it's not too much, Uncle Tom.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Oh! Bob'll manage! I suppose you see a good deal of - of - Lever. That's his brother in the Guards, isn't it?
#MRS. GWYN.
Yes.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Now what does this chap do?
#MRS. GWYN.
What should he do, Uncle Tom? He's a Director.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Guinea - pig! Your bringing him down was a good idea. I should like to have a look at him. But, I say, you know, Molly - mines, mines! There are a lot of these chaps about, whose business is to cook their own dinners. Your aunt thinks -
#MRS. GWYN.
Oh! Uncle Tom, don't tell me what Aunt Nell thinks!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Well - well! Look here, old girl! It's my experience never to - what I mean is - never to trust too much to a man who has to do with mining. I've always refused to have anything to do with mines. If your husband were in England, of course, I'd say nothing.
#MRS. GWYN.
We'd better keep him out of the question, had n't we?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Of course, if you wish it, my dear.
#MRS. GWYN.
Unfortunately, I do.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Ah! yes, I know; but look here, Molly, your aunt thinks you're in a very delicate position - in fact, she thinks you see too much of young Lever.
#MRS. GWYN.
Does she? And what do you think? I make a point of not thinking. I only know that here he is, and I don't want you to go burning your fingers, eh? gold mine's a gold mine. I don't mean he deliberately - but they take in women and parsons, and - and all sorts of fools. And then, you know, I can't tell your feelings, my dear, and I don't want to; but a man about town 'll compromise a woman as soon as he'll look at her, and I don't like that, Molly! It 's not the thing! If - if you were any other woman I should n't care - and if - if you were a plain woman, damme, you might do what you liked! I know you and Geoff don't get on; but here's this child of yours, devoted to you, and - and don't you see, old girl? Eh?
#MRS. GWYN.
Thanks! Perfectly! I suppose as you don't think, Uncle Tom, it never occurred to you that I have rather a lonely time of it.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Oh! my dear, yes, of course I know it must be beastly.
#MRS. GWYN.
It is.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Yes, yes! I don't know what I 'm talking like this for! It's your aunt! She goes on at me till she gets on my nerves. What d' you think she wants me to do now? Put money into this gold mine! Did you ever hear such folly?
#MRS. GWYN.
Oh! Uncle Tom!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
All very well for you to laugh, Molly!
#MRS. GWYN.
And how much are you going to put in?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Not a farthing! Why, I've got nothing but my pension and three thousand India stock!
#MRS. GWYN.
Only ninety pounds a year, besides your pension! D' you mean to say that's all you've got, Uncle Tom? I never knew that before. What a shame!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
It is a, d - d shame! I don't suppose there's another case in the army of a man being treated as I've been.
#MRS. GWYN.
But how on earth do you manage here on so little?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Your aunt's very funny. She's a born manager. She 'd manage the hind leg off a donkey; but if I want five shillings for a charity or what not, I have to whistle for it. And then all of a sudden, Molly, she'll take it into her head to spend goodness knows what on some trumpery or other and come to me for the money. If I have n't got it to give her, out she flies about 3 per cent., and worries me to invest in some wild - cat or other, like your friend's thing, the Jaco what is it? I don't pay the slightest attention to her.
#MRS. HOPE.
Tom!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Yes, dear! I say, Molly, don't you mind what I said about young Lever. I don't want you to imagine that I think harm of people - you know I don't - but so many women come to grief, and - I can't stand men about town; not that he of course -
#MRS.
HOPE, Tom!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I find it best to let your aunt run on. If she says anything -
#MRS. HOPE.
To - om!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Yes, dear!
#MRS. HOPE.
Well, how was I to know?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Did n't Joy come and tell you?
#MRS. HOPE.
I don't know what's the matter with that child? Well, Molly, so here you are. You're before your time - that train's always late.
#MRS. GWYN.
I'm sorry, Aunt Nell!
#MRS. HOPE.
What have you done with Mr. Lever? I shall have to put him in Peachey's room. Tom's got no champagne.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
They've a very decent brand down at the George, Molly, I'll send Bob over -
#MRS. HOPE.
Rubbish, Tom! He'll just have to put up with what he can get!
#MRS. GWYN.
Of course! He's not a snob! For goodness sake, Aunt Nell, don't put yourself out! I'm sorry I suggested his coming.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
My dear, we ought to have champagne in the house - in case of accident.
#MRS. GWYN.
No, please, Uncle Tom!
#MRS. HOPE.
Now, I've told your uncle, Molly, that he's not to go in for this gold mine without making certain it's a good thing. Mind, I think you've been very rash. I'm going to give you a good talking to; and that's not all - you ought n't to go about like this with a young man; he's not at all bad looking. I remember him perfectly well at the Fleming's dance.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Nell!
#MRS. HOPE.
No, Tom, I'm going to talk to Molly; she's old enough to know better.
#MRS. GWYN.
Yes?
#MRS. HOPE.
Yes, and you'll get yourself into a mess; I don't approve of it, and when I see a thing I don't approve of -
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Nell, I won't have it, I simply won't have it.
#MRS. HOPE.
What rate of interest are these Preference shares to pay?
#MRS. GWYN.
Ten per cent.
#MRS. HOPE.
What did I tell you, Tom? And are they safe?
#MRS. GWYN.
You'd better ask Maurice.
#MRS. HOPE.
There, you see, you call him Maurice! Now supposing your uncle went in for some of them -
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I'm not going in for anything of the sort.
#MRS. HOPE.
Don't swing your hat by the brim! Go and look if you can see him coming! Your uncle's getting very bald. I 've only shoulder of lamb for lunch, and a salad. It's lucky it's too hot to eat. Here she is, Peachey!
#MISS BEECH.
I see her.
#MRS. GWYN.
Well, Peachey! What d 'you make of me?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
There's a white hat crossing the second stile. Is that your friend, Molly?
#MRS. HOPE.
Oh! before I forget, Peachey - Letty and Ernest can move their things back again. I'm going to put Mr. Lever in your room. There's that disgusting paint pot! Take it up at once, Tom, and put it in the tree.
#MRS. HOPE.
Not there!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Well, where then?
#MRS. HOPE.
Why - up - oh! gracious!
#MRS. HOPE.
No - oh!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Well, dash it then! What do you want?
#MRS. GWYN.
Peachey, may I introduce Mr. Lever to you? Miss Beech, my old governess.
#LEVER.
How do you do?
#MISS BEECH.
Pleased to meet you.
#MRS. GWYN.
This is my uncle and my aunt. They're taking exercise, I think.
#MRS. HOPE.
So you 've got here! Are n't you very hot? - Tom!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Brought a splendid day with you! Splendid!
#MISS BEECH.
Thunder!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Thunder? Nonsense, Peachey, you're always imagining something. Look at the sky!
#MISS BEECH.
Thunder!
#MRS. HOPE.
Joy, don't you see Mr. Lever?
#LEVER.
How are you, Joy? Have n't seen you for an age!
#JOY.
I am very well, thank you.
#LEVER.
Of course, if this level peters out to the West we shall be in a tightish place; you know what a mine is at this stage, Colonel Hope.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Yes, yes. What is there to prevent its running out here to the East?
#LEVER.
Well, nothing, except that as a matter of fact it doesn't.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I'm very glad you showed me these papers, very glad! I say that it's a most astonishing thing if the ore suddenly stops there. I'm not an expert, but you ought to prove that ground to the East more thoroughly.
#LEVER.
Of course, sir, if you advise that -
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
If it were mine, I'd no more sit down under the belief that the ore stopped there than I 'd - There's a harmony in these things.
#LEVER.
I can only tell you what our experts say.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Ah! Experts! No faith in them - never had! Miners, lawyers, theologians, cowardly lot - pays them to be cowardly. When they have n't their own axes to grind, they've got their theories; a theory's a dangerous thing. Now my theory is, you 're in strata here of what we call the Triassic Age.
#LEVER.
Ah!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
You've struck a fault, that's what's happened. The ore may be as much as thirty or forty yards out; but it 's there, depend on it.
#LEVER.
Would you back that opinion, sir?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I never give an opinion that I'm not prepared to back. I want to get to the bottom of this. What's to prevent the gold going down indefinitely?
#LEVER.
Nothing, so far as I know.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Eh!
#LEVER.
All I can tell you is: This is as far as we've got, and we want more money before we can get any farther.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Yes, yes; that's very usual.
#LEVER.
If you ask my personal opinion I think it's very doubtful that the gold does go down.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Oh! a personal opinion a matter of this sort!
#LEVER.
Perhaps we'd better close the sitting, sir; sorry to have bored you.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Now, now! Don't be so touchy! If I'm to put money in, I'm bound to look at it all round.
#LEVER.
Please don't imagine that I want you to put money in.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Confound it, sir! D 'you suppose I take you for a Company promoter?
#LEVER.
Thank you!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
You've got Irish blood in you - um? You're so hasty!
#LEVER.
If you 're really thinking of taking shares - my advice to you is, don't!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
If this were an ordinary gold mine, I wouldn't dream of looking at it, I want you to understand that. Nobody has a greater objection to gold mines than I.
#LEVER.
But it is a gold mine, Colonel Hope.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I know, I know; but I 've been into it for myself; I've formed my opinion personally. Now, what 's the reason you don't want me to invest?
#LEVER.
Well, if it doesn't turn out as you expect, you'll say it's my doing. I know what investors are.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
If it were a Westralian or a Kaffir I would n't touch it with a pair of tongs! It 's not as if I were going to put much in! I like these Triassic formations!
#LEVER.
That young man seems depressed.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I don't like mines, never have! I tell you what, Lever - this thing's got tremendous possibilities. You don't seem to believe in it enough. No mine's any good without faith; until I see for myself, however, I shan't commit myself beyond a thousand.
#LEVER.
Are you serious, sir?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Certainly! I've been thinking it over ever since you told me Henty had fought shy. I 've a poor opinion of Henty. He's one of those fellows that says one thing and does another. An opportunist!
#LEVER.
I'm afraid we're all that, more or less. man never knows what he is himself. There 's my wife. She thinks she 's - By the way, don't say anything to her about this, please. And, Lever , I don't think, you know, this is quite the sort of thing for my niece.
#LEVER.
I agree. I mean to get her out of it.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Ah! You know, she - she's in a very delicate position, living by herself in London. You see a good deal of her? If it had n't been for Joy growing so fast, we shouldn't have had the child down here. Her mother ought to have her with her. Eh! Don't you think so?
#LEVER.
Mrs. Gwyn always seems to me to get on all right.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
You know, I've found that when a woman's living alone and unprotected, the very least thing will set a lot of hags and jackanapes talking. The more unprotected and helpless a woman is, the more they revel in it. If there's anything I hate in this world, it's those wretched creatures who babble about their neighbours' affairs.
#LEVER.
I agree with you.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
One ought to be very careful not to give them - that is - - I suppose you and Joy get on all right?
#LEVER.
Pretty well, thanks. I'm not exactly in Joy's line; have n't seen very much of her, in fact.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Wonderfully affectionate little thing! Well, she'll be going home to - morrow!
#MISS BEECH.
Talkin' business, poor creatures?
#LEVER.
Oh, no! If you'll excuse me, I'll wash my hands before tea.
#MISS BEECH.
I see your horrid papers.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Be quiet, Peachey!
#MISS BEECH.
On a beautiful summer's day, too.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
That'll do now.
#MISS BEECH.
For every ounce you take out of a gold mine you put two in.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Who told you that rubbish?
#MISS BEECH.
You did!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
This is n't an ordinary gold mine.
#MISS BEECH.
Oh! quite a special thing.
#ROSE.
If you please, sir, the Missis told me to lay the tea.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Go away! Ten fives fifty. Ten 5 16ths, Peachey?
#MISS BEECH.
I hate your nasty sums!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
What do you want?
#LETTY.
Tea, Father.
#ERNEST.
That Johnny - bird Lever is too cocksure for me, Colonel. Those South American things are no good at all. I know all about them from young Scrotton. There's not one that's worth a red cent. If you want a flutter -
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Flutter! I'm not a gambler, sir!
#ERNEST.
Well, Colonel , I only don't want you to chuck your money away on a stiff 'un. If you want anything good you should go to Mexico.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Go to What d'you call that, eh? M - E - X -
#ERNEST.
It all depend on what part.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
You think you know everything - you think nothing's right unless it's your own idea! Be good enough to keep your advice to yourself.
#ERNEST.
If you ask me, I should say it wasn't playing the game to put Molly into a thing like that.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
What do you mean, sir?
#ERNEST.
Any Juggins can see that she's a bit gone on our friend.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Indeed!
#ERNEST.
He's not at all the sort of Johnny that appeals to me.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Really?
#ERNEST.
If I were you, Colonel, I should tip her the wink. He was hanging about her at Ascot all the time. It 's a bit thick!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Jackanapes!
#MRS. HOPE.
Don't stand there, Tom; clear those papers, and let Rose lay the table. Now, Ernest, go and get another chair.
#MRS. BEECH.
Poor creature!
#ERNEST.
Ask any Johnny in the City, he 'll tell you Mexico's a very tricky country - the people are awful rotters
#MRS. HOPE.
Put that chair down, Ernest. What's he been talking about? You oughtn't to get so excited, Tom; is your head bad, old man? Here, take these papers! Peachey, go in and tell them tea 'll be ready in a minute, there 's a good soul? Oh! and on my dressing table you'll find a bottle of Eau de Cologne.
#MRS. BEECH.
Don't let him get in a temper again. That 's three times to - day!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Never met such a fellow in my life, the most opinionated, narrow - minded - thinks he knows everything. Whatever Letty could see in him I can't think. Pragmatical beggar!
#MRS. HOPE.
Now Tom! What have you been up to, to get into a state like this?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I shall lose my temper with him one of these days. He's got that confounded habit of thinking nobody can be right but himself.
#MRS. HOPE.
That's enough! I want to talk to you seriously! Dick's in love. I'm perfectly certain of it.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Love! Who's he in love with - Peachey?
#MRS. HOPE.
You can see it all over him. If I saw any signs of Joy's breaking out, I'd send them both away. I simply won't have it.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Why, she's a child!
#MRS. HOPE.
But she isn't - not yet. I've been watching her very carefully. She's more in love with her Mother than any one, follows her about like a dog! She's been quite rude to Mr. Lever.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I don't believe a word of it.
#MRS. HOPE.
Don't believe a word of what? If I thought there was anything between Molly and Mr. Lever, d 'you suppose I'd have him in the house? He's a very nice fellow; and I want you to pump him well, Tom, and see what there is in this mine.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Pump!
#MRS. HOPE.
Yes, you 've been up to something! Now what is it?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Pump my own guest! I never heard of such a thing!
#MRS. HOPE.
There you are on your high horse! I do wish you had a little common - sense, Tom!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I'd as soon you asked me to sneak about eavesdropping! Pump!
#MRS. HOPE.
Well, what were you looking at these papers for? It does drive me so wild the way you throw away all the chances you have of making a little money. I've got you this opportunity, and you do nothing but rave up and down, and talk nonsense!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Much you know about it! I 've taken a thousand shares in this mine
#MRS. HOPE.
You 've - WHAT? Without consulting me? Well, then, you 'll just go and take them out again!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
You want me to - ?
#MRS. HOPE.
The idea! As if you could trust your judgment in a thing like that! You 'll just go at once and say there was a mistake; then we 'll talk it over calmly.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Go back on what I 've said? Not if I lose every penny! First you worry me to take the shares, and then you worry me not - I won't have it, Nell, I won't have it!
#MRS. HOPE.
Well, if I'd thought you'd have forgotten what you said this morning and turned about like this, d'you suppose I'd have spoken to you at all? Now, do you?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Rubbish! If you can't see that this is a special opportunity!
#LETTY.
What's the matter with everybody? Is it the heat?
#ERNEST.
That sportsman, Lever, you know, ought to be warned off.
#LETTY.
Where's Miss Joy, Rose?
#ROSE.
Don't know, Miss.
#LETTY.
Ernie, be careful, you never know where Joy is.
#ERNEST.
Your old Dad 's as mad as a hatter with me.
#LETTY.
Why?
#ERNEST.
Well, I merely said what I thought, that Molly ought to look out what's she's doing, and he dropped on me like a cartload of bricks.
#LETTY.
The Dad's very fond of Molly.
#ERNEST.
But look here, d'you mean to tell me that she and Lever are n't -
#LETTY.
Don't! Suppose they are! If joy were to hear it'd be simply awful. I like Molly. I 'm not going to believe anything against her. I don't see the use of it. If it is, it is, and if it is n't, it is n't.
#ERNEST.
Well, all I know is that when I told her the mine was probably a frost she went for me like steam.
#LETTY.
Well, so should I. She was only sticking up for her friends.
#ERNEST.
Ask the old Peachey - bird. She knows a thing or two. Look here, I don't mind a man's being a bit of a sportsman, but I think Molly's bringin' him down here is too thick. Your old Dad's got one of his notions that because this Josser's his guest, he must keep him in a glass case, and take shares in his mine, and all the rest of it.
#LETTY.
I do think people are horrible, always thinking things. It's not as if Molly were a stranger. She's my own cousin. I 'm not going to believe anything about my own cousin. I simply won't.
#ERNEST.
I suppose it does make a difference, her bein' your cousin.
#LETTY.
Of course it does! I only hope to goodness no one will make Joy suspect -
#JOY.
Where 's Mother? Isn't she here?
#MRS. HOPE.
Now Joy, come and sit down; your mother's been told tea's ready; if she lets it get cold it's her lookout.
#DICK.
Plenty of room, Joy.
#JOY.
I don't believe Mother knows, Aunt Nell.
#LETTY.
Look, Ernie! Four couples and Peachey -
#ERNEST.
What couples?
#JOY.
Oh! Mums, here you are!
#MRS. HOPE.
Hand the sandwiches to Mr. Lever, Peachey. It's our own jam, Mr. Lever.
#LEVER.
Thanks. It's splendid!
#MRS. GWYN.
It's the first time I've ever seen you eat jam.
#LEVER.
Really! But I love it.
#MRS. GWYN.
You always refuse mine.
#JOY.
I'm all burnt up! Are n't you simply boiled, Mother?
#MRS. GWYN.
Ugh! You're quite clammy, Joy.
#JOY.
It's enough to make any one clammy.
#ERNEST.
I say, you know, the glass is going down.
#LEVER.
The glass in the hall's steady enough.
#ERNEST.
Oh, I never go by that; that's a rotten old glass.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Oh! is it?
#ERNEST.
I've got a little ripper - never puts you in the cart. Bet you what you like we have thunder before tomorrow night.
#MISS BEECH.
You don't think we shall have it before to - night, do you?
#LEVER.
I beg your pardon; did you speak to me?
#MISS BEECH.
I said, you don't think we shall have the thunder before to - night, do you?
#LEVER.
Really, I don't see any signs of it.
#MISS BEECH.
People don't often see what they don't want to, do they?
#MRS. GWYN.
What are you talking about? The weather's perfect.
#MISS BEECH.
Isn't it?
#MRS. HOPE.
You'd better make a good tea, Peachey; nobody'll get anything till eight, and then only cold shoulder. You must just put up with no hot dinner, Mr. Lever.
#LEVER.
Whatever is good enough for Miss Beech is good enough for me.
#MISS BEECH.
So you think!
#MRS. GWYN.
Don't be so absurd, Peachey.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I see the name of your engineer is Rodriguez - Italian, eh?
#LEVER.
Portuguese.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Don't like that!
#LEVER.
I believe he was born in England.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Oh, was he? Ah!
#ERNEST.
Awful rotters, those Portuguese!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
There you go!
#LETTY.
Well, Father, Ernie only said what you said.
#MRS. HOPE.
Now I want to ask you, Mr. Lever, is this gold mine safe? If it isn't - I simply won't allow Tom to take these shares; he can't afford it.
#LEVER.
It rather depends on what you call safe, Mrs. Hope.
#MRS. HOPE.
I don't want anything extravagant, of course; if they're going to pay their 10 per cent, regularly, and Tom can have his money out at any time - I only want to know that it's a thoroughly genuine thing.
#MRS. GWYN.
As if Maurice would be a Director if it was n't?
#MRS. HOPE.
Now Molly, I'm simply asking -
#MRS. GWYN.
Yes, you are!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I'll take two thousand of those shares, Lever. To have my wife talk like that - I 'm quite ashamed.
#LEVER.
Oh, come, sir, Mrs. Hope only meant -
#DICK.
Let's go on the river, Joy.
#MRS. HOPE.
Of course! What rubbish, Tom! As if any one ever invested money without making sure!
#LEVER.
It seems a little difficult to make sure in this case. There isn't the smallest necessity for Colonel Hope to take any shares, and it looks to me as if he'd better not.
#MRS. HOPE.
Now, Mr. Lever, don't be offended! I'm very anxious for Tom to take the shares if you say the thing's so good.
#LEVER.
I 'm afraid I must ask to be left out, please.
#JOY.
Mother, if you've finished, do come, I want to show you my room.
#MRS. HOPE.
I would n't say a word, only Tom's so easily taken in.
#MRS. GWYN.
Aunt Nell, how can't you?
#LETTY.
Ernie, will you play Dick and me? Come on, Dick!
#MRS. HOPE.
You ought to know your Uncle by this time, Molly. He's just like a child. He'd be a pauper to - morrow if I did n't see to things.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Understand once for all that I shall take two thousand shares in this mine. I 'm - I 'm humiliated.
#MRS. HOPE.
Well, what on earth have I said?
#MRS. GWYN.
You need n't insult my friends!
#MISS BEECH.
Molly! Take care, Molly, take care! The child! Can't you see? Take care, Molly, take care!
#LEVER.
Awfully hot, is n't it?
#MISS BEECH.
Ah! and it'll be hotter if we don't mind.
#LEVER.
Do we control these things? Extraordinary old lady! What's the matter with her, Molly?
#MRS.
GWYN, Oh! Peachey's a character!
#LEVER.
So I see!
#MRS. GWYN.
Maurice!
#LEVER.
Yes.
#MRS. GWYN.
Aunt Nell's hopeless, you mustn't mind her.
#LEVER.
My dear girl, I 've too much to bother me to mind trifles like that.
#MRS. GWYN.
Tell me, won't you? month ago you'd have told me soon enough!
#LEVER.
Now, Molly!
#MRS. GWYN.
Ah! The Spring's soon over.
#LEVER.
It 's always Spring between us.
#MRS. GWYN.
Is it?
#LEVER.
You did n't tell me what you were thinking about just now when you sat there like stone.
#MRS. GWYN.
It does n't do for a woman to say too much.
#LEVER.
Have I been so bad to you that you need feel like that, Molly?
#MRS. GWYN.
Oh! my dear, it's only that I'm so -
#LEVER.
So what?
#MRS. GWYN.
It's hateful here.
#LEVER.
I didn't want to come. I don't understand why you suggested it. It's been a mistake.
#MRS. GWYN.
Joy comes home to - morrow. I thought if I brought you here - I should know -
#LEVER.
Um!
#MRS. GWYN.
Can't you SEE? It haunts me? How are we to go on? I must know - I must know!
#LEVER.
I don't see that my coming -
#MRS. GWYN.
I thought I should have more confidence; I thought I should be able to face it better in London, if you came down here openly - and now - I feel I must n't speak or look at you.
#LEVER.
You don't think your Aunt -
#MRS. GWYN.
She! It's only Joy I care about.
#LEVER.
We must be more careful, that's all. We mustn't give ourselves away again, as we were doing just now.
#MRS. GWYN.
When any one says anything horrid to you, I can't help it.
#LEVER.
My dear child, take care! Don't dear, don't! I only meant - Come, Molly, let's be sensible. I want to tell you something about the mine.
#MRS. GWYN.
Yes - let 's talk sensibly, and walk properly in this sensible, proper place.
#JOY.
I hate him! Pig!
#ROSE.
Did you call, Miss?
#JOY.
Not you!
#ROSE.
No, Miss!
#JOY.
Oh! do hurry up, Rose!
#ROSE.
Mr. Dick's coming down the path! Aren't I going to get you to do your frock, Miss Joy?
#JOY.
No.
#ROSE.
What will the Missis say?
#JOY.
Oh, don't be so stuck, Rose!
#DICK.
Come on the river, Joy, just for half an hour, as far as the kingfishers - do! Why not? It 'll be so jolly and cool. I'm most awfully sorry if I worried you this morning. I didn't mean to. I won't again, I promise. Do come! It'll be the last time. I feel it awfully, Joy.
#JOY.
There's nothing to hurt you!
#DICK.
Isn't there - when you're like this?
#JOY.
If you don't like me, why do you follow me about?
#DICK.
What is the matter?
#JOY.
Oh! Don't!
#DICK.
Oh, Joy, what is the matter? Is it the heat?
#JOY.
Yes.
#DICK.
Have some Eau de Cologne. I 'll make you a bandage. It's quite clean.
#JOY.
Oh, Dick, you are so funny!
#DICK.
I can't bear you to feel bad; it puts me off completely. I mean I don't generally make a fuss about people, but when it 's you -
#JOY.
I'm all right.
#DICK.
Is that comfy?
#JOY.
Quite.
#DICK.
I'm not going to stay and worry you. You ought to rest. Only, Joy! Look here! If you want me to do anything for you, any time -
#JOY.
Only to go away. Dick - Dick! I didn't mean that; will you get me some water - irises for this evening?
#DICK.
Won't I? I know where there are some rippers! Are you sure you 're all right. Joy? You 'll just rest here in the shade, won't you, till I come back? - it 'll do you no end of good. I shan't be twenty minutes. You're quite sure you 're all right?
#JOY.
Hateful! Hateful!
#MRS. GWYN.
But I don't see why, Maurice.
#LEVER.
We mean to sell the mine; we must do some more work on it, and for that we must have money.
#MRS. GWYN.
If you only want a little, I should have thought you could have got it in a minute in the City.
#LEVER.
No, no; we must get it privately.
#MRS. GWYN.
Oh! Then it isn't such a good thing!
#LEVER.
Well, we mean to sell it.
#MRS. GWYN.
What about the people who buy?
#LEVER.
My dear girl, they've just as much chance as we had. It 's not my business to think of them. There's YOUR thousand pounds -
#MRS. GWYN.
Don't bother about my money, Maurice. I don't want you to do anything not quite -
#LEVER.
Oh! There's my brother's and my sister's too. I 'm not going to let any of you run any risk. When we all went in for it the thing looked splendid; it 's only the last month that we 've had doubts. What bothers me now is your Uncle. I don't want him to take these shares. It looks as if I'd come here on purpose.
#MRS. GWYN.
Oh! he mustn't take them!
#LEVER.
That 's all very well; but it 's not so simple.
#MRS. GWYN.
But, Maurice, have you told him about the selling?
#LEVER.
It 's a Board secret. I'd no business to tell even you.
#MRS. GWYN.
But he thinks he's taking shares in a good - a permanent thing.
#LEVER.
You can't go into a mining venture without some risk.
#MRS. GWYN.
Oh yes, I know - but - but Uncle Tom is such a dear!
#LEVER.
I can't help his being the sort of man he is. I did n't want him to take these shares; I told him so in so many words. Put yourself in my place, Molly: how can I go to him and say, "This thing may turn out rotten," when he knows I got you to put your money into it?
#MRS. GWYN.
I think he ought to be told about the selling; it 's not fair.
#LEVER.
What on earth made him rush at the thing like that? I don't understand that kind of man.
#MRS. GWYN.
I must tell him, Maurice; I can't let him take the shares without -
#LEVER.
I did n't think you'd give me away, Molly.
#MRS. GWYN.
I don't think I quite understand.
#LEVER.
If you tell the Colonel about this sale the poor old chap will think me a man that you ought to have nothing to do with. Do you want that? You can't act in a case like this as if you 'd only a principle to consider. It 's the - the special circumstances.
#MRS. GWYN.
But you'll be glad to get the money won't you?
#LEVER.
By George! if you're going to take it like this, Molly
#MRS. GWYN.
Don't!
#LEVER.
We may not sell after all, dear, we may find it turn out trumps.
#MRS. GWYN.
I don't want to hear any more. I know women don't understand. It's only that I can't bear any one should think that you -
#LEVER.
For goodness sake don't look like that, Molly! Of course, I'll speak to your Uncle. I'll stop him somehow, even if I have to make a fool of myself. I 'll do anything you want -
#MRS. GWYN.
I feel as if I were being smothered here.
#LEVER.
It 's only for one day.
#MRS. GWYN.
It's not your fault, dear. I ought to have known how it would be. Well, let's go in!
#JOY.
Mother!
#MRS. GWYN.
Oh! here you are!
#JOY.
Yes.
#MRS. GWYN.
Where - have you been? You look dreadfully hot; have you been running?
#JOY.
Yes - no.
#MRS. GWYN.
What's the matter - you 're trembling! Are n't you well, dear?
#JOY.
Yes - I don't know.
#MRS. GWYN.
What is it, darling?
#JOY.
Oh! Mother!
#MRS. GWYN.
I don't understand.
#JOY.
Oh, Mother, let me go back home with you now at once -
#MRS. GWYN.
Why? What on earth -
#JOY.
I can't stay here.
#MRS. GWYN.
But why?
#JOY.
I want to be with you - Oh! Mother, don't you love me?
#MRS. GWYN.
Of course I love you, Joy.
#JOY.
Ah! but you love him more.
#MRS. GWYN.
Love him - whom?
#JOY.
Oh! Mother, I did n't - Oh! don't.
#MRS. GWYN.
You'd better explain what you mean, I think.
#JOY.
I want to get you to - he - he 's - he 'snot - !
#MRS. GWYN.
Really, Joy!
#JOY.
I'll fight against him, and I know there's something wrong about -
#MRS. GWYN.
About what?
#JOY.
Let's tell Uncle Tom, Mother, and go away.
#MRS. GWYN.
Tell Uncle - Tom - what?
#JOY.
About - about - the mine.
#MRS. GWYN.
What about the mine? What do you mean? Have you been spying on me?
#JOY.
No! oh, no!
#MRS. GWYN.
Where were you?
#JOY.
I - I heard something.
#MRS. GWYN.
But you were not spying?
#JOY.
I was n't - I wasn't! I didn't want - to hear. I only heard a little. I couldn't help listening, Mother.
#MRS. GWYN.
Couldn't help listening?
#JOY.
I hate him. I didn't mean to listen, but I hate him.
#MRS. GWYN.
I see. Why do you hate him?
#JOY.
He - he -
#MRS. GWYN.
Yes?
#JOY.
I don't know. Oh! I don't know! But I feel -
#MRS. GWYN.
I can't reason with you. As to what you heard, it 's - ridiculous.
#JOY.
It 's not that. It 's - it 's you!
#MRS. GWYN.
I don't know what you mean.
#JOY.
I wish Dad were here!
#MRS. GWYN.
Do you love your Father as much as me?
#JOY.
Oh! Mother, no - you know I don't.
#MRS. GWYN.
Then why do you want him?
#JOY.
Because of that man.
#MRS. GWYN.
Indeed!
#JOY.
I will never - never make friends with him.
#MRS. GWYN.
I have not asked you to.
#JOY.
Oh, Mother! Mother - won't you? Let's tell Uncle Tom and go away from him?
#MRS. GWYN.
If you were not, a child, Joy, you wouldn't say such things.
#JOY.
I'm not a child, I'm - I'm a woman. I am.
#MRS. GWYN.
No! You - are - not a woman, Joy.
#LEVER.
What's the matter? What is it, Joy?
#JOY.
I heard you, I don't care who knows. I'd listen again.
#LEVER.
Ah! and what did I say that was so very dreadful?
#JOY.
You're a - a - you 're a - coward!
#MRS. GWYN.
Joy!
#LEVER.
Now hit me in the face - hit me - hit me as hard as you can. Go on, Joy, it'll do you good. Why don't you? I'm not pretending! Come, joy; you'll make yourself ill, and that won't help, will it? What's the matter? now come - tell me!
#JOY.
Will you leave my mother alone?
#MRS. GWYN.
Oh! my dear Joy, don't be silly!
#JOY.
I defy you - I defy you!
#MRS. GWYN.
Oh!
#LEVER.
Never mind, dear! It'll be - it'll be all right!
#DICK.
Curse! Curse!
#MISS BEECH.
Poor young man!
#DICK.
Well, Peachey, I can't help it
#MISS BEECH.
Did you ever know any one that could?
#DICK.
It's such awfully hard lines on Joy. I can't get her out of my head, lying there with that beastly headache while everybody's jigging round.
#MISS BEECH.
Oh! you don't mind about yourself - noble young man!
#DICK.
I should be a brute if I did n't mind more for her.
#MISS BEECH.
So you think it's a headache, do you?
#DICK.
Did n't you hear what Mrs. Gwyn said at dinner about the sun? I say, Peachey, could n't you - could n't you just go up and give her a message from me, and find out if there 's anything she wants, and say how brutal it is that she 's seedy; it would be most awfully decent of you. And tell her the dancing's no good without her. Do, Peachey, now do! Ah! and look here! You might give her these. I got them specially for her, and I have n't had a chance.
#MISS BEECH.
What 's this?
#DICK.
Fizz. The Colonel brought it from the George. It 's for supper; he put it in here because of - Mrs. Hope, I think. Peachey, do take her those irises. you think they'll do her any good?
#DICK.
I thought she'd like - I don't want to worry her - you might try. Why not?
#MISS BEECH.
The poor little creature won't let me in.
#DICK.
You've been up then!
#MISS BEECH.
Of course I've been up. I've not got a stone for my heart, young man!
#DICK.
All right! I suppose I shall just have to get along somehow.
#MISS BEECH.
That's what we've all got to do.
#DICK.
But this is too brutal for anything!
#MISS BEECH.
Worse than ever happened to any one!
#DICK.
I swear I'm not thinking of myself.
#MISS BEECH.
Did y' ever know anybody that swore they were?
#DICK.
Oh! shut up!
#MISS BEECH.
You'd better go in and get yourself a partner.
#DICK.
Look here, Peachey, I simply loathe all those girls.
#MISS BEECH.
Ah - h! Poor lot, are n't they?
#DICK.
All right; chaff away, it's good fun, isn't it? It makes me sick to dance when Joy's lying there. Her last night, too!
#MISS BEECH.
You're a good young man, and you 've got a good heart.
#DICK.
Peachey - I say, Peachey d' you think there 's - I mean d' you think there'll ever be any chance for me?
#MISS BEECH.
I thought that was coming! I don't approve of your making love at your time of life; don't you think I 'm going to encourage you.
#DICK.
But I shall be of age in a year; my money's my own, it's not as if I had to ask any one's leave; and I mean, I do know my own mind.
#MISS BEECH.
Of course you do. Nobody else would at your age, but you do.
#DICK.
I would n't ask her to promise, it would n't be fair when she 's so young, but I do want her to know that I shall never change.
#MISS BEECH.
And suppose - only suppose - she's fond of you, and says she'll never change.
#DICK.
Oh! Peachey! D' you think there's a chance of that - do you?
#MISS BEECH.
A - h - h!
#DICK.
I wouldn't let her bind herself, I swear I wouldn't. I'm not such a selfish brute as you seem to think.
#MISS BEECH.
Well - have a go!
#DICK.
Really? You are a brick, Peachey!
#MISS BEECH.
Don't you ever say I said so! You're too young, both of you.
#DICK.
But it is exceptional - I mean in my case, is n't it?
#MISS BEECH.
Oh! very!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
The girls are all sitting out, Dick! I've been obliged to dance myself. Phew! Hallo! What's the matter with him? Cooling your heels, Peachey? By George! it's hot. Fancy the poor devils in London on a night like this, what? It's a full moon. You're lucky to be down here, Molly.
#MRS. GWYN.
Very!
#MISS BEECH.
Oh! so you think she's lucky, do you?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Delicious scent to - night! Hay and roses - delicious. shame that poor child has knocked up like this. Don't think it was the sun myself - more likely neuralgic - she 's subject to neuralgia, Molly.
#MRS. GWYN.
I know.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Got too excited about your coming. I told Nell not to keep worrying her about her frock, and this is the result. But your Aunt - you know - she can't let a thing alone!
#MISS BEECH.
Ah! 't isn't neuralgia.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Excitable little thing. You don't understand her, Peachey.
#MISS BEECH.
Don't I?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
She's all affection. Eh, Molly? I remember what I was like at her age, a poor affectionate little rat, and now look at me!
#MISS BEECH.
I see you.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
We forget what we were like when we were young. She's been looking forward to to - night ever since you wrote; and now to have to go to bed and miss the, dancing. Too bad!
#MRS. GWYN.
Don't, Uncle Tom!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
There, there, old girl, don't think about it. She'll be all right tomorrow.
#MISS BEECH.
If I were her mother I'd soon have her up.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Have her up with that headache! What are you talking about, Peachey?
#MISS BEECH.
I know a remedy.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Well, out with it.
#MISS BEECH.
Oh! Molly knows it too!
#MRS. GWYN.
It's easy to advise.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Well, if you're thinking of morphia for her, don't have anything to do with it. I've always set my face against morphia; the only time I took it was in Burmah. I'd raging neuralgia for two days. I went to our old doctor, and I made him give me some. "Look here, doctor," I said, "I hate the idea of morphia, I 've never taken it, and I never want to."
#MISS BEECH.
When a tooth hurts, you should have it out. It 's only puttin' off the evil day.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
You say that because it was n't your own.
#MISS BEECH.
Well, it was hollow, and you broke your principles!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Hollow yourself, Peachey; you're as bad as any one!
#MISS BEECH.
Well, I know that!
#MRS. GWYN.
I - don't - judge for other people.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Hallo, Molly! Are n't you feeling the thing, old girl?
#MISS BEECH.
Let her get some air, poor creature!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Your Aunt's got some first - rate sal volatile.
#MRS. GWYN.
It's all right, Uncle Tom. I felt giddy, it's nothing, now.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
That's the dancing. I know what it is when you're not used to it.
#MRS. GWYN.
I suppose you think I 'm a very bad mother to be amusing myself while joy's suffering.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
My dear girl, whatever put such a thought into your head? We all know if there were anything you could do, you'd do it at once, would n't she, Peachey?
#MRS. GWYN.
Ah! you see, Peachey knows me better.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I always think women are wonderful. There's your Aunt, she's very funny, but if there's anything the matter with me, she'll sit up all night; but when she's ill herself, and you try to do anything for her, out she raps at once.
#MRS. GWYN.
There's always one that a woman will do anything for.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Exactly what I say. With your Aunt it's me, and by George! Molly, sometimes I wish it was n't. BEECH, But is it ever for another woman!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
You old cynic! D' you mean to say Joy wouldn't do anything on earth for her Mother, or Molly for Joy? You don't know human nature. What a wonderful night! Have n't seen such a moon for years, she's like a great, great lamp! Don't like these Chinese lanterns, with that moon - tawdry! eh! By Jove, Molly, I sometimes think we humans are a rubbishy lot - each of us talking and thinking of nothing but our own petty little affairs; and when you see a great thing like that up there - But there's your Aunt, if I were to say a thing like that to her she 'd - she'd think me a lunatic; and yet, you know, she 's a very good woman.
#MRS. GWYN.
Do you think me very selfish, Uncle Tom?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
My dear - what a fancy! Think you selfish - of course I don't; why should I?
#MRS. GWYN.
I don't know.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I like your friend, Lever, Molly. He came to me before dinner quite distressed about your Aunt, beggin' me not to take those shares. She 'll be the first to worry me, but he made such a point of it, poor chap - in the end I was obliged to say I wouldn't. I thought it showed very' nice feeling. It's a pretty tight fit to make two ends meet on my income - I've missed a good thing, all owing to your Aunt. I don't mind telling you, Molly, I think they've got a much finer mine there than they've any idea of. I can't see what there is to laugh at.
#MRS. GWYN.
I don't know what's the matter with me this evening.
#MISS BEECH.
I do.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
There, there! Give me a kiss, old girl! Why, your forehead's as hot as fire. I know - I know - you 're fretting about Joy. Never mind - come! Let's go and have a look at the moon on the river. We all get upset at times; eh! Why, you 're not crying, Molly! I say! Don't do that, old girl, it makes me wretched. Look here, Peachey. This is dreadful!
#MRS. GWYN.
It's all right, Uncle Tom!
#MISS BEECH.
Some one calling you.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
There, there, my dear, you just stay here, and cool yourself - I 'll come back - shan't be a minute. And Molly, old girl, don't you mind anything I said. I don't remember what it was - it must have been something, I suppose.
#MRS. GWYN.
Why do you torture me?
#MISS BEECH.
I don't want to torture you.
#MRS.
GWYN, But you do. D' you think I haven't seen this coming - all these weeks. I knew she must find out some time! But even a day counts -
#MISS BEECH.
I don't understand why you brought him down here.
#MRS. GWYN.
When day after day and night after night you've thought of nothing but how to keep them both, you might a little want to prove that it was possible, mightn't you? But you don't understand - how should you? You've never been a mother! You've never had a lov - Oh, I did n't mean that, Peachey!
#MISS BEECH.
All right, my dear.
#MRS. GWYN.
I'm so dragged in two! I knew it must come.
#MISS BEECH.
Does she know everything, Molly?
#MRS. GWYN.
She guesses.
#MISS BEECH.
It's either him or her then, my dear; one or the other you 'll have to give up.
#MRS. GWYN.
Life's very hard on women!
#MISS BEECH.
Life's only just beginning for that child, Molly.
#MRS. GWYN.
You don't care if it ends for me!
#MISS BEECH.
Is it as bad as that?
#MRS. GWYN.
Yes.
#MISS BEECH.
Poor things! Poor things!
#MRS. GWYN.
Are you still fond of me?
#MISS BEECH.
Yes, yes, my dear, of course I am.
#MRS. GWYN.
In spite of my - wickedness?
#MISS BEECH.
Who am I to tell what's wicked and what is n't? God knows you're both like daughters to me!
#MRS. GWYN.
I can't.
#MISS BEECH.
Molly.
#MRS. GWYN.
You don't know what you're asking.
#MISS BEECH.
If I could save you suffering, my dear, I would. I hate suffering, if it 's only a fly, I hate it.
#MRS. GWYN.
Life is n't fair. Peachey, go in and leave me alone.
#LEVER.
The next is our dance, Molly.
#MRS. GWYN.
Let's sit it out here, then.
#LEVER.
I've made it all right with your Uncle.
#MRS. GWYN.
Oh?
#LEVER.
I spoke to him about the shares before dinner.
#MRS. GWYN.
Yes, he told me, thank you.
#LEVER.
There 's nothing to worry over, dear.
#MRS. GWYN.
What does it matter about the wretched shares now? I 'm stifling.
#LEVER.
I don't understand what you mean by "now."
#MRS. GWYN.
Don't you?
#LEVER.
We were n't - Joy can't know - why should she? I don't believe for a minute -
#MRS. GWYN.
Because you don't want to.
#LEVER.
Do you mean she does?
#MRS. GWYN.
Her heart knows. I seem to bring you nothing but worry, Maurice. Are you tired of me?
#LEVER.
No, I am not.
#MRS. GWYN.
Ah, but would you tell me if you were?
#LEVER.
Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
#MRS. GWYN.
If I were to give you up, you'd forget me in a month.
#LEVER.
Why do you say such things?
#MRS. GWYN.
If only I could believe I was necessary to you!
#LEVER.
But you are!
#MRS. GWYN.
Am I? Midsummer day!
#LEVER.
For God's sake, don't, Molly - I don't believe in going to meet trouble.
#MRS. GWYN.
It's staring me in the face.
#LEVER.
Let the future take care of itself! Don't, Molly! Don't!
#MRS. GWYN.
Oh! what shall I do? Listen! One can't sit it out and dance it too. Which is it to be, Maurice, dancing - or sitting out? It must be one or the other, must n't it?
#LEVER.
Molly! Molly!
#MRS. GWYN.
Ah, my dear! How long shall I keep you? This is all that 's left of me. It 's time I joined the wallflowers. It's time I played the mother, is n't it? It'll be all sitting out then.
#LEVER.
Don't! Let's go and dance, it'll do you good.
#MRS. GWYN.
I can't give you up - I can't. Love me, oh! love me!
#LEVER.
Are you all right now, darling?
#MRS. GWYN.
Yes, dear - quite.
#LEVER.
Then let 's go, and dance.
#DICK.
It's not claret, Rose, I should n't warm it.
#DICK.
Joy!
#JOY.
I want Uncle Tom.
#DICK.
But ought you to have got up - I thought you were ill in bed; oughtn't you to be lying down?
#JOY.
If have n't been in bed. Where's Uncle Tom?
#DICK.
But where have you been? - your dress is all torn. Look!
#JOY.
In the fields. Where's Uncle Tom?
#DICK.
Are n't you really ill then? DICK, Look at these. They were the best I could get.
#JOY.
Don't! I want Uncle Tom!
#DICK.
Won't you take them?
#JOY.
I 've got something else to do.
#DICK.
What do you want the Colonel for?
#JOY.
I want him.
#DICK.
Alone?
#JOY.
Yes.
#DICK.
Joy, what is the matter?
#JOY.
I 've got something to tell him.
#DICK.
What? Is it about Lever?
#JOY.
The mine.
#DICK.
The mine?
#JOY.
It 's not - not a proper one.
#DICK.
How do you mean, Joy?
#JOY.
I overheard. I don't care, I listened. I would n't if it had been anybody else, but I hate him.
#DICK.
What did you hear?
#JOY.
He 's keeping back something Uncle Tom ought to know.
#DICK.
Are you sure? No, wait a minute - you must! Was it something that really matters? - I don't want to know what.
#JOY.
Yes, it was.
#DICK.
What a beastly thing - are you quite certain, Joy?
#JOY.
Yes.
#DICK.
Then you must tell him, of course, even if you did overhear. You can't stand by and see the Colonel swindled. Whom was he talking to?
#JOY.
I won't tell you.
#DICK.
Was it was it your Mother? But if it was your Mother, why does n't she -
#JOY.
Let me go!
#DICK.
I mean I can't see what -
#JOY.
Let me go!
#DICK.
I'm thinking of your Mother, Joy. She would never -
#JOY.
That man!
#DICK.
But joy, just think! There must be some mistake. It 's so queer - it 's quite impossible!
#JOY.
He won't let her.
#DICK.
Won't let her - won't let her? But Oh!
#JOY.
Why d' you look at me like that? Why can't you speak? I'm going to show what he is, so that Mother shan't speak to him again. I can - can't I - if I tell Uncle Tom? - can't I - ?
#DICK.
But Joy - if your Mother knows a thing like - that -
#JOY.
She wanted to tell - she begged him - and he would n't.
#DICK.
But, joy, dear, it means -
#JOY.
I hate him, I want to make her hate him, and I will.
#DICK.
But, Joy, dear, don't you see - if your Mother knows a thing like that, and does n't speak of it, it means that she - it means that you can't make her hate him - it means - If it were anybody else - but, well, you can't give your own Mother away!
#JOY.
How dare you! How dare you! It is n't true - Oh! it is n't true!
#DICK.
Joy, dear, I never meant, I didn't really!
#JOY.
Oh! go away, go away! Mother! Oh! Mother, it is n't true?
#MRS. GWYN.
What is n't true?
#JOY.
That you and he are - Then it is true. Oh!
#MRS. GWYN.
That's enough, Joy! What I am is my affair - not yours - do you understand?
#JOY.
Yes, I do.
#MRS. GWYN.
You don't. You're only a child.
#JOY.
I understand that you've hurt
#MRS. GWYN.
Do you mean your Father?
#JOY.
Yes, and - and me. I'm - I'm ashamed.
#MRS. GWYN.
I brought you into the world, and you say that to me? Have I been a bad mother to you?
#JOY.
Oh! Mother!
#MRS. GWYN.
Ashamed? Am I to live all my life like a dead woman because you're ashamed? Am I to live like the dead because you 're a child that knows nothing of life? Listen, Joy, you 'd better understand this once for all. Your Father has no right over me and he knows it. We 've been hateful to each other for years. Can you understand that? Don't cover your face like a child - look at me. you think - because I suffered when you were born and because I 've suffered since with every ache you ever had, that that gives you the right to dictate to me now? I've been unhappy enough and I shall be unhappy enough in the time to come. Oh! you untouched things, you're as hard and cold as iron!
#JOY.
I would do anything for you, Mother.
#MRS. GWYN.
Except - let me live, Joy. That's the only thing you won't do for me, I quite understand.
#JOY.
Oh! Mother, you don't understand - I want you so; and I seem to be nothing to you now.
#MRS. GWYN.
Nothing to me?
#JOY.
Mother, darling, if you're so unhappy let's forget it all, let's go away and I 'll be everything to you, I promise.
#MRS. GWYN.
Ah, Joy!
#JOY.
I would try so hard.
#MRS. GWYN.
My darling, I know you would, until you fell in love yourself.
#JOY.
Oh, Mother, I wouldn't, I never would, I swear it.
#MRS. GWYN.
There has never been a woman, joy, that did not fall in love.
#JOY.
But it 's wrong of you it's wicked!
#MRS. GWYN.
If it's wicked, I shall pay for it, not you!
#JOY.
But I want to save you, Mother!
#MRS. GWYN.
Save me?
#JOY.
I can't bear it that you - if you 'll only - I'll never leave you. You think I don't know what I 'm saying, but I do, because even now I - I half love somebody. Oh, Mother! I feel - I feel so awful - as if everybody knew.
#MRS. GWYN.
You think I'm a monster to hurt you. Ah! yes! You'll understand better some day.
#JOY.
I won't believe it - I - I - can't - you're deserting me, Mother.
#MRS. GWYN.
Oh, you untouched things! You -
#JOY.
Mother - it 's for me!
#MRS. GWYN.
Ask for my life, JOY - don't be afraid. I forgot - I 'm deserting you.
#DICK.
Oh! Joy; dear, don't cry. It's so dreadful to see you! I 'd do anything not to see you cry! Say something. Joy, darling! It's so awful, you 'll make yourself ill, and it is n't worth it, really. I 'd do anything to save you pain - won't you stop just for a minute? Nothing in the world 's worth your crying, Joy. Give me just a little look!
#JOY.
Don't!
#DICK.
You do look so sweet! Oh, Joy, I'll comfort you, I'll take it all on myself. I know all about it. I do. I 've had trouble too, I swear I have. It gets better, it does really.
#JOY.
You don't know - it's - it's -
#DICK.
Don't think about it! No, no, no! I know exactly what it's like.
#JOY.
You mustn't.
#DICK.
Look here, joy! It's no good, we must talk it over calmly.
#JOY.
You don't see! It's the - it 's the disgrace -
#DICK.
Oh! as to disgrace - she's your Mother, whatever she does; I'd like to see anybody say anything about her - I'd punch his head.
#JOY.
That does n't help.
#DICK.
But if she doesn't love your Father -
#JOY.
But she's married to him!
#DICK.
Yes, of course, I know, marriage is awfully important; but a man understands these things. I mean, he understands better than a woman. I've often argued about moral questions with men up at Oxford.
#JOY.
But there's nothing to argue about.
#DICK.
Of course, I believe in morals. Some men don't. But I can't help seeing marriage is awfully important.
#JOY.
It's sacred.
#DICK.
Yes, I know, but there must be exceptions, Joy. Joy. How can there be exceptions if a thing 's sacred?
#DICK.
All rules have exceptions; that's true, you know; it's a proverb.
#JOY.
It can't be true about marriage - how can it when - ?
#DICK.
But look here, Joy, I know a really clever man - an author. He says that if marriage is a failure people ought to be perfectly free; it isn't everybody who believes that marriage is everything. Of course, I believe it 's sacred, but if it's a failure, I do think it seems awful - don't you?
#JOY.
I don't know - yes - if - But it's my own Mother!
#DICK.
I know, of course. I can't expect you to see it in your own case like this. But look here, Joy, this'll show you! If a person loves a person, they have to decide, have n't they? Well, then, you see, that 's what your Mother's done.
#JOY.
But that does n't show me anything!
#DICK.
But it does. The thing is to look at it as if it was n't yourself. If it had been you and me in love, Joy, and it was wrong, like them, of course I know you'd have decided right. But I swear I should have decided wrong. That 's why I feel I understand your Mother.
#JOY.
Oh, Dick, you are so sweet - and - and - funny!
#DICK.
I love you, Joy, that 's why, and I 'll love you till you don't feel it any more. I will. I'll love you all day and every day; you shan't miss anything, I swear it. It 's such a beautiful night - it 's on purpose. Look' But it 's not so beautiful as you.
#JOY.
You mustn't. I don't know - what's coming?
#DICK.
Are n't your knees tired, darling? I - I can't get near you properly.
#JOY.
Oh! Dick, you are a funny - comfort!
#DICK.
We'll stick together, Joy, always; nothing'll matter then. You're missing it all! I can't bear you to miss the dancing. It seems so queer! Couldn't we? Just a little turn?
#JOY.
No, no?
#DICK.
Oh! try!
#JOY.
No - no! Oh! Dick - to - morrow 'll be so awful.
#DICK.
To - morrow shan't hurt you, Joy; nothing shall ever hurt you again.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Charming to see Molly dance with Lever, their steps go so well together! I can always tell when a woman's enjoying herself, Peachey.
#MISS BEECH.
Can you? You're very clever.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Wonderful, that moon! I'm going to have a look at her! Splendid glasses these, Peachy , not a better pair in England. I remember in Burmah with these glasses I used to be able to tell a man from a woman at two miles and a quarter. And that's no joke, I can tell you. I say, I say - is it one of the maids - the baggage! Why! It's Dick! By George, she's got her hair down, Peachey! It's Joy! It is! What about her headache? By George, they're kissing. I say, Peachey! I shall have to tell Nell!
#MISS BEECH.
Are you sure they're kissing? Well, that's some comfort.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
They're at the stile now. Oughtn't I to stop them, eh? We must n't spy on them, dash it all. They're out of sight now.
#MISS BEECH.
He said he wouldn't let her.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
What! have you been encouraging them!
#MISS BEECH.
Don't be in such a hurry!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
By George, Peachey, to think that Nell and I were once - Poor Nell! I remember just such a night as this BEECH, It's a comfort she's got that good young man. She's found out that her mother and this Mr. Lever are - you know.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
You tell me that my niece?
#MISS BEECH.
Out of her own mouth!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I never would have believed she'd have forgotten herself.
#MISS BEECH.
Ah, my dear! We're all the same; we're all as hollow as that tree! When it's ourselves it's always a special case! Don't you take it so to heart, my dear!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I couldn't have believed Molly would forget that child.
#MISS BEECH.
They must go their own ways, poor things! She can't put herself in the child's place, and the child can't put herself in Molly's. A woman and a girl - there's the tree of life between them!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
It's a grief to me, Peachey, it's a grief! Shan't tell Nell - dashed if I do anything to make the trouble worse!
#MISS BEECH.
There's suffering enough, without adding to it with our trumpery judgments! If only things would last between them!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Last! By George, they'd better - I say, Peachey Life's very funny!
#MISS BEECH.
Men and women are! There, there - take care of your poor, dear head! Tsst! The blessed innocents!
#JOY.
Dick, is love always like this?
#DICK.
It's never been like this before. It's you and me!
