#THE JUDGE.
Life's eve has at last brought the sunshine which its morning promised us. Early rains and late rains have blessed meadow and field. And soon the songs of the vintagers will be heard all over the country.
#OLD LADY.
Don't talk like that; somebody might hear you.
#THE JUDGE.
Who could be listening here, and what harm could it do to thank God for all good gifts?
#OLD LADY.
It's better not to mention one's good fortune lest misfortune overhear it.
#THE JUDGE.
What of it? Was I not born with a caul?
#OLD LADY.
Take care, take care! There are many who envy us, and evil eyes are watching us.
#THE JUDGE.
Well, let them! That's the way it has always been. And yet I have prospered.
#OLD LADY.
So far, yes. But I don't trust our neighbour. He has been going around the village saying that we have cheated him out of his property - and much more of the same kind which I don't care to repeat. Of course, it doesn't matter when one has a clean conscience and can point to a spotless life. Slander cannot hurt me. I go to confession and mass, and I am prepared to close my eyes whenever my hour may strike in order to open them again when I shall stand face to face with my Judge. And I know also what I am going to answer then.
#THE JUDGE.
What are you going to answer?
#OLD LADY.
Like this: I was not without fault, O Lord, but even if I was but a poor, sinful human creature, I was nevertheless a little better than my neighbour.
#THE JUDGE.
I don't know what has brought you to these thoughts just now, and I don't like them. Perhaps it is the fact that the mausoleum is to be consecrated in a few days?
#OLD LADY.
Perhaps that is it, for, as a rule, I don't give much thought to death. I have still every tooth left in my mouth, and my hair is as plentiful as when I was a bride.
#THE JUDGE.
Yes, yes - you have eternal youth, you as well as I, but just the same we shall have to pass away. And as fortune has smiled on us, we have wanted to avail ourselves of the privilege of resting in ground belonging to ourselves And so we have built this little tomb for ourselves here, where every tree knows us, where every flower will whisper of our labours, and our troubles, and our struggles -
#OLD LADY.
Yes, struggles against envious neighbours and ungrateful children -
#THE JUDGE.
There you said it: ungrateful children. - Have you seen anything of Adolph?
#OLD LADY.
No, I haven't seen him since he started out this morning to raise the money for the rent.
#THE JUDGE.
The money which he will never get - and I still less. But he knows now that the time of grace is up, for this is the third quarter rent that he has failed to pay.
#OLD LADY.
Yes, out with him into the world, and let him learn to work instead of sitting here and playing at son - in - law. I'll keep Amelia and the children -
#THE JUDGE.
Do you think Amelia will let herself be separated from Adolph?
#OLD LADY.
I think so, when it is a question whether her children are to inherit anything from us or not - No, look! There it is again!
#THE JUDGE.
What is it? What is it?
#OLD LADY.
On the mausoleum. Don't you see?
#THE JUDGE.
It's the reflection of the sun on the river. It means -
#OLD LADY.
It means that we'll see the light of the sun for a long time to come -
#THE JUDGE.
On the contrary. But that's all one. The best pillow for one's head is a good conscience, and the reward of the righteous never fails. - There's our neighbour now.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Good evening, Judge. Good evening, madam.
#THE JUDGE.
Good evening, neighbour. How goes it? It wasn't yesterday we had the pleasure. And how are your vines, I should have asked?
#NEIGHBOUR.
The vines, yes - there's mildew on them, and the starlings are after them, too.
#THE JUDGE.
Well, well! There's no mildew on my vines, and I have neither seen nor heard of any starlings.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Fate does not distribute its gifts evenly: one shall be taken and the other left.
#OLD LADY.
I suppose there are good reasons for it?
#NEIGHBOUR.
I see! The reward of the righteous shall not fail, and the wicked shall not have to wait for their punishment.
#THE JUDGE.
Oh, no malice meant! But you have to admit, anyhow, that it's queer: two parcels of land lie side by side, and one yields good harvests, the other poor ones -
#NEIGHBOUR.
One yields starlings and the other not: that's what I find queerer still. But, then, everybody wasn't born with a caul, like you, Judge.
#THE JUDGE.
What you say is true, and fortune has favoured me. I am thankful for it, and there are moments when I feel proud of it as if I had deserved it. - But listen, neighbour - you came as if you had been sent for. - That leasehold of mine is vacant, and I wanted to ask you if you care to take it.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Oh, the leasehold is vacant. Hm! Since when?
#THE JUDGE.
Since this morning.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Hm! So! - That means your son - in - law has got to go?
#THE JUDGE.
Yes, that good - for - nothing doesn't know how to manage.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Tell me something else, Judge. Haven't you heard that the state intends to build a military road across this property?
#THE JUDGE.
Oh, I have heard some rumours to that effect, but I don't think it's anything but empty talk.
#NEIGHBOUR.
On the contrary, I have read it in the papers. That would mean condemnation proceedings, and the loser would be the holder of the lease.
#THE JUDGE.
I cannot think so, and I would never submit to it. I to leave this spot where I expect to end my days in peace, and where I have prepared a final resting - place to escape lying with all the rest -
#NEIGHBOUR.
Wait a minute! One never knows what may prove one's final resting - place. My father, who used to own this property, also expected to be laid to rest in his own ground, but it happened otherwise. As far as the leasehold is concerned, I must let it go.
#THE JUDGE.
As you please. On my part the proposition was certainly disinterested, as you are a man without luck. For it is no secret that you fail in everything you undertake, and people have their own thoughts about one who remains as solitary and friendless as you. Isn't it a fact that you haven't a single friend?
#NEIGHBOUR.
Yes, it's true. I have not a single friend, and that doesn't look well. It is something I cannot deny.
#THE JUDGE.
But to turn to other matters - is it true, as the legend has it, that this vineyard once was a battle - field, and that this explains why the wine from it is so fiery?
#NEIGHBOUR.
No, that isn't what I have heard. My father told me that this had been a place of execution, and that the gallows used to stand where the mausoleum is now.
#THE JUDGE.
Oh, how dreadful! Why did you tell me?
#NEIGHBOUR.
Because you asked, of course. - And the last man to be hanged on this spot was an unrighteous judge. And now he lies buried here, together with many others, among them being also an innocent victim of his iniquity.
#THE JUDGE.
What kind of stories are those! Caroline!
#NEIGHBOUR.
And that's why his ghost has to come back here. Have you never seen him, Judge?
#THE JUDGE.
I have never seen anything at all!
#NEIGHBOUR.
But I have seen him. As a rule, he appears at the time when the grapes are harvested, and then they hear him around the wine - press down in the cellar.
#THE JUDGE.
Caroline!
#OLD LADY.
What is it?
#THE JUDGE.
Come here!
#NEIGHBOUR.
And he will never be at peace until he has suffered all the torments his victim had to pass through.
#THE JUDGE.
Get away from here! Go!
#NEIGHBOUR.
Certainly, Judge! I didn't know you were so sensitive.
#OLD LADY.
What was the matter?
#THE JUDGE.
Oh, he told a lot of stories that upset me. But - but - he is plotting something evil, that fellow!
#OLD LADY.
Didn't I tell you so! But you always let your tongue run whenever you see anybody - What kind of foolish superstition was he giving you?
#THE JUDGE.
I don't want to talk of it. The mere thought of it makes me sick. I'll tell you some other time. - There's Adolph now!
#ADOLPHUS.
Good evening!
#THE JUDGE.
Well?
#ADOLPHUS.
Luck is against me. I have not been able to get any money.
#THE JUDGE.
I suppose there are good reasons for it?
#ADOLPHUS.
I can see no reason why some people should fare well and others badly.
#THE JUDGE.
Oh, you can't? - Well, look into your own heart; search your own thoughts and actions, and you'll find that you have yourself to blame for your misfortunes.
#ADOLPHUS.
Perhaps I may not call myself righteous in every respect, but at least I have no serious crimes on my conscience.
#OLD LADY.
You had better think well -
#ADOLPHUS.
I don't think that's needful, for my conscience is pretty wakeful -
#THE JUDGE.
It can be put to sleep -
#ADOLPHUS.
Can it? Of course I have heard of evil - doers growing old in crime, but as a rule their consciences wake up just before death; and I have even heard of criminals whose consciences have awakened after death.
#THE JUDGE.
So that they had to come back, you mean? Have you heard that story, too? It's strange that everybody seems to have heard it except me -
#OLD LADY.
What are you talking about? Stick to business instead.
#ADOLPHUS.
Yes, I think that's wiser, too. And, as the subject has been broached, I want to tell you what I propose -
#THE JUDGE.
Look here, my boy! I think it a good deal more appropriate that I should tell you what I have decided. It is this: that from this day you cease to be my tenant, and that before the sun sets you must start out to look for work.
#ADOLPHUS.
Are you in earnest?
#THE JUDGE.
You ought to be ashamed! I am not in the habit of joking. And you have no cause for complaint, as you have been granted respite twice.
#ADOLPHUS.
While my crops have failed three times. Can I help that?
#THE JUDGE.
Nor have I said so. But I can help it still less. And you are not being judged by me. Here is the contract - here's the broken agreement. Was that agreement broken by me? Oh, no! So I am without responsibility and wash my hands of the matter.
#ADOLPHUS.
This may be the law, but I had thought there ought to be some forbearance among relatives - especially as, in the natural course of events, this property should pass on to your offspring.
#OLD LADY.
Well, well: the natural course of events! He's going around here wishing the life out of us! But you just look at me: I am good for twenty years more. And I am going to live just to spite you!
#THE JUDGE.
What rudeness - what a lack of all human feeling - to ask a couple of old people outright: are you not going to die soon? You ought to be ashamed of yourself, I say! But now you have broken the last tie, and all I can say is: go your way, and don't let yourself be seen here any more!
#ADOLPHUS.
That's plain talk! Well, I'll go, but not alone -
#OLD LADY.
So - o - you imagined that Amelia, our own child, should follow you out on the highways, and that all you would have to do would be to unload one child after another on us! But we have already thought of that and put a stop to it -
#ADOLPHUS.
Where is Amelia? Where?
#OLD LADY.
You may just as well know. She has gone on; a visit to the convent of the Poor Clares - only for a visit. So now you know it's of no use to look for her here.
#ADOLPHUS.
Some time you will have to suffer for your cruelty in depriving a man in distress of his only support. And if you break up our marriage, the penalty of that breach will fall on you.
#THE JUDGE.
You should be ashamed of putting your own guilt on those that are innocent! Go now! And may you hunger and thirst, with every door closed to you, until you have learned gratitude!
#ADOLPHUS.
The same to you in double measure! - But let me only bid my children good - bye, and I will go.
#THE JUDGE.
As you don't want to spare your children the pain of leave - taking, I'll do so - have already done it, in fact.
#ADOLPHUS.
That, too! Then I believe you capable of all the evil that has been rumoured. And now I know what our neighbour meant when he said that you couldn't - endure the sun!
#THE JUDGE.
Not another word! Or you will feel the heavy hand of law and justice -
#ADOLPHUS.
The hand of justice! - The hand of the perjurer whose finger stuck to the Bible when he took his false oath! Woe unto you! Woe! For the day of retribution is at hand, and your deeds will rise like corpses out of these hillsides to accuse you.
#OLD LADY.
What is that he is saying? It feels as if he were breathing fire at us! - Go, you lying spirit, and may hell be your reward!
#ADOLPHUS.
May Heaven reward you - according to your deserts - and may the Lord protect my children!
#THE JUDGE.
What was that? Who was it that spoke? It seemed to me as if the voice were coming out of some huge underground hall.
#OLD LADY.
Did you hear it, too?
#THE JUDGE.
God help us, then! - Do you remember what he said about the sun? That struck me as more peculiar than all the rest. How could he know - that it is so? Ever since my birth the sun has always burned me, and they have told me this is so because my mother suffered from sunstroke before I was born - but that you also -
#OLD LADY.
Hush! Talk of the devil, and - Isn't the sun down?
#THE JUDGE.
Of course it is down!
#OLD LADY.
How can that spot of sunlight remain on the mausoleum, then?
#THE JUDGE.
Jesus Maria! That's an omen!
#OLD LADY.
An omen, you say! And on the grave! That doesn't happen every day - and only a few chosen people who are full of living faith in the highest things -
#THE JUDGE.
There is something weird about the place to - night, something ghastly. - But what hurt me most keenly was to hear that good - for - nothing wishing the life out of us in order to get at the property. Do you know what I - well, I wonder if I dare to speak of it -
#OLD LADY.
Go on!
#THE JUDGE.
Have you heard the story that this spot here used to be a place of execution?
#OLD LADY.
So you have found that out, too?
#THE JUDGE.
Yes - and you knew it? - Well, suppose we gave this property to the convent? That would make the ground sacred, and it would be possible to rest in peace in it. The income might go to the children while they are growing up, and it would mean an additional gain, as Adolph would be fooled in his hope of inheriting from us. I think this a remarkably happy solution of a difficult problem: how to give away without losing anything by it.
#OLD LADY.
Your superior intelligence has again asserted itself, and I am quite of your opinion. But suppose condemnation proceedings should be started - what would happen then?
#THE JUDGE.
There is plenty of time to consider that when it happens. In the meantime, let us first of all, and as quietly as possible, get the mausoleum consecrated -
#FRANCISCAN.
The peace of the Lord be with you, Judge, and with you, madam!
#THE JUDGE.
You come most conveniently, Father, to hear something that concerns the convent -
#FRANCISCAN.
I am glad of it.
#OLD LADY.
And then we wanted to ask when the consecration of the mausoleum might take place.
#FRANCISCAN.
Oh, is that so?
#THE JUDGE.
Look, Father - look at that omen -
#OLD LADY.
Yes, the spot must be sacred, indeed -
#FRANCISCAN.
That's a will - o' - the - wisp.
#OLD LADY.
Is it not a good sign? Does it not carry some kind of message? Does it not prompt a pious mind to stop and consider? Would it not be possible to turn this place into a refuge for desert wanderers who are seeking -
#FRANCISCAN.
Madam, let me speak a word to you in private.
#OLD LADY.
Father?
#FRANCISCAN.
You, madam, enjoy a reputation in this vicinity which you don't deserve, for you are the worst sinner that I know of. You want to buy your pardon, and you want to steal heaven itself, you who have already stolen from the Lord.
#OLD LADY.
What is it I hear?
#FRANCISCAN.
When you were sick and near death you made a vow to the Lord that in case of recovery you would give a monstrance of pure gold to the convent church. Your health was restored and you gave the holy vessel, but it was of silver - gilded. Not for the sake of the gold, but because of your broken vow and your deception, you are already damned.
#OLD LADY.
I didn't know it. The goldsmith has cheated me.
#FRANCISCAN.
You are lying, for I have the goldsmith's bill.
#OLD LADY.
Is there no pardon for it?
#FRANCISCAN.
No! For it is a mortal sin to cheat God.
#OLD LADY.
Woe is me!
#FRANCISCAN.
The settlement of your other crimes will have to take place within yourself. But if you as much as touch a hair on the heads of the children, then you shall learn who is their protector, and you shall feel the iron rod.
#OLD LADY.
The idea - that this infernal monk should dare to say such things to me! If I am damned - then I want to be damned! Ha, ha!
#FRANCISCAN.
Well, you may be sure that there will be no blessing for your house and no peace for yourself until you have suffered every suffering that you have brought on others. - May I speak a word with you, Judge?
#OLD LADY.
Yes, give him what he deserves, so that one may be as good as the other.
#FRANCISCAN.
Where did you get the idea of building your tomb where the gallows used to stand?
#THE JUDGE.
I suppose I got it from the devil!
#FRANCISCAN.
Like the idea of casting off your children and robbing them of their inheritance? But you have also been an unrighteous judge - you have violated oaths and accepted bribes.
#FRANCISCAN.
And now you want to erect a monument to yourself! You want to build yourself an imperishable house in heaven! But listen to me: this spot will never be consecrated, and you may consider it a blessing if you are permitted to rest in common ground among ordinary little sinners. There is a curse laid on this soil, because blood - guilt attaches to it and because it is ill - gotten.
#THE JUDGE.
What am I to do?
#FRANCISCAN.
Repent, and restore the stolen property.
#THE JUDGE.
I have never stolen. Everything has been legally acquired.
#FRANCISCAN.
That, you see, is the worst part of all - that you regard your crimes as lawful. Yes, I know that you even consider yourself particularly favoured by Heaven because of your righteousness. But now you will soon see what harvest is in store for you. Thorns and thistles will grow in your vineyard. Helpless and abandoned you shall be, and the peace of your old age will turn into struggle and strife.
#THE JUDGE.
The devil you say!
#FRANCISCAN.
Don't call him - he'll come anyhow!
#THE JUDGE.
Let him come! Because we believe, we have no fear!
#FRANCISCAN.
The devils believe also, and tremble! - Farewell!
#THE JUDGE.
What did he say to you?
#OLD LADY.
You think I'll tell? What did he have to say to you?
#THE JUDGE.
And you think I'll tell?
#OLD LADY.
Are you going to keep any secrets from me?
#THE JUDGE.
And how about you? It's what you have always done, but I'll get to the bottom of your tricks some time.
#OLD LADY.
Just wait a little, and I'll figure out where you keep the money that is missing.
#THE JUDGE.
So you are hiding money, too! Now there is no longer any use in playing the hypocrite - just let yourself be seen in all your abomination, you witch!
#OLD LADY.
I think you have lost your reason - not that it was much to keep! But you might at least preserve an appearance of decency, if you can -
#THE JUDGE.
And you might preserve your beauty - if you can! And your perennial youth - ha, ha, ha! And your righteousness! You must have known how to bewitch people, and hoodwink them, for now I see how horribly ugly and old you are.
#OLD LADY.
Woe! It is burning me!
#THE JUDGE.
There I see you as you really are!
#OLD LADY.
And how you look!
#NEIGHBOUR.
Yes, child, there is justice, both human and divine, but we must have patience.
#AMELIA.
I am willing to believe that justice is done, in spite of all appearances to the contrary. But I cannot love my mother, and I have never been able to do so. There is something within me that keeps telling me that she is not only indifferent to me but actually hostile.
#NEIGHBOUR.
So you have found it out?
#AMELIA.
Why - she hates me, and a mother couldn't do that!
#NEIGHBOUR.
Well, well!
#AMELIA.
And I suffer from not being able to do my duty as a child and love her.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Well, as that has made you suffer, then you will soon - in the hour of retribution - learn the great secret of your life.
#AMELIA.
And I could stand everything, if she were only kind to my children.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Don't fear on that account, for her power is now ended. The measure of her wickedness has been heaped full and is now overflowing.
#AMELIA.
Do you think so? But this very day she tore my Adolph away from me, and now she has humiliated me still further by dressing me as a servant girl and making me do the work in the kitchen.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Patience!
#AMELIA.
Yes, so you say! Oh, I can understand deserved suffering, but to suffer without cause -
#NEIGHBOUR.
My dear child, the prisoners in the penitentiary are suffering justly, so there is no honour in that; but to be permitted to suffer unjustly, that's a grace and a trial of which steadfast souls bring home golden fruits.
#AMELIA.
You speak so beautifully that everything you say seems true to me. - Hush! There are the children - and I don't want them to see me dressed like this. and THYRA enter; the spot of light rests now on one of them and now on the other.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Look at the sun spot!
#THYRA.
Oh, you beautiful sun! But didn't he go to bed a while ago?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Perhaps he is allowed to stay up longer than usual because he has been very good all day.
#THYRA.
But how could the sun be good? Now you are stupid, Eric.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Of course the sun can be good - doesn't he make the grapes and the peaches?
#THYRA.
But if he is so good, then he might also give us a peach.
#PRINCE ERIC.
So he will, if we only wait a little. Aren't there any on the ground at all?
#THYRA.
No, but perhaps we might get one from the tree.
#PRINCE ERIC.
No, grandmother won't let us.
#THYRA.
Grandmother has said that we mustn't shake the tree, but I thought we could play around the tree so that one might fall down anyhow - of itself.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Now you are stupid, Thyra. That would be exactly the same thing. Oh, if only a peach would fall down!
#THYRA.
None will fall unless you shake.
#PRINCE ERIC.
You mustn't talk like that, Thyra, for that is a sin.
#THYRA.
Let's pray God to let one fall.
#PRINCE ERIC.
One shouldn't pray God for anything nice - that is, to eat! - Oh, little peach, won't you fall? I want you to fall! There, what a nice tree!
#THYRA.
But now you must give me half, for it was I who said that the tree had to be shaken -
#OLD LADY.
So you have been shaking the tree - now you'll see what you'll get, you nasty children -
#PRINCE ERIC.
No, grandmother, we didn't shake the tree!
#OLD LADY.
So you are lying, too. Didn't I hear Thyra say that the tree had to be shaken? Come along now, and I'll lock you up in the cellar where neither sun nor moon is to be seen -
#AMELIA.
The children are innocent, mother.
#OLD LADY.
That's a fine thing - to stand behind the bushes listening, and then to teach one's own children how to lie besides!
#NEIGHBOUR.
Nothing has been spoken here but the truth, madam.
#OLD LADY.
Two witnesses behind the bushes - exactly as if we were in court. But I know the tricks, I tell you, and what I have heard and seen is sufficient evidence for me. - Come along, you brats!
#AMELIA.
This is sinful and shameful -
#AMELIA.
Don't cry, children! Obey grandmother now - there is nothing to be afraid of. It is better to suffer evil than to do it, and I know that you are innocent. May God preserve you! And don't forget your evening prayer!
#AMELIA.
Belief comes so hard, but it is sweet if you can achieve it.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Is it so hard to believe that God is good - at the very moment when his kind intentions are most apparent?
#AMELIA.
Give me a great and good word for the night, so that I may sleep on it as on a soft pillow.
#NEIGHBOUR.
You shall have it. Let me think a moment. - This is it: Isaac was to be sacrificed -
#AMELIA.
Oh, no, no!
#NEIGHBOUR.
Quiet, now! - Isaac was to be sacrificed, but he never was!
#AMELIA.
Thank you! Thank you! And good night!
#NEIGHBOUR.
Good night, my child!
#THE JUDGE.
Why are you playing the ghost at this late hour?
#OLD LADY.
And how about yourself?
#THE JUDGE.
I couldn't sleep.
#OLD LADY.
Why not?
#THE JUDGE.
Don't know. Thought I heard children crying in the cellar.
#OLD LADY.
That's impossible. Oh, no, I suppose you didn't dare to sleep for fear I might be prying in your hiding - places.
#THE JUDGE.
And you feared I might be after yours! A pleasant old age this will be for Philemon and Baucis!
#OLD LADY.
At least no gods will come to visit us.
#THE JUDGE.
No, I shouldn't call them gods.
#OLD LADY.
O Mary, Mother of God, what is this?
#THE JUDGE.
Merciful heavens!
#OLD LADY.
Pray! Pray for us!
#THE JUDGE.
I have tried, but I cannot.
#OLD LADY.
Neither can I! The words won't come - and no thoughts!
#THE JUDGE.
How does the Lord's Prayer begin?
#OLD LADY.
I can't remember, but I knew it this morning. Who is the woman in white?
#THE JUDGE.
It is she - Amelia's mother - whose very memory we wanted to kill.
#OLD LADY.
Are these shadows or ghosts, or nothing but our own sickly dreams?
#THE JUDGE.
They are delusions sent by the devil. I'll throw cold steel after them. - Open the knife for me, Caroline! I can't, don't you see?
#OLD LADY.
Yes, I see - it isn't easy without a forefinger. - But I can't either!
#THE JUDGE.
Woe to us! Steel won't help here! Woe! There's the beheaded sailor! Let us get away from here!
#OLD LADY.
That's easy to say, but I can't move from the spot.
#THE JUDGE.
And I seem to be rooted to the ground. - No, I am not going to look at it any longer!
#OLD LADY.
But what is it? Mists out of the earth, or shadows cast by the trees?
#THE JUDGE.
No, it's our own vision that plays us false. There I go now, and yet I am standing here. Just let me get a good night's sleep, and I'll laugh at the whole thing! - The devil! Is this masquerade never going to end?
#OLD LADY.
But why do you look at it then?
#THE JUDGE.
I see it right through my hand - I see it in the dark, with my eyelids closed!
#OLD LADY.
But now it's over.
#THE JUDGE.
Praised be - why, I can't get the word out! - I wonder if it will be possible to sleep to - night? Perhaps we had better send for the doctor?
#OLD LADY.
Or Father Colomba, perhaps?
#THE JUDGE.
He can't help, and he who could won't! - Well, let the Other One do it then!
#THE JUDGE.
Who is that?
#THE OTHER ONE.
I am the Other One!
#THE JUDGE.
Make the sign of the cross! I can't!
#THE OTHER ONE.
The sign of the cross does not frighten me, for I am undergoing my ordeal merely that I may wear it.
#THE JUDGE.
Who are you?
#THE OTHER ONE.
I became the Other One because I wanted to be the First One. I was a man of evil, and my punishment is to serve the good.
#THE JUDGE.
Then you are not the Evil One?
#THE OTHER ONE.
I am. And it is my task to torment you into finding the cross, before which we are to meet some time.
#OLD LADY.
Don't listen to him! Tell him to go!
#THE OTHER ONE.
It won't help. You have called me, and you'll have to bear with me.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Well, child, how is your patience?
#AMELIA.
Thank you, neighbour, it might be worse. But I never had a worse job than this silver service here. I have worked at it for half an hour and cannot get it clean.
#NEIGHBOUR.
That's strange, but I suppose there are reasons for it, as the Judge says. Could you sleep last night?
#AMELIA.
Thank you, I slept very well. But do you know that father spent the whole night in the vineyard with his rattle - ?
#NEIGHBOUR.
Yes, I heard him. What kind of foolish idea was that?
#AMELIA.
He thought he heard the starlings that had come to eat the grapes.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Poor fellow! As if the starlings were abroad nights! - And the children?
#AMELIA.
Well, the children - she is still keeping them in the cellar, and I hope she won't forget to give them something to eat.
#NEIGHBOUR.
He who feeds the birds will not forget your children, my dear Amelia. And now I'll tell you something which, as a rule, shouldn't be told. There is a small hole in the wall between the Judge's wine - cellar and my own. When I was down there this morning to get the place aired out, I heard voices. And when I looked through the hole, I saw Eric and Thyra playing with a strange little boy.
#AMELIA.
You could see them, neighbour? And -
#NEIGHBOUR.
They were happy and well -
#AMELIA.
Who was their playmate?
#NEIGHBOUR.
That's more than I can guess.
#AMELIA.
This whole dreadful house is nothing but secrets.
#NEIGHBOUR.
That is true, but it is not for us to inquire into them.
#THE JUDGE.
So you are in here conspiring, neighbour! Is it not enough that your evil eye has brought the starlings into my vineyard? For you do have the evil eye - but we'll soon put it out. I know a trick or two myself.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Is it worth while to set him right? One who doesn't believe what is told him!
#AMELIA.
No, this is beyond us!
#THE JUDGE.
Tell me, Amelia, have you noticed where your mother is looking for things when she believes herself to be alone?
#AMELIA.
No, father.
#THE JUDGE.
I can see by your eyes that you know. You were looking this way. Damn the sun that is always burning me! This must be the place! - Now, let me see! The stupidest spot is also the cleverest, so that's where I must look - as in this box of perfume, for instance - And right I was! What's this? Twelve English bills of a pound each. Twelve of them! - Oho! Then it is easy to imagine the rest. But what is it I hear? There are the starlings again! Get away there!
#OLD LADY.
Are you still playing the ghost?
#THE JUDGE.
Are you not in the kitchen?
#OLD LADY.
No, as you see, I am not. Are you not done with the cleaning yet?
#AMELIA.
No, mother, I'll never get done with it. The silver won't clean, and I don't think it is real.
#OLD LADY.
Not real? Let me see! - Why, indeed, it's quite black! Where did you get this set from?
#THE JUDGE.
That one? Why, it came from an estate.
#OLD LADY.
For your services as executor! What you got was like what you gave!
#THE JUDGE.
You had better not make any defamatory remarks, for they are punishable under the law.
#OLD LADY.
Are you crazy, or was there anything crazy about my remark?
#THE JUDGE.
And for that matter, it is silver - sterling silver.
#OLD LADY.
Then it must be Amelia's fault.
#A VOICE.
The Judge can turn white into black, but he can't turn black into white!
#THE JUDGE.
Who said that?
#OLD LADY.
It seemed as if one of the starlings had been speaking.
#THE JUDGE.
Now the sun is here, and a while ago it seemed to be over there.
#OLD LADY.
Who was it that spoke?
#AMELIA.
I think it was that strange school - teacher with the red muffler.
#THE JUDGE.
Ugh! Let us talk of something else.
#SERVANT GIRL.
Dinner is served.
#OLD LADY.
You go down and eat, Amelia.
#AMELIA.
Thank you, mother.
#OLD LADY.
Are you not going to eat anything?
#THE JUDGE.
No, I am not hungry. How about you?
#OLD LADY.
I have just eaten.
#THE JUDGE.
Then you'll excuse me, I'm sure.
#OLD LADY.
There's a roast of venison on the table.
#THE JUDGE.
You don't say so!
#OLD LADY.
Do you think I poison the food?
#THE JUDGE.
Yes, it tasted of carbolic acid this morning.
#OLD LADY.
And what I ate had a sort of metallic taste -
#THE JUDGE.
If I assure you that I have put nothing whatever in your food -
#OLD LADY.
Then I don't believe you. But I can assure you -
#THE JUDGE.
And I won't believe it. Roast of venison is a good thing - I can smell it from here - but bread isn't bad either.
#OLD LADY.
Why are you sitting there watching that chest?
#THE JUDGE.
For the same reason that makes you guard those perfumes.
#OLD LADY.
So you have been there, you sneak - thief!
#THE JUDGE.
Ghoul!
#OLD LADY.
To think of it - such words between us! Us!
#THE JUDGE.
Yes, the world is evil and so is man.
#OLD LADY.
Yes, you may well say so - and ungrateful above all. Ungrateful children rob you of the rent; ungrateful grandchildren rob the fruit from the trees. You are right, indeed: the world is evil -
#THE JUDGE.
I ought to know, I who have had to witness all the rottenness, and who have been forced to pass the death sentence. That is why the mob hates me, just as if I had made the laws -
#OLD LADY.
It doesn't matter what the people say, if you have only a clean conscience - What was that? Who is there?
#THE JUDGE.
Oh, it was that wardrobe. It always cracks when there is rain coming.
#OLD LADY.
It's some kind of performance started by that strolling charlatan.
#THE JUDGE.
What was that, then?
#OLD LADY.
Oh, yes, it's that same juggler. He can play tricks, but he can't scare me.
#THE JUDGE.
Do you think he is one of those mesmerists?
#OLD LADY.
Well, whatever it happens to be called -
#THE JUDGE.
If that's so, how can he know our private secrets?
#OLD LADY.
Secrets? What do you mean by that?
#THE JUDGE.
Now I am getting scared.
#OLD LADY.
Then Old Nick himself may take me if I stay here another minute!
#THE JUDGE.
You mean that there is a portrait of her behind yours?
#OLD LADY.
Come away from here and let us go down and eat. And let us see whether we can't sell off the house and all the rest at auction -
#THE JUDGE.
You are right - sell off the whole caboodle and start a new life! - And now let us go down and eat.
#THE JUDGE.
That's an ordinary human being!
#OLD LADY.
Speak to him!
#THE JUDGE.
Who are you, sir?
#THE OTHER ONE.
I have told you twice. That you don't believe me is a part of your punishment, for if you could believe, your sufferings would be shortened by it.
#THE JUDGE.
It's - him - sure enough! For I feel as if I were turning into ice. How are we to get rid of him? - Why, they say that the unclean spirits cannot bear the sound of music. Play something on the harp, Caroline.
#OLD LADY.
Is he gone?
#THE OTHER ONE.
I thank you for the music, madam. It lulls the pain and awakens memories of better things even in a lost soul - Thank you, madam! - Speaking of the auction, I think you are doing right, although, in my opinion, an honest declaration of bankruptcy would be still better - Yes, surrender your goods, and let every one get back his own.
#THE JUDGE.
Bankruptcy? I have no debts -
#THE OTHER ONE.
No debts!
#OLD LADY.
My husband has no debts!
#THE OTHER ONE.
No debts! That would be happiness, indeed!
#THE JUDGE.
Well, that's the truth! But other people are in debt to me -
#THE OTHER ONE.
Forgive them then!
#THE JUDGE.
This is not a question of pardon, but of payment -
#THE OTHER ONE.
All right! Then you'll be made to pay! - For the moment - farewell! But we'll meet frequently, and the last time at the great auction!
#THE JUDGE.
He's afraid of the sun - he, too! Ha - ha!
#THE OTHER ONE.
Yes, for some time yet. But once I have accustomed myself to the light, I shall hate darkness.
#OLD LADY.
Do you really think he is - the Other One?
#THE JUDGE.
Of course, that's not the way he is supposed to look but then times are changing and we with them. They used to say that he had gold and fame to give away, but this fellow goes around dunning -
#OLD LADY.
Oh, he's a sorry lot, and a charlatan - that's all! A milksop who doesn't dare to bite, no matter how much he would like to!
#THE OTHER ONE.
Take care, I tell you! Take care!
#THE JUDGE.
Take care yourself!
#THE OTHER ONE.
Shame!
#THE JUDGE.
Woe is me!
#THE OTHER ONE.
You have never believed in anything good. Now you shall have to believe in the Evil One. He who is all goodness can harm nobody, you see, and so he leaves that to such villains as myself. But for the sake of greater effectiveness, you two must torture yourselves and each other.
#OLD LADY.
Spare us! Help us! Mercy!
#THE OTHER ONE.
Get up, woman! Woe is me! There is One, and One only, to whom you may pray! Get up now, or - Yes, now you believe, although I don't wear a red cloak, and don't carry sword or purse, and don't crack any jokes - but beware of taking me in jest! I am serious as sin and stern as retribution! I have not come to tempt you with gold and fame, but to chastise you with rods and scorpions - Your time is nearly up. Therefore, put your house in order - because die you must! Whose voice is speaking now? Do you think he can be scared off with your rattle when he comes sweeping across your vineyard? Storm and Hail are his names; destruction nestles under his wings, and in his claws he carries punishment. Put on your caul now, and don your good conscience.
#THE JUDGE.
Mercy!
#THE OTHER ONE.
Yes, if you promise repentance.
#THE JUDGE.
I promise on my oath -
#THE OTHER ONE.
You can take no oath, for you have already perjured yourself. But promise first of all to set the children free - and then all the rest!
#THE JUDGE.
I promise! Before the sun has set, the children shall be here!
#THE OTHER ONE.
That's the first step ahead, but if you turn back, then you'll see that I am as good as my name, which is - Legion!
#PRINCE ERIC.
I think it's awfully dull.
#THYRA.
I think grandmother is nasty.
#PRINCE ERIC.
You mustn't talk like that.
#THYRA.
No, perhaps not, but she is nasty.
#PRINCE ERIC.
You mustn't, Thyra, for then the little boy won't come and play with us again.
#THYRA.
Then I won't say it again. I only wish it wasn't so dark.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Don't you remember, Thyra, that the boy said we shouldn't complain -
#THYRA.
Then I won't do it any more - Oh, look at the sun - spot!
#PRINCE ERIC.
You mustn't step on the sun, Thyra. That's a sin!
#THYRA.
I didn't mean to step on him. I just wanted to have him. Now see - I have him in my arms, and I can pat him. - Look! Now he's kissing me right on the mouth.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Hello, little boy! - Come and shake hands, Thyra! - What's your name, boy? You must tell us to - day.
#THYRA.
You shouldn't be so forward, Eric, for it makes him bashful. - But tell me, little boy, who is your papa?
#PLAYMATE.
Don't be so curious. When you know me better, you'll learn all those things. - But let us play now.
#THYRA.
Yes, but nothing instructive, for that is so tedious. I want it just to be nice.
#PLAYMATE.
Shall I tell a story?
#THYRA.
Yes, but not out of the Bible, for all those we know by heart -
#PRINCE ERIC.
You say such things, Thyra, that he gets hurt -
#PLAYMATE.
No, my little friends, you don't hurt me - But now, if you are really good, we'll go and play in the open -
#PRINCE ERIC.
Oh, yes, yes! - But then, you know, grandmother won't let us -
#PLAYMATE.
Yes, your grandmother has said that she wished you were out, and so we'll go before she changes her mind. Come on now!
#THYRA.
Oh, what fun! Oh -
#PLAYMATE.
Come, children! Come into the sunlight and feel the joy of living!
#THYRA.
Can't we take the sun - spot along? It's a pity to leave it here in the darkness.
#PLAYMATE.
Yes, if it is willing to go with you. Call it! and THYRA go toward the door, followed by the spot of light.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Isn't it a nice little spot! Puss, puss, puss, puss!
#PLAYMATE.
Take it up on your arm, Thyra, for I don't think it can get over the threshold. gets the spot of light on her arm, which she bends as if carrying something.
#OLD LADY.
It's cool and nice here, and then there is no sun to bother you.
#THE JUDGE.
And how quiet it is. But where are the children?
#THE JUDGE.
It looks as if they had taken us at our word.
#OLD LADY.
Us? Please observe that I didn't promise anything, for he - you know - talked only to you toward the end.
#THE JUDGE.
Perhaps, but this time we had better obey, for I don't want to have any more trouble with hail - storms and such things. - However, the children are not here, and I suppose they'll come back when they get hungry.
#OLD LADY.
And I wish them luck when they do! Now it's beginning again.
#THE JUDGE.
Well, why don't you submit and do as he - you know who! - says? I, for my part, don't dare to do wrong any longer. The growing grapes have been destroyed, and we must take pleasure in what is already safe. Come here, Caroline, and let us have a glass of something good to brace us up! This is from the year of the comet - anno 1869, when the big comet came, and everybody said it meant war. And, of course, war did break out.
#OLD LADY.
You drink first!
#THE JUDGE.
Well, now - did you think there might be poison in this, too?
#OLD LADY.
No, really, I didn't - but - we'll never again know what peace is, or happiness!
#THE JUDGE.
Do as I do: submit!
#OLD LADY.
I want to, and I try to, but when I come to think how badly other people have treated us, I feel that I am just as good as anybody else. That's a very fine wine!
#THE JUDGE.
The wine is good, and it makes the mind easier. - Yes, the wiseacres say that we are rapscallions, one and all, so I can't see what right anybody has to go around finding fault with the rest. My own actions have always been legal; that is, in keeping with prevailing laws and constitutions. If others happened to be ignorant of the law, they had only themselves to blame, for no one has a right to ignorance of that kind. For that reason, if Adolph does not pay the rent, it is he who breaks the law, and not I.
#OLD LADY.
And yet the blame falls on you, and you are made to appear like a criminal. Yes, it is as I have always said: there is no justice in this world. If you had done right, you should have brought suit against Adolph and turned out the whole family. But then it isn't too late yet -
#THE JUDGE.
Well, you see, if I were to carry out the law strictly, then I should sue for the annulment of his marriage, and that would cut him off from the property -
#OLD LADY.
Why don't you do it?
#THE JUDGE.
We - e - ell! - I suppose that would settle the matter once for all. A divorce would probably not be granted, but I think it would be possible to get the marriage declared invalid on technical grounds -
#OLD LADY.
And if there be no such grounds?
#THE JUDGE.
There are technical grounds for everything, if you only look hard enough.
#OLD LADY.
Well, then! Think of it - how that good - for - nothing is wishing the life out of us - but now he'll see how "the natural course of events" makes the drones take to the road -
#THE JUDGE.
Ha - ha! You're right, quite right! And then, you know, when I think it over carefully - what reason have we for self - reproach? What wrong have we done? It's mean to bring up that about the monstrance - it didn't hurt anybody, did it? And as for my being guilty of perjury: that's a pure lie. I got blood - poison in the finger - that's all - and quite a natural thing.
#OLD LADY.
Just as if I didn't know it. And I may as well add that this hail - storm a while ago - why, it was as plain a thing as if it had been foretold in the Farmer's Almanac!
#THE JUDGE.
Exactly! That's what I think too. And for that reason, Caroline, I think we had better forget all that fool talk - and if you feel as I do, we'll just turn to another priest and get him to consecrate the mausoleum.
#OLD LADY.
Well, why shouldn't we?
#THE JUDGE.
Yes, why shouldn't we? Perhaps because that mesmerist comes here and talks a lot of superstitious nonsense?
#OLD LADY.
Tell me, do you really think he is nothing but a mesmerist?
#THE JUDGE.
That fellow? He's a first - class charlatan. A che - ar - la - tan!
#OLD LADY.
I am not so sure.
#THE JUDGE.
But I am sure. Su - ure! And if he should ever come before my eyes again - just now, for instance - I'll drink his health and say: here's to you, old humourist! What was that?
#THE JUDGE.
You just get some matches, and I'll clear this matter up. For I am no longer afraid of anything. Not of anything!
#OLD LADY.
Oh, don't, don't!
#THE OTHER ONE.
Now we'll have to have a talk in private.
#THE JUDGE.
Where did you come from?
#THE OTHER ONE.
That is no concern of yours.
#THE JUDGE.
What kind of language is that?
#THE OTHER ONE.
Your own! - Off with your cap! Now you shall hear sentence pronounced: you have wanted to sever what has been united by Him whose name I may not mention. Therefore you shall be separated from her who ought to be the staff of your old age. Alone you must run the gauntlet. Alone you must bear the qualms of sleepless nights.
#THE JUDGE.
Is that mercy?
#THE OTHER ONE.
It is justice; it is the law: an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth! The gospel has a different sound, but of that you didn't want to hear. Now, move I along.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Oh, how beautiful it is!
#THYRA.
Who is living here?
#PLAYMATE.
Whoever feels at home has his home here.
#THYRA.
Can we play here?
#PLAYMATE.
Anywhere except in that avenue over there to the right.
#PRINCE ERIC.
And may we pick the flowers?
#PLAYMATE.
You may pick any flowers you want, but you mustn't touch the tree at the fountain.
#THYRA.
What kind of tree is that?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Why, you know, it is one of those they call "Christ's Blood - drops."
#THYRA.
You should cross yourself, Eric, when you mention the name of the Lord.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Tell me, little boy, why mustn't we touch the tree?
#THYRA.
You should obey without asking any questions, Eric. - But tell me, little boy, why is that ugly scarecrow hanging there? Can't we take it away?
#PLAYMATE.
Yes, indeed, you may, for then the birds will come and sing for us.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Away with you, you nasty old scarecrow! Come and eat now, little birds! Oh, see the Golden Bird, Thyra!
#THYRA.
Oh, how pretty it is! Does it sing, too?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Can you understand what the bird sings, boy?
#PLAYMATE.
No, children, the birds have little secrets of their own which they have a right to keep hidden.
#THYRA.
Of course, Eric, don't you see, otherwise the children could tell where the nests are, and then they would take away the eggs, and that would make the birds sorry, and they couldn't have any children of their own.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Don't talk like a grown - up, Thyra.
#PLAYMATE.
Hush! Somebody is coming. Now let us see if he likes to stay with us or not.
#PLAYMATE.
Well, boy, won't you come and play with us?
#CHIMNEY-SWEEP.
Oh, you don't want to play with me.
#PLAYMATE.
Why shouldn't we?
#CHIMNEY-SWEEP.
I am sooty all over. And besides I don't know how to play - I hardly know what it is.
#THYRA.
Think of it, the poor boy has never played.
#PLAYMATE.
What is your name?
#CHIMNEY-SWEEP.
My name? They call me Ole - but -
#PLAYMATE.
But what's your other name?
#CHIMNEY-SWEEP.
Other name? I have none.
#PLAYMATE.
But your papa's name?
#CHIMNEY-SWEEP.
I have no papa.
#PLAYMATE.
And your mamma's?
#CHIMNEY-SWEEP.
I don't know.
#PLAYMATE.
He has no papa or mamma. Come to the spring here, boy, and I'll make you as white as a little prince.
#CHIMNEY-SWEEP.
If anybody else said it, I shouldn't believe it -
#PLAYMATE.
Why do you believe it then, when I say it?
#CHIMNEY-SWEEP.
I don't know, but I think you look as if it would be true.
#PLAYMATE.
Give the boy your hand, Thyra! - Would you give him a kiss, too?
#THYRA.
Yes, when you ask me!
#PLAYMATE.
Now you are white again. And now you must go behind that rose - bush there and put on new clothes.
#CHIMNEY-SWEEP.
Why do I get all this which I don't deserve?
#PLAYMATE.
Because you don't believe that you deserve it.
#CHIMNEY-SWEEP.
Then I thank you for it, although I don't understand what it means.
#THYRA.
Was he made a chimney - sweep because he had been bad?
#PLAYMATE.
No, he has never been bad. But he had a bad guardian who took all his money away from him, and so he had to go out into the world to earn a living - See how fine he looks now!
#PLAYMATE.
Go to the arcade now, and you'll meet somebody you love - and who loves you!
#CHIMNEY-SWEEP.
Who could love me?
#PLAYMATE.
Go and find out.
#THYRA.
Who is living in there?
#PLAYMATE.
Polly Pry! - But who is coming there?
#PRINCE ERIC.
It's grandmother! Oh, now we are in for it!
#THYRA.
Oh, my! It's grandmother!
#PLAYMATE.
Don't get scared, children. I'll tell her it's my fault.
#PRINCE ERIC.
No, you mustn't, for then she'll beat you.
#PLAYMATE.
Well, why shouldn't I take a beating for my friends?
#PRINCE ERIC.
No, I'll do it myself!
#THYRA.
And I, too!
#PLAYMATE.
Hush! And come over here - then you won't be scolded.
#OLD LADY.
So, this is the famous spring that is said to cure everything - after the angel has stirred it up, of course! - But I suppose it is nothing but lies. Well, I might have a drink anyhow, and water is water. What is it I see? Eric and Thyra with a strange boy! What can it mean? For they are not here. It must be an oracle spring. Ugh, it tastes of copper - he must have been here and poisoned the water, too! Everything is poisoned! Everything! - And I feel tired, too, although the years have not been hard on me - On the contrary, I look quite youthful - but it's hard to walk, and still harder to get up - My God, my God, have mercy! Don't leave me lying here!
#PLAYMATE.
Rise, and leave your evil ways!
#OLD LADY.
Who is that? - Oh, it's you, my nice gentleman, who has led the children astray?
#PLAYMATE.
Go, ungrateful woman! I have wiped the sweat of fear from your brow; I have raised you up when your own strength failed you, and you reward me with angry words. Go - go!
#PRINCE ERIC.
But I am sorry for grandmother just the same, although she is nasty.
#THYRA.
It isn't nice here, and I want to go home.
#PLAYMATE.
Wait a little! Don't be so impatient. - There comes somebody else we know.
#PLAYMATE.
He cannot come here and defile the spring. It is nice of you to be sorry for the old people, but you must believe that what I do is right. Do you believe that? and THYRA. Yes, we believe it, we believe it!
#THYRA.
But I want to go home to mamma!
#PLAYMATE.
I'll let you go.
#PLAYMATE.
For now I must go. The Angelus bell will soon be ringing -
#PRINCE ERIC.
Where are you going, little boy?
#PLAYMATE.
There are other children I must play with - far away from here, where you cannot follow me. But now, when I leave you here, don't forget what I have told you: that you mustn't touch the tree!
#PRINCE ERIC.
We'll obey! We will! But don't go away, for it will soon be dark!
#PLAYMATE.
How is that? Anybody who has a good conscience and knows his evening prayer has nothing, nothing to be afraid of.
#THYRA.
When will you come back to us, little boy?
#PLAYMATE.
Next Christmas I come back, and every Christmas! - Good night, my little friends! and THYRA kneel and pray silently while the bell is ringing.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Do you know who the boy was, Thyra?
#THYRA.
It was the Saviour!
#THYRA.
My!
#PRINCE ERIC.
What do you want? You nasty thing!
#THE OTHER ONE.
I only wanted - Look at me!
#PRINCE ERIC.
Yes?
#THE OTHER ONE.
I am looking like this because once I touched the tree. Afterward it was my joy to tempt others into doing the same. But now, since I have grown old, I have come to repent, and now I am remaining here to warn men, but nobody believes me - nobody - because I lied once.
#PRINCE ERIC.
You don't need to warn us, and you can't tempt us.
#THE OTHER ONE.
Tut, tut, tut! Not so high - and - mighty, my little friend! Otherwise it's all right.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Well, go away then, for I don't want to listen to you, and you scare my sister!
#THE OTHER ONE.
I am going, for I don't feel at home here, and I have business elsewhere. Farewell, children!
#AMELIA.
Eric and Thyra! and THYRA. Oh, there is mamma - dear little mamma!
#OLD LADY.
Well, at last, there you are.
#WITCH.
You have kept me waiting. Why have you called me?
#OLD LADY.
Help me!
#WITCH.
In what way?
#OLD LADY.
Against my enemies.
#WITCH.
There is only one thing that helps against your enemies: be good to them.
#OLD LADY.
Well, I declare! I think the whole world has turned topsyturvy.
#WITCH.
Yes, so it may seem.
#OLD LADY.
Even the Other One - you know who I mean - has become converted.
#WITCH.
Then it ought to be time for you, too.
#OLD LADY.
Time for me? You mean that my years are burdening me? But it is less than three weeks since I danced at a wedding.
#WITCH.
And you call that bliss! Well, if that be all, you shall have your fill of it. For there is to be a ball here to - night, although I myself cannot attend it.
#OLD LADY.
Here?
#WITCH.
Just here. It will begin whenever I give the word -
#OLD LADY.
It's too bad I haven't got on my low - necked dress.
#WITCH.
You can borrow one from me - and a pair of dancing shoes with red heels.
#OLD LADY.
Perhaps I might also have a pair of gloves and a fan?
#WITCH.
Everything! And, in particular, any number of young cavaliers who will proclaim you the queen of the ball.
#OLD LADY.
Now you are joking.
#WITCH.
No, I am not joking. And I know that they have the good taste at these balls to choose the right one for queen - and in speaking of the right one, I have in mind the most worthy -
#OLD LADY.
The most beautiful, you mean?
#WITCH.
No, I don't - I mean the worthiest. If you wish, I'll start the ball at once.
#OLD LADY.
I have no objection.
#WITCH.
If you step aside a little, you'll find your maid - while the hall is being put in order.
#OLD LADY.
Think of it - I am going to have a maid, too! You know, madam, that was the dream of my youth - which never came true.
#WITCH.
There you see: "What youth desires, age acquires."
#PRINCE.
Why do you disturb my peace at this midnight hour?
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
Always, brother, you are asking why. Have you not seen the light yet?
#PRINCE.
Only in part. I can perceive a connection between my suffering and my guilt, but I cannot see why I should have to suffer eternally, when He has suffered in my place.
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
Eternally? You died only yesterday. But then time ceased to exist to you, and so a few hours appear like an eternity.
#PRINCE.
Yesterday?
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
Yes. - But because you were proud and wanted no assistance, you have now to bear your own sufferings.
#PRINCE.
What have I done, then?
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
What a sublime question!
#PRINCE.
But why don't you tell?
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
As our task is to torture each other by truth - telling - were we not called "heroes of truth" in our lifetime? - I shall tell you a part of your own secret. You were, and you are still, a hunchback -
#PRINCE.
What is that?
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
There you see! You don't know what is known to everybody else. But all those others pitied you, and so you never heard the word that names your own deformity.
#PRINCE.
What deformity is that? Perhaps you mean that I have a weak chest? But that is no deformity. "weak chest" - yes, that is your own name for the matter. However, people kept the disfigurement of your body hidden from you, and they tried to assuage your misfortune by showing you sympathy and kindness. But you accepted their generosity as an earned tribute, their encouraging words as expressions of admiration due to your superior physique. And at last you went so far in conceit that you regarded yourself as a type of masculine beauty. And when, to cap it all, woman granted you her favours out of pity, then you believed yourself an irresistible conqueror.
#PRINCE.
What right have you to say such rude things to me?
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
Right? I am filling the saddening duty which forces one sinner to punish another. And soon you will have to fulfil the same cruel duty toward a woman who is vain to the verge of madness - a woman resembling you as closely as she possibly could.
#PRINCE.
I don't want to do it.
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
Try to do anything but what you must, and you'll experience an inner discord that you cannot explain.
#PRINCE.
What does it mean?
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
It means that you cannot all of a sudden cease to be what you are: and you are what you have wanted to become.
#OLD LADY.
Where am I? Is this the right place?
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
Quite right, for you are in the place we call the "waiting - room." It is so called , because here we have to spend our time waiting - waiting for something that will come some time -
#OLD LADY.
Well, it isn't bad at all - and there is the music - and there is a bust - of whom?
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
It's a pagan idol called Pan, because to the ancients he was all they had. And as we, in this place, are of the old order, more or less antiquated, he has been put here for us to look at.
#OLD LADY.
Why, we are not old -
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
Yes, my Queen. When the new era opened , we couldn't keep up with it, and so we were left behind -
#OLD LADY.
The new era? What kind of talk is that? When did it begin?
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
It is easy to figure out when the year one began - It was night, for that matter; the stars were shining brightly, and the weather must have been mild, as the shepherds remained in the open -
#OLD LADY.
Oh, yes, yes - Are we not going to dance here to - night?
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
Of course, we are. The Prince is waiting for a chance to ask you -
#OLD LADY.
Is he a real Prince? real one, my Queen. That is to say, he has full reality in a certain fashion -
#OLD LADY.
You don't look happy, my Prince?
#PRINCE.
I am not happy.
#OLD LADY.
Well, I can't say that I find it very hilarious - and the place smells of putty, as if the glazier had just been at work here. What is that strange smell, as of linseed - oil?
#PRINCE.
What are you saying? Do you mean that charnel - house smell?
#OLD LADY.
I fear I must have said something impolite - but then, it isn't for the ladies to offer pleasantries - that's what the cavalier should do -
#PRINCE.
What can I tell you that you don't know before?
#OLD LADY.
That I don't know before? Let me see - No, then I had better tell you that you are very handsome, my Prince.
#PRINCE.
Now you exaggerate, my Queen. I am not exactly handsome, but I have always been held what they call "good - looking."
#OLD LADY.
Just like me - I never was a beauty - that is, I am not, considering my years - Oh, I am so stupid! - What was it I wanted to say?
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
Let the music begin!
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
Well? Are you not going to dance?
#PRINCE.
No, I don't care to dance.
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
But you must: you are the only presentable gentleman.
#PRINCE.
That's true, I suppose - but is that a fit occupation for me?
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
How do you mean?
#PRINCE.
At times it seems as if I had something else to think of, but then - then I forget it.
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
Don't brood - enjoy yourself while youth is with you and the roses of life still bloom on your cheeks. Now! Up with the head, and step lively -
#OLD LADY.
Ugh! Your hands are cold as ice! goes to the throne] Why are those seven ladies not dancing?
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
How do you like the music, Queen?
#OLD LADY.
It's splendid, but they might play a little more forte -
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
They are soloists, all of them, and formerly each one of them wanted to make himself heard above the rest, and so they have to use moderation now.
#OLD LADY.
But I asked why the seven sisters over there are not dancing. Couldn't you, as master of ceremonies, make them do so?
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
I don't think it would be of any use trying, for they are obstinate as sin - But please assume your throne, my Queen. We are going to perform a little play in honour of the occasion -
#OLD LADY.
Oh, what fun! But I want the prince to ... escort me -
#PRINCE.
Have I got to do it?
#OLD LADY.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself - you with your hunch!
#PRINCE.
Hold your tongue, you cursed old hag!
#OLD LADY.
That'll teach you!
#PRINCE.
And that's, for you!
#PRINCE.
There's the false scalp! Now we'll pull out the teeth!
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
Enough! Enough!
#OLD LADY.
Goodness gracious, that I could let myself be fooled like that! But I haven't deserved any better, I admit.
#PRINCE.
No, you have deserved a great deal worse. You should leave my hunch alone, for otherwise hell breaks loose - It's a miserable thing to see an old woman like you so foolish and so degraded. But, then, you are to be pitied - as all of us are to be pitied.
#ALL.
We are all to be pitied!
#PRINCE.
The queen!
#OLD LADY.
The prince! - But haven't we met before?
#PRINCE.
Perhaps - in our youth - for I am old, too. You had too much frippery on before - but now, when the disguise has been taken away - I begin to distinguish certain features -
#OLD LADY.
Don't say anything more - don't say anything more - Oh, what have I come to - what is happening to me?
#PRINCE.
Now I know: you are my sister!
#OLD LADY.
But - my brother is dead! Have I been deceived? Or are the dead coming back?
#PRINCE.
Everything comes back.
#OLD LADY.
Am I dead or am I living?
#PRINCE.
You may well ask that question, for I don't know the difference. But you are exactly the same as when I parted from you once: just as vain and just as thievish.
#OLD LADY.
Do you think you are any better?
#PRINCE.
Perhaps! I am guilty of all the seven deadly sins, but you have invented the eighth one - that of robbing the dead.
#OLD LADY.
What are you thinking of now?
#PRINCE.
Twelve years in succession I sent you money to buy a wreath for mother's grave, and instead of buying it you kept the money.
#OLD LADY.
How do you know?
#PRINCE.
How I came to know of it is the only thing that interests you about that crime of yours.
#OLD LADY.
Prove it!
#PRINCE.
Here is the money!
#LADY IN WHITE.
Do you know me?
#OLD LADY.
No.
#LADY IN WHITE.
I am Amelia's mother. You have taken the memory of me away from her. You have erased me from her life. But now you are to be wiped out, and I shall recover my child's love and the prayers my soul needs.
#OLD LADY.
Oh, somebody has been telling tales to that hussy - then I'll set her to herd the swine -
#LADY IN WHITE.
Don't strike her!
#OLD LADY.
Are you interceding for me?
#LADY IN WHITE.
It is what I have been taught to do.
#OLD LADY.
You hypocrite! If you only dared, you would wish me buried as deep as there are miles from here to the sun!
#MASTER OF CEREMONIES.
Down with you - monster!
#WITCH.
Get up!
#OLD LADY.
I cannot - I am frozen stiff -
#WITCH.
The sun will rise in a moment. The cock has crowed. The matin bells are ringing.
#OLD LADY.
I don't care for the sun.
#WITCH.
Then you'll have to walk in darkness.
#OLD LADY.
Oh, my eyes! What have you done to me?
#WITCH.
I have only turned out the light because it troubled you. Now, up and away with you - through cold and darkness - until you drop!
#OLD LADY.
Where is my husband? - Amelia! Eric and Thyra! My children!
#WITCH.
Yes, where are they? But wherever they may be, you shall not see them until your pilgrimage is ended. Now, up and away! Or I will loose my dogs!
#THE JUDGE.
This time I am in luck! Here are the accounts of my guardianship; here is the contract for the lease - my report as executor - all of it! Make all the noise you please! As long as the axe stays still, I won't be scared. Everything has a cause: ratio sufficiens. This door must have a spring with which I am not familiar. It surprises me that I don't know it, but it cannot scare me. The axe moved - as a rule, that foretells an execution, but to - day it means only that its equilibrium has become disturbed in some way. Oh, no, nothing will give me pause but seeing my own ghost - for that would be beyond the tricks of any charlatan.
#THE JUDGE.
Who are you?
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
I am not - I have been. I have been that unrighteous judge who is now come here to receive his sentence.
#THE JUDGE.
What have you done then, poor man?
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
Everything wrong that an unrighteous judge might do. Pray for me, you whose conscience is clear -
#THE JUDGE.
Am I - to pray for you?
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
Yes, you who have caused no innocent blood to be shed -
#THE JUDGE.
That's true; that's something I haven't done. And besides, as I have always obeyed the letter of the law, I have good reason to let myself be called a righteous judge - yes, without irony!
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
It would, indeed, be a bad moment for joking, as the Invisible Ones are sitting in judgment -
#THE JUDGE.
What do you mean? Who are sitting in judgment?
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
You don't see them, but I do. Pray for me!
#THE JUDGE.
No, I won't. Justice must take its course. You must have been a great offender to reach consciousness of your guilt so late.
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
You are as stern as a good conscience.
#THE JUDGE.
That's just the word for it. Stern, but just!
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
No pity, then?
#THE JUDGE.
None whatever.
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
No mercy?
#THE JUDGE.
No mercy!
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
Now the verdict is being delivered. Can't you hear?
#THE JUDGE.
I hear nothing.
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
And you see nothing? Don't you see the beheaded sailor, the surveyor, the chimney - sweep, the lady in white, the tenant -
#THE JUDGE.
I see absolutely nothing.
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
Woe unto you, then, when your eyes become opened as mine have been. Now the verdict has been given: guilty!
#THE JUDGE.
Guilty!
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
You have said it - yourself! And you have already been sentenced. All that remains now is the big auction.
#AMELIA.
Before my mother left, she ordered me to clean the hallway and the stairs. It is winter now, and cold, and I cannot say that it has been any pleasure to carry out her order -
#NEIGHBOUR.
So you didn't get any pleasure out of it? Well, my child, I must say that you demand rather too much of yourself. But as you have obeyed, and stood the test, your time of trial shall be over, and I will let you know your life's secret.
#AMELIA.
Speak out, neighbour, for I dare hardly trust my good resolutions much longer.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Well, then! The woman you have been calling mother is your stepmother. Your father married her when you were only one year old. And the reason you have never seen your mother is that she died when you were born.
#AMELIA.
So that was it! - How strange to have had a mother and yet never to have seen her! Tell me - did you ever see her?
#NEIGHBOUR.
I knew her.
#AMELIA.
How did she look?
#NEIGHBOUR.
Well, how did, she look? - Her eyes were blue as the blossom of the flax - her hair was yellow as the dry stalks of wheat -
#AMELIA.
And tall and slender - and her hand was small and white as if it had touched nothing but silk in all her days - and her mouth was shaped like a heart, and her lips looked as if none but good words had ever passed them.
#NEIGHBOUR.
How can you know all that?
#AMELIA.
Because that is the image which appears in my dreams when I have not been good - And then she raises her hand as if to warn me, and on one of her fingers there is a ring with a green stone that seems to radiate light. It is she! - Tell me, neighbour, is there a picture of her in the place?
#NEIGHBOUR.
There used to be one, but I don't know whether it's still here.
#AMELIA.
So this one is my stepmother? Well, God was good when he let me keep my mother's image free from stain - and hereafter I shall find it quite natural that this other woman is cruel to me.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Cruel stepmothers exist to make children kind. And you were not kind, Amelia, but you have become so, and for that reason I shall now give you a Christmas present in advance.
#AMELIA.
My mother - mother of my dreams! But how can I keep the picture when it is to be sold at auction?
#NEIGHBOUR.
You can, because the auction has already taken place.
#AMELIA.
Where and when was it held?
#NEIGHBOUR.
It was held elsewhere - in a place not known to you - and to - day the things are merely to be taken away.
#AMELIA.
What a lot of queer things are happening! And how full of secrets the house is! - But tell me, where is my stepmother? I have not seen her in a long time.
#NEIGHBOUR.
I suppose it must be told: she is in a place from which nobody returns.
#AMELIA.
Is she dead?
#NEIGHBOUR.
She is dead. She was found frozen to death in a swamp into which she had stumbled.
#AMELIA.
Merciful God have pity on her soul!
#NEIGHBOUR.
So he will in time, especially if you pray for her.
#AMELIA.
Of course I will.
#NEIGHBOUR.
How good you have become, my child - as a result of her becoming so bad!
#AMELIA.
Don't say so now when she is dead -
#NEIGHBOUR.
Right you are! Let her rest in peace!
#AMELIA.
But where is my father?
#NEIGHBOUR.
That's a secret to all of us. But it is sweet of you to ask for him before you ask for your own Adolph.
#AMELIA.
Adolph - yes, where is he? The children are crying for him, and Christmas is near. - Oh, what a Christmas this will be to us!
#NEIGHBOUR.
Leave to each day its own trouble - and now take your Christmas present and go. The affairs connected with the auction are to be settled, and then you'll hear news.
#AMELIA.
I go, but no longer alone - and I have a feeling that something good is about to happen, but what I cannot tell.
#NEIGHBOUR.
But I know! Yet you had better go, for what is about to happen here should not be seen by children.
#THE OTHER ONE.
At a compulsory auction held at the court - house for the disposal of property left by the late circuit judge, the items now to be described were bid in by the Court on behalf of absent creditors, and may now be obtained and taken away by their respective owners.
#THE JUDGE.
In the name of the law - hold!
#THE OTHER ONE.
Don't speak of the law! Here the Gospel is preached - but not for you, who wanted to buy heaven with stolen money. - First: the widow and her fatherless children. There is the silver set which the judge accepted from you for his false report as executor. In his stained hands the silver has turned black, but I hope that in yours it will once more turn white. - Then we come to the ward, who had to become a chimney - sweep, after being cheated out of his inheritance. Here are the receipted bills and the property due to you from your guardian. And you need not thank him for his accounting. - Here stands the surveyor who, although he was innocent, had to serve two years in prison because he had made an illegal partition - the maps handed to him for the purpose having been falsified in advance. What can you do for him, Judge? Can you undo what has happened, or restore his lost honour?
#THE JUDGE.
Oh, that fellow - give him a bill and he'll be satisfied! His honour wasn't worth a penny, anyhow.
#THE OTHER ONE.
Here is the brother of the sailor who was beheaded in spite of his innocence. Can you restore his brother to life? No! And you cannot pay for his life with yours, as it is not worth as much. - And finally we come to the neighbour whom you cheated out of his property in a perfectly legal way. Not familiar with the tricks of the law, the neighbour has, contrary to prevailing practice, placed the judge's son - in - law in charge of the property as life tenant, wiping out his previous indebtedness and making him also legal heir to the property.
#THE JUDGE.
I appeal to a higher court!
#THE OTHER ONE.
This case has passed through all the instances except the highest, and that far you cannot reach with your stamped papers. For if you tried, all these poor people whom you have robbed of their living would cry out: Guilty! - Thus we are done with all that could be properly disposed of. What remains here still undisposed of goes to the poor: clocks, vases, jewelry and other valuables that have served as bribes, graft, tips, souvenirs - all in a perfectly legal way because evidence and witnesses were wanting. You poor, take back your own! Your tears have washed the guilt from the ill - gotten goods. And now remains the last item to be sold by me. This pauper here, formerly a judge, is offered to the lowest bidder for board at the expense of the parish. How much is offered? No offer? First, second, third time - no offer?
#THE JUDGE.
Is there no atonement?
#THE OTHER ONE.
Yes, punishment atones. - Take him into the woods and stone him in accordance with the law of Moses - for no other law was ever known to him. Away with him!
#THE JUDGE.
Hush! - I had a dream! They were throwing stones at me - and yet I felt no pain - and then everything turned black and vacant until this moment - How long it may have lasted, I cannot tell - Now I am beginning to hear again - and to feel. It feels as if I were being carried - oh, how cold it is - they are washing me, I think - I am lying in something that has six sides like a cell in a honeycomb and that smells like a carpenter shop - I am being carried, and a bell is ringing - Wait! Now I am riding, but not in a street - car, although the bell is ringing all the time - Now I am sinking down, down, as if I were drowning - boom, boom, boom: three knocks on the roof - and then the lessons begin - the teacher is leading - and now the boys are singing - What can it be? - And then they are knocking on the roof again, incessantly - boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom - silence - it's over! Where am I? I choke! It's so stuffy and close here! - Oh, it's you! - Where are we? Whose bust is that?
#OLD LADY.
They say it is the new god.
#THE JUDGE.
But he looks like a goat.
#OLD LADY.
Perhaps it is the god of the goats?
#THE JUDGE.
"The goats on the left side - " What is that I am recalling?
#PRINCE.
It is the god Pan.
#THE JUDGE.
Pan?
#PRINCE.
Exactly! Just exactly! And when, in the night, the shepherds - no, not those shepherds - catch sight of a hair of his hide they are seized with panic -
#THE JUDGE.
Woe! I don't want to stay here! Woe! Can't I get out of here? I want to get out!
#THE OTHER ONE.
You'll find nothing but entrances - no exits!
#THE JUDGE.
Are you Father Colomba?
#THE OTHER ONE.
No, I am The Other One.
#THE JUDGE.
As a monk?
#THE OTHER ONE.
Don't you know that The Other One turns monk when he grows old; and don't you think it is well that he does so some time? But, seriously speaking - for here everything is serious - this is my holiday attire, which I am permitted to wear only this one day of the year in order that I may remember what I have had and what I have lost.
#THE JUDGE.
What day of the year is it to - day?
#THE OTHER ONE.
It is Christmas Eve!
#THE JUDGE.
Think of it, it is Christmas Eve? - And you know I don't dare to ask where we are - I dare not - but let us go home, home to our children, to our own -
#OLD LADY.
Yes, let us go from here, home to ourselves, that we may start a new life in peace and harmony -
#THE OTHER ONE.
It is too late!
#OLD LADY.
Oh, dear, sweet fellow - help us, have mercy on us, forgive us!
#THE OTHER ONE.
It is too late!
#THE JUDGE.
I am choking with dread! Don't ask him where we are; I don't want to know! But one thing I do want to know: will there ever be an end to this?
#THE OTHER ONE.
Never! - That word "end" is not known to us here.
#THE JUDGE.
No end! And does the sun never enter this place of damp and cold?
#THE OTHER ONE.
Never, for those who dwell here have not loved the sun!
#THE JUDGE.
It is true: I have cursed the sun. - May I confess my sins?
#THE OTHER ONE.
No, you must keep them to yourself until they begin to swell and stop up your throat.
#OLD LADY.
O - I don't know how to pray!
#THE OTHER ONE.
Because for you there is no one to whom you might pray.
#OLD LADY.
Children - send somebody to give me a word of hope and pardon.
#THE OTHER ONE.
It will not be done. Your children have forgotten you - they are now rejoicing at your absence.
#THE JUDGE.
You say they are seated at the Christmas table rejoicing at our misfortune? - No, now you lie, for they are better than we!
#THE OTHER ONE.
What new tune is that? I have always heard that you were a righteous man - I was a great sinner - the greatest one that ever was!
#THE OTHER ONE.
Hm! Hm!
#THE JUDGE.
And if you say anything of the children you are guilty of a sin. I know that they are praying for us.
#OLD LADY.
I can hear them tell their rosaries: hush - I hear them!
#THE OTHER ONE.
You are completely mistaken. What you hear is the song of the workmen who are tearing down the mausoleum.
#THE JUDGE.
The mausoleum! Where we were to have rested in peace!
#PRINCE.
Shaded by a dozen wreaths.
#THE JUDGE.
Who is that?
#PRINCE.
She is my sister, and so you must be my brother - in - law.
#THE JUDGE.
Oh - that lazy scamp!
#PRINCE.
Look here! In this place we are all lazy scamps.
#THE JUDGE.
But we are not all hunchbacks!
#PRINCE.
Don't touch the hunch or there will be hell to pay!
#THE JUDGE.
What a way to treat a man of my ability and high social position! What a Christmas!
#PRINCE.
Perhaps you expected your usual creamed codfish and Christmas cake?
#THE JUDGE.
Not exactly, but there ought to be something to feed on -
#PRINCE.
Here we are keeping a Christmas fast, you see.
#THE JUDGE.
How long will it last?
#PRINCE.
How long? We don't measure time here, because it has ceased to exist, and a minute may last a whole eternity.
#OLD LADY.
We suffer only what our deeds have deserved - so don't complain -
#PRINCE.
Just try to complain, and you'll see what happens. - We are not squeamish here, but bang away without regard for legal forms.
#THE JUDGE.
Are they beating carpets out there - on a day like this?
#PRINCE.
No, it is an extra ration of rod all around as a reminder for those who may have forgotten the significance of the day.
#THE JUDGE.
Do they actually lay hands on our persons? Is it possible that educated people can do things like that to each other?
#PRINCE.
This is a place of education for the badly educated; and those who have behaved like scoundrels are treated like such.
#THE JUDGE.
But this passes all limits!
#PRINCE.
Yes, because here we are in the limitless! Now get ready! I have already been out there and had my portion.
#THE JUDGE.
What humiliation! That's to strip you of all human worth!
#PRINCE.
Ha ha! Human worth! Ha ha! - Look at the scales over there. That's where the human worth is - and invariably found wanting.
#THE JUDGE.
I could never have believed -
#PRINCE.
No, you could only believe in your caul and your own righteousness. And yet you had both Moses and the Prophets and more besides - for the very dead walked for your benefit.
#THE JUDGE.
The children! The children! Is it not possible to send them a word of greeting and of warning?
#PRINCE.
No! Eternally, no!
#THE JUDGE.
What is it?
#WITCH.
Christmas gifts for the righteous. Stereoscopes, you know. Help yourself. They don't cost anything.
#THE JUDGE.
There's a kind soul at last. And a little attention to a man of my age and rank does honour both to your tact and to your heart -
#WITCH.
That's very nice of you, Judge, but I hope you don't mind my having given some thought to the others, too.
#THE JUDGE.
Are you poking fun at me, you damned old hag?
#WITCH.
Hold your tongue, petti - fogger!
#THE JUDGE.
What company I have got into!
#WITCH.
Is it not good enough for you, you old perjurer, you grafter, you forger, you robber of orphans, you false pleader? Now have a look in the peep - show and take in the great spectacle: "From the Cradle to the Grave." There is your whole biography and all your victims - just have a look now. That's right! looks in the stereoscope; then he rises with horror stamped on his face.
#WITCH.
I hope this slight attention may add to the Christmas joy!
#THE JUDGE.
What do you see?
#OLD LADY.
Everything is there; everything! - And do you notice that everything is black? All life that seemed so bright is now black, and even moments which I thought full of innocent joy have an appearance of something nauseating, foul, almost criminal. It is as if all my memories had decayed, including the fairest among them -
#THE JUDGE.
You are right. There is not one memory that can bring light into this darkness. When I look at her who was the first love of my youth, I see nothing but a corpse. When I think of my sweet Amelia, there appears - a harlot. The little ones make faces at me like gutter - snipes. My court has become a pigsty; the vineyard, a rubbish - heap full of thistles; and the mausoleum - Oh, horrors! - an outhouse! When I think of the green woods, the leafage appears snuff - coloured and the trunks look bleached as mast tops. The blue river seems to flow out of a dung - heap and the blue arch above it looks like a smoky roof - Of the sun itself I can recall nothing but the name; and what was called the moon - the lamp that shed its light on bays and groves during the amorous nights of my youth - I can remember only as - no, I cannot remember it at all. But the words are left, although they have only sound without sense. - Love, wine, song! Flowers, children, happiness! - Don't the words sound pretty? And it is all that is left! - Love? What was it, anyhow?
#OLD LADY.
What was it? - Two cats on a back - yard fence.
#THE JUDGE.
Yes, that's it! That's what it was! Three dogs on a sidewalk. What a sweet recollection!
#OLD LADY.
Yes, it is sweet!
#THE JUDGE.
My watch has stopped. I am so hungry - and I am thirsty, too, and I long for a smoke. But I am also tired and want to sleep. All my desires are waking. They claw at me and hound me, but not one of them can I satisfy. We are lost! Lost, indeed!
#OLD LADY.
And I long for a cup of tea more than I can tell!
#THE JUDGE.
Hot green tea - that's just what I should like now - with a tiny drop of rum in it.
#OLD LADY.
No, not rum! I should prefer some cakes -
#PRINCE.
Sugared, of course? I fear you'll have to whistle for them.
#OLD LADY.
Oh, this dreadful language hurts me more than anything, else.
#PRINCE.
That's because you don't know yet how something else is going to hurt you.
#THE JUDGE.
What is that?
#OLD LADY.
No, don't! We don't want to know! Please!
#PRINCE.
Yes, I am going to tell. It begins with -
#OLD LADY.
Mercy! Don't, don't, don't!
#PRINCE.
Yes, I will - and as my brother - in - law is curious, I'll tell it to him. The second letter is -
#THE JUDGE.
This uncertainty is worse than torture - Speak out, you devil, or I'll kill you!
#PRINCE.
Kill, ha ha! Everybody is immortal here, body and soul, what little there is left. However, the third letter is - and that's all you'll know!
#MAN IN GREY.
May I speak a word with you, madam?
#OLD LADY.
What is it about?
#MAN IN GREY.
I'll tell - out there.
#OLD LADY.
No, no; I won't!
#MAN IN GREY.
; It isn't dangerous. Come along! All I want is to speak to you. Come now!
#PRINCE.
A little Christmas entertainment is wholesome.
#THE JUDGE.
Do you mean to maltreat a woman?
#PRINCE.
Here all injustices are abolished, and woman is treated as the equal of man.
#THE JUDGE.
You devil!
#PRINCE.
That's all right, but don't call me hunchback, for that touches my last illusion.
#THE OTHER ONE.
Well, how do you like our animal magnetism? It can work wonders on black - guards!
#THE JUDGE.
I understand nothing of all this.
#THE OTHER ONE.
That's just what is meant, and it is very nice of you to admit that there are things you don't understand.
#THE JUDGE.
Granting that I am now in the realm of the dead -
#THE OTHER ONE.
Say "hell," for that is what it's called.
#THE JUDGE.
Th - then I should like to remind you that He who once descended here to redeem all lost -
#PRINCE.
Don't argue!
#THE JUDGE.
They won't even listen to me! It is beyond despair! No mercy, no hope, no end!
#THE OTHER ONE.
Quite right! Here you find only justice and retribution - especially justice: an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth! Just as you wanted it!
#THE JUDGE.
But among men there is pardon - and that you don't have here.
#THE OTHER ONE.
Monarchs alone possess the right to pardon. And as a man of law you ought to know that a petition for pardon must be submitted before it can be granted.
#THE JUDGE.
For me there can be no pardon!
#THE OTHER ONE.
You feel, then, that your guilt is too great?
#THE JUDGE.
Yes.
#THE OTHER ONE.
Then I'll speak kindly to you. There is an end, you see, if there is a beginning. And you have made a beginning. But the sequel will be long and hard.
#THE JUDGE.
Oh, God is good!
#THE OTHER ONE.
You have said it!
#THE JUDGE.
But - there is one thing that cannot be undone - there is one!
#THE OTHER ONE.
You are thinking of the monstrance which should have been of gold but was of silver? Well, don't you think that He who changed water into wine may also change silver into gold?
#THE JUDGE.
But my misdeed is too great, too great to be forgiven.
#THE OTHER ONE.
Now you overestimate yourself again. But rise up. We are about to celebrate Christmas in our own fashion. - The light of the sun cannot reach here, as you know - nor that of the moon. But on this night, and on this alone, a star rises so far above the rocks that it is visible from here. It is the star that went before the shepherds through the desert - and that was the morning star.
