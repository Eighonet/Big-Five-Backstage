The skin food is nearly out. Skin food! Mutton fat and bergamot, cost, ten cents a jar. China jar and gilt label twenty cents more, total thirty cents, sells for five dollars. Well I guess there’s more money in skin food than there is in stomach food or brain food, for that matter. Anti - fat! Vinegar and water, three dollars a bottle. Anti grandmother! Why, I’m talking about my relatives. What fools these women are. I’ll start a Beauty Parlor I guess. I am a sample of Madame Princeton’s work myself. Humph! I never did a blessed thing for my beauty. I wouldn’t put her skin food on a mangy dog. That fat old Compton thing goes waddling round taking anti - fat and jerking the pulleys in the gymnasium. My, she makes me laugh. She gets fatter every day.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Susan, have you opened up the gymnasium to air it?
#SUSAN.
Yes’m!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Where is Mary?
#SUSAN.
In the stock room.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Have we plenty of everything? There’s going to be a run on Madame Princeton’s Toilet Articles. The World’s Fair medal is a great card.
#SUSAN.
I suppose we’ll get that medal before the next Fair opens?
#MADAME PRINCETON.
The delay is so annoying. But we’ll do as the others do—say we have it already.
#SUSAN.
The skin food is low.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Did you telephone the commission man to hurry up that mutton tallow?
#SUSAN.
Yes, he sent it by mistake to Madame La Duke’s Parlors.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Madame La Duke’s, indeed! I’ll sue her for damages if she steals any more of my secrets.
#SUSAN.
I guess Madame La Duke knows mutton fat from goose grease.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
She is an ignorant imposter. Every idea she has she stole from me. Tell Mary to set the girls making a gross of skin food immediately.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Why, how charming you look, Mrs. Compton.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
I’m nearly starved to death. I haven’t eaten a bite of meat for three days.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Abstinence and Madame Princeton’s Anti - fat will do the business. Take a dose now, That will revive you. It operates on the fat glands and allays their abnormal activity. It is excitement of the fat glands which causes excessive flesh. Do you feel better? You’ve lost, I should say, fifteen pounds the last week.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Madame Princeton, I just feel completely gone. Why, when the girl brought in Mr. Compton’s breakfast this morning, I felt like a wild animal. I just wanted to grab his steak and tear it with my fingers and teeth.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
But you must not indulge your appetite.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
I dare not or Mr. Compton would suspect. Heaven forgive me the lies I’ve told that man. And I a church member, too. Told him one day I had no appetite, and the next a headache, and the next that I had lunched hastily down town. Dear me, what can I tell him next!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Does he suspect you?
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
I’m afraid so. He said this morning if I didn’t eat pretty soon he’d send for the doctor.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Keep it up three days more and then we’ll surprise him. You will have lost at least thirty pounds by that time. Your husband will be delighted at your improved appearance.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
I don’t know about that. He’s a queer man. When I first met him I weighed only ninety pounds. It didn’t seem to matter to him when I weighed twice that.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
But it does matter. He is deceiving you. Men prefer willowly women.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Maybe, but I’ve heard him say that Mrs. Smith was as thin as the last run o’ June shad. Couldn’t you fatten that woman? It would be a relief to her neighbors if you could, and it would prove that you can perform miracles.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Yes, get her to come in. I’ll give you a commission. It’s very simple. If she’d only take my Anti - lean. All she needs is to have the fat glands stimulated. Anti - lean is the greatest discovery of the age.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Would you mind telling me what it is; in confidence, you know.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Oh, goodness, that is a professional secret.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
I’ll tell her about it, but, good land, what ye’re doin’ to me would kill her. I couldn’t stand it if I wasn’t as strong as an ox.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
You are doing bravely. What did you eat for breakfast?
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Three oatmeal crackers and a cup of coffee.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
You have broken the rules. I limited you to two crackers.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
It was Mr. Compton’s fault. He insisted I should eat.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Any cream in the coffee?
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Only a spoonful.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
You must obey me if you expect good results. I’ll give you a double dose of Anti - fat. And you shall lunch here to - day. One small white cracker, one large pickle and a double portion of Anti - fat.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Mayn’t I have a chalk crayon to nibble at. I’ll eat the wax candles next thing.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Oh, you may have all the chalk you want. Now go to the gymnasium. First the rowing apparatus, then the dumb bells and lastly, the swinging rings. That’ll fetch you round.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
If it doesn’t kill me.
#SUSAN.
The mutton fat—
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Hist!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
How do you do, Miss Terwilliger? You are very punctual. Some women have no notion what an engagement means.
#MISS TREHERNE.
Madame Princeton, my face pains terribly. I am really alarmed.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
I told you there would be some pain. Let me see your face. Removing freckles is rather a painful operation, if done by the quick method. It is working beautifully.
#MISS TREHERNE.
Oh, horrors! What a fright! Oh, oh!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Be cool, my dear.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Goodness, what a start you gave me! Why what on earth are you doing to that girl? Poor child! One side of her face is red as a beet and the other brown as a berry.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Really, Mrs. Compton, there is nothing the matter. That is the way it always works, Miss Terwilliger.
#MISS TREHERNE.
But my face is on fire, oh! oh! And I read in the paper that a young lady died here undergoing treatment.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
That was all a lie! I’ll never let another newspaper reporter interview me as long as I live. Come this way for treatment. Madame Compton, go back to your exercises.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Well, I’m glad I haven’t freckles or warts or whiskers. I never could stand it to be skinned alive, I know. I’m so hungry I could eat a jar of that skin food.
#SUSAN.
Silly little goose. She’s going to be a bridesmaid and is willing to be skinned in order to look pretty.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Are you the young lady I spoke to yesterday?
#SUSAN.
You are Miss Dickie Bird?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I am. I have an appointment at this hour.
#SUSAN.
I operate on the hair. Take this seat. Oh, what beautiful hair! If I had that hair I wouldn’t dye it for the world.
#DICKIE BIRD.
But blondes are so fashionable! They are all the rage, you know. Does it cause any inconvenience?
#SUSAN.
Not the least! You can not appear anywhere for several days.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Goodness! What is that?
#SUSAN.
Oh, nothing. They are skinning a girl in there.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Mercy sakes! Skinning a girl! That is horrible.
#SUSAN.
You misunderstand. It is the complexion treatment. It takes off the old skin, and I think they took it off that girl pretty deep. It burns like fire at first.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
My nerves just wont stand that!
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m very glad I don’t have to be skinned. Ugh! it makes me shudder.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
And what are you going to have done?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m going to be bleached!
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
What color?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Why, blonde, of course.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Well, if I had that head of hair I wouldn’t bleach it for the world. What lovely hair, and Mr. Compton does so admire hair.
#DICKIE BIRD.
They all do.
#SUSAN.
Are you ready, Miss Bird?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Quite ready.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Bird! That must be Dickie Bird. Giddy thing! She’s the worst flirt in town. Oh dear, I could eat a raw frog!
#FANNY.
Noise of pulleys going furiously.)
#DICKIE BIRD.
What is that fat old thing doing here?
#SUSAN.
Improving her shape. She’s on Anti - fat.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You couldn’t reduce her waist with one of those what do you call ’em machines. She’s had her day. Why doesn’t she stay at home with her old man.
#SUSAN.
Neither age nor condition is beyond the aid of Madame Princeton. That woman can work miracles.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Why are you so very particular about wrapping me up, Susan?
#SUSAN.
The stuff is very powerful. I musn’t let a single drop get on your skin.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh dear, I am nervous. Mercy, I can’t move hand or foot.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
What is the matter, Miss Bird?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I am afraid!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
My dear, there isn’t the slightest pain or danger. Go on, Susan. You’ve been talking again. Why can’t you keep your customers quiet like mine.
#MISS TREHERNE.
Madame Princeton, you will kill me! Oh, how my face smarts!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
It can’t hurt much.
#MISS TREHERNE.
It’s on fire! Oh, oh!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Only a temporary twinge, Miss Terwilliger. To - day I will apply my great discovery, Pastilla di Pasta and to - morrow you will have the complexion of a baby.
#MISS TREHERNE.
out L., shuts door.) Some people make a great fuss about nothing.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Madame Princeton, haven’t I exercised enough to - day?
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Not half enough!
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Well, I shall die, that’s what I’ll do!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
I wouldn’t if I were you, Mrs. Compton.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Madame Princeton, you are positively cruel! I believe you actually enjoy our sufferings.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
That’s right, excite yourself! Your heart is strong and excitement reduces flesh. It stimulates the lean glands, just as repose invigorates the fat glands.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
But s’pose I die right here in your place. Think of the consequences. One woman did die.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
No, she didn’t.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Goodness, that woman makes me nervous. Talks of dying in the place. I can’t stand this any longer.
#SUSAN.
Be careful, you’ll make me spill it and then—
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Susan, hold your tongue.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I am afraid.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Sit down, Miss Bird. The remedy is as harmless as water.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I am so nervous, let me go home. I read of the girl that nearly died here.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
No such thing ever happened, I tell you. She only fainted.
#DICKIE BIRD.
But papa doesn’t know what I’m doing. He wouldn’t approve at all. And if anything more should happen and my name get in the papers—
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Nothing can happen. How absurd.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
I am nervous, too. If Mr. Compton ever caught me here, oh dear.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Mrs. Compton, I beg you will act rationally. Go back to your pulleys! It is against the rules for one patient to enter the room where another is being operated on.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Humph! I can hear the racket of all of ’em. I’ll break that old machine. McF. Do I have the pleasure of addressing Madame Princeton?
#MADAME PRINCETON.
You do. Won’t you come into the reception room? It’s a mistake of the girl to show you in here. Your name? McF. Miss McFadden. Since we are here I think we can manage. I have but a moment.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Did you wish to enquire about treatment, Miss McFadden? McF. Yes, if you please.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Complexion, perhaps? McF. Exactly! My skin feels rather harsh at times.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
You need my crowning discovery, the wonderful skin food, followed by Pastilla di Pasta. McF. I had thought of trying something of the kind. How much?
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Five dollars a jar. McF. Isn’t that rather expensive?
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Excuse me, it is worth twice the money. I ought to charge ten dollars. The materials are very costly, and the secret is invaluable. McF. I’ll take a jar!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Anything else? McF. No, that is, yes, my sister has a wart on her nose, which disfigures her slightly!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
That can easily be removed. McF. Will it leave a scar?
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Oh dear, no! I never leave a blemish! In fact I improve on nature in her happiest moods, to such a state of perfection has my art attained. McF. Will it be a painful operation?
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Not at all! My customers actually enjoy the various processes, just as they say men enjoy being shaved and having their heads rubbed. McF. My sister may come in— What is that?
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Mercy! What has happened?
#DICKIE BIRD.
There! you’ve spilled some on my hand!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Miss Bird! Miss Bird! Do be careful!
#DICKIE BIRD.
It is black as ink. This is disgraceful, Madame Princeton.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Oh dear, Susan! Wash it off quick with the stain remover!
#MISS TREHERNE.
Madame Princeton, I wont stand this any longer! My face is on fire.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
But, Miss Terwilliger, patience. You will look like a baby when I am done with you.
#MISS TREHERNE.
I’m burning up.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Throw water on her, she’s afire!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Water, indeed!
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
She looks like a boiled lobster now! Did you ever see such a face? McF. But the process is painless?
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Quite so, her nerves are unstrung, poor thing. What are you writing there? McF. Only your address.
#MISS TREHERNE.
Oh, my face! Will it ever look right again?
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Don’t rub it!
#MISS TREHERNE.
But I can’t help it!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
My dear, you will look like a June rose.
#DICKIE BIRD.
And my hand, look at the great horrid black spot.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
It’ll all come off in a month. month, did you say! Oh, I can’t endure it that long.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Humph, I’ve been starving that long. Some people make a great fuss about nothing!
#DICKIE BIRD.
But I must go to the charity ball next week!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Mrs. Compton, you have thirty minutes yet. The rings are next.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Oh sugar! Maybe you think I’m a fool! I’m done with your old machine. I smashed it with the Indian clubs.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Smashed the machine! You shall pay for it. Indeed, you shall.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Oh, I’ll pay. And what’s more, I’ll eat if I have to weigh 300 pounds.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
That’s what you will weigh.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Well, I wont get fat to please you. I am not going to eat if I die for it.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, that stain! It’ll never come off I know.
#MISS TREHERNE.
Oh, my face!
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Oh, my stomach!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Oh, my patience! McF. Yes, your patients. Quite an interesting lot.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Young woman, what are you writing? McF. Just a little item. I am a reporter for the “Daily Fudge.” reporter!
#DICKIE BIRD.
My name in the papers! Papa will never forgive me!
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Mr. Compton will be furious. To think! Our names in the paper.
#MADAME PRINCETON.
Do it if you dare, young woman. She doesn’t dare. I’ll sue the “Fudge” for damages.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
I’m as weak as a cat, or I’d choke you, you horrid thing! Yes I would. My name in the “Daily Fudge!” And that horrid Anti - fat!
#MADAME PRINCETON.
After all ladies like their names in the papers. It wont hurt anything. It advertises business.
