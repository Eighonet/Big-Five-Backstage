#KEITH.
Who's there?
#LARRY.
Only I - Larry.
#KEITH.
Come in! I was asleep.
#KEITH.
What is it, man? Have you committed a murder that you stand there like a fish?
#LARRY.
Yes, Keith.
#KEITH.
By Jove! Drunk again! What do you mean by coming here in this state? I told you - If you weren't my brother - ! Come here, where I can we you! What's the matter with you, Larry?
#LARRY.
It's true.
#KEITH.
What in God's name is this nonsense? Come, Larry! Pull yourself together and drop exaggeration! What on earth do you mean?
#LARRY.
It's true, I tell you; I've killed a man.
#KEITH.
Be quiet! Why come here and tell me this?
#LARRY.
Whom should I tell, Keith? I came to ask what I'm to do - give myself up, or what?
#KEITH.
When - when - what - ?
#LARRY.
Last night.
#KEITH.
Good God! How? Where? You'd better tell me quietly from the beginning. Here, drink this coffee; it'll clear your head.
#LARRY.
My head! Yes! It's like this, Keith - there's a girl -
#KEITH.
Women! Always women, with you! Well? Polish girl. She - her father died over here when she was sixteen, and left her all alone. There was a mongrel living in the same house who married her - or pretended to. She's very pretty, Keith. He left her with a baby coming. She lost it, and nearly starved. Then another fellow took her on, and she lived with him two years, till that brute turned up again and made her go back to him. He used to beat her black and blue. He'd left her again when - I met her. She was taking anybody then. I never met a sweeter woman, or a truer, that I swear. Woman! She's only twenty now! When I went to her last night, that devil had found her out again. He came for me - a bullying, great, hulking brute. Look! I took his ugly throat, and when I let go -
#KEITH.
Yes?
#LARRY.
Dead, Keith. I never knew till afterwards that she was hanging on to him - to h - help me.
#KEITH.
What did you do then?
#LARRY.
We - we sat by it a long time.
#KEITH.
Well?
#LARRY.
Then I carried it on my back down the street, round a corner, to an archway.
#KEITH.
How far?
#LARRY.
About fifty yards.
#KEITH.
Was - did anyone see?
#LARRY.
No.
#KEITH.
What time?
#LARRY.
Three in the morning.
#KEITH.
And then?
#LARRY.
Went back to her.
#KEITH.
Why - in heaven's name?
#LARRY.
She way lonely and afraid. So was I, Keith.
#KEITH.
Where is this place?
#LARRY.
Forty - two Borrow Square, Soho.
#KEITH.
And the archway?
#LARRY.
Corner of Glove Lane.
#KEITH.
Good God! Why, I saw it in the paper this morning. They were talking of it in the Courts! Here it is again. "Body of a man was found this morning under an archway in Glove Lane. From marks about the throat grave suspicion of foul play are entertained. The body had apparently been robbed." My God! You saw this in the paper and dreamed it. D'you understand, Larry? - you dreamed it.
#LARRY.
If only I had, Keith!
#KEITH.
Did you take anything from the - body?
#LARRY.
This dropped out while we were struggling.
#KEITH.
"Patrick Walenn" - Was that his name? "Simon's Hotel, Farrier Street, London." No! - that makes me - What in God's name made you come here and tell me? Don't you know I'm - I'm within an ace of a Judgeship?
#LARRY.
Yes. You must know what I ought to do. I didn't, mean to kill him, Keith. I love the girl - I love her. What shall I do?
#KEITH.
Love!
#LARRY.
Love! - That swinish brute! A million creatures die every day, and not one of them deserves death as he did. But but I feel it here. Such an awful clutch, Keith. Help me if you can, old man. I may be no good, but I've never hurt a fly if I could help it.
#KEITH.
Steady, Larry! Let's think it out. You weren't seen, you say?
#LARRY.
It's a dark place, and dead night.
#KEITH.
When did you leave the girl again?
#LARRY.
About seven.
#KEITH.
Where did you go?
#LARRY.
To my rooms.
#KEITH.
To Fitzroy Street?
#LARRY.
Yes.
#KEITH.
What have you done since?
#LARRY.
Sat there - thinking.
#KEITH.
Not been out?
#LARRY.
No.
#KEITH.
Not seen the girl? Will she give you away?
#LARRY.
Never.
#KEITH.
Or herself hysteria?
#LARRY.
No.
#KEITH.
Who knows of your relations with her?
#LARRY.
No one.
#KEITH.
No one?
#LARRY.
I don't know who should, Keith.
#KEITH.
Did anyone see you go in last night, when you first went to her?
#LARRY.
No. She lives on the ground floor. I've got keys.
#KEITH.
Give them to me.
#LARRY.
I can't be cut off from her!
#KEITH.
What! A girl like that?
#LARRY.
Yes, a girl like that.
#KEITH.
What else have you that connects you with her?
#LARRY.
Nothing.
#KEITH.
In your rooms? Photographs? Letters?
#LARRY.
No.
#KEITH.
Sure?
#LARRY.
Nothing.
#KEITH.
No one saw you going back to her? Nor leave in the morning? You can't be certain.
#LARRY.
I am.
#KEITH.
You were fortunate. Sit down again, man. I must think.
#KEITH.
It's all too unlikely. It's monstrous!
#LARRY.
Yes.
#KEITH.
This Walenn - was it his first reappearance after an absence?
#LARRY.
Yes.
#KEITH.
How did he find out where she was?
#LARRY.
I don't know.
#KEITH.
How drunk were you?
#LARRY.
I was not drunk.
#KEITH.
How much had you drunk, then? little claret - nothing!
#KEITH.
You say you didn't mean to kill him.
#LARRY.
God knows.
#KEITH.
That's something.
#LARRY.
He hit me. I didn't know I was so strong.
#KEITH.
She was hanging on to him, you say? - That's ugly.
#LARRY.
She was scared for me.
#KEITH.
D'you mean she - loves you?
#LARRY.
Yes, Keith.
#KEITH.
Can a woman like that love?
#LARRY.
By God, you are a stony devil! Why not?
#KEITH.
I'm trying to get at truth. If you want me to help, I must know everything. What makes you think she's fond of you?
#LARRY.
Oh, you lawyer! Were you never in a woman's arms?
#KEITH.
I'm talking of love.
#LARRY.
So am I. I tell you she's devoted. Did you ever pick up a lost dog? Well, she has the lost dog's love for me. And I for her; we picked each other up. I've never felt for another woman what I feel for her - she's been the saving of me!
#KEITH.
What made you choose that archway?
#LARRY.
It was the first dark place.
#KEITH.
Did his face look as if he'd been strangled?
#LARRY.
Don't!
#KEITH.
Did it? Very disfigured?
#LARRY.
Yes.
#KEITH.
Did you look to see if his clothes were marked?
#LARRY.
No.
#KEITH.
Why not?
#LARRY.
I'm not made of iron, like you. Why not? If you had done it - !
#KEITH.
You say he was disfigured. Would he be recognisable?
#LARRY.
I don't know.
#KEITH.
When she lived with him last - where was that?
#LARRY.
In Pimlico, I think.
#KEITH.
Not Soho? How long has she been at this Soho place?
#LARRY.
Nearly a year.
#KEITH.
Living this life?
#LARRY.
Till she met me.
#KEITH.
Till, she met you? And you believe - ?
#LARRY.
Keith!
#KEITH.
Always in the same rooms?
#LARRY.
Yes.
#KEITH.
What was he? A professional bully? Spending most of his time abroad, I suppose.
#LARRY.
I think so.
#KEITH.
Can you say if he was known to the police?
#LARRY.
I've never heard.
#KEITH.
Now listen, Larry. When you leave here, go straight home, and stay there till I give you leave to go out again. Promise.
#LARRY.
I promise.
#KEITH.
Is your promise worth anything?
#LARRY.
"Unstable as water, he shall not excel!"
#KEITH.
Exactly. But if I'm to help you, you must do as I say. I must have time to think this out. Have you got money?
#LARRY.
Very little.
#KEITH.
Half - quarter day - yes, your quarter's always spent by then. If you're to get away - never mind, I can manage the money.
#LARRY.
You're very good, Keith; you've always been very good to me - I don't know why.
#KEITH.
Privilege of A brother. As it happens, I'm thinking of myself and our family. You can't indulge yourself in killing without bringing ruin. My God! I suppose you realise that you've made me an accessory after the fact - me, King's counsel - sworn to the service of the Law, who, in a year or two, will have the trying of cases like yours! By heaven, Larry, you've surpassed yourself!
#LARRY.
I'd better have done with it. KErra. You fool! Give that to me.
#LARRY.
No. White magic, Keith! Just one - and they may do what they like to you, and you won't know it. Snap your fingers at all the tortures. It's a great comfort! Have one to keep by you?
#KEITH.
Come, Larry! Hand it over.
#LARRY.
Not quite! You've never killed a man, you see. D'you remember that hammer when we were boys and you riled me, up in the long room? I had luck then. I had luck in Naples once. I nearly killed a driver for beating his poor brute of a horse. But now - ! My God!
#KEITH.
Come, Larry! Courage!
#LARRY.
All right, Keith; I'll try.
#KEITH.
Don't go out. Don't drink. Don't talk. Pull yourself together!
#LARRY.
Don't keep me longer than you can help, Keith.
#KEITH.
No, no. Courage! Courage! My God! I shall need it!
#WANDA.
Oh! it's you, Larry! Why did you knock? I was so frightened. Come in! Oh! Who is it?
#KEITH.
A friend of Larry's. Don't be frightened. You needn't be afraid. I haven't come to do you harm - quite the contrary. Larry wouldn't have given me these, would he, if he hadn't trusted me? I'm sorry to have startled you.
#WANDA.
Who are you, please?
#KEITH.
Larry's brother. He'd told me.
#WANDA.
Yes?
#KEITH.
An awful business!
#WANDA.
Yes; oh, yes! Awful - it is awful!
#KEITH.
In this room?
#WANDA.
Just where you are standing. I see him now, always falling.
#KEITH.
You - look very young. What's your name?
#WANDA.
Wanda.
#KEITH.
Are you fond of Larry?
#WANDA.
I would die for him!
#KEITH.
I - I've come to see what you can do to save him. WANDA, You would not deceive me. You are really his brother?
#KEITH.
I swear it.
#WANDA.
If I can save him! Won't you sit down?
#KEITH.
This, man, your - your husband, before he came here the night before last - how long since you saw him?
#WANDA.
Eighteen month.
#KEITH.
Does anyone about here know you are his wife?
#WANDA.
No. I came here to live a bad life. Nobody know me. I am quite alone.
#KEITH.
They've discovered who he was - you know that?
#WANDA.
No; I have not dared to go out. Well, they have; and they'll look for anyone connected with him, of course.
#WANDA.
He never let people think I was married to him. I don't know if I was - really. We went to an office and signed our names; but he was a wicked man. He treated many, I think, like me.
#KEITH.
Did my brother ever see him before?
#WANDA.
Never! And that man first went for him.
#KEITH.
Yes. I saw the mark. Have you a servant?
#WANDA.
No. A woman come at nine in the morning for an hour.
#KEITH.
Does she know Larry?
#WANDA.
No. He is always gone.
#KEITH.
Friends - acquaintances?
#WANDA.
No; I am verree quiet. Since I know your brother, I see no one, sare.
#KEITH.
Do you mean that?
#WANDA.
Oh, yes! I love him. Nobody come here but him for a long time now.
#KEITH.
How long?
#WANDA.
Five month.
#KEITH.
So you have not been out since - ? What have you been doing?
#WANDA.
Crying. He is in danger because of me. I am so afraid for him.
#KEITH.
Look at me. If the worst comes, and this man is traced to you, can you trust yourself not to give Larry away?
#WANDA.
Look! I have burned all the things he have given me - even his picture. Now I have nothing from him.
#KEITH.
Good! One more question. Do the police know you - because - of your life? You know where Larry lives?
#WANDA.
Yes.
#KEITH.
You mustn't go there, and he mustn't come to you.
#WANDA.
Please do not take him from me altogether. I will be so careful. I will not do anything to hurt him. But if I cannot see him sometimes, I shall die. Please do not take him from me.
#KEITH.
Leave that to me. I'm going to do all I can.
#WANDA.
But you will be kind? Listen! Someone - out there! Oh! Who is it?
#KEITH.
You said no one comes but Larry.
#WANDA.
Yes, and you have his keys. Oh! if it is Larry! I must open! Yes? Please? Who?
#WANDA.
Thank you, air. policeman!
#KEITH.
Curse! I must have left that door. You told me they didn't know you.
#WANDA.
I did not think they did, sir. It is so long I was not out in the town; not since I had Larry.
#KEITH.
After your life, who can believe - ? Look here! You drifted together and you'll drift apart, you know. Better for him to get away and make a clean cut of it.
#WANDA.
Oh, sir! May I not love, because I have been bad? I was only sixteen when that man spoiled me. If you knew -
#KEITH.
I'm thinking of Larry. With you, his danger is much greater. There's a good chance as things are going. You may wreck it. And for what? Just a few months more of - well - you know.
#WANDA.
Oh, sir! Look! It is true. He is my life. Don't take him away from me.
#KEITH.
You must know what Larry is. He'll never stick to you.
#WANDA.
He will, sir.
#KEITH.
The last man on earth to stick to anything! But for the sake of a whim he'll risk his life and the honour of all his family. I know him.
#WANDA.
No, no, you do not. It is I who know him.
#KEITH.
Now, now! At any moment they may find out your connection with that man. So long as Larry goes on with you, he's tied to this murder, don't you see?
#WANDA.
But he love me. Oh, sir! he love me!
#KEITH.
Larry has loved dozens of women.
#WANDA.
Yes, but -
#KEITH.
Don't cry! If I give you money, will you disappear, for his sake?
#WANDA.
It will be in the water, then. There will be no cruel men there.
#KEITH.
Ah! First Larry, then you! Come now. It's better for you both. A few months, and you'll forget you ever met.
#WANDA.
I will go if Larry say I must. But not to live. No! I could not, sir. I could not live without Larry. What is left for a girl like me - when she once love? It is finish.
#KEITH.
I don't want you to go back to that life.
#WANDA.
No; you do not care what I do. Why should you? I tell you I will go if Larry say I must.
#KEITH.
That's not enough. You know that. You must take it out of his hands. He will never give up his present for the sake of his future. If you're as fond of him as you say, you'll help to save him.
#WANDA.
Yes! Oh, yes! But do not keep him long from me - I beg!
#KEITH.
Well, well! Get up. Listen!
#WANDA.
Larry! Oh, thank God!
#LARRY.
Keith!
#KEITH.
So much for your promise not to go out!
#LARRY.
I've been waiting in for you all day. I couldn't stand it any longer.
#KEITH.
Exactly!
#LARRY.
Well, what's the sentence, brother? Transportation for life and then to be fined forty pounds'?
#KEITH.
So you can joke, can you?
#LARRY.
Must. boat leaves for the Argentine the day after to - morrow; you must go by it.
#LARRY.
Together, Keith?
#KEITH.
You can't go together. I'll send her by the next boat.
#LARRY.
Swear?
#KEITH.
Yes. You're lucky they're on a false scent.
#LARRY.
What?
#KEITH.
You haven't seen it?
#LARRY.
I've seen nothing, not even a paper.
#KEITH.
They've taken up a vagabond who robbed the body. He pawned a snake - shaped ring, and they identified this Walenn by it. I've been down and seen him charged myself.
#LARRY.
With murder?
#WANDA.
Larry!
#KEITH.
He's in no danger. They always get the wrong man first. It'll do him no harm to be locked up a bit - hyena like that. Better in prison, anyway, than sleeping out under archways in this weather.
#LARRY.
What was he like, Keith? little yellow, ragged, lame, unshaven scarecrow of a chap. They were fools to think he could have had the strength.
#LARRY.
What! Why, I saw him - after I left you last night.
#KEITH.
You? Where?
#LARRY.
By the archway.
#KEITH.
You went back there?
#LARRY.
It draws you, Keith. KErra. You're mad, I think.
#LARRY.
I talked to him, and he said, "Thank you for this little chat. It's worth more than money when you're down." Little grey man like a shaggy animal. And a newspaper boy came up and said: "That's right, guv'nors! 'Ere's where they found the body - very spot. They 'yn't got 'im yet." An innocent man!
#KEITH.
He's in no danger, I tell you. He could never have strangled - Why, he hadn't the strength of a kitten. Now, Larry! I'll take your berth to - morrow. Here's money You can make a new life of it out there together presently, in the sun.
#LARRY.
In the sun! "A cup of wine and thou." How can I, Keith? I must see how it goes with that poor devil.
#KEITH.
Bosh! Dismiss it from your mind; there's not nearly enough evidence.
#LARRY.
Not?
#KEITH.
No. You've got your chance. Take it like a man.
#LARRY.
Shall we, Wanda?
#WANDA.
Oh, Larry!
#LARRY.
Take them back, Keith.
#KEITH.
What! I tell you no jury would convict; and if they did, no judge would hang. A ghoul who can rob a dead body, ought to be in prison. He did worse than you.
#LARRY.
It won't do, Keith. I must see it out.
#KEITH.
Don't be a fool!
#LARRY.
I've still got some kind of honour. If I clear out before I know, I shall have none - nor peace. Take them, Keith, or I'll put them in the fire.
#KEITH.
I suppose I may ask you not to be entirely oblivious of our name. Or is that unworthy of your honour?
#LARRY.
I'm awfully sorry, Keith; awfully sorry, old man.
#KEITH.
You owe it to me - to our name - to our dead mother - to do nothing anyway till we see what happens.
#LARRY.
I know. I'll do nothing without you, Keith.
#KEITH.
Can I trust you?
#LARRY.
You can trust me.
#KEITH.
Swear?
#LARRY.
I swear.
#KEITH.
Remember, nothing! Good night!
#LARRY.
Good night!
#LARRY.
An innocent man!
#WANDA.
Oh, Larry! But so are you. What did we want - to kill that man? Never! Oh! kiss me! I have suffered so - not seein' you. Don't leave me again - don't! Stay here. Isn't it good to be together? - Oh! Poor Larry! How tired you look! - Stay with me. I am so frightened all alone. So frightened they will take you from me.
#LARRY.
Poor child!
#WANDA.
No, no! Don't look like that!
#LARRY.
You're shivering.
#WANDA.
I will make up the fire. Love me, Larry! I want to forget.
#LARRY.
The poorest little wretch on God's earth - locked up - for me! little wild animal, locked up. There he goes, up and down, up and down - in his cage - don't you see him? - looking for a place to gnaw his way through - little grey rat.
#WANDA.
No, no! I can't bear it! Don't frighten me more!
#LARRY.
There, there!
#WANDA.
If we could sleep a little - wouldn't it be nice?
#LARRY.
Sleep?
#WANDA.
Promise to stay with me - to stay here for good, Larry. I will cook for you; I will make you so comfortable. They will find him innocent. And then - Oh, Larry! in the sun - right away - far from this horrible country. How lovely! Larry!
#LARRY.
To the edge of the world - and - over!
#WANDA.
No, no! No, no! You don't want me to die, Larry, do you? I shall if you leave me. Let us be happy! Love me!
#LARRY.
Ah! Let's be happy and shut out the sight of him. Who cares? Millions suffer for no mortal reason. Let's be strong, like Keith. No! I won't leave you, Wanda. Let's forget everything except ourselves. There he goes - up and down!
#WANDA.
No, no! See! I will pray to the Virgin. She will pity us!
#LARRY.
Pray for us! Bravo! Pray away! What?
#WANDA.
She is smiling! We shall be happy soon.
#LARRY.
Poor child! When we die, Wanda, let's go together. We should keep each other warm out in the dark.
#WANDA.
Yes! oh, yes! If you die I could not - I could not go on living!
#HANK.
Pyper! Glove Lyne murder! Trial and verdict! Verdict! Pyper!
#KEITH.
Where's Larry?
#WANDA.
He went to the trial. I could not keep him from it. The trial - Oh! what has happened, sir?
#KEITH.
Guilty! Sentence of death! Fools! - idiots!
#WANDA.
Of death!
#KEITH.
Girl! girl! It may all depend on you. Larry's still living here?
#WANDA.
Yes.
#KEITH.
I must wait for him.
#WANDA.
Will you sit down, please?
#KEITH.
Are you ready to go away at any time?
#WANDA.
Yes, yes; always I am ready.
#KEITH.
And he?
#WANDA.
Yes - but now! What will he do? That poor man! graveyard thief - a ghoul!
#WANDA.
Perhaps he was hungry. I have been hungry: you do things then that you would not. Larry has thought of him in prison so much all these weeks. Oh! what shall we do now?
#KEITH.
Listen! Help me. Don't let Larry out of your sight. I must see how things go. They'll never hang this wretch. Now, we must stop Larry from giving himself up. He's fool enough. D'you understand?
#WANDA.
Yes. But why has he not come in? Oh! If he have, already!
#KEITH.
My God! If the police come - find me here - No, he wouldn't without seeing you first. He's sure to come. Watch him like a lynx. Don't let him go without you.
#WANDA.
I will try, sir.
#KEITH.
Listen! It's he!
#LARRY.
Keith! So you've seen?
#KEITH.
The thing can't stand. I'll stop it somehow. But you must give me time, Larry.
#LARRY.
Still looking after your honour, KEITH!
#KEITH.
Think my reasons what you like.
#WANDA.
Larry!
#LARRY.
Sorry, old man.
#KEITH.
This man can and shall get off. I want your solemn promise that you won't give yourself up, nor even go out till I've seen you again.
#LARRY.
I give it.
#KEITH.
By the memory of our mother, swear that.
#LARRY.
I swear.
#KEITH.
I have your oath - both of you - both of you. I'm going at once to see what can be done.
#LARRY.
Good luck, brother.
#WANDA.
What does it mean?
#LARRY.
Supper, child - I've had nothing all day. Put these lilies in water. We've had a good time, Wanda. Best time I ever had, these last two months; and nothing but the bill to pay.
#WANDA.
Oh, Larry! Larry!
#LARRY.
Take off those things and put on a bridal garment.
#WANDA.
Promise me - wherever you go, I go too. Promise! Larry, you think I haven't seen, all these weeks. But I have seen everything; all in your heart, always. You cannot hide from me. I knew - I knew! Oh, if we might go away into the sun! Oh! Larry - couldn't we? Well! If it must be dark - I don't care, if I may go in your arms. In prison we could not be together. I am ready. Only love me first. Don't let me cry before I go. Oh! Larry, will there be much pain?
#LARRY.
No pain, my pretty.
#WANDA.
It is a pity.
#LARRY.
If you had seen him, as I have, all day, being tortured. Wanda, - we shall be out of it. We shall be free in the dark; free of their cursed inhumanities. I hate this world - I loathe it! I hate its God - forsaken savagery; its pride and smugness! Keith's world - all righteous will - power and success. We're no good here, you and I - we were cast out at birth - soft, will - less - better dead. No fear, Keith! I'm staying indoors. Drink it up! Now go and make yourself beautiful.
#WANDA.
Oh, Larry!
#LARRY.
Hanged by the neck until he's dead - for what I did.
#LARRY.
Two each - after food. Oh! my girl! "No more, no more, the moon is dead, And all the people in it."
#LARRY.
It's all here - I've confessed. "Please bury us together." "LAURENCE DARRANT. "January 28th, about six p.m." They'll find us in the morning. Come and have supper, my dear love.
#KEITH.
Asleep! Drunk! Ugh! What! Larry! Larry! My God! "I, Lawrence Darrant, about to die by my own hand confess that I - " If I leave that there - my name - my whole future! My God! It's ruin! All my - No! Let him hang! What's that? What - ! Fool! Nothing!
