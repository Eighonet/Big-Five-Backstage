Hello! Cat - nappin' was I, Polly?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Just a kitten - nap, I guess. The yoke done?
#LINK.
Thar! When he's ben steamed a spell, and bended snug, I guess this feller'll sarve t' say "Gee" to - and "Haw" to him. Beech every time, Sir; beech or walnut. Hang me if I'd shake a whip at birch, for ox - yokes. - Polly, are ye thar?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, Uncle Link.
#LINK.
What's that I used to sing ye? "Polly, put the kittle on, Polly, put the kittle on, Polly, put the kittle on - " We'll give this feller a dose of ox - yoke tea!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
The kettle's boilin'.
#LINK.
Wall, then, steep him good.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
You're feelin' smart to - day.
#LINK.
Smart! - Wall, if I could git a hull man to swap legs with me, mebbe I'd arn my keep. But this here settin' dead an' alive, without no legs, day in, day out, don't make an old hoss wuth his oats.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
I guess you'll soon be walkin' round.
#LINK.
Not if that doctor feller has his say: He says I can't never go agin this side o' Jordan; and looks like he's 'bout right. - Nine months to - morrer, Polly, gal, sence I had that stroke.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
You're fitter sittin' than most folks standin'.
#LINK.
Oh, they can't keep my two hands from makin' ox - yokes. That's my second natur' sence I was a boy. What's that?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Why, that's the army veterans down to the graveyard. This is Decoration mornin': you ain't forgot?
#LINK.
So 'tis, so 'tis. Roger, your young man - ha! He come and axed me was I agoin' to the cemetery. "Me? Don't I look it?" says I. Ha! "Don't I look it?" He meant - to decorate the graves. course; but I must take my little laugh. I told him I guessed I wa'n't persent'ble anyhow, my mustache and my boots wa'n't blacked this mornin'. I don't jest like t' talk about my legs. - Be you a - goin' to take your young school folks, Polly?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Dear no! I told my boys and girls to march up this way with the band. I said I'd be a - stayin' home and learnin' how to keep school in the woodpile here with you.
#LINK.
Schoolma'am at seventeen! Some smart, I tell ye!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
School - master, you, past seventy; that's smarter! I tell 'em I learn from you, so's I can teach my young folks what the study - books leave out.
#LINK.
Sure ye don't want to jine the celebratin'?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
No Sir! We're goin' to celebrate right here, and you're to teach me to keep school some more.
#LINK.
What's thar?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Your teachin' rig.
#LINK.
The old blue coat! - My, but I'd like to see the boys: the Grand Old Army Boys! Yes, we was boys: jest boys! Polly, you tell your young folks, when they study the books, that we was nothin' else but boys jest fallin' in love, with best gals left t' home - the same as you; and when the shot was singin', we pulled their pictur's out, and prayed to them 'most more 'n the Allmighty. Thar she blows Agin!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
They're marchin' to the graves with flowers.
#LINK.
My Godfrey! 't ain't so much thinkin' o' flowers and the young folks, their faces, and the blue line of old fellers marchin' - it's the music! that old brass voice a - callin'! Seems as though, legs or no legs, I'd have to up and foller to God - knows - whar, and holler - holler back to guns roarin' in the dark. No; durn it, no! I jest can't stan' the music.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Uncle Link, you want that I should steam this longer?
#LINK.
Oh, kittleful, a kittleful.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Now, then, I'm ready for school. - I hope I've drawed the map all right.
#LINK.
Map? Oh, the map! Yes, thar she be: old Gettysburg!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
I know the places - most.
#LINK.
So, do ye? Good, now: whar's your marker?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Here.
#LINK.
Willoughby Run: whar's that?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
That's farthest over next the barn door.
#LINK.
My, how we fit the Johnnies thar, the fust mornin'! Jest behind them willers, acrost the Run, that's whar we captur'd Archer. My, my!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Over there - that's Seminary Ridge. Peach Orchard, Devil's Den, Round Top, the Wheatfield -
#LINK.
Lord, Lord, the Wheatfield!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Cemetery Hill, Little Round Top, Death Valley, and this here is Cemetery Ridge.
#LINK.
And colors flyin'! We kep 'em flyin' thar, too, all three days, from start to finish.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Have I learned 'em right?
#LINK.
A number One, chick! Wait a mite: Culp's Hill: I don't jest spy Culp's Hill.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
There wa'n't enough kindlin's to spare for that. It ought to lay east there, towards the kitchen.
#LINK.
Let it go! That's whar us Yanks left our back door ajar and Johnson stuck his foot in: kep it thar, too, till he got it squoze off by old Slocum. Let Culp's Hill lay for now. - Lend me your marker. Death Valley needs some scoopin' deeper. So: smooth off them chips. You better guess 't was deep as hell, that second day, come sundown. - Here, flat down the Wheatfield yonder. Goda'mighty! that Wheatfield: wall, we flatted it down flatter than any pancake what you ever cooked, Polly; and 't wan't no maple syrup neither was runnin', slipp'ry hot and slimy black all over it, that nightfall.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Here's the road to Emmetsburg.
#LINK.
No, 'tain't: this here's the pike to Taneytown, where Sykes's boys come sweatin', after an all - night march, jest in the nick to save our second day. The Emmetsburg road's thar. - Whar was I, 'fore I fell cat - nappin'?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
At sunset, July second, Sixty - three.
#LINK.
The Bloody Sundown! God, that crazy sun: she set a dozen times that afternoon, red - yeller as a punkin jacko'lantern, rairin' and pitchin' through the roarin' smoke till she clean busted, like the other bombs, behind the hills.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
My! Wa'n't you never scart and wished you'd stayed t' home?
#LINK.
Scart? Wall, I wonder! Chick, look a - thar: them little stripes and stars. I heerd a feller onct, down to the store, - a dressy mister, span - new from the city - layin' the law down: "All this stars and stripes," says he, "and red and white and blue is rubbish, mere sentimental rot, spread - eagleism!" "I wan't t' know!" says I. "In Sixty - three, I knowed a lad, named Link. Onct, after sundown I met him stumblin' - with two dead men's muskets for crutches - towards a bucket, full of ink - water, they called it. When he'd drunk a spell, he tuk the rest to wash his bullet holes. - Wall, sir, he had a piece o' splintered stick, with red and white and blue, tore 'most t' tatters, a - danglin' from it." "Be you color sergeant?" says I. "Not me," says Link; "the sergeant's dead, but when he fell, he handed me this bit o' rubbish - red and white and blue." And Link he laughed. "What be you laughin' for?" says I. "Oh, nothin'. Ain't it lovely, though!" says Link.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
What did the span - new mister say to that?
#LINK.
I didn't stop to listen. Them as never heerd dead men callin' for the colors don't guess what they be. But this ain't keepin' school!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
I guess I'm learnin' somethin', Uncle Link.
#LINK.
The second day, 'fore sunset. Yon's the Wheatfield. Behind it thar lies Longstreet with his rebels. Here be the Yanks, and Cemetery Ridge behind 'em. Hancock - he's our general - he's got to hold the Ridge, till reinforcements from Taneytown. But lose the Wheatfield, lose the Ridge, and lose the Ridge - lose God - and - all! - Lee, the old fox, he'd nab up Washington, Abe Lincoln and the White House in one bite! - So the Union, Polly, - me and you and Roger, your Uncle Link, and Uncle Sam - is all thar - growin' in that Wheatfield.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
And they're growin' still!
#LINK.
Not the wheat, though. Over them stone walls, thar comes the Johnnies, thick as grasshoppers: gray legs a - jumpin' through the tall wheat tops. And now thar ain't no tops, thar ain't no wheat, thar ain't no lookin': jest blind feelin' round in the black mud, and trampin' on boys' faces, and grapplin' with hell - devils, and stink o' smoke, and stingin' smother, and - up thar through the dark - that crazy punkin sun, like an old moon lopsided, crackin' her red shell with thunder!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Oh! What was God a - thinkin' of, t' allow the created world to act that awful?
#LINK.
Now, I wonder! - Cast your eye along this hoe: Thar in that poked up mess o' dirt, you see yon weeny chip of ox - yoke? - That's the boy I spoke on: Link, Link Tadbourne: "Chipmunk Link," they call him, 'cause his legs is spry 's a squirrel's. - Wall, mebbe some good angel, with bright eyes like yourn, stood lookin' down on him that day, keepin' the Devil's hoe from crackin' him. If so, I reckon, Polly, it was you. But mebbe jest Old Nick, as he sat hoein' them hills, and haulin' in the little heaps o' squirmin' critters, kind o' reco'nized Link as his livin' image, and so kep him to put in an airthly hell, whar thar ain't no legs, and worn - out devils sit froze in high - backed chairs, list'nin' to bugles - bugles - bugles, callin'.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Don't, dear; they'll soon quit playin'. Never mind 'em.
#LINK.
No, never mind; that's right. It's jest that onct - onct we was boys, onct we was boys - with legs. But never mind. An old boy ain't a bugle. Onct, though, he was: and all God's life a - snortin' outn his nostrils, and Hell's mischief laughin' outn his eyes, and all the mornin' winds ablowin' Glory Hallelujahs, like brass music, from his mouth. - But never mind! 'T ain't nothin': boys in blue ain't bugles now. Old brass gits rusty, and old underpinnin' gits rotten, and trapped chipmunks lose their legs. But jest the same - - for holy God, that band! Why don't they stop that band!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
I'll run and tell them. Sit quiet, dear. I'll be right back.
#LINK.
Set quiet! Dead folks don't set, and livin' folks kin stand, and Link - he kin set quiet. - Goda'mighty, how kin he set, and them a - marchin' thar with old John Brown? Lord God, you ain't forgot the boys, have ye? the boys, how they come marchin' home to ye, live and dead, behind old Brown, a - singin' Glory to ye! Jest look down: thar's Gettysburg, thar's Cemetery Ridge: don't say ye disremember them! And thar's the colors: Look, he's picked 'em up - the sergeant's blood splotched 'em some - but thar they be, still flyin'! Link done that: Link - the spry boy, what they call Chipmunk: you ain't forgot his double - step, have ye? - My God, why do You keep on marchin' and leave him settin' here? No! - I - won't - set! Them are the boys that marched to Kingdom - Come ahead of us, but we keep fallin' in line. Them voices - Lord, I guess you've brought along your Sunday choir of young angel folks to help the boys out. Glory! - Never mind me singin': you kin drown me out. But I'm goin' t' jine in, or bust! " - a - mold'rin' in the grave, John Brown's body lies a - mold'rin' in the grave, John Brown's body lies a - mold'rin' in the grave, But his soul goes - " Lord, Lord, my legs! Whar did Ye git my legs? I'm comin', boys! Link's loose agin: Chipmunk has sprung his trap. Now, boys, three cheers for Cemetery Ridge! Jine in, jine in! Hooray! - Hooray! - Hooray! " - ry hallelujah, Glory, glory hallelujah, His truth is marchin' on!"
