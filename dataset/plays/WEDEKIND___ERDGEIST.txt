#SCHOEN.
Do you know, I'm getting acquainted with a brand new side of the lady.
#SCHWARZ.
I have never painted anyone whose expression changed so continuously. I could hardly keep a single feature the same two days running.
#SCHOEN.
Do you find that in it?
#SCHWARZ.
I have done everything imaginable to call forth some sort of quiet in her mood by my conversation during the sittings.
#SCHOEN.
Then I understand the difference. Do you think that makes it look more like her?
#SCHWARZ.
We can only work with art as scientifically as possible.
#SCHOEN.
Tell me -
#SCHWARZ.
The color had sunk in pretty well, too.
#SCHOEN.
Have you ever loved a woman in your life?
#SCHWARZ.
The dress isn't made to stand out enough yet. We don't see the living body under it.
#SCHOEN.
I make no doubt that the workmanship is good.
#SCHWARZ.
If you'll step this way....
#SCHOEN.
You must have told her regular ghost - stories.
#SCHWARZ.
As far back as you can.
#SCHOEN.
Excuse me -
#SCHWARZ.
That's all right.
#SCHOEN.
What is that?
#SCHWARZ.
Do you know her?
#SCHOEN.
No. costume - picture.
#SCHOEN.
But, really, you've succeeded with =her=.
#SCHWARZ.
You know her?
#SCHOEN.
No. And in that costume - ?
#SCHWARZ.
It isn't nearly finished yet. What would you have? While she is posing for me I have the pleasure of entertaining her husband.
#SCHOEN.
What?
#SCHWARZ.
We talk about art, of course, - to complete my good fortune!
#SCHOEN.
But how did you make such a charming acquaintance?
#SCHWARZ.
As they're generally made. An ancient, tottering little man drops in on me here to know if I can paint his wife. Why, of course, were she as wrinkled as Mother Earth! Next day at ten prompt the doors fly open, and the fat - belly drives this little beauty in before him. I can feel even now how my knees shook. Then comes a sap - green lackey, stiff as a ramrod, with a package under his arm. Where is the dressing - room? Imagine my plight. I open the door there Just luck that everything was in order. The sweet thing vanishes into it, and the old fellow posts himself outside as a bastion. Two minutes later out she steps in this Pierrot. I never saw anything like it.
#SCHOEN.
And the fat - belly stands guard?
#SCHWARZ.
The whole body in harmony with that impossible costume as if it had come into the world in it! Her way of burying her elbows in her pockets, of lifting her little feet from the rug, - the blood often shoots to my head....
#SCHOEN.
One can see that in the picture.
#SCHWARZ.
People like us, you know -
#SCHOEN.
Here the model is mistress of the conversation.
#SCHWARZ.
She has never yet opened her mouth.
#SCHOEN.
Is it possible?
#SCHWARZ.
Allow me to show the costume to you.
#SCHOEN.
A devilish beauty. There's more depth here. He is still rather young for his age.
#SCHWARZ.
What sort of material is that?
#SCHOEN.
Satin.
#SCHWARZ.
And all in one piece.
#SCHOEN.
How does one get into it then?
#SCHWARZ.
That I can't tell you.
#SCHOEN.
What enormous trowser - legs!
#SCHWARZ.
The left one she pulls up.
#SCHOEN.
Above the knee!
#SCHWARZ.
She does that entrancingly!
#SCHOEN.
And transparent stockings?
#SCHWARZ.
Those have got to be painted, specially.
#SCHOEN.
Oh, you can do that.
#SCHWARZ.
And with it all a coquetry!
#SCHOEN.
What brought you to that horrible suspicion?
#SCHWARZ.
There are things that our school - philosophy lets itself never dream of.
#SCHOEN.
When we sleep....
#SCHWARZ.
If you wish to make her acquaintance too -
#SCHOEN.
No.
#SCHWARZ.
They must be here in a moment.
#SCHOEN.
How much longer will the lady have to sit?
#SCHWARZ.
I shall probably have to bear the pains of Tantalus three months longer.
#SCHOEN.
I mean the other one.
#SCHWARZ.
I beg your pardon. Three times more at most. If the lady will just leave me the upper part of the dress then....
#SCHOEN.
With pleasure. Let us see you at my house again soon. For Heaven's sake!
#SCHWARZ.
May I introduce ...
#DR. GOLL.
What are you doing here?
#LULU.
You're not going already?
#DR. GOLL.
But what wind blows you here?
#SCHOEN.
I've been looking at the picture of my bride.
#LULU.
Your bride is here?
#DR. GOLL.
So you're having work done here, too?
#LULU.
Look at it! Enchanting! Entrancing!
#DR. GOLL.
Have you got her hidden somewhere round here?
#LULU.
So that is the sweet young prodigy who's made a new person out of you....
#SCHOEN.
She sits in the afternoon mostly.
#DR. GOLL.
And you don't tell anyone about it?
#LULU.
Is she really so solemn?
#SCHOEN.
Probably the after - effects of the seminary still, dear lady.
#DR. GOLL.
One can see that you have been transformed profoundly.
#LULU.
But now you mustn't let her wait any longer.
#SCHOEN.
In a fortnight I think the engagement will come out.
#DR. GOLL.
Let's lose no time. Hop!
#LULU.
Just think, we came at a trot over the new bridge. I was driving, myself.
#DR. GOLL.
No, no. We two will talk some more later. Get along, Nellie. Hop!
#LULU.
Now you're going to talk about me!
#DR. GOLL.
Our Apelles is already wiping his brushes.
#LULU.
I had imagined it would be much more amusing.
#SCHOEN.
But you have always the satisfaction of preparing for us the greatest and rarest pleasure.
#LULU.
Oh, just wait!
#SCHWARZ.
If madame will be so kind....
#DR. GOLL.
I christened her Nellie, you know, in our marriage - contract.
#SCHOEN.
Did you? - Yes.
#DR. GOLL.
What do you think of it?
#SCHOEN.
Why not call her rather Mignon?
#DR. GOLL.
That would have been good, too. I didn't think of that.
#SCHOEN.
Do you consider the name so important?
#DR. GOLL.
Hm.... You know, I have no children.
#SCHOEN.
But you've only been married a couple of months.
#DR. GOLL.
Thanks, I don't want any.
#SCHOEN.
Have a cigarette?
#DR. GOLL.
I've plenty to do with this one. Say, what's your little danseuse doing now?
#SCHOEN.
You and a danseuse?
#SCHWARZ.
The lady was sitting for me at that time only as a favor. I made her acquaintance on a flying trip of the Cecilia Society.
#DR. GOLL.
Hm.... I think we're getting a change of weather.
#SCHOEN.
The toilet isn't going so quickly, is it?
#DR. GOLL.
It's going like lightning! Woman has got to be a virtuoso in her job. So must we all, each in his job, if life isn't to turn to beggary. Hop, Nellie!
#LULU.
Just a second!
#DR. GOLL.
I can't get onto these blockheads.
#SCHOEN.
I can't help envying them. These blockheads know nothing holier than an altar - cloth, and feel richer than you and me with 30,000 - mark incomes. Besides, you can't be judge of a man who from childhood has lived from palette to mouth. Try to get at his finances: it's an arithmetic example! I haven't the moral courage, and one can easily burn one's fingers at it, too.
#LULU.
Here I am!
#SCHOEN.
Superb!
#LULU.
Well?
#SCHOEN.
You put shame on the boldest fancy.
#LULU.
How do you like me? picture before which art must despair.
#DR. GOLL.
Don't you think so, too?
#SCHOEN.
Have you any notion what you do?
#LULU.
I'm perfectly possessed of myself!
#SCHOEN.
Then you might be a little more discreet.
#LULU.
But I'm only doing what's my duty.
#SCHOEN.
You are powdered?
#LULU.
What do you take me for!
#DR. GOLL.
I've never seen such a white skin as she's got. I've told our Raphael here, too, to do just as little with the flesh tints as possible. For once, I can't get enthusiastic about the modern art - nonsense.
#SCHWARZ.
At any rate, it's thanks to impressionism that present - day art can stand up beside the old masters without blushing.
#DR. GOLL.
Oh, it can do quite well for a bit of butcher's work.
#SCHOEN.
For Heaven's sake don't get excited!
#DR. GOLL.
They can see your undershirt. You must pull it lower.
#LULU.
I would soonest have left it off. It only bothers me.
#DR. GOLL.
He should be able to paint it out.
#LULU.
What would you say now, if you had to stand at attention for two hours?
#SCHOEN.
I'd sell my soul to the devil for the chance to exchange with you.
#DR. GOLL.
Come over here. Here is my post of observation.
#LULU.
So?
#SCHWARZ.
Yes....
#LULU.
So?
#SCHWARZ.
Yes, yes....
#DR. GOLL.
From this place I find her still more attractive.
#LULU.
I beg pardon! I am equally attractive on all sides.
#SCHWARZ.
The right knee further forward, please.
#SCHOEN.
The body does show finer lines perhaps.
#SCHWARZ.
The light to - day can be borne at least half way.
#DR. GOLL.
Oh, you must throw on lots of it! Hold your brush a bit longer.
#SCHWARZ.
Certainly, Dr. Goll.
#DR. GOLL.
Treat her as a piece of still - life.
#SCHWARZ.
Certainly, Doctor. You used to hold your head a wee mite higher, Mrs. Goll.
#LULU.
Paint my lips a little open.
#SCHOEN.
Paint snow on ice. If you get warm doing that, then instantly your art gets inartistic!
#SCHWARZ.
Certainly, Doctor.
#DR. GOLL.
Art, you know, must so reproduce nature that one can find at least some =spiritual= enjoyment in it!
#LULU.
So - look. I'll hold it half opened, so.
#SCHWARZ.
As soon as the sun comes, the wall opposite throws warm reflections in here.
#DR. GOLL.
You must keep your position just as if our Velasquez here didn't exist at all.
#LULU.
Well, a painter =isn't= a man at all, anyway.
#SCHOEN.
I don't think you ought to judge the whole profession by just one famous exception.
#SCHWARZ.
I should have liked to have had to hire a different studio last fall.
#SCHOEN.
What I wanted to ask you - have you seen the little Murphy girl yet as a Peruvian pearl - fisher?
#DR. GOLL.
I see her to - morrow for the fourth time. Prince Polossov took me. His hair has already got dark yellow again with delight.
#SCHOEN.
So you find her quite fabulous too.
#DR. GOLL.
Who ever wants to judge of that beforehand?
#LULU.
I think someone knocked.
#SCHWARZ.
Pardon me a moment.
#DR. GOLL.
You can safely smile at him with less bashfulness!
#SCHOEN.
He makes nothing of it.
#DR. GOLL.
And if he did! - What are we two sitting here for?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
May one come in?
#SCHOEN.
My son!
#LULU.
Oh! It's Mr. Alva!
#DR. GOLL.
Don't mind. Just come along in.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Glad to see you. Do I see a - right? Oh, if only I could engage you for my title part!
#LULU.
I don't think I could dance nearly well enough for your show!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
But you do have a dancing - master such as cannot be found on any stage in Europe.
#SCHOEN.
But what brings you here?
#DR. GOLL.
Maybe you're having somebody or other painted here, too, in secret!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I wanted to take you to the dress rehearsal.
#DR. GOLL.
Do you have 'em dance to - day in full costume?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Of course. Come along, too. In five minutes I must be on the stage. Unhappy!
#DR. GOLL.
I've forgotten - what's the name of your ballet?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Dalailama.
#DR. GOLL.
I thought =he= was in a madhouse.
#SCHOEN.
You're thinking of Nietzsche, Doctor.
#DR. GOLL.
You're right; I got 'em mixed up.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I have helped Buddhism to its legs.
#DR. GOLL.
By his legs is the stage - poet known.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Corticelli dances the youthful Buddha as tho she had seen the light of the world by the Ganges.
#SCHOEN.
So long as her mother lived, she danced with her legs.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Then when she got free she danced with her intelligence.
#DR. GOLL.
Now she dances with her heart.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
If you'd like to see her - ?
#DR. GOLL.
Thank you.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Come along with us!
#DR. GOLL.
Impossible.
#SCHOEN.
Anyway, we have no time to lose.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Come with us, doctor. In the third act you see Dalailama in his cloister, with his monks -
#DR. GOLL.
The only thing I care about is the young Buddha.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Well, what's hindering you?
#DR. GOLL.
I can't. I can't do it.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
We're going to Peter's, after it. There you can express your admiration.
#DR. GOLL.
Don't press it on me, please.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
You'll see the tame monkey, the two Brahmans, the little girls....
#DR. GOLL.
For heaven's sake, just keep away from me with your little girls!
#LULU.
Reserve one of the proscenium boxes for us on Monday, Mr. Alva.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
How could you doubt that I would, dear lady!
#DR. GOLL.
When I come back the whole picture will be spoilt on me.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Well, it could be painted over.
#DR. GOLL.
If I don't explain to this Caravacci every stroke of his brush -
#SCHOEN.
Your fears are unfounded, I think....
#DR. GOLL.
Next time, gentlemen!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
The Brahmans are getting impatient. The daughters of Nirvana are shivering in their tights.
#DR. GOLL.
Damned enchantment!
#SCHOEN.
They'll quarrel with us, if we don't bring you with us.
#DR. GOLL.
In five minutes I'll be back.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Duty calls me, gracious lady!
#DR. GOLL.
You must model it a bit more here. The hair is bad. You aren't paying enough attention to your business!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Come on.
#DR. GOLL.
Now, just hop it! Ten horses will not drag me to Peter's.
#SCHOEN.
We'll take my carriage. It's waiting downstairs.
#SCHWARZ.
Pack! If only that were life's end! The bread - basket! - paunch and mug! Now rears my artist's pride. This company! - The choice would be a hard one to make. If I may request Mrs. Goll to raise the right hand a little higher.
#LULU.
Who would have thought that was possible!
#SCHWARZ.
I am quite ridiculous, you think?
#LULU.
He's coming right back.
#SCHWARZ.
I can do nothing but paint.
#LULU.
There he is!
#SCHWARZ.
Well?
#LULU.
Don't you hear?
#SCHWARZ.
Someone is coming....
#LULU.
I knew it.
#SCHWARZ.
It's the janitor. He's sweeping the stairs.
#LULU.
Thank heaven!
#SCHWARZ.
Do you perhaps accompany the doctor to his patients?
#LULU.
Everything =but= that.
#SCHWARZ.
Because, you are not accustomed to being alone.
#LULU.
We have a housekeeper at home.
#SCHWARZ.
She keeps you company?
#LULU.
She has a lot of taste.
#SCHWARZ.
What for?
#LULU.
She dresses me.
#SCHWARZ.
Do you go much to balls?
#LULU.
Never.
#SCHWARZ.
Then what do you need the dresses for?
#LULU.
For dancing.
#SCHWARZ.
You really dance?
#LULU.
Czardas ... Samaqueca ... Skirt - dance.
#SCHWARZ.
Doesn't - that - disgust you, then?
#LULU.
You find me ugly?
#SCHWARZ.
You don't understand me. But who gives you lessons then?
#LULU.
Him.
#SCHWARZ.
Who?
#LULU.
Him.
#SCHWARZ.
He?
#LULU.
He plays the violin -
#SCHWARZ.
Every day one learns something new of the world!
#LULU.
I learned in Paris. I took lessons from Eugenie Fougère. She let me copy her costumes, too.
#SCHWARZ.
What are =they= like? little green lace skirt to the knee, all in ruffles, low - necked, of course, very low - necked and awfully tight - laced. Bright green petticoat, then brighter and brighter. Snow - white underclothes with a hand's - breadth of lace....
#SCHWARZ.
I can no longer -
#LULU.
Then paint!
#SCHWARZ.
Aren't you cold at all?
#LULU.
God forbid! No. What made you ask? Are you so cold?
#SCHWARZ.
Not to - day. No.
#LULU.
Praise God, one can breathe!
#SCHWARZ.
How so?... Don't do that, please! The boot - black only attends to her feet! His color doesn't eat into his money, either. If I go without supper to - morrow, no little society lady will ask me if I know anything about oyster - patties!
#LULU.
Is he going out of his head?
#SCHWARZ.
What ever drove the fellow to this test!
#LULU.
I'd like it better, too, if he had stayed here.
#SCHWARZ.
We are truly the martyrs of our calling!
#LULU.
I didn't wish to cause you pain.
#SCHWARZ.
If you - the left trowser - leg - a little higher -
#LULU.
Here?
#SCHWARZ.
Permit me....
#LULU.
What do you want?
#SCHWARZ.
I'll show you.
#LULU.
You mustn't.
#SCHWARZ.
You are nervous ...
#LULU.
Let me alone! You don't get me for a long time yet.
#SCHWARZ.
You can't understand a joke.
#LULU.
Oh, yes I can. I understand everything. Just you leave me be. You'll get nothing at all from me by force. Go to your work. You have no right to molest me. Sit down behind your easel!
#SCHWARZ.
As soon as I've punished you - you wayward, capricious -
#LULU.
But you must have me, first! Go away. You can't catch me. In long clothes I'd have fallen into your clutches long ago - but in the Pierrot!
#SCHWARZ.
I've got you!
#LULU.
Good - night! I can see away over all the cities of the earth.
#SCHWARZ.
This old skin!!
#LULU.
I reach up into heaven, and stick the stars in my hair.
#SCHWARZ.
I'll shake it till you fall off!
#LULU.
If you don't stop, I'll throw the ladder down. Will you let go of my legs? God save the Poles! I told you that you weren't going to get me.
#SCHWARZ.
Let us make peace.
#LULU.
Keep away from me, or -
#SCHWARZ.
Merciful Heaven!
#LULU.
You knocked the hole in it yourself!
#SCHWARZ.
I am ruined! Ten weeks' work, my journey, my exhibition! Now there is nothing more to lose!
#LULU.
A grave! Don't fall into it! She made a new man out of him!
#SCHWARZ.
I am merciless now!
#LULU.
Leave me in peace now. I'm getting dizzy. O Gott! O Gott!...
#LULU.
He may come back.
#SCHWARZ.
How d' you feel?
#LULU.
As if I had fallen into the water....
#SCHWARZ.
I love you.
#LULU.
One time, I loved a student.
#SCHWARZ.
Nellie -
#LULU.
With four - and - twenty scars -
#SCHWARZ.
I love you, Nellie.
#LULU.
My name isn't Nellie. It's Lulu.
#SCHWARZ.
I would call you Eve.
#LULU.
Do you know what time it is?
#SCHWARZ.
Half past ten. You don't love me.
#LULU.
Yes I do.... It's five minutes after half past ten.
#SCHWARZ.
Give me a kiss, Eve!
#LULU.
You smell of tobacco.
#SCHWARZ.
Why so distant?
#LULU.
It would be uncomfortable to -
#SCHWARZ.
You're just making believe!
#LULU.
You're making believe yourself, it seems to me. I make believe? What makes you think that? =I never needed to do that.=
#SCHWARZ.
God in Heaven! The world is strange to me - !
#LULU.
Only don't kill me!
#SCHWARZ.
=Thou hast never yet loved!=
#LULU.
=You have never yet loved ...!=
#DR. GOLL.
Open the door!
#LULU.
Hide me! O God, hide me!
#DR. GOLL.
Open the door!
#LULU.
He will strike me dead!
#DR. GOLL.
Open the door!
#LULU.
He'll beat me to death! He'll beat me to death!
#SCHWARZ.
Stand up....
#DR. GOLL.
You dogs! You ...!
#SCHWARZ.
Mister - Doctor - Doc - Doctor Goll -
#LULU.
Please, though, first put the studio in order.
#SCHWARZ.
Dr. Goll! Doc - He's cut his forehead. Help me to lay him on the ottoman.
#LULU.
No. No...
#SCHWARZ.
Dr. Goll.
#LULU.
He doesn't hear.
#SCHWARZ.
But you, help me, please.
#LULU.
The two of us together couldn't lift him.
#SCHWARZ.
We must send for a doctor.
#LULU.
He is fearfully heavy.
#SCHWARZ.
Please, though, be so good as to put the place a little to rights while I'm away.
#LULU.
He'll spring up all at once. Bussi! He just won't notice anything. He sees my feet, and watches every step I take. He has his eye on me everywhere. Bussi! It's serious with him. The dance is over. He'll send me to prison. What shall I do? A strange, wild face! And no one to do him the last services - isn't that sad!
#SCHWARZ.
Still not come to himself?
#LULU.
What shall I do?
#SCHWARZ.
Doctor Goll.
#LULU.
I almost think it's serious.
#SCHWARZ.
Talk decently!
#LULU.
=He= wouldn't say that to me. He makes me dance for him when he doesn't feel well.
#SCHWARZ.
The doctor will be here in a moment.
#LULU.
Doctoring won't help =him=.
#SCHWARZ.
But people do what they can, in such cases!
#LULU.
=He= doesn't think so.
#SCHWARZ.
Then won't you at least - get dressed?
#LULU.
Yes, - right off.
#SCHWARZ.
What are you waiting for?
#LULU.
Please ...
#SCHWARZ.
What is it?
#LULU.
Shut =his= eyes.
#SCHWARZ.
You make me shiver.
#LULU.
Not nearly so much as you make =me=!
#LULU.
You're a born criminal.
#SCHWARZ.
Doesn't this moment touch you at all, then?
#LULU.
It hits me, too, some.
#SCHWARZ.
Please, just you keep still now!
#LULU.
It hits you some, too.
#SCHWARZ.
You really didn't need to say that to a man, in such a moment.
#LULU.
=Please ...!=
#SCHWARZ.
Do what you think necessary. I don't know how.
#LULU.
He's looking at me.
#SCHWARZ.
And at me, too.
#LULU.
You're a coward!
#SCHWARZ.
It's the first time in my life that anyone has called me that.
#LULU.
Didn't you do it to your mother?
#SCHWARZ.
No.
#LULU.
You were away, perhaps.
#SCHWARZ.
No!
#LULU.
Or else you were afraid?
#SCHWARZ.
No!
#LULU.
I didn't mean to insult you.
#SCHWARZ.
She's still alive.
#LULU.
Then you still have somebody.
#SCHWARZ.
She's as poor as a beggar.
#LULU.
I know what that is.
#SCHWARZ.
Don't laugh at me!
#LULU.
Now I am rich -
#SCHWARZ.
It gives me cold shudders - She can't help it!
#LULU.
What'll I do?
#SCHWARZ.
Absolutely depraved! Look me in the eyes!
#LULU.
What do you want?
#SCHWARZ.
Look me in the eyes.
#LULU.
I see myself in them as Pierrot.
#SCHWARZ.
Confounded dancer - ing!
#LULU.
I must change my clothes -
#SCHWARZ.
One question -
#LULU.
I can't answer it.
#SCHWARZ.
Can you speak the truth?
#LULU.
I don't know.
#SCHWARZ.
Do you believe in a Creator?
#LULU.
I don't know.
#SCHWARZ.
Can you swear on anything?
#LULU.
I don't know. Leave me alone. You're mad.
#SCHWARZ.
What do you believe in, then?
#LULU.
I don't know.
#SCHWARZ.
Have you no soul, then?
#LULU.
I don't know.
#SCHWARZ.
Have you ever once loved - ?
#LULU.
I don't know.
#SCHWARZ.
She doesn't know!
#LULU.
I don't know.
#SCHWARZ.
He knows.
#LULU.
What do you want to know?
#SCHWARZ.
Go, get dressed! Would I could change with you, you dead man! I give her back to you. I give my youth to you, too. I lack the courage and the faith. I've had to wait patiently too long. It's too late for me. I haven't grown up big enough for happiness. I have a hellish fear of it. Wake up! I didn't touch her. He opens his mouth. Mouth open and eyes shut, like the children. With me it's the other way round. Wake up, wake up! Here I beseech Heaven to make me =able= to be happy - to give me the strength and the freedom of soul to be just a weeny mite happy! For =her sake, only for her sake=.
#LULU.
Would you hook me up here? My hand trembles.
#SCHWARZ.
Eve!
#LULU.
At your orders?
#SCHWARZ.
Seems to me you look extra charming to - day.
#LULU.
Depends on what you expect.
#SCHWARZ.
Your hair breathes out a morning freshness....
#LULU.
I've just come out of the water.
#SCHWARZ.
I've an awful lot to do to - day.
#LULU.
That's what you say to yourself.
#SCHWARZ.
What are you reading?
#LULU.
"Suddenly she heard an anchor of refuge come nodding up the stairs."
#SCHWARZ.
Who under the sun writes so absorbingly?
#LULU.
"It was the postman with a money - order."
#HENRIETTE.
The mail. I'm going to take your hat to the milliner, madam. Anything else?
#LULU.
No.
#SCHWARZ.
What was it you dreamt all last night?
#LULU.
You've asked me that twice already, to - day.
#SCHWARZ.
I tremble for news. Every day I fear the world may go to pieces. For you.
#LULU.
Madame Corticelli.
#SCHWARZ.
My Samaqueca - dancer sold - for fifty thousand marks!
#LULU.
Who says that?
#SCHWARZ.
Sedelmeier in Paris. That's the third picture since our marriage. I hardly know how to save myself from my luck!
#LULU.
There are more there.
#SCHWARZ.
See.
#LULU.
Sir Henry von Zarnikow has the honor to announce the engagement of his daughter, Charlotte Marie Adelaide, to Doctor Ludwig Schön.
#SCHWARZ.
At last! He's been an eternal while evading a public engagement. I can't understand it - a man of his standing and influence. What can be in the way of his marriage?
#LULU.
What is that that you're reading?
#SCHWARZ.
An invitation to take part in the international exhibition at St. Petersburg. I have no idea what to paint for it.
#LULU.
Some entrancing girl or other, of course.
#SCHWARZ.
Will you be willing to pose for it?
#LULU.
God knows there are other pretty girls enough in existence!
#SCHWARZ.
But with any other model - tho she be as racy as hell - I can't get such a full display of my powers.
#LULU.
Then I must, I suppose. Wouldn't it go as well lying down?
#SCHWARZ.
Really, I'd liefest have your taste arrange it for me. Don't let's forget to congratulate Schön to - day, anyway.
#LULU.
But we did that a long time ago.
#SCHWARZ.
For his bride's sake.
#LULU.
You can write to him again if you want.
#SCHWARZ.
And now to work! Eve!
#LULU.
Your pleasure?
#SCHWARZ.
I feel every day as if I were seeing you for the very first time.
#LULU.
You're a terror.
#SCHWARZ.
The fault is yours.
#LULU.
You're =wasting= me.
#SCHWARZ.
You =are mine=. But you are never more ensnaring than when you ought for God's sake to be, just once, real ugly for a couple of hours! Since I've had you, I have had nothing more. I'm entirely lost to myself.
#LULU.
Not so excited!
#SCHWARZ.
Confound it!
#LULU.
No one at home!
#SCHWARZ.
Perhaps it's the art - dealer -
#LULU.
And if it's the Chinese Emperor!
#SCHWARZ.
One moment.
#LULU.
Thou? Thou?
#SCHWARZ.
A beggar, who says he was in the war. I have no small change on me. It's high time, too, that I should finally go to work.
#SCHIGOLCH.
I'd thought he was more of a swell - a little more glory to him. He's sort of embarrassed. He quaked a little in the knees when he saw =me= in front of him.
#LULU.
How can you beg from him, too?
#SCHIGOLCH.
That's why I've dragged my seventy - seven summers just here. You told me he kept at his painting in the mornings.
#LULU.
He hadn't got quite awake yet. How much do you need?
#SCHIGOLCH.
Two hundred, if you have that much handy. Personally, I'd like three hundred. Some of my clients have evaporated.
#LULU.
Whew, I'm tired!
#SCHIGOLCH.
That's just what brought me, too. I've been wanting a long time to see how things were looking now with you.
#LULU.
Well?
#SCHIGOLCH.
It just sweeps over you. Like with me fifty years ago. Instead of the loafing chairs we still had rusty old sabres then. Devil, but you've brought it pretty far! Carpets....
#LULU.
I like best to walk on them bare - footed.
#SCHIGOLCH.
Is that you?
#LULU.
Pretty fine?
#SCHIGOLCH.
If all that's genuine.
#LULU.
Have something sweet?
#SCHIGOLCH.
What?
#LULU.
Elixir de Spaa.
#SCHIGOLCH.
That doesn't help me - Does he drink?
#LULU.
Not yet. The cordial has such various effects!
#SCHIGOLCH.
He comes to blows?
#LULU.
He goes to sleep.
#SCHIGOLCH.
When he's drunk, you can see right into his insides.
#LULU.
I'd rather =not=. Tell me about it.
#SCHIGOLCH.
The streets keep on getting longer, and my legs shorter.
#LULU.
And your harmonica?
#SCHIGOLCH.
Has bad air, like me with my asthma. I just keep a - thinking it isn't worth the trouble to make it better.
#LULU.
I thought you'd come to an end a long time ago -
#SCHIGOLCH.
To an end - already up and away? I thought so, too. But no matter how early the sun goes down, still we aren't let lie quiet. I'm hoping for winter. Perhaps then my - my - my asthma will invent some opportunity to carry me off.
#LULU.
Do you think they could have forgotten you on the other side?
#SCHIGOLCH.
Would be possible, for it certainly isn't going like it usually does. Now you tell - not seen you a long time - my little Lulu.
#LULU.
Life is beyond me!
#SCHIGOLCH.
What do you know about it? You're still so young!
#LULU.
That you call me Lulu.
#SCHIGOLCH.
Lulu, isn't it? Have I ever called you anything else?
#LULU.
In the memory of man my name has no longer been Lulu.
#SCHIGOLCH.
Another way of naming?
#LULU.
Lulu sounds to me quite ante - diluvian.
#SCHIGOLCH.
Children! Children!
#LULU.
My name now is -
#SCHIGOLCH.
As if the principle wasn't always the same!
#LULU.
You mean - ?
#SCHIGOLCH.
What is it now?
#LULU.
=Eve.=
#SCHIGOLCH.
Lept, hopped, skipped, jumped....
#LULU.
I'm listening.
#SCHIGOLCH.
This is the way I dreamt of it for you. You've aimed straight for it. What's that?
#LULU.
Heliotrope.
#SCHIGOLCH.
Does that smell better than you?
#LULU.
That needn't bother you any more.
#SCHIGOLCH.
Who would have dreamt of this royal luxury before!
#LULU.
When I think back - Ugh!
#SCHIGOLCH.
How's it going with you, then? You still keep at the French?
#LULU.
I lie and sleep.
#SCHIGOLCH.
That's genteel. That always looks like something. And afterwards?
#LULU.
I stretch - till it cracks.
#SCHIGOLCH.
And when it has cracked?
#LULU.
What do you mind about that?
#SCHIGOLCH.
What do I mind about that? What do I mind? I'd rather live till the last trump and renounce all heavenly joys than leave my Lulu deprived of anything down here behind me. What do I mind about that? It's my sympathy. To be sure, my better self =is= already transfigured - but I still have some sense for this world.
#LULU.
I haven't.
#SCHIGOLCH.
You're too well off.
#LULU.
Idiot....
#SCHIGOLCH.
Better than with the old dancing - bear?
#LULU.
I don't dance any more.
#SCHIGOLCH.
For him it was time, too.
#LULU.
Now I am -
#SCHIGOLCH.
Speak how it is with you, child! I believed in you when there was no more to be seen in you than your two big eyes. What are you now? beast....
#SCHIGOLCH.
That you - ! And what kind of a beast? A fine beast! An elegant beast! A glorified beast! Then I'll let them bury me. We're through with prejudices - even with the one against the corpse - washer.
#LULU.
You needn't be afraid that you will be washed once more.
#SCHIGOLCH.
Doesn't matter, either. One gets dirty again.
#LULU.
It would call you back to life again!
#SCHIGOLCH.
We are mud.
#LULU.
I beg your pardon! I rub grease into myself every day and then powder on top of it.
#SCHIGOLCH.
Probably worth while, too, on the dressed - up mucker's account.
#LULU.
It makes the skin like satin.
#SCHIGOLCH.
As if it weren't just dirt all the same!
#LULU.
Thank you. I wish to be worth biting at!
#SCHIGOLCH.
We are. Give a big dinner down below there pretty soon. Keep open house.
#LULU.
Your guests will hardly over - eat themselves at it.
#SCHIGOLCH.
Patience, girl! Your worshippers won't put you in alcohol, either. It's "schöne Melusine" as long as it keeps buoyant. Afterwards? They don't take it at the zoölogical garden. The gentle beasties might get stomach - cramps.
#LULU.
Have you enough?
#SCHIGOLCH.
There's still enough left over to plant a juniper on my grave. I'll find my own way out.
#SCHOEN.
What's your father doing here?
#LULU.
What's the matter?
#SCHOEN.
If I were your husband that man would never come over my threshold.
#LULU.
You can speak intimately. He's not here.
#SCHOEN.
Thank you, I'd rather not.
#LULU.
I don't understand.
#SCHOEN.
I know that. I should like to speak with you just on that subject.
#LULU.
Why didn't you tell me so yesterday, then?
#SCHOEN.
Please, nothing now about yesterday. I did tell you two years ago.
#LULU.
Oh, yes, - Hm!
#SCHOEN.
Please be kind enough to cease your visits to my house.
#LULU.
May I offer you an elixir -
#SCHOEN.
Thanks. No elixir. Have you understood me? Good. You have the choice. You force me to the most extreme measures: - either act in accordance with your station -
#LULU.
Or?
#SCHOEN.
Or - you compel me - I should have to turn to that person who is responsible for your behavior.
#LULU.
What makes you imagine that?
#SCHOEN.
I shall request your husband, himself to watch over your ways. Where are you going?
#LULU.
Walter!
#SCHOEN.
Are you mad?
#LULU.
Aha!
#SCHOEN.
I have made the most superhuman efforts to raise you in society. You can be ten times as proud of your name as of your intimacy with me.
#LULU.
Why are you still afraid, now that you're at the zenith of your hopes?
#SCHOEN.
No comedy! The zenith of my hopes? I am at last engaged: I have now the hope of bringing my bride into a clean house.
#LULU.
She has developed delightfully in the two years!
#SCHOEN.
She no longer looks thru one so earnestly.
#LULU.
She is now, for the first time, a woman. We can meet each other wherever it seems suitable to you.
#SCHOEN.
We shall meet each other nowhere but in the presence of your husband!
#LULU.
You don't believe yourself what you say.
#SCHOEN.
Then =he= must believe it. Go on and call him! Thru his marriage to you, thru all that I've done for him, he has become my friend.
#LULU.
Mine, too.
#SCHOEN.
Then I'll cut down the sword over my head.
#LULU.
You have, indeed, chained me up. But I owe my happiness to you. You will get friends by the crowd as soon as you have a pretty young wife again.
#SCHOEN.
You judge women by yourself! He's got the sense of a child or he would have tracked out your doublings and windings long ago.
#LULU.
I only wish he would! Then, at last he'd get out of his swaddling - clothes. He puts his trust in the marriage contract he has in his pocket. Trouble is past and gone. One can now give oneself and let oneself go as if one were at home. That isn't the sense of a =child=! It's banal! He has no education; he sees nothing; he sees neither me nor himself; he is blind, blind, blind....
#SCHOEN.
When =his= eyes open!!
#LULU.
Open his eyes for him! I'm going to ruin. I'm neglecting myself. He doesn't know me at all. What am I to him? He calls me darling and little devil. He would say the same to any piano - teacher. He makes no pretensions. Everything is alright, to him. That comes from his never in his life having felt the need of intercourse with women.
#SCHOEN.
If that's true!
#LULU.
He admits it perfectly openly. man who has painted them, rags and tags and velvet gowns, since he was fourteen.
#LULU.
Women make him anxious. He trembles for his health and comfort. But he isn't afraid of =me=!
#SCHOEN.
How many girls would deem themselves God knows how blessed in your situation.
#LULU.
Seduce him. Corrupt him. You know how. Take him into bad company - you know the people. I am nothing to him but a woman, just woman. He makes me feel so ridiculous. He will be prouder of me. He doesn't know any differences. I'm thinking my head off, day and night, how to shake him up. In my despair I dance the can - can. He yawns; and drivels something about obscenity.
#SCHOEN.
Nonsense. He is an artist, though.
#LULU.
At least he believes he is.
#SCHOEN.
That's the chief thing!
#LULU.
When I pose for him.... He believes, too, that he's a famous man.
#SCHOEN.
We =have= made him one.
#LULU.
He believes everything. He's as mistrustful as a thief, and lets himself be lied to, till one loses all respect! When we first knew each other I informed him I had never yet loved - Otherwise he would really have taken me for a fallen woman!
#SCHOEN.
You make God knows what exorbitant demands on =legitimate= relations!
#LULU.
I make no exorbitant demands. Often I even dream still of Goll.
#SCHOEN.
He was, at any rate, not banal!
#LULU.
He is there, as if he had never been away. Only he walks as tho in his socks. He isn't angry with me; he's awfully sad. And then he is fearful, as tho he were there without the permission of the police. Otherwise, he feels at ease with us. Only he can't quite get over my having thrown away so much money since -
#SCHOEN.
You yearn for the whip once more?
#LULU.
Maybe. I don't dance any more.
#SCHOEN.
Teach him to do it. waste of trouble.
#SCHOEN.
Out of a hundred women, ninety educate their husbands to suit themselves.
#LULU.
He loves me.
#SCHOEN.
That's fatal, of course.
#LULU.
He loves me -
#SCHOEN.
That is an unbridgeable abyss.
#LULU.
He doesn't know me, but he loves me! If he had anything like a correct idea of me, he'd tie a stone around my neck and sink me in the sea where it's deepest.
#SCHOEN.
Let's finish this?
#LULU.
As you say.
#SCHOEN.
I've married you off. Twice I have married you off. You live in luxury. I've created a position for your husband. If that doesn't satisfy you, and he laughs in his sleeve at it, I don't pretend to meet ideal claims; but - leave me out of the game, out of it!
#LULU.
If I belong to any person on this earth, I belong to you. Without you I'd be - I won't say where. You took me by the hand, gave me food to eat, had me dressed, - when I was going to steal your watch. Do you think that can be forgotten? Anybody else would have called the police. You sent me to school, and had me learn manners. Who but you in the whole world has ever thought anything of me? I've danced and posed, and was glad to be able to earn my living that way. But =love= at command, I can't!
#SCHOEN.
Leave =me= out! Do what you will. I'm not coming to make scandal; I'm coming to shake the scandal from my neck. My engagement is costing me sacrifices enough! I had imagined that with a healthy young man, than whom a woman of your years can wish herself no better, you would, at last, have been contented. If you are under obligations to me, don't throw yourself a third time in my way! Am I to wait yet longer before putting my pile in security? Am I to risk the whole success of my patents falling into the water again after two years? What good is it to me to be your married - man, when =you= can be seen going in and out of my house at every hour of the day? Why the devil didn't Dr. Goll stay alive just one year more! With him you were in safe keeping. Then I'd have had my wife long since under my roof!
#LULU.
And what would you have had then? The kid gets on your nerves. The child is too uncorrupted for you. She's been much too carefully brought up. What should I have against your marriage? But you are deceived about yourself if you think that on account of your impending marriage you may express your contempt to me.
#SCHOEN.
Contempt? I shall soon give the child the right idea. If anything is contemptible, it's your intrigues!
#LULU.
Am I jealous of the child? That never once entered my head.
#SCHOEN.
Then why talk about the child? The child is not even a whole year younger than you are. Leave me my freedom to live what life I still have. No matter how the child's been brought up, she's got her five senses just like you....
#SCHWARZ.
What's the matter here?
#LULU.
Well? Go on. Talk.
#SCHWARZ.
What's the matter with you two?
#LULU.
Nothing that touches you -
#SCHOEN.
Quiet!
#LULU.
He's had enough of me.
#SCHOEN.
It had to come out - I must have my hands free at last!
#SCHWARZ.
Is that a way to jest?
#SCHOEN.
Please.
#SCHWARZ.
What is it?
#SCHOEN.
Please.
#SCHWARZ.
Well?
#SCHOEN.
You have married half a million....
#SCHWARZ.
Is it gone?
#SCHOEN.
Not a penny.
#SCHWARZ.
Explain to me the peculiar scene....
#SCHOEN.
You have married half a million -
#SCHWARZ.
No one can make a crime of that.
#SCHOEN.
You have created a name for yourself. You can work unmolested. You need to deny yourself no wish -
#SCHWARZ.
What have you two got against me?
#SCHOEN.
For six months you've been revelling in all the heavens. You have a wife whom the world envies you, and she deserves a man whom she can respect -
#SCHWARZ.
Doesn't she respect me?
#SCHOEN.
No.
#SCHWARZ.
I come from the dark depths of society. She is above me. I cherish no more ardent wish than to become her equal. Thank you.
#SCHOEN.
Don't mention it.
#SCHWARZ.
Speak!
#SCHOEN.
Keep a little more watch on her.
#SCHWARZ.
I - on her?
#SCHOEN.
We are not children! We don't trifle! She demands that she be taken seriously. Her value gives her a perfect right to be.
#SCHWARZ.
What does she do, then?
#SCHOEN.
You have married half a million!
#SCHWARZ.
She - ?
#SCHOEN.
No, that's not the way! We must speak with each other very seriously here.
#SCHWARZ.
What does she do?
#SCHOEN.
First count on your fingers what you have to thank her for, and then -
#SCHWARZ.
What does she do - man!!
#SCHOEN.
And then make yourself responsible for your faults, and no one else.
#SCHWARZ.
With whom? With whom?
#SCHOEN.
If we should shoot each other -
#SCHWARZ.
Since when, then?
#SCHOEN.
- I don't come here to make scandal, I come to save you from the scandal.
#SCHWARZ.
You have misunderstood her.
#SCHOEN.
That will not do for me. I can't see you go on living in blindness. The girl deserves to be a respectable woman. Since I have known her she has improved as she developed.
#SCHWARZ.
Since you have known her? Since when have you known her then?
#SCHOEN.
Since about her twelfth year.
#SCHWARZ.
She told me nothing about that.
#SCHOEN.
She sold flowers in front of the Alhambra Café. Every evening between twelve and two she pressed in among the guests, bare - footed.
#SCHWARZ.
She told me nothing of that.
#SCHOEN.
She did right there. I'm telling you, so you may see that you have not to do with moral degeneracy. The girl is, on the contrary, of extraordinarily good disposition.
#SCHWARZ.
She said she had grown up with an aunt.
#SCHOEN.
That was the woman I gave her to. She was her best pupil. The mothers used to make her an example to their children. She has the feeling for duty. It is simply and solely your mistake if you have till now neglected to take her on her best sides.
#SCHWARZ.
O God! -
#SCHOEN.
No O God!! Nothing of the happiness you have cost can be changed. Done is done. You over - rate yourself against your better knowledge if you persuade yourself you will lose. You stand to gain. But with "O God" nothing is gained. A greater friendliness I have not yet shown you: I speak plainly and offer you my help. Don't show yourself unworthy of it!
#SCHWARZ.
When I first knew her, she told me she had never loved.
#SCHOEN.
When a widow says that - ! It does her credit that she chose you for a husband. Make the same claims on yourself and your happiness is without a blot.
#SCHWARZ.
She says he made her wear short dresses.
#SCHOEN.
But he married her! That was her master - stroke. How she brought the man to it is beyond me. You really must know it now: you are enjoying the fruits of her diplomacy.
#SCHWARZ.
How did she get to know Dr. Goll then?
#SCHOEN.
Through me! It was after my wife's death, when I was making the first advances to my present fiancée. She stuck herself in between. She had fixed her mind on becoming my wife.
#SCHWARZ.
And then when her husband died?
#SCHOEN.
You married half a million!!
#SCHWARZ.
O, to have stayed where I was! To have died of hunger!
#SCHOEN.
Do you think, then, that I make no compromises? Who is there that does not compromise? You have married half a million. You are to - day one of the foremost artists. That can't be done without money. You are not the man to sit in judgment on her. You can't possibly treat an origin like Mignon's according to the notions of bourgeois society.
#SCHWARZ.
Who are you speaking of?
#SCHOEN.
Of her father! You're an artist, I say: your ideals are on a different plane from those of a wage - worker.
#SCHWARZ.
I don't understand a word of all that.
#SCHOEN.
I am speaking of the inhuman conditions out of which, thanks to her good management, the girl has developed into what she is!
#SCHWARZ.
Who?
#SCHOEN.
Who? Your wife.
#SCHWARZ.
=Eve?=
#SCHOEN.
I called her Mignon.
#SCHWARZ.
I thought her name was Nellie?
#SCHOEN.
Dr. Goll called her so.
#SCHWARZ.
I called her Eve -
#SCHOEN.
What her real name is I don't know.
#SCHWARZ.
Perhaps she knows.
#SCHOEN.
With a father like hers, she is, with all her faults, a miracle. I don't understand you -
#SCHWARZ.
He died in a madhouse - ?
#SCHOEN.
He was here just now!
#SCHWARZ.
Who was here?
#SCHOEN.
Her father.
#SCHWARZ.
Here - in my house?
#SCHOEN.
He squeezed by me as I came in. And there are the two glasses still.
#SCHWARZ.
She says he died in the madhouse.
#SCHOEN.
Let her feel she's in authority - ! She craves nothing but the compulsion to unconditional obedience. With Dr. Goll she was in heaven, and with him there was no joking.
#SCHWARZ.
She said she had never loved -
#SCHOEN.
But you, make a beginning with yourself. Pull yourself together!
#SCHWARZ.
She has sworn - !
#SCHOEN.
You can't demand a sense of duty in her before you know your own task.
#SCHWARZ.
By her mother's grave!
#SCHOEN.
She never knew her mother, let alone the grave. Her mother hasn't got a grave.
#SCHWARZ.
I don't fit in society.
#SCHOEN.
What's the matter?
#SCHWARZ.
Pain - horrible pain!
#SCHOEN.
Guard her for yourself: she's yours. The moment is decisive. To - morrow she may be lost to you.
#SCHWARZ.
Here, here.
#SCHOEN.
You have married half - She is lost to you if you let this moment slip!
#SCHWARZ.
If I could weep! Oh, if I could cry out!
#SCHOEN.
You're suffering -
#SCHWARZ.
You are right, quite right.
#SCHOEN.
Where are you going?
#SCHWARZ.
To speak with her.
#SCHOEN.
Right! That was tough work. He had taken her into the studio before though? Open! Open the door!
#LULU.
What's -
#SCHOEN.
Open it!
#LULU.
That is horrible.
#SCHOEN.
Have you an ax in the kitchen?
#LULU.
He'll open it right off -
#SCHOEN.
I can't kick it down.
#LULU.
When he's had his cry out.
#SCHOEN.
Open! Bring me an ax.
#LULU.
Send for the doctor -
#SCHOEN.
You are not yourself.
#LULU.
It serves you right.
#SCHOEN.
I mustn't let myself be seen here.
#LULU.
Perhaps it's the art - dealer.
#SCHOEN.
But if we don't answer it -
#LULU.
-
#SCHOEN.
Stop. It sometimes happens that one is not just at hand - Please be quiet.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
A revolution has broken out in Paris!
#SCHOEN.
Be quiet.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
You're as pale as death.
#SCHOEN.
Walter! Walter!
#LULU.
God pity you.
#SCHOEN.
Haven't you brought an ax?
#LULU.
If there's one there -
#ALVA SCHOEN.
He's just keeping us in suspense. revolution has broken out in Paris?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
In the editors' room they're beating their heads against the wall. No one knows what he ought to write.
#SCHOEN.
Walter!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Shall I force it in?
#SCHOEN.
I can do that. Who is it coming now? To enjoy life and let others be responsible for it -
#LULU.
Henriette has come home.
#SCHOEN.
Shut the door behind you.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Give it here.
#SCHOEN.
You must hold it nearer the end.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
It's cracking -
#LULU.
After you. Are you getting - dizzy?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Ghastly!
#LULU.
Oh! Oh! I can't stay here.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Horrible!
#LULU.
Come.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Where to?
#LULU.
I can't be alone.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
She's changing her clothes.
#SCHOEN.
She has gone?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
To her room. She's changing her clothes.
#SCHOEN.
You know where Dr. Bernstein lives?
#HENRIETTE.
Of course, Doctor. Right next door.
#SCHOEN.
Take that over to him, please.
#HENRIETTE.
In case the doctor is not at home?
#SCHOEN.
He is at home. And take this to police headquarters. Take a cab. I am judged!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
My blood is cold.
#SCHOEN.
The fool!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
He waked up to something, perhaps?
#SCHOEN.
He has been too absorbed with himself.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Where are you going now?
#LULU.
Out. I see it on all the walls.
#SCHOEN.
Where are his papers?
#LULU.
In the desk.
#SCHOEN.
Where?
#LULU.
Lower right - hand drawer. Here. There is nothing to fear. He had no secrets.
#SCHOEN.
Now I can just withdraw from the world.
#LULU.
Write a pamphlet about him. Call him Michelangelo.
#SCHOEN.
What good'll that do? There lies my engagement.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
That's the curse of your game!
#SCHOEN.
Shout it thru the streets!!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
If you had treated that girl fairly and justly when my mother died -
#SCHOEN.
My engagement is bleeding to death there!
#LULU.
I sha'n't stay here any longer.
#SCHOEN.
In an hour they'll be selling extras. I dare not go across the street!
#LULU.
Why, what can you do to help it?
#SCHOEN.
That's just it! They'll stone me for it!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
You must get away - travel.
#SCHOEN.
To leave the scandal a free field!
#LULU.
Ten minutes ago he was lying here.
#SCHOEN.
This is the reward for all I've done for him! In one second he wrecks my whole life for me!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Control yourself, please!
#LULU.
There's no one but ourselves here.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
But =our= position?
#SCHOEN.
What will you say to the police?
#LULU.
Nothing.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
He didn't want to remain a debtor to his destiny.
#LULU.
He always thought of death immediately.
#SCHOEN.
He thought what a human being can only dream of.
#LULU.
He has paid dearly for it.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
He had what =we= don't have!
#SCHOEN.
I know your reasons! I have no cause to consider you! If you try every means to prevent having any brothers and sisters, that's all the more reason why I should get more children.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
You've a poor knowledge of men.
#LULU.
You get out an extra yourself!
#SCHOEN.
He had no moral sense! Paris in revolution - ?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Our editors act as though they'd been struck. Everything has stopped dead.
#SCHOEN.
That's got to help me over this! Now if only the police would come. The minutes are worth more than gold.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
There they are -
#LULU.
Wait, you've got blood -
#SCHOEN.
Where?
#LULU.
Wait, I'll wipe it.
#SCHOEN.
It's your husband's blood.
#LULU.
It leaves no trace.
#SCHOEN.
Monster!
#LULU.
You will marry me, though. Only have patience, children.
#ESCHERICH.
Allow me to - to introduce myself -
#SCHOEN.
You've run?
#ESCHERICH.
From police headquarters. A suicide, I understand.
#SCHOEN.
Fritz Escherich, correspondent of the "News and Novelties." Come along.
#ESCHERICH.
One moment. A kitchen - ax.
#SCHOEN.
Excuse me.
#ESCHERICH.
Door broken open with a kitchen - ax.
#SCHOEN.
Look before you, my dear sir.
#ESCHERICH.
Now if you will have the kindness to open the door - Merciful Heaven! God!!
#SCHOEN.
Look it all over carefully.
#ESCHERICH.
I can't look at it!
#SCHOEN.
Then what did you come here for?
#ESCHERICH.
To - to cut up - to cut up his throat with a razor!
#SCHOEN.
Have you seen it all?
#ESCHERICH.
That must feel -
#SCHOEN.
Sit down. Here is paper and pen. Write.
#ESCHERICH.
I can't write -
#SCHOEN.
Write! Persecution - mania....
#ESCHERICH.
Per - secu - tion - mania.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Never since I began to work for the stage have I seen a public so uncontrolled in enthusiasm.
#LULU.
Don't give me too much red wine. Will he see me to - day?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Father?
#LULU.
Yes.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I don't know if he's in the theater.
#LULU.
Doesn't he want to see me at all?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
He has so little time.
#LULU.
His =bride= occupies him.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Speculations. He gives himself no rest. You? We're just speaking of you.
#LULU.
Is he there?
#SCHOEN.
You're changing?
#LULU.
You write in all the papers that I'm the most gifted danseuse who ever trod the stage, a second Taglioni and I don't know what else - and you haven't once found me gifted enough to convince yourself of the fact.
#SCHOEN.
I have so much to write. You see, I was right: there were hardly any seats left. You must keep rather more in the proscenium.
#LULU.
I must first accustom myself to the light.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
She has kept herself strictly to her part.
#SCHOEN.
You must get more out of your performers! You don't know enough yet about the technique. What do you come as now?
#LULU.
As a flower - girl.
#SCHOEN.
In tights?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
No. In a skirt to the ankles.
#SCHOEN.
It would have been better if you hadn't ventured on symbolism.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I look at a dancer's feet.
#SCHOEN.
The point is, what the public looks at. An apparition like =her= has no need, thank heaven, of your symbolic mummery.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
The public doesn't look as if it was bored!
#SCHOEN.
Of course not; because I have been working for her success in the press for six months. Has the prince been here?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Nobody's been here.
#SCHOEN.
Who lets a dancer come on thru two acts in raincoats?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Who is the prince?
#SCHOEN.
Shall we see each other afterwards?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Are you alone?
#SCHOEN.
With acquaintances. At Peter's?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
At twelve?
#SCHOEN.
At twelve.
#LULU.
I'd given up hoping he'd ever come.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Don't let yourself be misled by his grumpy growls. If you'll only be careful not to spend your strength before the last number begins -
#LULU.
He doesn't seem to have noticed at all how cleverly you have used your performers.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I won't blow in sun, moon and stars in the first act!
#LULU.
You disclose me by degrees.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I knew, though, that you knew all about changing costumes.
#LULU.
If I'd wanted to sell my flowers this way before the Alhambra café, they'd have had me behind lock and key right off the very first night.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Why? You were a child!
#LULU.
Do you remember me when I entered your room the first time?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
You wore a dark blue dress with black velvet.
#LULU.
They had to stick me somewhere and didn't know where.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
My mother had been lying sick two years then.
#LULU.
You were playing theater, and asked me if I wanted to play too.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
To be sure! We played theater!
#LULU.
I see you still - the way you shoved the figures back and forth.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
For a long time my most terrible memory was when all at once I saw clearly into your relations -
#LULU.
You got icy curt towards me then.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Oh, God - I saw in you something so infinitely far above me. I had perhaps a higher devotion to you than to my mother. Think - when my mother died - I was seventeen - I went and stood before my father and demanded that he make you his wife on the spot or we'd have to fight a duel.
#LULU.
He told me that at the time.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Since I've grown older, I can only pity him. He will never comprehend me. There he is making up a story for himself about a little diplomatic game that puts me in the rôle of laboring against his marriage with the Countess.
#LULU.
Does she still look as innocently as ever at the world?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
She loves him. I'm convinced of that. Her family has tried everything to make her turn back. I don't think any sacrifice in the world would be too great for her for his sake.
#LULU.
A little more, please.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
You're drinking too much.
#LULU.
He shall learn to believe in my success! He doesn't believe in any art. He believes only in papers.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
He believes in nothing.
#LULU.
He brought me into the theater in order that someone might eventually be found rich enough to marry me.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Well, alright. Why need that trouble us?
#LULU.
I am to be glad if I can dance myself into a millionaire's heart.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
God defend that anyone should take you from us!
#LULU.
You've composed the music for it, though.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
You know that it was always my wish to write a piece for you.
#LULU.
I am not at all made for the stage, however.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
You came into the world a dancer!
#LULU.
Why don't you write your things at least as interesting as life is?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Because if we did no man would believe us.
#LULU.
If I didn't know more about acting than the people on the stage do, what might not have happened to me?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I've provided your part with all the impossibilities imaginable, though.
#LULU.
With hocus - pocus like that no dog is lured from the stove in the real world.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
It's enough for me that the public finds itself most tremendously stirred up.
#LULU.
But I'd like to find myself most tremendously stirred up.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
You don't seem to be in need of much more for that.
#LULU.
No one of them realizes anything about the others. Each thinks that he alone is the unhappy victim.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
But how can you feel that?
#LULU.
There runs up one's body such an icy shudder.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
You are incredible.
#LULU.
My cape.... I shall keep in the proscenium!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Here is your cape.
#LULU.
He shall have nothing more to fear for his shameless boosting.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Keep yourself under control!
#LULU.
God grant that I dance the last sparks of intelligence out of their heads.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Yes, a more interesting piece could be written about her. First act: Dr. Goll. Rotten already! I can call up Dr. Goll from purgatory or wherever else he's doing penance for his orgies, but I'll be made responsible for his sins. They rage there as in a menagery when the meat appears at the cage. Second act: Walter Schwarz. Still more impossible! How our souls do strip off their last coverings in the light of such lightning - strokes! Third act? Is it really to go on this way? It can not go on this way in the third act!
#ESCERNY.
Up to the middle of the third act it didn't seem to go so well to - day as usual.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I was not on the stage.
#ESCERNY.
Now she's in full career again.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
She's lengthening each number.
#ESCERNY.
I once had the pleasure of meeting the artiste at Schön's.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
My father has brought her before the public by some critiques in his paper.
#ESCERNY.
I was conferring with Dr. Schön about the publication of my discoveries at Lake Tanganika.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
His remarks leave no doubt that he takes the liveliest interest in your work.
#ESCERNY.
It's a very good thing in the artiste that the =public= does not exist for her at all.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
As a child she learned the quick changing of clothes; but I was surprised to discover such an expressive dancer in her.
#ESCERNY.
When she dances her solo she is intoxicated with her own beauty, with which she herself seems to be mortally in love.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Here she comes.
#LULU.
You're called for. I was three times before the curtain. Dr. Schön is not in your box?
#ESCERNY.
Not in mine.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Didn't you see him?
#LULU.
He is probably away again.
#ESCERNY.
He has the last parquet - box on the left.
#LULU.
It seems he is ashamed of me!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
There wasn't a good seat left for him.
#LULU.
Ask him, though, if he likes me better now.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I'll send him up.
#ESCERNY.
He applauded.
#LULU.
Did he really?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Give yourself some rest.
#LULU.
I've got to change again now.
#ESCERNY.
But your maid isn't here?
#LULU.
I can do it quicker alone. Where did you say Dr. Schön was sitting?
#ESCERNY.
I saw him in the left parquet - box farthest back.
#LULU.
I've still five costumes before me now; dancing - girl, ballerina, queen of the night, Ariel, and Lascaris....
#ESCERNY.
Would you think it possible that at our first meeting I expected nothing more than to make the acquaintance of a young lady of the literary world?... Have I perhaps erred in my judgment of your nature, or did I rightly interpret the smile which the thundering storms of applause called forth on your lips? That you are secretly pained at the necessity of profaning your art before people of doubtful disinterestedness? That you would gladly exchange at any moment the shimmer of publicity for a quiet, sunny happiness in distinguished seclusion? That you feel in yourself enough dignity and high rank to fetter a man to your feet - in order to enjoy his utter helplessness?... That in a comfortable, richly furnished villa you would feel in a more fitting place than here, - with unlimited means, to live completely as your =own mistress=?
#LULU.
If there's just one evening I don't go on, I dream the whole night that I'm dancing and feel the next day as if I'd been racked.
#ESCERNY.
But what difference could it make to you to see before you instead of this mob =one= spectator, specially elect?
#LULU.
That would make no difference. I don't see anybody anyway. lighted summer - house - the splashing of the water near at hand.... I am forced in my exploring - trips to the practise of a quite inhuman tyranny -
#LULU.
A good school!
#ESCERNY.
And if I now long to deliver myself unreservedly into the power of a woman, that is a natural need for relaxation.... Can you imagine a greater life - happiness for a woman than to have a man entirely in her power?
#LULU.
Oh yes!
#ESCERNY.
Among cultured men you will find not one who doesn't lose his head over you.
#LULU.
Your wishes, however, no one will fulfill without deceiving you.
#ESCERNY.
To be deceived by a girl like you must be ten times more enrapturing than to be uprightly loved by anybody else.
#LULU.
You have never in your life been uprightly loved by a girl! Would you undo this knot for me? I've laced myself too tight. I am always so excited getting dressed.
#ESCERNY.
I'm sorry; I can't.
#LULU.
Then leave it. Perhaps I can.
#ESCERNY.
I confess that I am lacking in deftness. Maybe I was not docile enough with women.
#LULU.
And probably you don't have much opportunity to be so in Africa, either?
#ESCERNY.
Let me openly admit to you that my loneliness in the world embitters many hours.
#LULU.
The knot is almost done....
#ESCERNY.
What draws me to you is not your dancing. It's your physical and mental refinement, as it is revealed in every one of your movements. Anyone who is so much interested in art as I am could not be deceived in that. For ten evenings I've been studying your spiritual life in your dance, until to - day when you entered as the flower - girl I became perfectly clear. Yours is a grand nature - unselfish; you can see no one suffer; you embody the joy of life. As a wife you will make a man happy above all things.... You are all open - heartedness. You would be a poor actor.
#LULU.
Now I can breathe again. The curtain is going up. I must dance.
#ESCERNY.
Allow me to remain here a little while longer.
#LULU.
Please, stay.
#ESCERNY.
I need some solitude. What is to be aristocratic? To be eccentric, like me? Or to be perfect in body and mind, like this girl? He who gives me back my faith in men, gives me back my life. Should not the children of this woman be more princely, body and soul, than the children whose mother has no more vitality in her than I have felt in me until to - day? The dance has ennobled her body....
#ALVA SCHOEN.
One is never sure a moment that some miserable chance may not throw the whole performance out for good.
#ESCERNY.
But the public has never yet shown itself so grateful.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
She's finished the skirt - dance.
#ESCERNY.
I hear her coming....
#ALVA SCHOEN.
She isn't coming. She has no time. She changes her costume in the wings.
#ESCERNY.
She has two ballet - costumes, if I'm not mistaken?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I find the white one more becoming to her than the rose.
#ESCERNY.
Do you?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Don't you?
#ESCERNY.
I find she looks too body - less in the white tulle.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I find she looks too animal in the rose - tulle.
#ESCERNY.
I don't find that.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
The white tulle expresses more the child - like in her nature.
#ESCERNY.
The rose tulle expresses more the female in her nature.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
For heaven's sake, what is wrong?
#ESCERNY.
What's the matter?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Something's gone wrong there -
#ESCERNY.
How can you get so suddenly frightened?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
That must be a hellish confusion!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
You had a faint?
#LULU.
Please lock the door.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
At least come down to the stage.
#LULU.
Did you see him?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
See whom?
#LULU.
With his bride?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
With his - You might have spared yourself that jest!
#SCHOEN.
What's the matter with her? How can you play the scene straight at me!
#LULU.
I feel as if I'd been whipped.
#SCHOEN.
You will dance - as sure as I've taken the responsibility for you!
#LULU.
Before your bride?
#SCHOEN.
Have you a right to trouble yourself before whom? You've been engaged here. You receive your salary ...
#LULU.
Is that your affair?
#SCHOEN.
You dance for anyone who buys a ticket. Whom I sit with in my box has nothing to do with your business!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I wish you'd stayed sitting in your box! Tell me, please, what I am to do. There is the manager. Yes, in a moment! You won't compel us to break off the performance?
#SCHOEN.
Onto the stage with you!
#LULU.
Let me have just a moment! I can't now. I'm utterly miserable.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
The devil take the whole theater crowd!
#LULU.
Put in the next number. No one will notice if I dance now or in five minutes. There's no strength in my feet.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
But you will dance then?
#LULU.
As well as I can.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
As badly as you like. I'm coming.
#LULU.
You are right to show me where my place is. You couldn't do it better than by letting me dance the skirt - dance before your fiancée.... You do me the greatest service when you point out where I belong.
#SCHOEN.
For you with your origin it's incomparable luck to still have the chance of entering before respectable people!
#LULU.
Even when my shamelessness makes them not know where to look.
#SCHOEN.
Nonsense! - Shamelessness? - Don't make a necessity of virtue! Your shamelessness is balanced with gold for you at every step. One cries "bravo," another "fie" - it's all the same to you! Can you wish for a more brilliant triumph than when a respectable girl can hardly be kept in the box? Has your life any other aim? As long as you still have a spark of self - respect, you are no perfect dancer. The more terribly you make people shudder, the higher you stand in your profession!
#LULU.
But it is absolutely indifferent to me what they think of me. I don't, in the least, want to be any better than I am. I'm content with myself.
#SCHOEN.
That is your true nature. I call that straightforward! A corruption!!
#LULU.
I wouldn't have known that I had a spark of self - respect -
#SCHOEN.
No harlequinading -
#LULU.
O Lord - I know very well what I'd have become if you hadn't saved me from it.
#SCHOEN.
Are you then, perhaps, something different to - day?
#LULU.
God be thanked, no!
#SCHOEN.
That is right!
#LULU.
And how awfully glad I am about it.
#SCHOEN.
Will you dance now?
#LULU.
In anything, before anyone!
#SCHOEN.
Then down to the stage!
#LULU.
Just a minute more! Please! I can't stand up straight yet. They'll ring.
#SCHOEN.
You have become what you are in spite of everything I sacrificed for your education and your welfare.
#LULU.
Had you overrated your ennobling influence?
#SCHOEN.
Spare me your witticisms.
#LULU.
The prince was here.
#SCHOEN.
Well?
#LULU.
He takes me with him to Africa.
#SCHOEN.
Africa?
#LULU.
Why not? Didn't you make me a dancer just so that someone might come and take me away with him?
#SCHOEN.
But not to Africa, though!
#LULU.
Then why didn't you let me fall quietly in a faint, and silently thank heaven for it?
#SCHOEN.
Because, more's the pity, I had no reason for believing in your faint!
#LULU.
You couldn't bear it any longer out there?
#SCHOEN.
Because I had to bring home to you what you are and to whom you are not to look up.
#LULU.
You were afraid, though, that my legs might have been seriously injured?
#SCHOEN.
I know too well you are indestructible.
#LULU.
So you know that?
#SCHOEN.
Don't look at me so impudently!
#LULU.
No one is keeping you here.
#SCHOEN.
I'm going as soon as the bell rings.
#LULU.
As soon as you have the energy! Where is your energy? You have been engaged three years. Why don't you marry? You recognize no obstacles. Why do you want to put the blame on me? You ordered me to marry Dr. Goll: I forced Dr. Goll to marry me. You ordered me to marry the painter: I made the best of a bad bargain. Artists are your creatures, princes your protegés. Why don't you marry?
#SCHOEN.
Do you imagine =you= stand in the way?
#LULU.
If you knew how happy your rage is making me! How proud I am that you should humble me by every means in your power! You debase me as deep - as deep as a woman can be debased, for you hope you can then jump over me easier. But you have suffered unspeakably yourself from everything you just said to me. I see it in you. Already you are near the end of your self - command. Go! For your innocent fiancée's sake, leave me alone! One minute more, your mood will change around and you'll make a scene with me of another kind, that you can't answer for now.
#SCHOEN.
I fear you no longer.
#LULU.
Me? Fear yourself! I do not need you. I beg you to go! Don't give me the blame. You know I don't need to faint to destroy your future. You have unlimited confidence in my honorableness. You believe not only that I'm an ensnaring daughter of Eve; you believe, too, that I'm a very good - natured creature. I am neither the one nor the other. Your misfortune is only that you think I am.
#SCHOEN.
Leave my thoughts alone! You have two men under the sod. Take the prince, dance him into the earth! I am thru with you. I know when the angel in you stops off and the devil begins. If I take the world as it's made, the Creator must be responsible, not I! To me life is not an amusement!
#LULU.
And, therefore, you make claims on life greater than anyone can make. Tell me, who of us two is more full of claims and demands, you or
#SCHOEN.
Be silent! I don't know how or what I think. When I hear you, I don't think any more. In a week I'll be married. I conjure you, by the angel that is in you, during that time come no more to my sight!
#LULU.
I will lock my doors.
#SCHOEN.
Go on and boast! God knows since I've been wrestling with the world and with life I have cursed no one like you!
#LULU.
That comes from my lowly origin.
#SCHOEN.
From your depravity!
#LULU.
With a thousand pleasures I take the blame on myself! You must feel clean now; you must think yourself a model of austerity now, a paragon of unflinching principle! Otherwise you could never marry the child in her boundless inexperience -
#SCHOEN.
Do you want me to grab you and -
#LULU.
Yes! What must I say to make you? Not for the world would I change with the innocent kid now! Tho the girl loves you as no woman has ever loved you yet!
#SCHOEN.
Silence, beast! Silence!
#LULU.
Marry her - and then she'll dance in her childish wretchedness before =my= eyes, instead of I before hers!
#SCHOEN.
God forgive me -
#LULU.
Strike me! Where is your riding - whip? Strike me on the legs -
#SCHOEN.
Away, away! Can I go before the girl now, this way? Home!
#LULU.
Be a man! Look yourself in the face once: - you have no trace of a conscience; you are frightened at no wickedness; in the most cold - blooded way you mean to make the girl that loves you unhappy; you conquer half the world; you do what you please; - and you know as well as I that -
#SCHOEN.
Stop!
#LULU.
That you are too weak - to tear yourself away from me.
#SCHOEN.
Oh! Oh! You make me weep.
#LULU.
This moment makes =me= I cannot tell you how glad.
#SCHOEN.
My age! My position!
#LULU.
He cries like a child - the terrible man of might! Now go so to your bride and tell her what kind of a girl I am at heart - not a bit jealous!
#SCHOEN.
The child! The innocent child!
#LULU.
How can the incarnate devil get so weak all of a sudden! But now go, please. You are nothing more now to me.
#SCHOEN.
I cannot go to her.
#LULU.
Out with you. Come back to me when you have regained your strength again.
#SCHOEN.
Tell me in God's name what I must do.
#LULU.
Here is writing - paper -
#SCHOEN.
I can't write....
#LULU.
Write! "My dear young lady...."
#SCHOEN.
I call her Adelheid ...
#LULU.
"My dear young lady ..."
#SCHOEN.
My sentence of death!
#LULU.
"Take back your promise. I cannot reconcile it with my conscience - " Write conscience! - "to fasten you to my unhappy lot...."
#SCHOEN.
You are right. You are right.
#LULU.
"I give you my word that I am unworthy of your love - " Write love! "These lines are the proof of it. For three years I have tried to tear myself loose; I have not the strength. I am writing you by the side of the woman that commands me. Forget me. Dr. Ludwig Schön."
#SCHOEN.
O God!
#LULU.
No, no O God! "Dr. Ludwig Schön." Postscript: "Do not attempt to save me."
#SCHOEN.
Now - comes the - execution.
#GESCHWITZ.
You can't think how glad I shall be to see you at our artists' ball.
#SCHOEN.
Is there no sort of possibility of a person like me smuggling in?
#GESCHWITZ.
It would be high treason if any of us lent herself to such an intrigue.
#SCHOEN.
The glorious flowers!
#LULU.
Fräulein von Geschwitz brought me those.
#GESCHWITZ.
Don't mention it. Oh, you'll be in man's costume, won't you?
#LULU.
Do you think that becomes me?
#GESCHWITZ.
You're a dream here.
#LULU.
My husband doesn't like it.
#GESCHWITZ.
Is it by a local man?
#LULU.
You will hardly have known him.
#GESCHWITZ.
No longer living?
#SCHOEN.
He had enough.
#LULU.
You're in bad temper.
#GESCHWITZ.
I must go, Mrs. Schön. I can't stay any longer. This evening we have life - class, and I have still so much to get ready for the ball. Good - bye, Dr. Schön.
#SCHOEN.
Pure Augean stable. That, the end of my life. They ought to show me a corner that's still clean. The pest in the house. The poorest day - laborer has his tidy nest. Thirty years' work, and this my family circle, the circle of my people - God knows who is overhearing me again now! Man is, indeed, uncertain of his life! That, my family circle! The fellow still has courage! Shall I not rather shoot =myself= in the head? Against deadly enemies one fights, but the - The dirt - the dirt.... Insanity has already conquered my reason, or else - exceptions prove the rule!
#LULU.
Couldn't you get away for this afternoon?
#SCHOEN.
Just what did that Countess want?
#LULU.
I don't know. She wants to paint me.
#SCHOEN.
Misfortune in human guise, that waits upon one.
#LULU.
Couldn't you get away, then? I would so like to drive thru the grounds with you.
#SCHOEN.
Just the day when I must be at the exchange. You know that I'm not free to - day. All my property is drifting on the waves.
#LULU.
I'd sooner be dead and buried than let my life be embittered so by my property.
#SCHOEN.
Who takes life lightly does not take death hard.
#LULU.
As a child I always had the most horrible fear of death.
#SCHOEN.
That is just why I married you.
#LULU.
You're in bad humor. You give yourself too much work. For weeks and months I've seen nothing of you.
#SCHOEN.
Your light - heartedness should cheer up my old days.
#LULU.
Indeed, you didn't marry me at all.
#SCHOEN.
Who else did I marry then?
#LULU.
I married you!
#SCHOEN.
How does that alter anything?
#LULU.
I was always afraid it would alter a great deal.
#SCHOEN.
It has, indeed, crushed a great deal underfoot.
#LULU.
But not one thing, praise God!
#SCHOEN.
Of that I should be covetous.
#LULU.
Your love for me.
#GESCHWITZ.
Oh dear, there's somebody -
#SCHIGOLCH.
Has the youngster left his heart behind him in the "Nightlight" café?
#RODRIGO.
He is still too small for the great world, and can't walk so far on foot yet.
#SCHIGOLCH.
God be thanked we're home again at last! What damned skunk has waxed the stairs again? If I have to have my joints set in plaster again before being called home, she can just present me between the palms here to her relations as the Venus de' Medici. Nothing but steep rocks and stumbling blocks!
#RODRIGO.
This thing has a royal police - captain for a father and not as much courage in his body as the raggedest hobo!
#HUGENBERG.
If there was nothing more to it than life and death, then you'd soon learn to know me!
#RODRIGO.
Even with his lover's woe, little brother don't weigh more than sixty kilos. I'll let myself be hung on that statement any time.
#SCHIGOLCH.
Throw him up to the ceiling and catch him by the feet. That'll whip his young blood into the proper rhythm right from the start.
#HUGENBERG.
Hooray, hooray, I shall be expelled from school!
#RODRIGO.
You've never been to any sensible school at all yet.
#SCHIGOLCH.
Here many a man has already won his spurs. Only, no timidity! First, I'll set before you a drop of what can't be had anywhere for money.
#HUGENBERG.
Now if she doesn't come dancing in on the instant, I'll wallop you two so you'll still rub your tails in the hereafter.
#RODRIGO.
The strongest man in the world little brother will wallop! Let mamma put long trowsers on you first.
#HUGENBERG.
I'd rather you lent me your mustache.
#RODRIGO.
Maybe you want her to throw you out of the door straight off?
#HUGENBERG.
If I only knew now what the devil I was going to say to her!
#RODRIGO.
That she knows best herself.
#SCHIGOLCH.
I started in on one of them yesterday.
#RODRIGO.
Don't give him too much, or we'll both have to pay for it.
#SCHIGOLCH.
Will the gentlemen smoke?
#HUGENBERG.
Havana - imported!
#RODRIGO.
From papa police - captain?
#SCHIGOLCH.
Everything in the house is mine. You only need to ask.
#HUGENBERG.
I made a poem to her yesterday.
#RODRIGO.
What did you make to her?
#SCHIGOLCH.
What did he make to her? poem.
#RODRIGO.
A poem.
#SCHIGOLCH.
He's promised me a dollar if I can spy out where he can meet her alone.
#HUGENBERG.
Just who does live here?
#RODRIGO.
Here =we= live!
#SCHIGOLCH.
Jour fix - every stock - market day! Our health.
#HUGENBERG.
Should I read it to her first, maybe?
#SCHIGOLCH.
What's he mean?
#RODRIGO.
His poem. He'd like to stretch her out and torture her a little first.
#SCHIGOLCH.
His eyes! His eyes!
#RODRIGO.
His eyes, yes. They've robbed her of sleep for a week.
#SCHIGOLCH.
You can have yourself pickled.
#RODRIGO.
We can both have ourselves pickled! Our health, gossip Death!
#SCHIGOLCH.
Health, jack - in - the - box! If it's still better later on, I'm ready for departure at any moment; but - but -
#LULU.
But children, children, I expect company!
#SCHIGOLCH.
But I can tell you what, those things must cost something over there!
#LULU.
You've fallen into pretty company! I expect visitors, children!
#SCHIGOLCH.
I guess I've got to stick something in there, too.
#LULU.
Do I look well?
#SCHIGOLCH.
What are those you've got there?
#LULU.
Orchids. Smell.
#RODRIGO.
Do you expect Prince Escerny?
#LULU.
God forbid!
#RODRIGO.
So somebody else again - !
#LULU.
The prince has gone traveling.
#RODRIGO.
To put his kingdom up for auction?
#LULU.
He's spying out a fresh tribe in the neighborhood of Africa.
#RODRIGO.
He wanted to marry her originally.
#SCHIGOLCH.
I, too, wanted to marry her originally.
#RODRIGO.
You wanted to marry her originally?
#SCHIGOLCH.
Didn't you, too, want to marry her originally?
#RODRIGO.
You bet I wanted to marry her originally!
#SCHIGOLCH.
Who has not wanted to marry her originally!!
#RODRIGO.
I would never have got a better!
#SCHIGOLCH.
She has let no one regret that he didn't marry her.
#RODRIGO.
Then she's not your child?
#SCHIGOLCH.
Never occurs to her.
#HUGENBERG.
What is her father's name then?
#SCHIGOLCH.
She has boasted of me!
#HUGENBERG.
What is her father's name then?
#SCHIGOLCH.
What's he say?
#RODRIGO.
What her father's name is.
#SCHIGOLCH.
She never had one.
#LULU.
What have I never had? father.
#LULU.
Yes, sure - I'm a wonder - child. How are you getting along with your father?
#RODRIGO.
He smokes a respectable cigar, anyway, the police - captain.
#SCHIGOLCH.
Have you locked up upstairs?
#LULU.
There is the key.
#SCHIGOLCH.
Better have left it in the lock.
#LULU.
Why?
#SCHIGOLCH.
So no one can unlock it from outside.
#RODRIGO.
Isn't he at the stock - exchange?
#LULU.
Oh, yes, but he suffers from persecution - mania.
#RODRIGO.
I take him by the feet, and yup! - there he stays sticking to the roof.
#LULU.
He hunts you into a mouse - hole with the corner of his eye.
#RODRIGO.
What does he hunt? Who does he hunt? Just look at this biceps!
#LULU.
Show me.
#RODRIGO.
Granite. Wrought - iron!
#LULU.
If you only didn't have such long ears -
#FERDINAND.
Doctor Schön!
#RODRIGO.
The rogue! God preserve me!
#SCHIGOLCH.
Give me the key!
#LULU.
Show him in!
#HUGENBERG.
If he doesn't stay - we'll be alone.
#LULU.
Sh!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Methinks the matinee will take place with burning lamps. I've - What the - is that?
#LULU.
An old friend of your father's.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Wholly unknown to me.
#LULU.
They were in the campaign together. He's awfully badly -
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Is my father here then?
#LULU.
He drank a glass with him. He had to go to the stock market. We'll have lunch before we go, won't we?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
When does it begin?
#LULU.
After two. How do you like me?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Had I not better be silent to you on that point?
#LULU.
I only mean my appearance.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Your dressmaker manifestly knows you better than I may permit myself to know you.
#LULU.
When I saw myself in the glass I could have wished to be a man - my man! -
#ALVA SCHOEN.
You seem to envy your man the joy you offer to him. Have you a toothache?
#LULU.
Don't.
#FERDINAND.
Doctor Schön ...?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
He seems so puckered - up and tearful to - day.
#FERDINAND.
One is only a man after all.
#LULU.
What I always think most highly of in you is your firmness of character. You're so perfectly sure of yourself. Even when you must have been afraid of quarreling with your father about it, you always stood up for me like a brother just the same.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Let's drop that. It's just my fate -
#LULU.
That was me.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Impossible! It's just my fate, with the most frivolous ideas always to seize on the best.
#LULU.
You deceive yourself if you make yourself out worse than you are.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Why do you flatter me so? It is true that perhaps there is no man living, so bad as I - who has brought about so much good.
#LULU.
In any case you're the only man in the world who's protected me without lowering me in my own eyes!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Do you think that so easy? With gifts from God like yours, one turns those around one to criminals without ever dreaming of it. I, too, am only flesh and blood, and if we hadn't grown up with each other like brother and sister -
#LULU.
That's why, too, I give myself to you alone quite without reserve. From you I have nothing to fear.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I assure you there are moments when one expects to see one's whole inner self cave in. The more self - restraint a man loads onto himself, the easier he breaks down. Nothing will save him from that except -
#LULU.
What are you looking for?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I conjure you, let me keep my confession of faith to myself! As an inviolable sanctity you were more to me than with all your gifts you could be to anyone else in your life!
#LULU.
How do you come to think on that so entirely differently from your father?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Are you sick?
#LULU.
Let him be!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
He's trembling as if he had fever.
#FERDINAND.
I am not yet so used to waiting ...
#ALVA SCHOEN.
You must have something prescribed for you.
#FERDINAND.
I'm a coachman usually -
#SCHOEN.
So, he too.
#LULU.
What sort of moments are those of which you spoke, where one expects to see his whole inner self tumble in?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I =didn't want= to speak of them. I should not like to lose, in joking over a glass of champagne, what has been my highest happiness for ten years.
#LULU.
I have hurt you. I won't begin on that again.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Do you promise me that for always?
#LULU.
My hand on it. What are you doing.
#SCHOEN.
And there is still another!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
A soul - that in the hereafter rubs the sleep out of its eyes.... Oh, this hand....
#LULU.
What do you find in it?...
#ALVA SCHOEN.
An arm....
#LULU.
What do you find in it?... body.....
#LULU.
What do you find in it?...
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Mignon!
#LULU.
What do you find in it?...
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Mignon! Mignon!
#LULU.
Don't look at me so - for God's sake! Let us go before it is too late. You're an infamous wretch!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I told you, didn't I, I was the basest villain.
#LULU.
I see that!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I have no sense of honor, no pride....
#LULU.
You think I am your equal!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
You? - you are as heavenly high above me as - as the sun is over the abyss! Destroy me! I beg you, put an end to me! Put an end to me!
#LULU.
Do you =love= me then?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I will pay you with everything that was mine!
#LULU.
Do you love me?
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Do you love me - Mignon? Not a soul.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
I love you.
#LULU.
I poisoned your mother - His father!
#SCHOEN.
Alva! A revolution has broken out in Paris.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
To Paris ... let me go to Paris -
#SCHOEN.
In the editors' room they're beating their heads against the wall. No one knows what he ought to write.
#LULU.
You can't get out here.
#RODRIGO.
Let me through!
#LULU.
You'll run into his arms.
#RODRIGO.
He'll shoot me thru the head!
#LULU.
He's coming.
#RODRIGO.
Devil, death and demons!
#HUGENBERG.
No room!
#RODRIGO.
Damned and done for!
#SCHOEN.
Where is =he= gone?
#LULU.
Out.
#SCHOEN.
Down over the balcony?
#LULU.
He's an acrobat.
#SCHOEN.
That could not be foreseen. You who drag me thru the muck of the streets to a tortured death!
#LULU.
Why did you not bring me up better?
#SCHOEN.
You destroying angel! You inexorable fate! To be a murderer without drowning in filth; to take me on board like a released convict, or hang me up over the morass! You joy of my old age! You hangman's noose!
#LULU.
Oh, shut up, and kill me!
#SCHOEN.
Everything I possess I have made over to you, and asked nothing but the respect that every servant pays to my house. Your credit is exhausted!
#LULU.
I can answer for my reckoning still for years. How do you like my new gown?
#SCHOEN.
Away with you, or my brains will give way to - morrow and my son swim in his own blood! You infect me like an incurable pest in which I shall groan away the rest of my life. I =will= cure myself! Do you understand? This is your physic. Don't break down; don't kneel! You yourself shall apply it. You or I - which is the weaker?
#LULU.
It doesn't go off.
#SCHOEN.
Do you still remember how I tore you out of the clutches of the police?
#LULU.
You have much confidence -
#SCHOEN.
Because I'm not afraid of a street - girl? Shall I guide your hand for you? Have you no mercy towards yourself? No false alarms! What was that?
#LULU.
Nothing.
#SCHOEN.
What flew out of here?
#LULU.
You're suffering from persecution - mania.
#SCHOEN.
Have you got still more men hidden here? Is yet another man calling on you? I'll regale your men! Did you come down the chimney?
#GESCHWITZ.
Save me from him!
#SCHOEN.
Or are you, too, an acrobat?
#GESCHWITZ.
You hurt me.
#SCHOEN.
Now you will =have= to stay to dinner. We want no town - criers. There's still enough for you in it. Look at me! I cannot assist the coachman in my house to decorate my forehead for me. Look at me! I pay my coachman. Look at me! Am I doing the coachman a favor when I can't stand the stable - stench?
#LULU.
Have the carriage got ready! Please! We're going to the opera.
#SCHOEN.
We're going to the devil! Now I am coachman. Think you we let ourselves be mistreated as you mistreat me, and hesitate between a galley - slave's shame at the end of life and the merit of freeing the world of =you=? Come, get through. It will be the gladdest remembrance of my life. Pull the trigger!
#LULU.
You can get a divorce.
#SCHOEN.
Only that was left! In order that to - morrow the next man may find his pastime where I have shuddered from cleft to chasm, suicide upon me and =thou= before me! You dare suggest that? That part of my life I have poured into you I am to see thrown before wild beasts? Do you see your bed with the sacrifice - the victim - on it? The boy is homesick for you. Did you let yourself be divorced? You trod him under your feet, knocked out his brains, caught up his blood in gold - pieces. I let myself be divorced? =Can= one be divorced when two people have grown into each other and half the man must go, too? Give it here!
#LULU.
Don't!
#SCHOEN.
I'll spare you the trouble.
#LULU.
If men have killed themselves for my sake, that doesn't lower my value. You know as well why you made me your wife as I knew why I took you for husband. You had deceived your best friends with me; you could not well go on deceiving yourself with me. If you bring me the close of your life as a sacrifice, still you have had my whole youth for it. You understand ten times better than I do which is the more valuable. I have never in the world wished to seem to be anything different from what I am taken for, and I have never in the world been taken for anything different from what I am. You want to force me to fire a bullet into my heart. I'm not sixteen any more, but to fire a bullet in my heart I am still much too young!
#SCHOEN.
Down, murderess! Down with you! To your knees, murderess! Down, and never dare to stand again! Pray to God, murderess, that he give you strength. Sue to heaven that strength for it may be lent you!
#SCHOEN.
And - there - is - one - more -
#LULU.
All merciful - !
#SCHOEN.
Out of my sight! Alva!
#LULU.
The one man I loved!
#SCHOEN.
Harlot! Murderess! Alva! Alva! Water!
#LULU.
Water; he's thirsty.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Father! O God, my father!
#LULU.
I shot him.
#HUGENBERG.
She is innocent!
#SCHOEN.
You! It miscarried.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
You must go to bed; come.
#SCHOEN.
Don't take me so! I'm drying up. You are still like yourself. Don't let her escape. You are the next.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Help me carry him to bed.
#SCHOEN.
No, no, please, no. Wine, murderess -
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Take him up that side. Into the bed - room.
#SCHOEN.
O God! O God! O God! The Devil.
#LULU.
He has got over it.
#ALVA SCHOEN.
Don't stir!
#GESCHWITZ.
I thought it was you.
#LULU.
You can't give me up to the law! It is =my= head that is struck off. I shot him because he was about to shoot me. I have loved nobody in the world but him! Alva, demand what you will, only don't let me fall into the hands of justice. Take pity on me. I am still young. I will be true to you as long as I live. I will belong only to you. Look at me, Alva. Man, look at me! Look at me!!
#ALVA SCHOEN.
The police.
#HUGENBERG.
I shall be expelled from school.
