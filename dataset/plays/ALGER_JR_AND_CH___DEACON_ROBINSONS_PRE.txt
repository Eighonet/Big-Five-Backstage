#LANDLORD.
Good - evening, deacon.
#DEACON ROBINSON.
Good - evening. I’ve come down from Morristown to ’tend the convention. I may be here two or three days. Can you give me a room?
#LUND.
Oh, yes, certainly; a nice room, too. Will you order supper before going up stairs?
#DEACON ROBINSON.
Supper! No, indeed! It’s nine o’clock, and I’m going to bed. Besides, I took supper afore I left home.
#LUND.
But you’ll register your name, first?
#DEACON ROBINSON.
Wal, yes, I hain’t no objection.
#LUND.
Here, John, take this lamp and show the gentleman up to Number 33.
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, sir.
#FITZ HOWARD.
Aw—I say—aw—can you give me a good room?
#LUND.
Yes sir, directly. But, beg pardon, sir; perhaps you’d like some supper first?
#FITZ HOWARD.
Aw—yes, but I’ll go to my room first—aw, and make my toilet—remove the dust and travel—aw.
#LUND.
Your name, sir!
#FITZ HOWARD.
Aw—yes—I had forgotten. What a deuced poor pen!
#LUND.
Here is another.
#FITZ HOWARD.
Deacon Jonathan Robinson—aw. What a name! Not much like the next one. Charles Herbert Fitz Howard—aw.
#JACK.
Ain’t he a swell, though?
#LUND.
John.
#JACK.
Yes, sir.
#LUND.
Show this gentleman up to number 35.
#JACK.
Yes, sir. This way, sir.
#DEACON ROBINSON.
I don’t see but I’ve got to wear these clothes, as long as the others are gone, for the convention meets at nine, and I shan’t have much more’n time to eat my breakfast. But it beats all where them other clothes went to, and where these come from. I declare, I never heard o’ such a thing in my born days. Yes, it must be—there’s no other way. Some of my friends here in Rossville must ha’ clubbed together, and bought me this new suit, knowing I was to be here to the convention. But when could they ha’ brought them in, and taken my others away, for I’ve had my door locked ever since I came into the room? Oh, I remember now, last night, when there was an alarm of fire, I slipped on my overcoat, and went into the entry to see where ’twas; but findin’ ’twas a false alarm, I came back in less than ten minutes. They must ha’ been dreadful spry to ha’ made the change so quick. I’m afraid they’re too gay for me, but I seem to be ’bleeged to wear ’em. I wonder if the coat fits as well as the rest. Well, it’s a complete fit, and it does really improve me amazin’ly—makes me look a good deal younger. The cloth seems good too. They must ha’ cost a good deal. Really, my friends have been very kind, but I do wish they’d brought a different hat. Perhaps I can exchange it to - morrow, but I’ve got to wear it to - day, at any rate. There’s one thing I haven’t thought of afore I wonder whether they thought to change things in the pockets from the old to the new. There aint a single thing in any of ’em. And what shall I do without money? Ah, here is the old wallet. Lucky for me I bought a newspaper last evening, or that pocket - book would ha’ been gone too. I must go down and see if I can hear anything about the rest of the things.
#FITZ HOWARD.
Well—aw—I’m sure, I don’t see what I’m going to do. I never can go out on the street—aw—wearing such wretched - looking clothes. Why, they’re absolutely horwid. It’s strange—aw—how anybody could have been quick enough—aw—to change those clothes in the five minutes I was out—aw—last night at the alarm of fire. I should just like to get hold of the thief—aw—that’s all. I guess—aw—he’d never steal anything else. I won’t wear this horwid - looking coat What would Dick Hayes or Harwy Nichols say—aw—to see me dressed in this style! I won’t wear the shabby ole thing. I should feel—aw—as if I was my own grandfather. And this horwid old hat. Aw—I’ll ring for the landlord.
#FITZ HOWARD.
Aw—where’s the landlord—aw?
#JACK.
He’s gone away.
#FITZ HOWARD.
When he comes back—aw—I want to see him.
#JACK.
Yes, sir; but he may not be back till noon, but I’ll tell him when he comes.
#FITZ HOWARD.
Well—aw—there’s no help from that quarter. I don’t see but I’ve got to come to it, for if I don’t wear these clothes—aw—what shall I wear? There isn’t any shop that sells ready - made clothing that I’d be willing to wear—aw—and if there was I haven’t money enough to spare to buy another suit. I don’t see but I must wear it. Oh, dear! Aw—what a fright! And I was going to call on Arabella Meade this morning. But there’s no use in my going there to - day. The servants would take me—aw—for a ragamuffin, and thrust me out of the house—aw—if I attempted to enter it. I suppose I shall have to go down in this costume—aw—and see if I cannot find some clue to my own clothes—aw.
#DEACON ROBINSON.
How do you do, Dr. Cummings?
#DR. CUMMINGS.
Really, sir, you have the advantage of me!
#DEACON ROBINSON.
What, don’t you recognize me? You’ve known me for the last twenty - five years. I’m Deacon Jonathan Robinson, of Morristown.
#DR. CUMMINGS.
Why, bless my soul, so you are! But, good gracious, deacon, what possessed you to dress in this strange way?
#DEACON ROBINSON.
Strange?
#DR. CUMMINGS.
Yes. I consider it discreditable to one of your years, sobriety, and position in the community, to make such a popinjay of yourself.
#DEACON ROBINSON.
But it isn’t my doings.
#DR. CUMMINGS.
Isn’t your doings? Then whose is it? I don’t understand it. Surely Mrs. Robinson doesn’t countenance such folly!
#DEACON ROBINSON.
She doesn’t know anything about it.
#DR. CUMMINGS.
No; I thought not.
#DEACON ROBINSON.
If you won’t be in such a hurry, Dr. Cummings, I’ll explain it all. You see I came over to Rossville last evening and put up here. I went to bed early, but about midnight there was a cry of fire. I slipped on my overcoat, and went into the entry to learn whether it was near by. In a few minutes I heard that it was a false alarm. I hurried back to my room, which I couldn’t have been out of more’n ten minutes, and locked my door. Then I went to bed and to sleep. When I waked in the morning my old clothes, which have done me such faithful service, were gone, and these were left in their place.
#DR. CUMMINGS.
How do you suppose they came there?
#DEACON ROBINSON.
It is my opinion that my friends in Rossville, knowing that I was to attend a convention, took this way of presenting me with a new and fashionable suit of clothes.
#DR. CUMMINGS.
It’s a strange story.
#MRS. ROBINSON.
I should like to know, Deacon Robinson, what has put it into your head to dress in this ridiculous style; you, a man most sixty years old!
#DEACON ROBINSON.
I’m only fifty - eight.
#MRS. ROGERS.
And you dress as if you were eighteen. You refuse me a silk dress, and then go and squander your money on this foolish rig. I should think you had gone stark, staring mad.
#DEACON ROBINSON.
Stop, Reeny, I’ll explain it all. My friends in Rossville came and brought me this suit in the night.
#MRS. ROGERS.
Fiddlestick! Do you expect me to believe that ridiculous story? I’m really afraid you’ve been drinking. Nothing else could ha’ brought you to make such a fool of yourself.
#DEACON ROBINSON.
Mrs. Robinson, I command you to be silent. It’s you that are makin’ a fool o’ yourself, I’d have you to know. It’s enough for you to think of your own dress, and not interfere with mine.
#MRS. ROGERS.
O Jonathan, is this the way you speak to me, who’ve been a faithful wife to you for more than thirty years?
#FITZ HOWARD.
So you’re the thief—aw—you rascal—
#DR. CUMMINGS.
What does this mean?
#FITZ HOWARD.
It means—aw—that this fellah has run off with my clothes—a hundred - dollar suit, and left—aw—this worthless rubbish in its place. Help! Police—aw—where’s the police?
#MRS. ROGERS.
O Jonathan, have you brought disgrace upon your innocent wife and family by this strange conduct?
#DR. CUMMINGS.
O Deacon!
#DEACON ROBINSON.
Hear me; hear me. There’s some strange mistake.
#FITZ HOWARD.
There’s no mistake about it. Bring the police.
#DEACON ROBINSON.
I won’t go to jail. Call the landlord.
#MRS. ROGERS.
Yes; call the landlord. Perhaps he can explain about it.
#FITZ HOWARD.
This man—aw—has stolen my clothes, and I demand his arrest.
#DEACON ROBINSON.
Well, landlord, you’ve known me a good many years. Do you think I should be likely to steal now—at my age?
#LUND.
Impossible; there must be some mistake.
#FITZ HOWARD.
But there can’t be any mistake; don’t you see—aw—he’s got on my clothes, and I his?
#LUND.
Yes; but if he intended to steal them he wouldn’t come in, and sit quietly in the parlor with the garments on. But I haven’t heard how it came about. Did either of you leave your room last night?
#FITZ HOWARD.
I only left it for five minutes—aw—when the alarm of fire was raised—aw—and this morning when I waked—aw—my new suit was changed into these horwid things.
#LUND.
And did you leave your room, too?
#DEACON ROBINSON.
Yes; but only long enough to go into the entry and back again.
#LUND.
I see how it is; your rooms were side by side. You both left them, and when you returned, you each went into the other’s room. That accounts for the change of clothing.
#DEACON ROBINSON.
By George, that must ha’ been the way ’twas done. But I declare to goodness, I never should ha’ thought about it. Thank you, landlord, for gettin’ me out o’ this scrape. And look here, young man, suppose we just go up stairs and swap clothes again. I guess these aint any more becomin’ to me than them are to you.
#FITZ HOWARD.
You’re right there—aw—old man.
#MRS. ROGERS.
Well, I thank goodness things have turned out as they have. I wouldn’t ha’ had Jonathan gone to the convention in that rig for nothin’ in the world.
#DR. CUMMINGS.
Not even if they had been a present to him from his friends in Rossville!
