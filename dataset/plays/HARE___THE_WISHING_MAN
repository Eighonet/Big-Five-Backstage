#DUMPLING.
Whoa, there, Jimmie! Oh, Grandpa, I do love my pony. It's the best of all my presents.
#GRANDPA.
Well, it's time you put him in his stall.
#TOOTSY.
I'm going to call my pony after Mr. - 'Cause he looks just like him.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
And what are you going to call your pony, Snookums?
#SNOOKUMS.
Going to call him Elizabeth, after you, Grandma.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
That's my baby!
#MOTHER.
Grandma, we'd better get our hats and coats. It's nearly time for the car to be after us.
#FATHER.
Come, Grandpa. It's nearly eight o'clock.
#GRANDPA.
But I don't like to leave the children.
#DUMPLING.
And we don't like to have you leave us, either. My, this has been the grandest Christmas day I've ever seen.
#MOTHER.
Come, Grandma.
#GRANDPA.
Come, children. I'm glad you've had such a happy Christmas. You got everything you wanted, didn't you?
#TOOTSY.
Yes, everything. My, I wish Christmas would come every day.
#DUMPLING.
Tell us the story about old Saint Nick, Grandpa.
#GRANDPA.
Do you want to hear that old chestnut again?
#CHILDREN.
Oh, yes, yes!
#CHILDREN.
Oh, that was just lovely.
#TOOTSY.
I just wish I could see him. Just once!
#DUMPLING.
And so do I. I'm going to catch him some Christmas Eve.
#SNOOKUMS.
Me, too!
#MOTHER.
Here, Grandpa, put on your coat and hat, or we'll be late for the dinner.
#GRANDPA.
I'd rather stay here and talk to the children.
#FATHER.
But Aunt Clara is expecting us.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
And the auto is at the door.
#GRANDPA.
Dumpling, are you sure you got everything you wanted for Christmas?
#DUMPLING.
I can't think of anything else.
#GRANDPA.
If you didn't, and if all three of you children can agree on anything else, it shall be yours if money can buy it.
#TOOTSY.
Money can buy everything, can't it, Grandpa?
#GRANDPA.
No, my dear, not quite everything.
#DUMPLING.
But suppose we wish for something that money can't buy?
#GRANDPA.
I'd try to get it for you some other way.
#TOOTSY.
How, Grandpa; how?
#GRANDPA.
Why, I'd tell the Wishing Man. He'd get it for you.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Come along, John; don't put such nonsense in the children's heads.
#FATHER.
We must hurry along to Aunt Clara's, children. But this is Christmas night. You may all stay up tonight just as long as you wish.
#DUMPLING.
Oh, can we? Can we?
#MOTHER.
Yes. Cecelia will look after you. Cecelia?
#NURSE MAID.
Of course I will, mum.
#MOTHER.
Come along, now. We must hurry.
#TOOTSY.
Oh, we can stay up just as long as we wish! Goody, goody! Why that is the very best gift of all.
#NURSE MAID.
Now you children be good, and if you want me, call out. I'll be down in the kitchen with the cook.
#DUMPLING.
Now we're left all alone.
#TOOTSY.
I don't see why Aunt Clara couldn't have invited us to her dinner party, too.
#SNOOKUMS.
Snookums likes dinner party.
#DUMPLING.
It's 'cause we ain't big enough.
#TOOTSY.
My, I wisht I was a great, great, great big girl.
#DUMPLING.
There, that's a wish that money can't buy.
#TOOTSY.
Grandpa said he'd get us anything we wished for.
#DUMPLING.
What do you wish, Snookums?
#SNOOKUMS.
Wish Grandpaw would come home.
#TOOTSY.
I know a real good wish. I wish it were Christmas every day. Don't you, Dumpling?
#DUMPLING.
No, I don't. We'd have to have a present and a tree and a turkey and plum pudding every day of our lives. We'd get awfully tired of it after a while. Just think, we'd have to give away about a million presents every year.
#TOOTSY.
I'll tell you what I really do wish.
#DUMPLING.
What?
#TOOTSY.
I wish we could do just like grown up folks do. I wish I was the biggest little girl in all the world.
#DUMPLING.
And I wish so, too. I wish we were just awfully, awfully, awfully big - and then we could go to Aunt Clara's dinner party, and everywhere.
#SNOOKUMS.
Me wish me was great big Snookums.
#TOOTSY.
But money couldn't buy that wish, Dumpling.
#DUMPLING.
No, that's right. But Grandpa said if he couldn't buy our wish he'd get it some other way.
#TOOTSY.
How could he get it?
#DUMPLING.
He said he'd tell the Wishing Man.
#TOOTSY.
My, I wonder if there really is such a person!
#DUMPLING.
I don't know. But I'd like to see him if there is.
#TOOTSY.
I'll make a rhyme.
#WISHING MAN.
Well? and TOOTSY. Well? Well!
#SNOOKUMS.
Well?
#WISHING MAN.
Well, I'm here.
#DUMPLING.
Who's here?
#WISHING MAN.
Why, I am here. You said you would like to see me and so I have come. I'm here.
#TOOTSY.
Are you the Wishing Man?
#WISHING MAN.
That's my name.
#DUMPLING.
And can you really grant us anything we wish for?
#WISHING MAN.
I can, if it's a good wish - and if you all agree on the same thing.
#TOOTSY.
Anything in the wide, wide world?
#WISHING MAN.
Well, pretty nearly anything. Would you like some new toys?
#TOOTSY.
Oh, no, thank you. This is Christmas, you know, and we got ever so many toys.
#SNOOKUMS.
Ever so many toys.
#WISHING MAN.
I don't see what you called me for. You seem to have everything you want.
#DUMPLING.
Oh, no, we haven't. We've made a wish, and we're all agreed on it.
#WISHING MAN.
Are you sure it's a good wish?
#DUMPLING.
Oh, yes, it's an awful good wish. You see, we want to be great big children so we can stay up late at night and go to Aunt Clara's dinner parties. That's our wish. We want to be the biggest children there are anywhere.
#WISHING MAN.
Oh, ho, ho, ho! That's the funniest wish I ever heard since I've been in the wishing business. So you want to be the very biggest children there are anywhere, do you?
#TOOTSY.
Yes, sir; that's just what we want. I want to be a great, big, tall little girl.
#WISHING MAN.
A great, big tall little girl, hey?
#DUMPLING.
And I want to be a great, big, big, big little boy.
#WISHING MAN.
Oh, a big, big, BIG little boy, hey?
#SNOOKUMS.
And so do I.
#WISHING MAN.
And so do you, hey?
#CHILDREN.
Yes, sir; that is our wish.
#WISHING MAN.
Well, I'll have to see if I can accommodate you. It's a pretty big job, you know.
#TOOTSY.
You said you could give us anything we wished for.
#WISHING MAN.
But I didn't think you'd wish for anything like that.
#DUMPLING.
That's the only thing we want, Mr Wishing Man.
#WISHING MAN.
Well, now - let me see. I'm afraid it's too big a job for me. In the first place I haven't any marble.
#CHILDREN.
Marble?
#WISHING MAN.
Yes. In order to make you grow and grow and grow, you'll have to stand on marble.
#TOOTSY.
We have a marble - top table in the front hall.
#DUMPLING.
Oh, yes. And we can all stand on top of the table.
#WISHING MAN.
But I have to stand here by the open window.
#TOOTSY.
Well, we can go in there and leave the door open. You can stay here and make our wish come true. Come on, Dumpling.
#WISHING MAN.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you all of you sure you want to be made into great big, big little children?
#CHILDREN.
Yes, all of us.
#WISHING MAN.
All right. If that's your wish, it's no business of mine. Go out in the front hall and climb on the marble - top table and I'll see what I can do for you.
#TOOTSY.
Oh, come on, quick, Dumpling, before he changes his mind.
#WISHING MAN.
It's a very foolish wish, but maybe they'll be satisfied if I make them the biggest children on earth. I'll see what I can do.
#DUMPLING.
I'm standing up on the table now.
#TOOTSY.
Now it's my turn. I'm on the table.
#SNOOKUMS.
Now, Mr. Wishing Man, I'm on the table.
#WISHING MAN.
That's the Baby Snookums. Very well, little Snookie Ookums! I'll change you into the biggest baby on earth.
#NURSE MAID.
Goodness, gracious! Is it a tornado or an earthquake? Oh! And who are you? Murder! Thieves! Robbers! Where's me children? Where's little Dumpling and Tootsy and Baby Snookums?
#WISHING MAN.
Where are your children?
#WISHING MAN.
There they are. There are little Dumpling and Tootsy and Baby Snookums.
#WISHING MAN.
Hello, little boys and girls, how do you do this fine winter night? I know what each of you has been thinking. You've been wishing that you could meet the Wishing Man and that he would make your wishes come true. Now, haven't you? Well, I've made that wish come true. You wished to meet me, and here I am. I've been watching you all the year in Sunday School. I know how you have worked over your lessons, how you have helped your teachers and how punctual you have been. To be sure, I know some of you haven't helped your teachers as much as you could have done, but I'll forget all that at Christmas time. Now tell me what you wish for most.
#CHILDREN.
A Christmas tree. A look at old Santa Claus. Some nice Christmas presents, etc.
#WISHING MAN.
Stop, stop. I can't attend to so many wishes at once.
#LITTLE GIRL.
Please, Mr. Wishing Man, couldn't you tell us what we'd better wish for?
#WISHING MAN.
Have you ever had a great, big Christmas tree?
#CHILDREN.
Oh, yes, lots of times.
#WISHING MAN.
Have you ever seen my old friend, Mr. Santa Claus?
#CHILDREN.
Oh, yes.
#LITTLE BOY.
We see him every year at Christmas.
#WISHING MAN.
How would like to go with me to Wishing Land.
#CHILDREN.
Oh, goody! That would be fine. Can you take us there?
#WISHING MAN.
Of course I can. And that's just what we'll do. We'll all of us go to the Wishing Land. First, I'll call little Dumpling. Dumpling, little Dumpling, where are you? comes in from behind the curtains.
#BIG DUMPLING.
Here I am, Mr. Wishing Man. I was playing with my little horse and wagon.
#WISHING MAN.
And how do you like being a great, big Dumpling?
#BIG DUMPLING.
Well, not very well. I'm always bumping my head on the doors and things. And all my toys are so very little I'm always breaking them.
#WISHING MAN.
Where is your sister? Where is little Tootsy? enters.
#BIG TOOTSY.
Here, Mr. Wishing Man. I'm here. Me and my little dolly.
#WISHING MAN.
Well, little Tootsy, how do you like being a great, big Tootsy?
#BIG TOOTSY.
I don't like it very well. My clothes don't seem to fit, and I know I look awfully funny. Don't I? Everybody laughs at me and it always makes me cry.
#WISHING MAN.
And where is little Snookie Ookums? enters.
#BIG SNOOKUMS.
Here I am, Mr. Wishing Man. Here's 'ittie Snookie Ookums.
#WISHING MAN.
You look like a 'ittie baby elephant, Snookie Ookums. Well, are you children satisfied with your wish?
#THE THREE.
Not very much. We wish we were little again.
#BIG SNOOKUMS.
I tried to ride my little horsie and I bweaked him all to pieces.
#BIG DUMPLING.
And I can't get enough to eat. My little knife and fork and spoon are too little, and when I eat I swallow dishes and all.
#BIG TOOTSY.
And all my clothes are too little for me, and I look so funny that everybody laughs at me. And I don't like it at all.
#WISHING MAN.
I'm just going to start on a journey to the Wishing Land. The toys there are awfully big. They'd be just the right size for you. Would you like to go with me?
#BIG SNOOKUMS.
Is it very far?
#BIG DUMPLING.
Could we get back by bedtime?
#BIG TOOTSY.
Wouldn't it be awfully cold flying through the air?
#WISHING MAN.
Oh, no. We'd fly so fast you'd only have time to shiver once and then we'd be right there.
#THE THREE.
Oh, yes; let's go.
#WISHING MAN.
All right. Now all of you part your hair right in the middle, so you won't be heavier on one side than on the other. That's good. Now give me your hands and hold on tight and we're off to the Wishing Land. Follow me, full of glee.
#WISHING MAN.
Well, here we are in the Wishing Land. My kingdom and not a soul to welcome me!
#BIG DUMPLING.
Oh, what a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful place.
#BIG SNOOKUMS.
See 'ittie bitsy teeny weeny trumpets gwowing in twees.
#BIG TOOTSY.
And the dolls. The lovely, lovely dolls.
#WISHING MAN.
What, ho! Is there none to welcome me?
#BIG DUMPLING.
Oh, see the Teddy Bear.
#BIG TOOTSY.
And he's the biggest one I ever saw.
#BIG SNOOKUMS.
Nice pussy, nice, nice pussy!
#BIG SNOOKUMS.
Oh, naughty, naughty, naughty!
#WISHING MAN.
Hello, Teddy Bear. Where's your brother?
#WISHING MAN.
Go out and find him for me. Have you been a very, very good Teddy Bear while I was away?
#WISHING MAN.
That's good. Now go out and find Jimmy Bear.
#WISHING MAN.
Everything is growing fine. I think the bicycle trees need a little more water. Well, children, what do you think of the Wishing Land?
#BIG DUMPLING.
It's awfully pretty.
#BIG TOOTSY.
It's perfectly gorgeous.
#BIG SNOOKUMS.
Wunnerful, simply wunnerful.
#WISHING MAN.
Here's where I grow my toys. See, there is the trumpet vine, and the candy tree and the dolly flowers. Whenever a little child makes a wish for anything like that, all I have to do is to come in here and pick a toy. See?
#BIG DUMPLING.
Oh, lookee at the tin soldiers. They're awful big. Can I have one, Mr. Wishing Man?
#WISHING MAN.
I don't think they're quite ripe yet.
#BIG SNOOKUMS.
Me want a twumpet. Want a nice, big twumpet to blow.
#WISHING MAN.
There you are, my little man.
#BIG TOOTSY.
I want one, too. A nice loud one.
#WISHING MAN.
And there's one for you, Tootsy.
#BIG DUMPLING.
Believe I'll take a drum.
#WISHING MAN.
There you are. Right off the tree.
#BIG DUMPLING.
Now we'll have a parade.
#WISHING MAN.
Here, here, wait a minute. You're making enough noise to wake the dead. Hold on, there. Quiet, quiet!
#BIG TOOTSY.
Oh, dear! Just as we were having such a lovely time.
#BIG SNOOKUMS.
Oh, whee! See the funny box. What is in it, Mr. Wishing Man?
#WISHING MAN.
You'd better let it alone. That's Ka - zin - ski, and Ka - zin - ski doesn't like babies.
#BIG SNOOKUMS.
But I wish to see him.
#WISHING MAN.
Is it a wish?
#BIG SNOOKUMS.
Yes, sir; it's a wish.
#WISHING MAN.
Then pull the string.
#BIG SNOOKUMS.
Oh, whee! Take him away! I'm fwightened, I am. Vill he come after me?
#WISHING MAN.
No, no. Get up, 'ittie Snookie Ookums, he won't hurt you.
#BIG DUMPLING.
Say, Mr. Wishing Man?
#WISHING MAN.
What is it, my little boy?
#BIG DUMPLING.
Can we have anything we wish for here in the Wishing Land?
#WISHING MAN.
Of course you can. That's what the Wishing Land is for.
#BIG DUMPLING.
Then I wish I was a little boy again. I'm too big to enjoy myself.
#BIG TOOTSY.
And I wish I was a little girl again. Everybody laughs at me, 'cause I'm so big.
#BIG SNOOKUMS.
And I wish I was a 'ittie, teeny, weeny baby again. Being so big fwightens me so.
#WISHING MAN.
Oh, ho! So you all want to be little again?
#THE THREE.
Yes, sir, if you please.
#BIG TOOTSY.
Why, I'm so big that I can't get all of me into bed. I'll have to let my feet hang outside.
#BIG SNOOKUMS.
And if I get in my baby buggy, I'll bweak it all down.
#BIG DUMPLING.
And my mamma won't recognize me at all, 'cause I'm grown so big.
#WISHING MAN.
That's all very well, but it will be quite a job to make you all little again. It will take three magic fern seeds, and I don't think I have any ripe yet.
#BIG DUMPLING.
Oh, what is it, Mr. Wishing Man? Is it the fern seed?
#WISHING MAN.
Yes, but it's only one fern seed. Only one of you can be made little again.
#BIG DUMPLING.
Give it to my sister, Tootsy. She's a girl.
#BIG TOOTSY.
No, give it to Dumpling. He's the oldest.
#WISHING MAN.
I think I'll give it to 'ittie Snookie Ookums. Here, Snookums, take that little seed and go down by the pump and get a drink of water. Put the seed in the water and swallow it and you'll be the original 'ittie Snookums again.
#BIG SNOOKUMS.
Oh, goody, goody, goody!
#WISHING MAN.
Here's another fern seed. Ladies first, Dumpling. I'll give it to Tootsy.
#BIG TOOTSY.
Oh, you dear, good Wishing Man. I'll give you a nice hug and kiss for that.
#WISHING MAN.
And here's the third magical fern seed. Here you are, Master Dumpling. Hurry along and grow little again.
#BIG DUMPLING.
Oh, thank you, sir. and the TWO BEARS dance out at L. in time to the music.
#WISHING MAN.
The dolly plants don't seem to be doing very well. Here's a ripe one. I'm going to give that to for a Christmas present. And here's another for - I wonder how my big French dolls are doing. They're dreadfully hard to raise. They require so much attention. I have to keep them under cover to protect them from the sun. The wax melts so easily and the pretty red cheeks are apt to run down over their pretty French dresses. How nice they look. There's Annette, Olivette and Babette. Three as pretty little French ladies as ever came out of Paris. I think they're just about ready to pick. They're such pretty dollies that I think I'll give them to little boys instead of little girls. I'll give Annette to and I'll give Olivette to - , and little Babette I'll give to - My, my, I was forgetting all about the children and the mysterious fern seed. I wonder if it has changed them back into real little children again. Yes, here they come.
#DUMPLING.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Wishing Man. I feel ever so much better now.
#TOOTSY.
Yes, indeed. My clothes are a perfect fit and nobody will laugh at me now.
#SNOOKUMS.
I feel perfectly fan - tas - a - ma - gor - ious.
#TOOTSY.
Oh, see the pretty French dollies. I wish they would talk to me.
#WISHING MAN.
If that's your wish, they can.
#TOOTSY.
Can you talk?
#ANNETTE.
Pa - pa, pa - pa, pa - pa!
#TOOTSY.
And what can you say?
#OLIVETTE.
Ma - ma, ma - ma, ma - ma!
#SNOOKUMS.
Go on and talk to me.
#BABETTE.
Mer - ry Christ - mas! Mer - ry Christ - mas!
#TOOTSY.
I wish you could wind them up so they could walk around and play with us.
#WISHING MAN.
Is that your wish?
#TOOTSY.
Oh, yes. Do you think you can do it?
#WISHING MAN.
I can try.
#ANNETTE.
Pa - pa, pa - pa, pa - pa!
#DUMPLING.
Here, stop her. She'll fall down. Here, turn around. Walk this way.
#OLIVETTE.
Ma - ma, ma - ma, ma - ma;
#TOOTSY.
Oh, I think you are a darling.
#BABETTE.
Mer - ry Christ - mas! Mer - ry Christmas.
#WISHING MAN.
Here, wait for me.
#DUMPLING.
Wind up the soldiers. Then each dolly can have a partner.
#WISHING MAN.
Just a minute.
#PRIVATE BLACK.
Allow me.
#PRIVATE JACK.
Allow me.
#PRIVATE MACK.
Allow me.
#TOOTSY.
Oh, I wish they were all alive.
#WISHING MAN.
You do? Is that your wish? Then I'll make them all alive.
#SNOOKUMS.
Oh, lookee! Candy!
#WISHING MAN.
That's alive, too. Mr. Snookie Ookums, let me introduce you to Mr. Jim Dandy, a stick of candy.
#SNOOKUMS.
Would he mind if I'd take a bite out of his leg?
#JIM DANDY.
You bet he would. I'm alive now.
#WISHING MAN.
And here comes Teddy Bear and Jimmy Bear. They're alive, too. And look at the Baby Elephant.
