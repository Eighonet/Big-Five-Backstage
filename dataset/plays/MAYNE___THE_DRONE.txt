#KATE.
That one's stale. It would break your teeth to eat it. And the mice have nibbled that one. And there's another as bad.
#BROWN.
Well! Well! Pigs get fat and men get lean in this house.
#KATE.
It's you again, is it? And what are you looking now?
#BROWN.
I'm looking a spanner for the boss. The feedboard to the threshing machine got jammed just when halfway through the first stack, and he is in a lamentable temper.
#KATE.
Is he?
#BROWN.
And he's been grumbling all morning about the way things is going on in this house. Bread and things wasted and destroyed altogether.
#KATE.
Well, it's all Miss Mary's fault. I told her about this bread yesterday forenoon, and she never took any heed to me.
#BROWN.
Miss Mary? What does a slip of a girl like that know about housekeeping and her not home a half - year yet from the boarding - school in the big town, and with no mother nor nobody to train her. I don't see that spanner at all. Did you see it, Kate?
#KATE.
No. I've more to do than look for spanners.
#BROWN.
It's a nice house, right enough. And I suppose old Mr. Dan is never up yet. I was told by Johnny McAndless, he was terribly full last night at McArn's publichouse and talking - ach - the greatest blethers about this new invention of his.
#KATE.
Do you say so?
#BROWN.
Aye. No wonder he's taking a lie this morning. He's not in his wee workshop?
#KATE.
No. Miss Mary is just after taking up his breakfast to him.
#BROWN.
Some people get living easy in this world. Well divil a spanner can I see. I'll tell the master that.
#MARY.
Who was that?
#KATE.
It's the servant man looking for a spanner for your father, Miss Mary. There's something gone wrong with the threshing machine.
#MARY.
I do believe sometimes that Uncle Dan's a lazy man.
#KATE.
And is it only now you're after finding that out! Sure the whole countryside knowed it this years and years.
#MARY.
The whole countryside has no business to talk about what doesn't concern it.
#KATE.
Oh, well, people are bound to talk, Miss.
#MARY.
But then Uncle Dan is awfully clever. He's got the whole brains of the Murrays, so father says, and then, besides that, he is a grand talker.
#KATE.
Aye. He can talk plenty. Sure Sarah McMinn, that lives up the Cut, says its a shame the way he's going on this twenty years and more, never doing a hand's turn from morning to night, and she says she wonders your poor father stands him and his nonsense.
#MARY.
Who said that?
#KATE.
Sarah McMinn told Johnny McAndless that yesterday.
#MARY.
Sarah McMinn? Pooh! That hard, mean, old thing. No. I believe in Uncle Dan and so does father. He'll make a name for himself yet.
#KATE.
Well, it's getting near time he done it.
#MARY.
And that Sarah McMinn they say just keeps her brother in starvation, and she just says nasty things like that about Uncle Dan because he doesn't like her.
#KATE.
Aye. He never did like people as seen through him, not but she is a mean old skin - a - louse. He's up, Miss.
#MARY.
Are you up, uncle?
#DANIEL.
Yes. Did the Whig come yet?
#MARY.
Yes. I put it in your workshop.
#DANIEL.
Bless my heart, it's half - past one!
#MARY.
It is, indeed, uncle.
#DANIEL.
Well! Well! Time goes round, Mary. Time goes round. Where's your father?
#MARY.
He's out working with Sam Brown at the threshing all morning since seven o'clock.
#DANIEL.
Well! Well! A very industrious man is John Murray. Very. But lacking in brains, my dear - lacking in brains. Kind, good - hearted, easy - going, but - ah! well, one can't help these things. Where did you say the Whig was, Mary?
#MARY.
It's in your workshop.
#MARY.
You were very late coming in last night, uncle.
#DANIEL.
Eh?
#MARY.
I heard you coming in, and the clock was just after striking two.
#DANIEL.
Well - I met a few friends last night. Appreciative friends I could talk to, and I was explaining that new idea of mine that I've been working at so long - that new idea for a fan - bellows. It's a great thing. Oh yes. It should be. I sat up quite a while last night, thinking it over, and I believe I've got more ideas about it - better ones.
#MARY.
Do you think you'll make money off it, uncle?
#DANIEL.
Mary - if it comes off - if I can get someone to take it up, I believe 'twill make our fortune, I do.
#MARY.
Oh, uncle, it would be lovely if you did, and I would just die to see that nasty McMinn woman's face when she hears about you making such a hit.
#DANIEL.
McMinn? Has that woman been sneering about me again? That's one woman, Mary, I can't stand. I can never do myself justice explaining ideas in company when that woman is present.
#MARY.
Never mind her, uncle. Do you mind the time last time, uncle, when you went up to Belfast for a week to see about that patent for - what's this the patent was, uncle?
#DANIEL.
Last time? Aye? Why?
#MARY.
Yes. Don't you remember you said you knew of an awfully nice boy that you met, and you were going to bring him down here.
#DANIEL.
Upon my soul, I had clean forgotten. Yes, yes. I think I did say something about a young fellow I met.
#MARY.
Was he nice, uncle?
#DANIEL.
Eh? I think so. Oh. He was - very nice chap.
#MARY.
Well, you said he was coming here to see me, and he never turned up yet.
#DANIEL.
Did I? Very possibly. I suppose he must have forgotten.
#MARY.
I'm sick of the boys here. There's only Alick McCready that's anyway passable. When will you see him again, uncle?
#DANIEL.
Well - possibly, when I go up to town again. Very soon, perhaps. That is if your father, Mary, can spare the money.
#MARY.
I don't know, uncle. You see that would be five times now, and somehow you never seem to get anything done. That's what he said, mind you, uncle.
#DANIEL.
Well! Well! To think of me toiling and moiling away in that workshop of mine, day after day, and week after week, and year after year - and there's all the thanks you get for it.
#MARY.
Uncle?
#DANIEL.
Well?
#MARY.
Look, if you went up to Belfast again soon, won't you see that boy? I wonder what he's like. Is he dark or fair?
#DANIEL.
Yes, yes. I think so.
#MARY.
Dark?
#DANIEL.
Yes. I believe he is dark.
#MARY.
And tall?
#DANIEL.
Very tall.
#MARY.
Oh, how nice! And uncle, is he good - looking?
#DANIEL.
Very. Fine looking fellow.
#MARY.
That's grand; and uncle, is he well to do?
#DANIEL.
He has every appearance of it.
#MARY.
Oh you dear old uncle! But maybe he wouldn't look at me when he has a whole lot of town girls to go with.
#DANIEL.
My dear niece, you don't know what a very good - looking young lady you are, and besides he saw your photograph.
#MARY.
Which photograph?
#DANIEL.
Which photograph? Your own of course!
#MARY.
The one I got taken at Lurgan?
#DANIEL.
Yes. I think so.
#MARY.
Oh uncle! That horrid thing! Why didn't you show him the one I got taken at Newcastle?
#DANIEL.
My mistake. Very sorry, indeed, Mary, I assure you. But I tell you what, I'll take the album with me next time. Will that do?
#MARY.
There. Now you're only joking. What do you do all the time you stay in Belfast, uncle?
#DANIEL.
Um - um - Business, my dear girl, business. See engineers and all that sort of thing, and talk things over. It takes time, you know, Mary, time.
#MARY.
You've been an awful long time inventing, uncle, haven't you?
#DANIEL.
Well, you know, Mary dear - time - it takes time. You can't rush an inventor.
#MARY.
Well look, uncle. You know I can just wheedle father round my wee finger, can't I?
#DANIEL.
You can indeed.
#MARY.
Well, look: if you promise to bring down this boy you are talking about, I'll get father to give you enough to have two weeks in Belfast. There. It's a bargain.
#DANIEL.
Um - well - he may not be there you know.
#MARY.
O uncle!
#DANIEL.
You see he travels a lot and he may be away. He may be in London. In fact I think - yes. He said he would be going to London.
#MARY.
Then why not go to London?
#DANIEL.
Eh? I never thought of that! But no. Your father, Mary. He would never give me the money. No.
#MARY.
But you're more likely to meet people there who'd take it up, aren't you, uncle?
#DANIEL.
It's the place for an inventor to go, Mary. The place. But I'm afraid when John hears about it -
#MARY.
Well, look here, uncle. Do you mind the last time when he would not give you money to go up to Belfast about your patent.
#DANIEL.
I do.
#MARY.
You remember you got a letter a few days after asking you to come up at once and you had to go then. Hadn't you?
#DANIEL.
I had.
#MARY.
Well, couldn't we do the same this time?
#DANIEL.
Eh?
#MARY.
Couldn't we get someone to send a letter. Oh, the very thing! You know that silly Alick McCready that comes running after me. Well, look, I'll get him to send a letter.
#DANIEL.
No good, my dear. I did it before - I mean letters on plain notepaper don't carry much weight. No.
#MARY.
What about - oh, I know! Uncle, a telegram!
#DANIEL.
Great idea! It is in soul!
#MARY.
And we'll put something on it like "come to London at once to see about the patent," or something like that. And he'd have to let you go then.
#DANIEL.
Mary, you're really a cleverer girl than your father thinks. Two weeks in London.
#MARY.
And don't forget the nice boy, uncle, when you go.
#DANIEL.
I'll do my best to get hold of him.
#MARY.
No. I want a good definite promise. Promise, uncle.
#DANIEL.
Well, really you know, my dear, he -
#MARY.
Uncle, promise.
#DANIEL.
Um - well, I promise.
#MARY.
You're a dear old thing. You see, uncle, I don't want to marry Alick McCready or Jim McDowell or any of those boys, unless there's nobody else.
#DANIEL.
Quite right, my dear, quite right. Two weeks in London. Splendid! But it's time I was going into my workshop. I must really try and do something this morning.
#MARY.
You won't forget, uncle? Will you?
#DANIEL.
No, certainly not.
#MARY.
I do hope uncle brings that nice boy. Dark - tall - well set up - well to do.
#KATE.
Well? What notion have you got now?
#MARY.
Oh! just think, Kate! How would you like a boy who was dark and tall, and well set up and well to do?
#KATE.
I'd just leap at him.
#MARY.
Agh! I don't think he'll ever come, Kate!
#KATE.
I think you've plenty on hand to manage. You're back again, are you?
#BROWN.
Aye.
#KATE.
What ails you now?
#BROWN.
I'm looking the spanner.
#MARY.
The spanner?
#BROWN.
The spanner, Miss Mary. It's for turning the nuts like.
#KATE.
Have you never got it yet?
#BROWN.
Do you think I've got eyes in the back of my head? Underneath the seat, beside the salt - box, on the right near the wee crock in the left hand corner.
#KATE.
Will you get out of that, ignorance. It's not there.
#BROWN.
Maybe its in the parlour?
#MARY.
Well, I'll take a look round.
#BROWN.
Did you hear the news?
#KATE.
No. What?
#BROWN.
Ach! You women never know anything.
#KATE.
What's the news? Somebody killed?
#BROWN.
No. More serious.
#KATE.
God bless me! What is it?
#BROWN.
Andy McMinn has a sister.
#KATE.
Ach!
#BROWN.
And she's trying to get a man.
#KATE.
Well. I knowed that this years.
#BROWN.
And Mr. John Murray is a widow man.
#KATE.
You mean to be telling me that Mr. John has a notion of that old thing? Go long with you!
#BROWN.
Did you ever hear tell of a widow man that never got married again.
#KATE.
Plenty. Don't come in here talking blethers.
#BROWN.
Whist. There's more in what I'm telling you than you think. And I'll hold you to a shilling that Sarah McMinn will be Mrs. John Murray before one month.
#KATE.
Who told you?
#BROWN.
Ach. You've no more head than a yellow yorling. Where has Mr. John been going to these wheen of nights?
#KATE.
Andy McMinns!
#BROWN.
Aye. Do you think it is to see old Andy? And sure he's been talking to me all morning about the way the house is being kept. No hand to save the waste; bread and things destroyed; hens laying away; eggs ate up by the dozen and chickens lost and one thing and another. And hinting about what money a good saving woman would bring him. And Mr. Daniel -
#KATE.
Sh - he's in there working.
#BROWN.
Working? Ah, God save us! Him working! The last man that seen Mr. Dan working is in his grave this twenty years. I'll just peep in at him through the keyhole.
#ALICK.
Well! Well! Some people earn their money easy!
#BROWN.
Aye. In soul. Just look in there to see it.
#DANIEL.
What's the matter?
#ALICK.
Ah. I was just laughing at a wee joke, Mr. Murray.
#DANIEL.
It must have been very funny.
#ALICK.
Aye. It was. I say. Were you at McArn's publichouse last night?
#DANIEL.
Well, just a minute or two. Why?
#ALICK.
There was someone there told Andy McMinn this morning, I believe, that you'd been talking of a great invention altogether, and he was that much curious to see it that him and his sister Sarah are coming over this day to have a look at it.
#DANIEL.
Who? Sarah McMinn?
#ALICK.
Aye. She's very anxious to see it, I believe.
#DANIEL.
Um. Rather awkward this. She's not a woman that, plainly speaking, I care very much to talk about my ideas to.
#ALICK.
But have you got something struck out?
#DANIEL.
McCready, come here. It is really a great idea. Splendid. But I've a great deal of trouble over it. In fact I've been thinking out details of a particular gear all morning.
#ALICK.
Aye.
#DANIEL.
You were always an ignorant hound anyway and be d - d to you.
#ALICK.
Ah, Mr. Murray, I beg your pardon. It's another thing altogether I'm thinking about. I just wanted a talk with you this morning. You have a nice wee girl for a niece, Mr. Murray.
#DANIEL.
Well?
#ALICK.
And I was wondering if you could put in a good word for me now and again with her.
#DANIEL.
Now, look here, Alick. We can all work nice and comfortably together, can't we?
#ALICK.
Aye.
#DANIEL.
Well, if you behave yourself like a man with some manners, and not like an ignorant clodhopper, I can do a great deal for you.
#ALICK.
Thank you, sir. You know, Mr. Murray, I have as nice a wee farm, and as good stock on it as well, as any man in the county, and if I'm lucky enough to get that niece of yours, you'll always be welcome to come and pass a day or two and have a chat.
#DANIEL.
I think you and I will get along all right, Alick. There's one or two little things I need badly sometimes in this house. I mean I want help often, you know, Alick, to carry my points with John; points about going to see people and that sort of thing, and it's really very hard to manage John on points like that, unless we resort to certain means to convince him they are absolutely necessary.
#ALICK.
Yes. I sort of follow you.
#DANIEL.
You know what I mean. John's a little dense, you know. He can't see the point of an argument very well unless you sort of knock him down with it. Now, if a thing is fair and reasonable, and a man is so dense that he can't see it, you are quite justified - at least, I take it so - to manufacture a way - it doesn't matter how - so long as you make that dense man accept the thing, whatever it is, as right. Do you follow me?
#ALICK.
I'm just beginning to see a kind of way.
#MARY.
I can't see that thing anywhere. Oh Alick! You here!
#ALICK.
Yes. It's a nice morning, and you're looking beautiful!
#MARY.
Oh, bother. Oh, I say! uncle! You remember? Uncle!
#DANIEL.
Eh?
#MARY.
Telegram to come to London.
#DANIEL.
Ah - Oh, yes, yes.
#MARY.
Let's go into your workshop and tell Alick what we want. Come on.
#ALICK.
I'll do anything in the world you want.
#JOHN GALE.
There. There you are, you stupid - looking, good for nothing, dunder - headed, Italian idiot you.
#BROWN.
You're something terrible cross this morning.
#JOHN GALE.
Is it any wonder? Away out at once now and put her to rights and quick about it. The like of servant men nowadays, I never seen in my mortal days. A concern of ignorant bauchles, every one of them.
#DANIEL.
Good morning John.
#JOHN GALE.
Morning.
#DANIEL.
John, what do you think, I believe I have just come on to a great idea about -
#JOHN GALE.
Ach! You and your great ideas! Here you've been blundering and blethering and talking these fifteen years and more, and I've never seen anything come of them yet.
#DANIEL.
I know, John, I know. But I'm handicapped you know. Bad place to work in and all the rest of it: but you've been kind to me, John. Keeping a brother and helping him after he has lost all his money isn't a common thing with many men, but John a day will come sometime, and you'll get it all back. Every penny. Aye, and twice over.
#JOHN GALE.
Thank you, Daniel.
#DANIEL.
You will, John, you will. But don't cast up things like that about the time I've been. It hurts me. A thing like this takes time to mature, you know, John. The great and chief thing for an inventor is time. Look at Palissy, the great French potter, who found out how to make porcelain glaze. Why he worked for years and years at his invention. And there was the man who found out how to make steam drive engines. Look at the years those men spent - and no one begrudged them.
#JOHN GALE.
I suppose that now.
#DANIEL.
Certainly, John, nothing surer. And look at the fortunes those men made. But the great difficulty is trying to get someone to take up your patent. You see these men had the eyes of the world fixed on them. People knew all about them, and had their hands stretched out ready to grab what they invented. I - I'm just a poor unknown man struggling in a wee dark corner.
#JOHN GALE.
Never mind, Danny. You'll make the name of the Murray's known yet, maybe.
#DANIEL.
I'll do my best, John. But mind you it would take me to be pushing on this thing that I have found out and bringing it before people to notice. You see I've got it all ready now except for a few small details.
#JOHN GALE.
Have you now? I would like you sometime to explain it to me, Daniel. I didn't quite get on to it the last time you were telling me about it.
#DANIEL.
Some time again. Oh yes. But John - I'll have to go to some of the towns soon to see people about it. The bigger the town the better the chance, and John - London's the place.
#JOHN GALE.
London! In all the name of the world, yon place! Would Belfast not do you?
#DANIEL.
No. I don't like Belfast. They're a mangy, stick - in - the - mud, follow - in - the - old - ruts crowd. Never strike out anything new. It's a case of London or nothing.
#JOHN GALE.
It will be a terrible expense this London visiting.
#DANIEL.
It'll be worth it.
#JOHN GALE.
Now, Danny, I would like to oblige you, but what do you think it would cost me?
#DANIEL.
Well, I could live cheap you know, John, and do without meals an odd day, and go steerage and third class, and that sort of thing. I would say about fifteen pounds roughly. That would let me stay more than a week.
#JOHN GALE.
Fifteen pounds! God bless me, Daniel, would you break me? No, no, I couldn't afford to give you that much.
#DANIEL.
Maybe ten would do it. I could sleep out under the arches an odd night or two, and -
#JOHN GALE.
No, no. I'll not have that. A Murray aye had a bed to go to and a sup to eat. Here, I'll give you three pounds and you can go to Belfast.
#DANIEL.
I don't care much about Belfast. You know I have been there five times now, and I have never got anyone to look into the thing at all proper.
#JOHN GALE.
You're too backward, Daniel, when it comes to the like of that. But ten pounds! No, I would like you to get on in the world right enough, Daniel, but I couldn't afford it. You know the way this house is being kept; it's lamentable. Tea and sugar and flour and things. Man, I'm just after paying off ten pounds to the McAfees for one thing and another, and it only a running account for two months. If I had a good housekeeper now, maybe things would alter for the better.
#MARY.
O Uncle Dan! He says he'll go at once and get it -
#ALICK.
How are you, Mr. Murray?
#JOHN GALE.
O! bravely. What's the news with you?
#ALICK.
I was just looking over some of them ideas of Daniel's, about the new fan bellows.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. Now what do you think of it?
#ALICK.
They're great altogether.
#JOHN GALE.
Do you think there will be any sale for it at all?
#ALICK.
I think so. I believe there would be indeed.
#JOHN GALE.
Man, I wish I had the head of some of you young fellows to understand the working of them machinery and things. I've the worst head in the world for understanding about them sort of things. There's Daniel, a great head on him, Daniel.
#ALICK.
He has, right enough!
#JOHN GALE.
One of the best. When he was a wee fellow, dang the one could beat him at making boats or drawing pictures, or explaining extraordinary things to you. None. Not one. A great head on him, Daniel. He'll do something yet.
#ALICK.
Did you know Andy McMinn's for coming over to see you this day, Mr. Murray?
#JOHN GALE.
This day? When? Are you sure?
#ALICK.
Aye, so he said. About two o'clock or so. Someone told him about Daniel's great new idea, and he's very curious to hear about it.
#MARY.
He's always poking his nose into people's business.
#JOHN GALE.
Whist. Andy McMinn's a very decent man. Tell me , was Sarah to come with him?
#MARY.
O holy prophets! I hope not.
#ALICK.
Aye. She's coming too. She wanted to see it as well as Andy.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. Certainly, and she's welcome too. Mary, you can get the house ready, and the table set, and a nice tea for them when they come, and I can go and get tidied up a wee bit.
#ALICK.
You're as nice a wee girl as ever I -
#MARY.
You're an awful fool. Hurry, Alick, like a decent man and get that telegram sent.
#ALICK.
That uncle of yours, Mary, heth he's as canny a keoghboy as I've seen. Its the queer tears he'll be taking to himself in London if I know anything.
#MARY.
Hold your tongue. You've no business to talk about Uncle Dan that way. He could give you tons as far as brains go anyway.
#ALICK.
I believe that. I say, Mary. What name will I put on that telegram? "Come to London at once about patent. Intend purchasing." Hadn't we better have a name?
#MARY.
Yes. I'll just ask uncle. Uncle!
#DANIEL.
Yes.
#MARY.
What name will we put to that telegram?
#DANIEL.
Oh, it's not particular. Wilson or Smith, or Brown, or Gregg.
#ALICK.
I'll put Gregg on it.
#DANIEL.
Do well.
#ALICK.
Did you see the fluster that your father got into, Mary, when he heard that Sarah McMinn was coming over?
#MARY.
What?
#ALICK..
Did you not see how he rushed off to tidy himself up when he heard Sarah McMinn was coming over?
#MARY.
Nonsense. Father wouldn't think of that woman.
#ALICK.
All right. But I think I know something more than you.
#MARY.
What? Tell me.
#ALICK.
Come on and leave me down the loaning a pace, and I'll tell you.
#MARY.
Oh, I can't. Those people are coming over, and that McMinn woman will be looking at everything and telling you how to do things in front of father, and all the rest of it.
#ALICK.
Leave me down the loaning a pace till I tell you the news.
#MARY.
No.
#ALICK.
Come on.
#MARY.
No.
#JOHN GALE.
Daniel! Daniel!
#DANIEL.
Well!
#JOHN GALE.
Tidy yourself up a wee bit, man, Andy McMinn and Sarah's coming over to see you.
#DANIEL.
Me?
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. They want to see about the new invention. You can have the collar I wore last Sunday, and put on your new coat that you got in Belfast. I wonder what tie would be the better one? Yon green or the red one that Mary gave me last Christmas. Aye. D - n! Is he making no shapes to dress himself. Daniel!
#DANIEL.
Aye.
#JOHN GALE.
Daniel!
#DANIEL.
Well!
#JOHN GALE.
Come on and get on you.
#DANIEL.
Ach. This is always the way. Just when a man has got the whole thing worked out and the plans of the apparatus just on the point of completion he has to stop.
#JOHN GALE.
Never mind, Danny. You can do it again the night or the morrow morning. I want you to look decent. Come on and get on you.
#DANIEL.
Who did you say was coming?
#JOHN GALE.
Andy and Sarah McMinn.
#DANIEL.
McMinn. Mc - Surely to God he hasn't a notion of that woman? John! John!
#JOHN GALE.
Hurry up, man.
#DANIEL.
John. Tell me, John. You haven't - you're not going to - you haven't a notion of that woman?
#JOHN GALE.
Well, Daniel, you see the house needs some one to look after it proper, and I thought - well - maybe - that Sarah would be just as nice and saving a woman as I could get, but I thought I would keep it a bit secret, don't you know, because I don't know yet if she'd have me or not. And she could talk to you better nor I could about machinery and things that would interest you, for she has an agency for sewing machines, and knows something about that sort of thing, and you'd get on great with each other. Now, hurry and get on you.
#DANIEL.
If - if she'd have him! O great God! If that woman comes to this house, I - I'm a ruined man.
#KATE.
I suppose they'll be wanting jam and sugar for the tea - aye - and some of them scones Miss Mary cooked yesterday, not but you couldn't eat them, and a pat or two of butter. Now, that's a nice girl for you! Here's company coming till the house and tea and things a wanting, and she goes and leaves all to go strolling down the loaning with that fool of a McCready.
#KATE.
Well?
#BROWN.
Well, yourself?
#KATE.
Do you see any sign of them McMinns yet?
#BROWN.
Aye. I see the trap coming over the Cattle Hill. There was three in it, as far as I could make out.
#KATE.
Who be to be the third party I wonder? Is it their servant man?
#BROWN.
Do you think old Andy McMinn's servant man gets leave to drive them about of an afternoon like the clergy's? Talk sense, woman.
#KATE.
Maybe it's yon Scotch body I heard was stopping with them.
#BROWN.
Aye. Yon Mackenzie. Ach, man, but yon creature would scunder you.
#KATE.
Aye.
#BROWN.
Ach! Cracking jokes and laughing that hearty at them, and I'm danged if a bat with one eye shut could make out what he was laughing at. Here they are. I hear the wheels coming up the loaning. I'll have to go and put up the horse for them I suppose.
#KATE.
I wonder if the master seen them coming. I better tell him.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. What's the matter?
#KATE.
They're just come, sir.
#JOHN GALE.
Are they? Is my tie right, Kate? And my clothes - is there any dirt on the back of them?
#KATE.
You'll do grand. I never seen you looking better.
#JOHN GALE.
Where's Mary? Why isn't she here?
#KATE.
She went out about something. She'll be back in a minute.
#JOHN GALE.
Right enough, it would do her all the good in the world to have a sensible woman looking after her. She just gets her own way a deal too much in this house. Aye. Here they are! Tell Daniel to hurry. Sarah's looking bravely. Man, that woman could save me thirty, aye forty, pounds a year if she was here. Ach! Is Daniel never ready yet? Daniel! Daniel!
#DANIEL.
Aye.
#JOHN GALE.
Hurry, man. They've come.
#DANIEL.
Ach!
#JOHN GALE.
Yous are all welcome. Every one of you. You Andy and Sarah, and Mr. Mackenzie. The Scotch is aye welcome, Mr. Mackenzie.
#MACKENZIE.
Aye. That's what I said the last time I was in Ballyannis, and was verra thirsty, and went into a beer - shop to get a dram - Black and White it was. Verra guid.
#SARAH.
We brought Mr. Mackenzie along with us to see your brother, John. You see he's an engineer and knows a good deal about machinery and plans and things.
#MACKENZIE.
Aye. There's not much about machinery that I dinna ken, Mr. Murray, from a forty thousand horse power quadruple expansion doon to a freewheel bicycle. I hae done spells work at all of them, you ken.
#ANDY.
I suppose Daniel's at home. Is he?
#JOHN GALE.
Daniel? Oh aye, Daniel's at home. He's just tidying himself up a wee bit. wee bit paint and powder gangs a lang gait to make up defects, as you ken yourself, Miss McMinn. That's a guid one.
#ANDY.
He's up out of bed then?
#JOHN GALE.
Oh aye. He sits up late of nights working out things. That's his workshop.
#MACKENZIE.
He works then?
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. He works in there.
#MACKENZIE.
Because it doesna follow always, as I have discovered in my experience, that because a man has a workshop, he works.
#ANDY.
There's nothing much to see in this place except a lot of dirty papers.
#JOHN GALE.
That's the plans of the bellows he's working at.
#MACKENZIE.
Come out, Mr. McMinn, till I examine. Eh. This is the plan of the great bellows.
#ANDY.
Is he making much headway with it, John?
#JOHN GALE.
Indeed, now, I think he's doing bravely at it. He's keeping very close at it this day or two.
#ANDY.
There's a terrible amount of newspapers lying in there. Has he no other plans and drawings except what's there?
#JOHN GALE.
Oh aye. He has plenty of plans and drawings somewhere, for I seen them once or twice.
#MACKENZIE.
I can't say much about that contrivance. And, I say. Look here. He does more than draw bellows. He draws corks as well.
#JOHN GALE.
Ah, well. He's not a great transgressor either in the matter of a bottle. No, no.
#ANDY.
And the smell of smoke in the place!
#SARAH.
John, I think Daniel smokes far too much.
#ANDY.
He should be dressed by now.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. Oh, aye. He should right enough. He's a wee bit backward before women, you know, Sarah. Daniel! Daniel!
#DANIEL.
Yes.
#JOHN GALE.
Why didn't you come long ago. What kept you?
#DANIEL.
Your collar. How do you do, Andy and Sarah? You're very welcome.
#ANDY.
This is a friend of ours, Daniel, that happened to be stopping with us last summer at Newcastle in the same house, and he came over for his holidays to us this time. We brought him over to see you. They calls him Mackenzie.
#DANIEL.
How do you do?
#MACKENZIE.
I'm glad to see you at last, Mr. Murray, for I've heard a good deal about you.
#SARAH.
You see, Daniel, Mr. Mackenzie is an engineer in one of the great Scotch engineering yards. What place was it you were in, Mr. Mackenzie?
#MACKENZIE.
I served six years in the engine and fitting shops with Messrs. Ferguson, Hartie & Macpherson, and was two years shop foreman afterwards to Dennison, McLachlan & Co., and now I'm senior partner with the firm of Stephenson & Mackenzie. If ever you're up in Greenock direction, and want to see how we do it, just ask for Donal Mackenzie, and they'll show you the place. We're the sole makers of the Mackenzie piston, if ever you heard of it.
#DANIEL.
I'm sorry to say I haven't.
#MACKENZIE.
And you call yourself an engineer and you don't know about Donal Mackenzie's patent reciprocating piston.
#JOHN GALE.
You see we be a bit out of the world here, Mr. Mackenzie.
#DANIEL.
Yes. Now that's one point. One great point that always tells against me. It really needs a man to be continually visiting the great engineering centres - Greenock, London -
#MACKENZIE.
London's not an engineering centre - Glasgow, Hartlepool, Newcastle -
#DANIEL.
Well, all those places. He could keep himself posted up in all the newest ideas then, and inventions.
#MACKENZIE.
But a man can keep himself to the fore if he reads the technical journals and follows their articles. What technical papers do you get? Do you ever get the Scottish Engineers' Monthly Handbook, price sixpence monthly? I'm the writer on the inventors' column. My articles are signed Fergus McLachlan. Perhaps you've read them?
#DANIEL.
I think - um - I'm not quite sure that I have.
#MACKENZIE.
You remember one I wrote on the new compressed air drills last July?
#DANIEL.
I don't think I do.
#JOHN GALE.
No. We don't get them sort of papers. I did buy one or two like them for Daniel, but he told me he would just as soon have the Whig, for there was just as much information in it.
#MACKENZIE.
O spirit of Burns! Just as much information - well, so much for that. Now, about this new patent, this new fan bellows that I hear you're working at, Mr. Murray.
#DANIEL.
What about it?
#ANDY.
We both seen the drawings in there, Daniel, but I don't think either of us made much of it. Could you not explain it to him, Daniel. Give him an idea what you mean to do with it.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. Now's your chance, Daniel. You were talking of some difficulty or other. Maybe this gentleman could help you with it.
#DANIEL.
Well. There's no great hurry. A little later on in the evening. I'm thinking about Miss McMinn. I don't think this conversation would be very interesting to her.
#SARAH.
Oh, indeed now, Mr. Murray, I just love to know about it. A good fan bellows would be the great thing for yon fireplace of ours, Andy.
#ANDY.
Aye. Soul, it would that.
#DANIEL.
No. Not just yet, John. A bit later on. I'm shy, John, you know. A bit backward before company.
#JOHN GALE.
You're a man to talk about going to see people in London.
#SARAH.
What? Was he going to London?
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. He was talking about going to London, and I was half - minded to let him go.
#ANDY.
Boys, that would cost a wheen of pounds!
#MACKENZIE.
Who wull you go to see in London?
#DANIEL.
Oh - engineers and patent agents and people that would take an interest in that sort of thing.
#MACKENZIE.
Have you anyone to go to in particular?
#DANIEL.
Oh, yes.
#SARAH.
It will cost a great deal of money, Daniel. Seven or eight pounds anyway. Won't it, Mr. Mackenzie?
#MACKENZIE.
It would, and more.
#JOHN GALE.
Man, that's a saving woman. She can count the pounds. Daniel, away out and show Andy and Mr. Mackenzie the thresher, and get used to the company, and then you can come in and explain the thing to them. I want Sarah to stay here and help me to make the tea. That fool of a Mary is away again somewhere.
#ANDY.
Aye. Come on, Daniel, and explain it to us. I hear there's a new kind of feedboard on her.
#MACKENZIE.
How is she driven, Mr. Murray?
#DANIEL.
How is she what?
#MACKENZIE.
How is she worked - steam, horse, or water power, which?
#JOHN GALE.
Go on out and you can show them, Daniel. He's backward, you know, Sarah, oh, aye - backward; but a great head. A great head on him, Daniel.
#SARAH.
I suppose he is clever in his way.
#JOHN GALE.
Ah, boys, Sarah, I mind when he went to serve his time with McArthurs, of Ballygrainey, he was as clever a boy as come out of the ten townlands. And then he set up for himself, you know, and lost all, and then he come here. He's doing his best, poor creature, till pay me for what kindness I showed him, by trying to invent things that he says would maybe pay off, some time or other, all he owes to me.
#SARAH.
Poor Daniel! And he lost all his money?
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. Every ha'penny; and he took a hundred pounds off me as well. And now, poor soul, he hasn't a shilling, barring an odd pound or two I give him once or twice a month.
#SARAH.
Well! Well! And he's been a long time this way?
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. I suppose it's coming on now to twenty years.
#SARAH.
It's a wonder he wouldn't make some shapes to try and get a situation somewhere.
#JOHN GALE.
Ach, well, you know, when Annie, the wife, died and left Mary a wee bit of a wain, I was lonesome, and Daniel was always a right heartsome fellow, and I never asked him about going when he came here.
#SARAH.
He must be rather an expense to you. Pocket money for tobacco, and whenever he goes out a night to McArn's, its a treat all round to who is in at the time. And his clothes and boots, and let alone that, his going to see people about patents and things up to Belfast three or four times in the year. If he was in a situation and doing for himself, you could save a bit of money.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. Heth and I never thought much of that, Sarah. I could right enough. I'll think over that now. You weren't at Ballyannis School fête, Sarah?
#SARAH.
No. But I heard you were there. Why?
#JOHN GALE.
I was expecting to see you.
#SARAH.
I don't believe in young girls going to them things.
#JOHN GALE.
But God bless me, they wouldn't call you young! I missed you. Man, I was looking for you all roads.
#SARAH.
I'm not a fool sort of young girl that you can just pass an idle hour or two with, John Murray, mind that.
#JOHN GALE.
I never thought that of you, Sarah.
#SARAH.
Some people think that.
#JOHN GALE.
No.
#SARAH.
They do. There's Andy just after warning me this morning about making a fool of myself.
#JOHN GALE.
But you never done that, Sarah.
#SARAH.
Well, he was just after giving me advice about going round flirting with Tom, Dick and Harry.
#JOHN GALE.
Ah no. You never done that. Sure I knowed you this years and years, and you never had a boy to my knowing.
#SARAH.
Well I had, plenty. Only I just wouldn't take them. I refused more than three offers in my time.
#JOHN GALE.
Well! Well! And you wouldn't have them!
#SARAH.
No.
#JOHN GALE.
Why now?
#SARAH.
Well - I liked somebody else better.
#JOHN GALE.
Did he - the somebody - did he never ask you?
#SARAH.
He might yet, maybe.
#JOHN GALE.
I wonder would it be any use then me asking her.
#SARAH.
And I'm beginning to think he is a long time thinking about it.
#JOHN GALE.
Ach! Who's that?
#BROWN.
Me, sir. Mr. Dan wants to know could you not come out a minute, and show the gentlemen what way you can stop the feedboard working.
#JOHN GALE.
Don't you know yourself, you stupid headed lump you. Away back at once. That's them servant men for you. He knowed rightly what way it worked, only he was just curious. He's a stupid creature, anyway.
#SARAH.
I think all men is stupid. They never see things at all.
#JOHN GALE.
Now, Sarah, sure women are just as bad. There's Mary. She's bright enough someways, but others - ach -
#SARAH.
Mary needs someone - a woman - to look after her. Somebody that knows how to manage a house and save money. She's lost running about here. Now, I had a young girl with me once was a wild useless thing when she came, and when she left me six months after, there wasn't a better trained, nor as meek a child in the whole country.
#JOHN GALE.
And you can manage a house, Sarah, and well, too. Can't you?
#SARAH.
I ran the house for Andy there twenty years and more, and I never once had to ask him for a pound. And what's more, I put some into the bank every quarter.
#JOHN GALE.
Did you now?
#SARAH.
Yes. And I cleared five pounds on butter last half year.
#JOHN GALE.
Did you?
#SARAH.
And made a profit of ten pounds on eggs alone this year already.
#JOHN GALE.
Sarah, will you marry me?
#SARAH.
Oh, John, this is very sudden. I will. I will. Will you tell them when they come in?
#JOHN GALE.
Well, I would rather you waited a few days, and then we could let them know, canny, don't you know, Sarah. Break the news soft, so to speak. Eh?
#SARAH.
Well, if you want it particular that way I -
#JOHN GALE.
Aye, I'd rather you did.
#MARY.
I peeped through the window and I thought, perhaps, it would be better to knock first. It's a nice evening Miss McMinn. Where's Uncle Dan? I want to see him.
#JOHN GALE.
He'll be in soon enough. He's out showing Andy and Mackenzie the thresher.
#MARY.
Uncle Dan! What does he know about - Mr. Mackenzie?
#SARAH.
Yes. He's a gentleman, a friend of ours, engaged in the engineering business, who has a large place of his own in Scotland, and we brought him over here to see your Uncle Dan about the invention he's working at.
#JOHN GALE.
You stop here, Mary, with Sarah, and get the tea ready. You should have been in the house when company was coming. Where were you?
#MARY.
Oh, just down the loaning.
#JOHN GALE.
Who with?
#MARY.
Alick McCready.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. You're gay fond of tralloping about with the boys.
#SARAH.
He's not just the sort of young man I would like to see in your company, Mary.
#MARY.
It's none of your business whose company I was in.
#JOHN GALE.
Now, Mary, remember your manners in front of your elders, and mind you must always show Miss McMinn particular respect. Particular respect. And you can show Sarah what you have in the house, and do what she bids you. Them's my orders.
#SARAH.
I wonder a girl like you has no more sense than to go gallivanting about at this time of day with boys, making talk for the whole country side.
#MARY.
I don't have to run after them to other people's houses anyway.
#SARAH.
And that is no way to be leaving down your hat. Is that your Sunday one?
#MARY.
Just find out for yourself.
#SARAH.
Now, you should take and put it away carefully. There's no need to waste money that way, wearing things out.
#MARY.
Do you know it's my hat? Not yours. And I can do what I like with it. I can tramp on it if I want to.
#SARAH.
Oh, well, tramp away. It's no wonder your father complained of waste and this sort of conduct going on.
#MARY.
Have you got the tea things ready, Kate?
#KATE.
Yes, Miss.
#MARY.
I suppose we better wet the tea.
#SARAH.
Have you the kettle on?
#MARY.
Can't you see for yourself it's not on.
#SARAH.
Here, girl , fill the kettle and put it on. Where's the tea till I show you how to measure?
#MARY.
Kate, get Miss McMinn the tea cannister till she shows you how to measure.
#SARAH.
But it's you I want to show. There now - pay particular attention to this. One spoonful for your father and uncle, one for my brother and Mr. Mackenzie, one for yourself and me, and half - a - one for Kate.
#MARY.
Do you see that, Kate?
#KATE.
Yes, Miss.
#MARY.
Now the next thing, I suppose, is to weigh out the sugar.
#SARAH.
No. You always ask the company first do they take sugar before you pour out the tea.
#MARY.
No; not in good society. You put it on the saucers.
#SARAH.
Put some in the bowl, Kate, and never heed her.
#MARY.
You've no business to say that, Kate! Who's your mistress here?
#KATE.
You, Miss.
#MARY.
Then do what I tell you. Put on the tablecloth, and lay the cups and saucers, and make everything ready, and take no orders except from me.
#SARAH.
Very well. I'll learn her manners when I come to this house. I want to see the china.
#MARY.
Well, go into the next room and look for it.
#SARAH.
You better mind what your father told you.
#MARY.
You nasty old thing. Uncle Dan. Wasn't it good of Alick? He went away to Ballyannis Post Office to get that telegram sent. very decent fellow, Alick. Very obliging.
#MARY.
Do you know, uncle, when he went off to send that telegram I was nearly calling him back. I don't care so very much now whether I see that boy you were telling me about or not. Is he - do you think, uncle - is he much nicer than Alick?
#DANIEL.
Nicer? Well, of course we have all our opinions on these things you know, Mary, but Alick - well, after all there's many a worse fellow than Alick, isn't there? Ah, yes.
#MARY.
Uncle! Do you know what has happened? I heard father proposing to Miss McMinn!
#DANIEL.
Oh my! I knew it would happen! I knew it would happen! When? Where?
#MARY.
In here. I wanted to slip in quietly after leaving Alick down the loaning when I overheard the voices. It was father and Miss McMinn. She was telling him how she had saved five pounds on butter last half year, and ten pounds on eggs this year, and then father asked her to marry him. I knocked at the door out of divilment, and she just pitched herself at him. I - I'm not going to stay in the house with that woman. I'd sooner marry Alick McCready.
#DANIEL.
I would myself. I daren't - I couldn't face the look of that woman in the mornings.
#MARY.
It's all right for you to talk, uncle. You'll be working away at your inventions, and that sort of thing, and will have nothing much to do with her, but I'd be under her thumb all the time. And I hate her, and I know she hates me. And then the way father talks about her being such a fine housekeeper, and about the waste that goes on in this house, it nearly makes me cry, just because I have been a bit careless maybe. But I could manage a house every bit as well as she could, and I'd show father that if I only got another chance. Couldn't I uncle?
#DANIEL.
And far better, Mary. Far better.
#MARY.
And you could do far more at your invention if you only got a chance. Couldn't you, uncle?
#DANIEL.
No doubt about it, Mary. None. I never got much of a chance here.
#MARY.
I wonder could we both try to get another chance. Uncle!
#DANIEL.
Well?
#MARY.
Aren't you going to explain that fan bellows thing you've been working at to them when they come in? Well, look. That Scotchman - he understands things like that, and that's just the reason why that nasty woman brought him over. Just to trip you and show you up, and she thinks she'll make father see through you. But just you rise to the occasion and astonish them. Eh, uncle?
#DANIEL.
Um - well, I don't know. That Scotchman's rather a dense sort of fellow. Very hard to get on with somehow.
#MARY.
Now, Uncle Dan, it's our last chance. Let us beat that woman somehow or other.
#DANIEL.
It's all very well, Mary, to talk that way. I wonder is there a book on machinery in the house?
#MARY.
Machinery? Let me think. Yes, I do believe KATE was reading some book yesterday about things, and there was something about machinery in it.
#DANIEL.
For Heaven's sake, Mary, get it.
#MARY.
Kate! Are you there, Kate? Where's that book you were reading last night, Kate?
#KATE.
For dear's sake, Miss! Yon dirty old thing? The one with the big talk between the old fellow and the son about everything in the world you could think of?
#MARY.
Yes, yes. Uncle Dan wants it.
#DANIEL.
"The Child's Educator. A series of conversations between Charles and his father regarding the natural philosophy, as revealed to us, by the Very Reverend Ezekiel Johnston."
#KATE.
Aye. Just go on till you see Mr. Dan. Its the queerest conversation between an old lad and his son ever you heard tell of.
#DANIEL.
Ah! "The simple forms of machines. The lever, the wedge, the inclined plane - Father - and here we come to further consider the application of this principle, my dear Charles, to what is known as the differential wheel and axle. Um Charles - Father - Charles. Father." No good, my dear. Out of date.
#KATE.
She's going into all the cupboards and drawers, and looking at everything. I never seen such a woman.
#MARY.
Just keep an eye on her, Kate, and see she doesn't take anything.
#DANIEL.
I might get something out of this. Atmosphere. Pressure.
#MARY.
Uncle Dan. Uncle Dan, I'm going down the loaning a pace. Alick said he might be back, and I think -
#DANIEL.
Charles. And now my dear father, after discussing in such clear and lucid terms the use of the barometer, and how it is constructed, could you tell me or explain the meaning of the word "pneumatic."
#MARY.
Good luck, Uncle Danny. I'm away.
#DANIEL.
There's not much here about bellows. I wish I had made up this subject a little better.
#KATE.
The divil take her and them remarks of hers. Who gave her the right to go searching that way, I wonder? Where's the silver kept, and was it locked, and how many spoons was there, and why weren't they better polished; and part of the china broke.
#SARAH.
Where do you keep the knives and forks?
#KATE.
You don't want forks for the tea.
#SARAH.
I want to count them. Kate Oh, God save us! You'd think there was a pross on the house!
#MACKENZIE.
And it was a great idea, you know. The steam passed through the condenser, and the exhaust was never open to the atmosphere.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. The exhaust!
#MACKENZIE.
Aye. The exhaust. But now I'm verra anxious to hear your brother explaining what he's made out about the bellows. Its the small things like that you ken that a man makes a fortune of, not the big ones.
#JOHN GALE.
Do you think that now?
#MACKENZIE.
You know I take a particular interest in bellows myself. I tried my hand a good while working out a new kind of bellows, and I flatter myself that I know something about the subject.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. Where's Daniel? Daniel! Are you there, Daniel? You could maybe bring them plans out you're working at and explain it to them now, Daniel. Eh? And wait, Sarah wants to hear it too. Are you there, Sarah?
#DANIEL.
Aye. She's in there somewhere taking stock.
#JOHN GALE.
Are you there, dear? Daniel's going to explain the thing to us, and you wanted to hear about it. Didn't you?
#SARAH.
I'm just dying to know all about it. You know, Mr. Daniel, that's one thing we want very bad in our house - a good fan bellows.
#DANIEL.
They are very useful, very.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. They are that. He has a good head on him, Daniel. Eh? Now go on and make it very plain so that every one can follow you. Bring out the plans and show us.
#DANIEL.
I can explain it better without them. Well, I suppose this subject of bellows would come under the heading of pneumatics in natural philosophy.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, now, don't be going off that way. Could you not make it plainer nor that?
#DANIEL.
Well. Could I be much plainer, Mr. Mackenzie?
#MACKENZIE.
I'm here to discuss fan bellows, not pneumatics.
#DANIEL.
D - n him. Well. Then I suppose the first thing is - well - to know what is a bellows.
#ANDY.
Aye. Man, Daniel, you start off just the same as the clergy. That's the way they always goes on expounding things to you.
#SARAH.
Don't be interrupting, Andy.
#MACKENZIE.
Well, I think everyone here knows what a bellows is.
#DANIEL.
Everyone here? Do you, John?
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. I would like, Daniel, to hear right what a bellows is. I mean I can see the thing blowing up a fire when you use it, any man could see that - but its the workings of it. What's the arrangements and internal works of the bellows now, Daniel?
#DANIEL.
Well, you push the handles together in an ordinary bellows and - and the air - blows out. Now, why does it blow out?
#JOHN GALE.
Because it's pushed out of course. There's no sense in asking that sort of a question.
#DANIEL.
Well, there's a flap on the bellows - a thing that moves up and down. Well, that flap has all to do with pushing the air.
#JOHN GALE.
Maybe this scientifican business is uninteresting to you, Sarah, is it?
#DANIEL.
I'm sure it is. Perhaps we better stop.
#SARAH.
Oh, not at all. I want to hear more.
#MACKENZIE.
You're wasting a lot of my time, Mr. Murray. I came here to hear about a fan bellows.
#DANIEL.
Oh, yes. Yes. Certainly. Fan bellows. There's a difference between a fan bellows and an ordinary bellows.
#MARY.
Oh, Uncle Dan, are you explaining it to them. Did I miss much of it?
#MACKENZIE.
I don't think it matters much what time you come in during this.
#JOHN GALE.
Go on, Daniel.
#DANIEL.
It's very hard for me to go on with these constant interruptions. Well, I was just saying there was a difference between a fan bellows and an ordinary bellows.
#MACKENZIE.
Now, what is a fan bellows yourself, Mr. Murray?
#DANIEL.
A fan bellows? Ah. Why now is it called a fan bellows?
#MACKENZIE.
Don't be asking me my own questions.
#DANIEL.
Well, now we will take it for granted it is because there must be something of the nature of a fan about a fan bellows. It is because there are fans inside the casing. And the handle being turned causes these - eh - fans to turn round too. And then the air comes out with a rush.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. It must be the fans that pushes it out.
#DANIEL.
Exactly. Well, now, the difficulty we find here is -
#ANDY.
Aye.
#JOHN GALE.
Go on, Daniel.
#DANIEL.
You want a constant draught blowing. That's number one. Then - well - the other. You see, if we took some of these fans.
#MACKENZIE.
Yes.
#DANIEL.
And put them in a tight - fitting case, and put more of them inside, and understood exactly what their size was, we could arrange for the way that -
#JOHN GALE.
I can only follow Daniel a short way too. Put them in a tight - fitting case -
#BROWN.
A telegram for Mr. Daniel.
#DANIEL.
Ah! "Come to London at once to explain patent. Want to purchase. Gregg."
#MACKENZIE.
Who? Gregg?
#DANIEL.
I suppose I better go, John?
#JOHN GALE.
Let's see the telegram.
#MACKENZIE.
If you go to London, it'll take you to explain yourself a bit better, Mr. Murray.
#JOHN GALE.
That will mean how many pounds, Daniel, did you say?
#DANIEL.
Fifteen, John.
#MACKENZIE.
Who is Gregg?
#DANIEL.
Gregg? Ah. He's a man lives in London. Engineer.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, I suppose you -
#MARY.
Tea's ready.
#SARAH.
We didn't hear all about the bellows.
#ANDY.
No, nor you never will.
#MACKENZIE.
Any more, Mr. Murray?
#DANIEL.
I refuse to discuss the matter any further in public.
#MACKENZIE.
Do you know what it is, Mr. Murray? Your brother's nothing short of an impostor.
#JOHN GALE.
Don't dare to say that of a Murray.
#MACKENZIE.
Well, I'm going for some tea.
#SARAH.
John, I've something to say to you again about Daniel, but the company's waiting.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye.
#MARY.
Are you not coming, father?
#JOHN GALE.
Aye.
#MARY.
Father! Surely you aren't going to marry that woman?
#JOHN GALE.
Don't talk of Sarah that ways. I am!
#MARY.
Well, if you are, I'm going to say yes to Alick McCready. I don't want to yet awhile, but I'm not going to stay on here if that nasty woman comes. Oh, father, if you only give me another chance, I could show you I could keep house every bit as well as that woman. Give me another chance, father. Don't marry her at all. Let me stay with you - won't you?
#JOHN GALE.
You're too late. She's trothed to me now.
#MARY.
Pooh. I'd think nothing of that. Uncle Dan! What's the matter?
#DANIEL.
Mary, I can't eat and sit beside that Scotchman.
#JOHN GALE.
What are you doing, Daniel?
#DANIEL.
Just making a few preparations.
#JOHN GALE.
Ah, but look here. I haven't settled about London yet, Daniel.
#DANIEL.
Oh, London, John. Let that pass. I won't worry you about that. I'm leaving your house, John.
#JOHN GALE.
What?
#DANIEL.
You've been kind, John. Very kind. We always pulled well together, and never had much cross words with one another, but - well, circumstances are altered now.
#JOHN GALE.
You mean because I'm going to marry Sarah.
#DANIEL.
Exactly. That puts an end to our long and pleasant sojourn here together. I'll have to go.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh easy, Daniel. Ah, now, Sarah always liked you. She thinks a deal of you, and I'm sure she'd miss you out of the house as much as myself.
#DANIEL.
John, I know better. She wants me out of this, and I would only be a source of unhappiness. I wouldn't like to cause you sorrow. She doesn't believe in me. She brought that Scotchman over to try and show me up. You all think he did. You think I mugged the thing. You don't believe in me now yourself.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. Well - to tell you the truth, Daniel, you did not make much of a hand at explaining, you -
#DANIEL.
I thought so. Look here. One word. Do you think Mackenzie invented that patent reciprocating piston that he's so proud of?
#JOHN GALE.
What?
#DANIEL.
Well. I know something about that. He stole it off another man, and took all the profits. I knew that. Do you think I'm going to give away the product of my brains explaining it to a man like that! No fear, John. I'm taking details of my bellows, and my coat, and a few socks, and the pound you gave me yesterday, and I'm going to face the world alone.
#JOHN GALE.
No, no. You'll not leave me, Daniel. Ah, no. I never meant that.
#DANIEL.
If she's coming here I'll have to go, and may as well now.
#SARAH.
John Murray!
#DANIEL.
I'm going to get that other coat you gave me. It's better than this one for seeing people in.
#SARAH.
Hurry up, John. The company's waiting on you, and I don't know what's keeping you. Unless it was that brother of yours, more shame to him.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. Daniel kept me. He's talking of leaving. You wouldn't have that, Sarah, would you?
#SARAH.
Leaving, is he? And a right good riddance say I. What has he done but ate up all your substance.
#JOHN GALE.
You wouldn't put him out, Sarah?
#SARAH.
I just wouldn't have him about the place. An idle, good for nothing, useless, old pull a cork.
#JOHN GALE.
Do you not like him, Sarah? You told me you thought a good deal of him before.
#SARAH.
Aye. Until I seen through him. Him and his letters and telegrams. Just look at that. It comes from Ballyannis.
#JOHN GALE.
I don't understand that.
#SARAH.
He just put up some one to send it. Young McCready or someone. You couldn't watch a man like that. No. If I come here, out he goes. You expects me to come and save you money and the like of that old bauchle eating up the profits. Come into your tea at once.
#JOHN GALE.
By me sang he was right.
#DANIEL.
I'll say good - bye, John. Maybe I'll never see you again.
#JOHN GALE.
Ach. Take your time. I don't see the sense of this hurrying. Stop a week or two, man. I'll be lonesome without you. We had many a good crack in the evenings, Daniel.
#DANIEL.
We had, John. And I suppose now that you'll be married I'll have to go, but many a time I'll be sitting lonely and thinking of them.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. You were always the best of company, and heartsome. You were, Daniel.
#DANIEL.
Well, I did my best, John, to keep - to keep up a good heart.
#JOHN GALE.
You did. I wouldn't like to lose you, Daniel. But Daniel. This telegram. It comes from Ballyannis.
#DANIEL.
Ballyannis? Ballyannis? Ah, of course. Sure Gregg, that London man, he was to go through Ballyannis to - day. He's on a visit, you know, somewhere this way. It's him I'm going to look for now.
#JOHN GALE.
Was that the way of it? And she was for making you out an impostor and for putting you out. I didn't like them talking of a Murray the way they done.
#DANIEL.
Are you engaged to that McMinn woman, John?
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. I spoke the word the day.
#DANIEL.
Was there anybody there when you asked her?
#JOHN GALE.
There was no one.
#DANIEL.
Did you write her letters?
#JOHN GALE.
No. Not a line.
#DANIEL.
And did you visit and court much at the home?
#JOHN GALE.
No. I always seen Andy on business and stopped to have a word or two with her.
#DANIEL.
Then, John, John, it's not too late yet. Give me - ah, give wee Mary another chance.
#SARAH.
Come in, John, at once. Your tea's cold waiting, and it's no way to entertain company that.
#JOHN GALE.
D - n her. Daniel! Out of this home you will not go. I'd rather have your crack of a winter night as two hundred pounds in the bank and yon woman. I'll break the match.
#BROWN.
Miss Mary! Are you there, Miss Mary?
#KATE.
Hi there. Stop that shouting. D'ye want to wake the dead?
#BROWN.
I want to give these letters to Miss Mary. Where is she?
#KATE.
Who're they for? Let's look at them.
#BROWN.
Not for you anyway. Miss Mary.
#KATE.
Ach quit deaving me with your shouting.
#MARY.
What's the matter? Oh! Letters! Any for me, Sam?
#BROWN.
Aye. There's a post card for you, Miss Mary, and a registered letter for Mr. John. The posty says he'll call on the road back for the account when you sign it. It's like the MCMINN writing that. Isn't Mr. Dan to be home to - day from Belfast, Miss Mary?
#MARY.
Eh?
#BROWN.
Isn't Mr. Dan expected home to - day from Belfast?
#MARY.
Yes.
#BROWN.
I wonder did he get the bellows sold? There was great talking about him last night in McArn's. Some said he had sold it and made a fortune. Post cards is interesting things. Picture post cards is.
#KATE.
Here. Away out and get them purtas dug for the dinner. We're tired hearing your gabble.
#BROWN.
The master was complaining again to me yesterday evening about the dinner he got. There's no mistake he likes his meat like myself, and right enough it was bad yesterday. I was chowing haws all evening to keep off the hunger.
#KATE.
Go on you out of this.
#BROWN.
That's all the news this morning.
#MARY.
I can't understand this post card. What does that mean? "How's the uncle?" It's some cheeky person anyway - "from D.M." Who could that be?
#KATE.
It's not McCready, Miss, is it?
#MARY.
No. That's not his writing.
#KATE.
Och, Miss Mary! Do you see the picture of the Highland man dancing, and under it - "A Mackenzie Clansman." It's thon Scotch fellow sent it.
#MARY.
Just like the way he would do. I met him again one night we were over at the doctor's, and he was trying to make up to me all he was able.
#KATE.
Aye. Any word from Mr. Dan about the boy he was to bring you?
#MARY.
No. I'm not going to bother any more about boys, I'm going to keep house from this on properly. But Uncle Dan said something in his last letter about a great surprise he had for all of us.
#KATE.
Surprise enough it will be, and he lands home with a ha'penny in his pocket. The last time he come home he borrowed a shilling of me and niver paid me back yet. Did he sell the plans of the bellows, Miss?
#MARY.
He didn't say. Father, there's a letter for you. A registered one too.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. So Brown was telling me. Maybe its from thon McAlenan fellow that owes me two pound for the heifer.
#MARY.
What's the matter, father?
#JOHN GALE.
Nothing, child. Nothing. Well I'm - She's a caution.
#MARY.
Father. Tell me. Is it from the McMinns?
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. I knowed she'd do it. I knowed she'd do it.
#MARY.
What?
#JOHN GALE.
Sarah's taking an action against me.
#MARY.
An action?
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. For a thousand pounds.
#MARY.
A thousand pounds!
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. Now the fat's in the fire. She says I promised to marry her and broke it off. At least, it's Andy that writes the letter, but it's her that put him up to it. I know that too well. "To Mr. John Murray. Dear Sir, - You have acted to my sister in a most ungentlemanly way, and done her much wrong, and I have put the case intil the hands of Mr. McAllen, the solicitor, who will bring it forward at the coming Assizes. If you wish, however, to avoid a scandal, we are oped to settle the matter by private arrangement for one thousand pounds. Yours truly, Andrew McMinn."
#MARY.
That's awful, father, isn't it?
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. It's a terrible mess, right enough.
#MARY.
Sure she wouldn't get a thousand off you, father?
#KATE.
There's John McArdle up by Slaney Cross got a hundred pounds took off him by wee Miss Black, the school teacher.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. Heth now, I just call that to mind. And he never got courting her at all, I believe.
#KATE.
It just served him right. He was always a great man for having five or six girls running after him.
#JOHN GALE.
And she hadn't much of a case against him.
#KATE.
The school children were standing by when he asked her in a joking sort of way would she marry him, and the court took their evidence.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. Men are always terrible hard on other men where women are concerned.
#KATE.
And a good job it is, or half the girls would be at the church waiting, and the groom lying at home rueing his bargain.
#MARY.
Father, has she a good case against you?
#JOHN GALE.
No. I don't think it.
#MARY.
Don't worry so much then, father.
#JOHN GALE.
It's the jury I'm so frightened of. They all come from the mountainy district at this Assizes, and there's not a man of them but wouldn't put a knife in me, the way I get beating them down in price at the fairs.
#MARY.
I don't think they'd give her fifty pounds when they see her. It's only good looking girls would get big sums like a thousand pounds.
#JOHN GALE.
It's all very well, Mary, but she could dress herself to look nice enough, the same Sarah, if she liked.
#MARY.
She could not, indeed.
#JOHN GALE.
They say, at least Brown was hinting to me, that its yon Scotch fellow, Mackenzie, has put up the McMinns to this business. He and that connection are as thick as thieves.
#MARY.
He mightn't be so very fond of them. When a man sends post cards to a girl he doesn't know very well, he's got a wee bit of a liking for her.
#JOHN GALE.
What are you talking about? I never sent her any post cards.
#MARY.
Father, what are you going to do?
#JOHN GALE.
I'm d - d if I know.
#MARY.
Will you defend the case?
#JOHN GALE.
I don't want to go near the court at all.
#MARY.
Father! Father! Sure you wouldn't - you couldn't think of marrying her after all that row that happened? Wouldn't you rather lose a thousand pounds and keep me, father? Wouldn't you, father.
#JOHN GALE.
Ah! Heaven save us, what kind of bread's that?
#MARY.
Father! Ah please, please, don't marry her anyway. Sure you won't?
#BROWN.
Here's Mr. Dan coming up the loaning, sir, that grand looking you'd hardly know him, and a big cigar in his mouth.
#JOHN GALE.
Daniel back?
#MARY.
Oh, I must go out and meet him.
#JOHN GALE.
Had he his luggage with him?
#BROWN.
Aye. He has yon big portmanteau of his, and a parcel of something or other.
#JOHN GALE.
Away out and help him then, can't you? I wonder what kept him in Belfast all this time. I suppose he's spent most of the five pounds I gave him. Like enough. I never mind him coming back yet with a ha'penny on him. A thousand pounds! And there never was a breach of promise case known where they didn't bring in a verdict for the woman. Never!
#DANIEL.
Home again, John.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. It was near time, I think.
#DANIEL.
Saw quite a number of people this time, John. A great number. They were all very much interested. Fine town, Belfast. Growing very rapidly. Wonderful place.
#MARY.
What's in the parcel?
#DANIEL.
Ah, that - that't the great secret. Mum's the word. All in good time, Mary.
#BROWN.
Will I leave your bag here, Mr. Dan?
#DANIEL.
Yes. Here's a sixpence for you.
#JOHN GALE.
You're brave and free - handed with your money. Giving the like of that bauchle sixpence. The Lord knows but we will be wanting every ha'penny we can scrape together, and soon enough.
#MARY.
I didn't tell Uncle Dan yet, father.
#DANIEL.
Has anything happened?
#MARY.
Yes. Sarah McMinn has -
#JOHN GALE.
Read that letter, Daniel.
#DANIEL.
Um.
#JOHN GALE.
Well? What do you think of that?
#DANIEL.
Keep up a stout heart, John. You're safe enough.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, heth, I'm not so sure of that. Sure you never heard tell of a jury yet that didn't give damages against the defendant in a breach of promise case. Did you now?
#DANIEL.
Tuts, man. She has no case.
#JOHN GALE.
Case or no case it doesn't seem to matter. What sort of case had Jennie Black against John McArdle, of Slaney Cross? None. What sort of case had Maggie McAndless against old William Boyd? None at all. I was at both of them trials and says to Pat McAleenan - "the girl has no case at all!" But for all that they brought in a verdict for one hundred pounds against McArdle, and they put two hundred against old Boyd, and nearly broke the two of them.
#DANIEL.
It's very awkward this.
#JOHN GALE.
Did you do anything, Daniel about the bellows?
#DANIEL.
The bellows? Aye. A good deal, John. It's all there. But it's all not quite settled yet. A day or two more and you'll see. If all goes well I'll have a great surprise for you in a day or two.
#JOHN GALE.
Ach! I suppose you spent every ha'penny of the money, too, that I gave you?
#DANIEL.
John. Another surprise for you! Those people I met and went to, put me up very cheap for the week. Very cheap. Therees one pound ten and sixpence for you.
#JOHN GALE.
What?
#DANIEL.
I'll keep the pound to do me to the end of the month and not ask you for any more, John, after that. That is if - well - That thing there is all right.
#JOHN GALE.
Daniel. I'm sorry, but there's an account of some thirty shillings I owe the McArdles, and I want to pay it the night. So if you don't mind -
#DANIEL.
Well, I suppose it can't be helped, John. But it leaves me just with nothing. However, there you are.
#JOHN GALE.
What ails you anyway?
#BROWN.
If you please sir, the posty wants the account signed for that letter.
#MARY.
Oh, I forgot all about that. I'll sign it for you, father. And I'll give it to him myself.
#JOHN GALE.
It's a serious business, this, about the McMinns.
#DANIEL.
You're all right, man. Wait a day or two. Take my advice. Do nothing in a hurry. Sit down and think it over the way I do when I'm working out a new idea. Don't rush things. It will all come right in the end. Just you wait and see if it doesn't.
#JOHN GALE.
Would it not be better to settle before going into the court? You know I couldn't stand being pointed out to of a Sunday morning and one and another talking - "There's the man that Sarah McMinn took the breach of promise case against." No, I couldn't stand that at all. It would be a disgrace to the Murrays for ever. I'm wondering now -
#DANIEL.
John. Surely you wouldn't - you couldn't think of going back on what you said to me. Would you?
#JOHN GALE.
I wonder, Daniel, would you mind so much after all if I married her?
#DANIEL.
I couldn't stand it. No, John, I couldn't stay. Any other woman but that McMinn.
#MARY.
Come on in, Alick.
#ALICK.
Good morning, Mr. Murray. How are you, Mr. Dan? So you are back again? We're all glad to have you back.
#DANIEL.
Thank you, Alick.
#MARY.
Father. Alick says he heard Andy McMinn talking yesterday to some one at McArdle's shop, and he was telling them all about the whole business, and blaming it all on Uncle Dan.
#JOHN GALE.
And so the people are talking of me already? Now that I come to think of it, it was your Uncle Dan, and a brave ha'penny it's going to cost me. One thousand pounds.
#ALICK.
Never mind, Mr. Murray. Maybe Uncle Dan will do something yet. What about the bellows?
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. Here, Daniel. I'll make a bargain with you. I'll leave you to the settling of the case, and you can find the money yourself to pay for it if you want to. And if you can't find the money, I'll marry her.
#MARY.
Father, surely -
#JOHN GALE.
What? That's enough about it. I would as soon do without the marrying if I could. I don't want the woman at all, but I'll marry her before she gets a ha'penny off me. So you can settle it among yourselves. You can take charge of that letter, Dan, and make the best you can of it.
#DANIEL.
This is a nice mess you put me in for, Alick. What the divil made you mention the bellows?
#ALICK.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dan. I wasn't thinking.
#DANIEL.
The sooner you start and think a bit the better. If you don't help to settle the case - well - I've a good deal of influence with somebody.
#ALICK.
I'll do my best, Mr. Dan, to help you.
#MARY.
What will we do, Uncle Dan?
#DANIEL.
I suppose you've no money, Alick?
#ALICK.
Well, I haven't much ready money, Mr. Dan, but I could lend you up to twenty pounds at a pinch.
#MARY.
Twenty pounds would hardly be enough. Would it, uncle?
#ALICK.
Better get hold of Andy and ask him.
#DANIEL.
I don't like going near that woman at all.
#MARY.
Alick! Could you not slip over and ask Andy to come across? You know what the McMinns are like. He'd come over for a shilling if he thought he'd get one. Ah, yes. You will, Alick. Won't you?
#ALICK.
I'll go straight across now if you - if you -
#MARY.
What?
#ALICK.
If you'd leave us along the road a bit.
#DANIEL.
Aye. Do. Mary. Leave him down to the gate anyway. I want to stay here and think over things a wee bit. That't the good wee girl. I'm afraid, Dan Murray, it's all U. P. this time. I'm afraid it is. Unless - unless - well - I wonder now if I -
#KATE.
There. Put it down there. You didn't know we wanted that much, did you not? You're getting as big an old liar as Mr. -
#BROWN.
Aye. Go on. As who do you say, woman?
#KATE.
Just as big an old liar as Andy McMinn.
#BROWN.
Now, whist. The McMinns were aye decent folk. They're near people, and all that sort of thing, but once they say a thing they stick to it.
#KATE.
They're a lot of mean scrubs, the whole caboosh of them.
#DANIEL.
I wonder would twenty pounds be any use at all?
#BROWN.
I believe that once Sarah puts a price on a thing, like a pig or a sow, or a hen, the divil himself couldn't beat her down in the price of it. And Andy, they say, can beat the best dealer in the county from here to the Mourne. It's the fine cigar that you were smoking, Mr. Daniel, this morning.
#DANIEL.
Cigar? Yes. Yes.
#BROWN.
Aye. A fine cigar, sir. There was a grand smell off it. I seen you coming up by the McMinns, sir, this morning on the road from the station.
#DANIEL.
Yes. On the road from the station.
#BROWN.
You didn't see them, but I noticed Andy and Sarah coming out to the gate when you had passed them and looking after you a long time.
#DANIEL.
Is that so?
#BROWN.
Aye. A long time, sir. I suppose, like myself, they smelled the cigar. Mr. Andy, they say, is guy fond of a good cigar, and I understand that he'll be for getting a few boxes of them soon, for the sister, they say, is coming into a lot of money.
#KATE.
Ach, you and your cigars! Will you get out of this and quit tormenting people? Go on. Out you go.
#DANIEL.
He's a very impertinent man that. Very worrisome.
#KATE.
Ach, never heed him, Mr. Dan! sure no one in this house does. You'll be tired after travelling, sir. Will I make you a drop of tea?
#DANIEL.
It's hard to eat anything, Kate, when I'm worried. I don't think there's another man living that has the same worries as I have. Something awful! Where's the pen and ink, I wonder?
#KATE.
There's some here on the dresser, Miss Mary was using it to - day. Cheer up, Mr. Daniel. Sure you sold the plans of the bellows anyway. Didn't you, sir? They had word up at the McAleenans the other night that you got two thousand for it.
#DANIEL.
Eh? They said that.
#KATE.
Aye. To be sure. McAndless told McArdle, and he told Smith the postman, and the postman told the McAleenans, and said he had seen letters about it. And McAleenan was up in McMinns the other night and told them, and I believe you never saw such an astonished crowd of people in all their lives.
#DANIEL.
He told the McMinns that?
#KATE.
Aye, last night I think it was.
#DANIEL.
Last night? Yesterday was the 14th, wasn't it? Aye. It was. I wonder did they believe McAleenan?
#KATE.
I don't think they know right what to make of it. And yon Scotchman was there at the time, and mind you, Mr. Dan, they say he looked quite serious when he heard it, and said such things as that happened many's a time.
#DANIEL.
Mackenzie said that?
#KATE.
Aye. You know, I think it's maybe because he has a wee notion of Miss Mary, sir.
#DANIEL.
It's quite possible. Quite possible. A nice wee girl is Mary. Fact, too good for the half of the clodhoppers about these parts.
#KATE.
Poor creature. I'm feared he's for the road again if he doesn't worry out some way for himself. And God knows he's the one best fitted for it. Well, did you see him off comfortably?
#MARY.
Who?
#KATE.
Alick McCready.
#MARY.
Kate. I with you'd mind your own business.
#KATE.
It's a sore time I have in this house minding my own and every other bodies' business.
#MARY.
Kate. He said I couldn't bake a cake to save my life. I'll just show him that I can, and you're not to help me, mind you. I'm going to do it all myself.
#MARY.
Where's the flour?
#KATE.
There's none in the house, Miss Mary.
#MARY.
What?
#KATE.
You mind it was all used up this morning on account of them cakes that nearly killed your poor ould da.
#MARY.
Go down to McArdles, Kate, and get a quarter stone on account.
#KATE.
Your da told me this morning, Miss Mary, that I wasn't to get any more from McArdles or any other place unless he gives me an order for it. Do you not mind?
#MARY.
So he did. I had forgotten.
#KATE.
Aye. Quite so, Miss.
#MARY.
I wonder is Uncle Dan about?
#KATE.
Aye. He's in his workshop, Miss.
#MARY.
Uncle Dan!
#DANIEL.
Well, Mary?
#MARY.
Uncle Dan, could you give me sixpence?
#DANIEL.
Sixpence? Sixpence, Mary? Bless your wee heart. Here. Here's a two shilling bit. But Mary, mum's the word. Don't tell John I gave it to you.
#MARY.
No. Thank you, uncle. There, Kate, quick as you can and don't stop to talk to anybody. Sure you won't?
#KATE.
I'm not dirty looking - am I, Miss Mary?
#MARY.
No. You'll do grand. Flour, currants.
#KATE.
Ach! You and your currants. Could you not tell a body was her face clean?
#MARY.
It's lovely. Hurry, Kate. Flour, currants - raisins - He's actually got something to work. He has, indeed. Uncle Danny! Ha! Ha! Uncle Danny! Uncle Dan's a wonderful man! Uncle Dan's a wonderful man!
#DANIEL.
What's all this?
#MARY.
I'm a cleverer girl than you think, Uncle Dan! I know your great surprise. I've found it out. And you've actually got it to work! That's splendid, uncle, isn't it? Father will be awful proud when he hears about it. And you did it all yourself, uncle?
#DANIEL.
Well, I took those plans, Mary, to a handy chap, an acquaintance of mine, and he made it out according to my design. I'm not sure - I think it works all right.
#MARY.
And did you get it sold, uncle?
#DANIEL.
No, Mary, but I have hopes - great hopes.
#MARY.
Do you think you'd get more than one thousand pounds for it?
#DANIEL.
Don't know, Mary. Don't know. Very hard to know these things. Where could that screw driver be I wonder?
#MARY.
I think I saw father working with it last at something in the parlour. Will I get it for you, Uncle Dan?
#DANIEL.
No. Never mind, Mary. I'll get it myself. There's someone at the door. You better open the door, Mary. Come in.
#MACKENZIE.
Fine afternoon, Miss Murray.
#MARY.
Good day to you.
#MACKENZIE.
I'm going off to Scotland verra soon, and I thought I would call over to see you before I went off. You're no angry, are you?
#MARY.
No.
#MACKENZIE.
Did you get a post card?
#MARY.
I got some silly thing this morning that I tore up.
#MACKENZIE.
I'm sorry. I'm verra fond of you, Mary.
#MARY.
Miss Murray, please. girl like you is lost here, you know. Now, if you were a Scotch lassie you would have a great time enjoying yourself. In a place like Greenock we have a theatre, and we have a music hall and a cinematograph show on Saturdays and trains to Glasgow. You could have a grand time in Scotland.
#MARY.
Do you really like me, Mr. Mackenzie?
#MACKENZIE.
Verra much. Indeed I -
#MARY.
Well. Look here. I would like you very, very much too, if you -
#MACKENZIE.
If I what, bonnie Mary?
#MARY.
I'd even let you call me Mary, and write to me if you wanted to, if you would do me a favour.
#MACKENZIE.
What's the favour?
#MARY.
Uncle Dan has brought home his fan bellows, and it works.
#MACKENZIE.
The fan bellows! I think he'll never make much of a fortune of his fan bellows.
#MARY.
Do you ever examine new inventions?
#MACKENZIE.
Aye. I'm a specialist on that, you know. I'm the writer of the inventions column in the Scottish -
#MARY.
Yes. Yes. That's all right. I know. Are all the inventions you write about good things?
#MACKENZIE.
Eh? Ninety - nine per cent. rotten, lassie. Ninety - nine per cent. perfectly rotten. People don't invent a reciprocating piston that works every day in the week, or a fan bellows either.
#MARY.
But if you liked the inventor you could do him a good turn all the same?
#MACKENZIE.
Aye. I did that often.
#MARY.
Then could you do a good turn for Uncle Dan?
#MACKENZIE.
Give the bellows a boost up. No, Mary. I could nae. I don't like to grieve you, but committing perjury - No. I couldn't do it, Mary.
#MARY.
Yes. You would. You'd do it for me. Won't you?
#MACKENZIE.
Eh?
#MARY.
Look. Uncle Dan has his new fan bellows in that workshop. Go in and look at it, and if you do like me really, you could tell the McMinns that it was good - even if it wasn't quite perfect.
#MACKENZIE.
Um. I'll consider the question.
#MARY.
Uncle Dan! Mr. Mackenzie's going to examine your bellows.
#DANIEL.
I don't allow everybody to go and look at it. No. I refuse. It's my property and no one else's.
#MARY.
Uncle Dan. Mr. Mackenzie has promised to give his opinion on it.
#DANIEL.
It's not protected yet by patent.
#MACKENZIE.
Andy McMinn is coming over, Mr. Murray. He has got orders from his sister to settle the case for her. Are you going to pay the money?
#DANIEL.
That is a matter of my own deciding.
#MACKENZIE.
Verra well. I may go. I would have done you that good turn, Miss Murray; but there's no enmity between us. And - I hope you get the best of the McMinns in the bargain. Don't give in, Mr. Murray, easy. Take my tip. I'm from the stables, you know.
#MARY.
Here's Andy now , and Alick's with him.
#DANIEL.
Good afternoon, Andy.
#ANDY.
Good afternoon. I suppose you know I've power to settle the case.
#DANIEL.
Well, you wrote the letter, and so, in point of law, I think it is you who should look after all this unfortunate business. Believe me, Andy, I sympathise with you. I do indeed. I have your letter here. Yes. One thousand pounds. Do you not think that a trifle high?
#ANDY.
Well. You know we could have as easily claimed two thousand, but we didn't like to break you altogether; so we just said that a thousand would come pretty near it.
#MACKENZIE.
Mr. Daniel, may I look at the bellows?
#MARY.
Uncle Dan, I'm sure you won't object.
#DANIEL.
Yes. Yes. I'll thrash out the matter here with Andy. A thousand pounds is impossible. Absolutely out of the question.
#ALICK.
Ach. She only torments me.
#DANIEL.
Eh? People behave strangely sometimes, Andy. Very strangely. Just a moment, Andy. What about a wee drink. Eh, Andy?
#ANDY.
Aye. Well, I wouldn't mind at all, Daniel.
#DANIEL.
Just to show there's no ill - feeling over this unfortunate business. Good health, Andy.
#ANDY.
Good health, Daniel.
#DANIEL.
Now to go on with our business. I don't think, in the first case, that this was an affaire de coeur, as the Frenchmen say.
#ANDY.
Eh?
#DANIEL.
You don't understand French? Of course not. No. It wasn't a love affair, I mean. I don't think Sarah was in love with John, was she?
#ANDY.
Well - indeed, now, I don't know that she was.
#DANIEL.
No. We're all aware of that. He was just what we'd call a likely man. That's all.
#ANDY.
Aye. He would have been a good match for her.
#DANIEL.
Yes. Quite so, Andy. He would have been a good match for her. Nothing like notes, Andy. Now, so much for the love part of the business. They never exchanged letters?
#ANDY.
No. No letters.
#DANIEL.
No letters. Of course in a breach of promise letters are a great help. A great help. I'm very glad, however, just for your sister's sake, that she never wrote any to John. Imagine them reading out the love letters in the open court, and all the servant boys gaping and laughing.
#ANDY.
It's not nice, right enough. It's one thing I wouldn't like.
#DANIEL.
No. It's one thing we would not like. Well. No love. No letters. Next thing. He never courted her?
#ANDY.
Well, he came over and sat in the house a few nights.
#DANIEL.
Yes. No doubt. But hadn't he always some message on business to transact with you? Loan of a plough or a horse, or something like that?
#ANDY.
That's so, of course.
#DANIEL.
Ah, yes. That's so, of course.
#ANDY.
But I seen him with his arm round her the night of the social at the school house.
#DANIEL.
Andy. That's a wee failing of John's. I often warned him about doing that sort of thing indiscriminately. A bit of a ladies' man, John, in his way. I saw him do the same nonsense four or five times that night with other girls. John likes to think himself a bit of a gay dog, you know. It's not right - I don't think myself it's a bit proper to put your arm round a girl's waist on every occasion, but sometimes it's quite allowable. A night like a social, for instance.
#ANDY.
Aye. Of course a social's different.
#DANIEL.
Aye, Andy, a social's different. Well, now. No love, no letters, no courting, no photographs exchanged? No photographs exchanged? No ring? In fact, Andy, no nothing.
#ANDY.
But he proposed to her right enough.
#DANIEL.
Who said so?
#ANDY.
What? Do you mean to deny he didn't?
#DANIEL.
My dear Andy, I don't know. There was no one there but the two, I suppose, when he asked her - if he did ask her. There's only her word for it.
#ANDY.
He wouldn't deny it himself?
#DANIEL.
Well. That depends on whether he really asked her to marry him of course. And it's likely enough that John would be inclined to deny it if his memory was at all bad - it is a bad memory he has, you know. He forgets often to return your ploughs and that sort of thing.
#ANDY.
Aye. He has a bad memory.
#DANIEL.
Yes. Just so. And the fact that a verdict of one thousand pounds would hang on it would hardly make it any better. Would it? You've a bad case against us, Andy. A rotten case! In fact, looking over the whole thing carefully, do you really believe you'd make even a ten pound note out of us?
#ANDY.
I wish Sarah had come and settled the case herself.
#DANIEL.
Ah, no. You've a better head, Andy, for seeing the sensible side of a thing, far better. Well?
#MARY.
Uncle Dan, he's delighted with it.
#ANDY.
What with? The bellows?
#MARY.
Yes. Go in, Andy, till you see it.
#ANDY.
Is it true, Daniel, you were offered two thousand for it?
#DANIEL.
We'll just go in and have a look at it.
#MARY.
What's the matter?
#ALICK.
Nothing. I'm going home.
#MARY.
Alick!
#ALICK.
Goodbye.
#MARY.
And I was going to go to all the trouble of baking a big plum cake for you, you big ungrateful thing.
#ALICK.
I know what your plum cakes would be like.
#MARY.
Well, get that big, ugly Maggie Murphy to bake them for you then.
#ALICK.
I say, here's Kate and your father coming and a load of flour.
#MARY.
Kate and father?
#ALICK.
He seems to be in a bit of a temper.
#MARY.
He's caught her with the flour!
#ALICK.
Flour? Aye - she's carrying about three stone of it! Boys, but that would make a powerful pudding!
#MARY.
It was to have been the nicest one I could have baked.
#ALICK.
Mary.
#MARY.
What?
#ALICK.
You wouldn't come to my house where there would be no stint of flour or raisins or anything else, and I'd eat all you cooked for me no matter if I was dying after it.
#MARY.
Go to your house!
#ALICK.
Aye. Look here, wee girl. I got this - Let me put that on your wee finger, won't you?
#MARY.
Oh, Alick, what a lovely wee ring.
#JOHN GALE.
Mary. Did you send her for more flour?
#MARY.
Yes, father.
#JOHN GALE.
And didn't I leave word there was no more to be got without my orders? It's lamentable the waste in this house! I was just looking at the pass book last night, and you'd think this house was a bakery to see the amount of flour comes into it.
#MARY.
I'm sorry, father.
#JOHN GALE.
When I was out on the road, I seen a trail of flour leading up our loaning, and says I to myself, Jeminy' father, are they getting some more! So I followed up the mark and just caught up on her coming through the gate.
#MARY.
It's paid for, Kate, anyway. Isn't it?
#KATE.
It is, Miss.
#JOHN GALE.
Eh? Who give you the money?
#MARY.
Uncle Dan is in there, father, with Andy McMinn and Mr. Mackenzie, the Scotch engineer, looking at his bellows.
#JOHN GALE.
Eh? Andy McMinn? Is Dan settling the case?
#MARY.
I believe he'll do it yet.
#JOHN GALE.
He has a great head on him, Daniel.
#MACKENZIE.
Mary, I'm sorry. That bellows is such an absolutely rotten thing - so useless and so absolutely rotten that I can't - How are you, Mr. Murray?
#JOHN GALE.
Fine day.
#MARY.
Mr. Mackenzie, what did you say to Andy about it?
#MACKENZIE.
What did I say? Oh, ma perjured conscience - I said it was a grand thing.
#ANDY.
Brave day, John.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. It is.
#ANDY.
Sarah gave me power to settle the case.
#JOHN GALE.
I'm glad to hear it.
#MACKENZIE.
I tell you what it is, Mr. Daniel Murray. It's a good thing that - a right good thing, and I'll make you an offer for it.
#ANDY.
What's it worth?
#MACKENZIE.
It's worth - it's worth more than all the damages your sister will get from Mr. Murray.
#DANIEL.
I tell you what it is, Andy, and believe me when I tell you, I'm sacrificing a great deal. I'll make a deal with you. Instead of a lump sum cash down, I'll hand over all the rights and royalties of that same bellows to you to settle the case.
#ANDY.
I - I don't know.
#DANIEL.
You will have all the expense of the law, the bad name that your sister will be having over the head of being in a breach of promise, and all the expenses of solicitors and lawyers. Then, after that, trying to get the money out of us, and, mind you, we will fight you to the last ditch. Won't we, John?
#JOHN GALE.
Aye.
#DANIEL.
There now. What do you say, Mr. Mackenzie?
#MACKENZIE.
I tell you what it is, Mr. Murray. I'll make you an offer for -
#ANDY.
I'll take your offer, Daniel.
#DANIEL.
One second. I drew up a wee agreement for you to sign, and I'll fetch the bellows.
#ANDY.
I don't like signing my name to agreements or things like that unless I'm quite certain they're all right, Mr. Mackenzie.
#MACKENZIE.
Well, if you have any compunction about signing, I'll do it myself.
#MARY.
I think Uncle Dan's a fool to throw away the thing that way. I do indeed.
#DANIEL.
Just sign your name to that, Andy. It's a sort of agreement to settle the case - you can read it for yourself. It's to show that the whole thing is fixed up to the satisfaction of everybody. Ah. Good! Now, Alick, and you, Mr. Mackenzie, just witness it and the date. And now, Andy, there's your bellows. And may you have the best of luck with it.
#MACKENZIE.
Noo, my reward, Miss Murray - Mary rather.
#JOHN GALE.
I hope you're satisfied, Andy.
#ANDY.
I'm just wondering, Mr. Mackenzie, do you think -
#MACKENZIE.
I think nothing for a year. I'll - I'll - I'm for Scotland in the morning.
#DANIEL.
There, Andy. There's company home for you, and good luck to you. It's a sad heart I'll have this night.
#ANDY.
I'm wondering what Sarah would say - Ach! She couldn't do better herself. No courting.
#DANIEL.
No. No courting.
#ANDY.
And no love and no letters.
#DANIEL.
No. No love and no letters.
#ANDY.
And no ring nor nothing, and a thousand pound bellows.
#DANIEL.
Yes, Andy. And a thousand pound bellows. - Goodbye, Andy. And may you have the best of luck with it.
#ANDY.
Thank ye, Daniel. Goodbye.
#DANIEL.
Well, John?
#JOHN GALE.
Dan, I've said it before, and I'll say it again, you've a great head on you, Daniel.
