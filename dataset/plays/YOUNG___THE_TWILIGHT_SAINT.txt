#PIA.
Guido, Guido, thou hast not spoke this hour, Nor read one word nor written aught. Dear Lord, The lion on the palace at Assisi Sits not more still in stone! Guido, look thou!
#GUIDO.
Yes, old Pia, good neighbor.
#PIA.
Yes, old Pia! Guido, grieve not so much, Lisetta will be well before the spring Comes round again.
#GUIDO.
Yes, Lisetta will be well perhaps. God grant!
#PIA.
Well, what then?
#GUIDO.
'Tis not only of her I think, Pia, here am I Shut in this house from month to month a nurse; Here lies she sick, this child, and may not stir; And I, lacking due means to hire, must serve The house; while my best self, my soul, my art, Rust. My soul is scorched with holy thirst, My temples throb, my veins run fire; but yet, For all my dim distress and vague desire, No word, no single song, no verse, has come - O Blessed God! - stifled with creature needs, And with necessity about my throat!
#PIA.
Thy corner is too hot, the glaring sun Is yet on the wall.
#GUIDO.
'Tis not that sun that maddens me, O Pia! Can you not see me shrunk? Have you not heard That other Guido of Perugia How he is grown? How lately at the feast That Ugolino, the great cardinal, Spread at Assisi Easter night, Guido Read certain of his verses and declaimed Pages of cursed sonnets to the guests.
#PIA.
Young Guido of Perugia, thy friend?
#GUIDO.
Yea. And when he ended, came the Duke Down from the dais to kiss that Guido's hand Humbly, and said that poesy was king.
#PIA.
Madonna, kissed by the Duke!
#GUIDO.
And I, O God, I might have honor too Could I but break this prison where I drudge!
#PIA.
Speak low, her sleep is light. Her road is hard As well as thine. For all this year, since thou Didst bring her to Rieto here to us, Hath she lain on her bed, broken with pain, This child that is thy wife and loveth thee.
#GUIDO.
Aye, yes, 'tis true, she loveth me, she loveth me, And I love her. 'Tis worse - add grief to care, And Poesy fares worse.
#PIA.
And she is grown most pale and still of late.
#GUIDO.
Look, Pia, how she lieth there like death, That far - off patience on her face. Now, now, Surely I needs must make a song! And yet I may not; ashes and floor - sweeping clog My soul within me!
#PIA.
Nay, let thy dreams pass. Look thou, how pale! Dear Lord, how blue her little veins do shine!
#GUIDO.
Thou art most kind, good neighbor, to come here Helping our house. And it is very strange That when we are so kind we cannot know The heart also. For in my soul I hear bell summoning me always -
#PIA.
If I should stew in milk the peas, maybe - Do you think the child would eat it?
#GUIDO.
For thy world is not my world, kind old friend.
#PIA.
Why do you not walk, Guido, for a while, I have an hour yet.
#GUIDO.
Then I will go, Pia. But not for long, I will come back soon enough to my chores, be sure; Mine is a short tether.
#LISETTA.
Pia.
#PIA.
Yes, dear child.
#LISETTA.
Pia, turn my pillow, I am stifled.
#PIA.
There! Thou hast slept well?
#LISETTA.
I have not slept.
#PIA.
Holy Virgin, thou hast not slept!
#LISETTA.
Pia, think you I did not know? This month I scarce have slept for thinking on his lot. I read his fighting soul. Where are his songs, The great renown that waited him? Down, down, Struck by the self - same hand that shattered me. I listen night on night and hear him moan In his sleep -
#PIA.
It is his love for thee, Lisetta.
#LISETTA.
The padre from the village hemmed and said That God had sent me and my sickness here For Guido's cross to bear, his scourge. They thought I slept -
#PIA.
Thou hast dreamed this, he loveth thee, Lisetta.
#LISETTA.
Yea, loveth me somewhat but glory more. And I would have it so. O Mother of God, When wilt thou send me death? O Blessed Mother, I have lain so still!
#PIA.
Beware, Lisetta, tempt not God!
#LISETTA.
Death is the sister of all them that weep, Pia.
#PIA.
Child, child, try thou to sleep.
#LISETTA.
For thy sake will I try.
#PIA.
Aye, sleep now. I will smooth thy bed. Hist!
#LISETTA.
What, good Pia?
#PIA.
Footsteps. Look, it is a monk.
#FRANCIS.
I have not eaten food this day. Hast thou Somewhat that I may eat?
#PIA.
Alas, poor brother, sit thee here; there's bread And cheese and lentils, eat thy store. Poor 'tis, But given in His name.
#FRANCIS.
I will eat then and bless thee.
#PIA.
He taketh but a crust!
#FRANCIS.
It is enough. He that hath eaten long The bread of the heart hath little hunger in him.
#PIA.
Sit thou and rest, poor soul.
#FRANCIS.
Nay, I must go on. My daughter, child, Thou sleepest not for all thy lowered lids. Tears quiver on thy lashes, hast thou pain?
#LISETTA.
The tears of women even in dreams may fall, Good brother. Wilt thou not bide?
#FRANCIS.
I must fare on.
#LISETTA.
Aye, aye, the world lies open to thy hand, But unto me this twelvemonth is a death. The flesh is dead, and dying lies my soul, Shrunk like a flower in my fevered hand.
#FRANCIS.
My dear.
#LISETTA.
I may not see the stars rise on the hills, Nor tend the flocks at even, nor rise to do Aught of the small sweet round of duties owed To him I love; but lie a burden to him, Calling on death who heareth not.
#FRANCIS.
My life hath given me words for thee to hear.
#LISETTA.
Surely thy life is peace.
#FRANCIS.
There is a life larger than life, that dwells Invisible from all; whose lack alone Is death. There in thy soul the stars may rise, And at the even the gentle thoughts return To flock the quiet pastures of the mind; And in the large heart love is all thou owest For service unto God and thy Beloved.
#LISETTA.
Little Brother!
#FRANCIS.
May you have God's peace, dear friends. Farewell.
#PIA.
Why dost thou look so long upon the door?
#LISETTA.
Pia, the spring smiles on the tender grass, Surely the sun is brighter where he stood.
#PIA.
'Tis a glaring sun for twilight.
#LISETTA.
Pia, 'twill be the gentlest of all eves. Surely God sent the brother for my need, To give His peace.
#PIA.
Aye, and my old heart ripens at his words Like apples in the sun. 'Tis a sweet monk.
#LISETTA.
Who is he, think you?
#PIA.
One of the Little Poor Men, by his brown. They are too thin, these brothers, and do lack Stomach for life. Mark, oh, 'tis merry now To see the little beggars from their pods Popping like schoolboys from their shoes in spring! The season hath been so fine and dry this year My peas are smaller and must have more work. Well, well, labor is good, and things made scarce Are better loved.
#LISETTA.
Pia, thou art a good woman.
#PIA.
Child, do not make me cry. 'Tis thy pure heart Deceives thee. Stubborn I am and full of sloth, And a wicked old thing.
#LISETTA.
I would not grieve thee. Pia, 'twas my love That sees thy goodness better than thyself.
#PIA.
Lisetta, I see the sky at the chimney top. Firefly, firefly, come from the shadows, Twilight is falling over the meadows, Burn, little garden lamps, flicker and shimmer, Shine, little meadow stars, twinkle and glimmer. Firefly, firefly, shine, shine!
#LISETTA.
Pia.
#PIA.
Yes.
#LISETTA.
Pia, come near me here. Can you not see How much I love? If I could only speak To him or he to me, Guido, my love!
#PIA.
Surely he is beside thee often.
#LISETTA.
His hand is near, but not his heart.
#PIA.
Nay, child, 'tis Guido's way. He speaks but little. When I speak to him look what he says, "Yes, good Pia," 'tis not much.
#LISETTA.
Aye, tell me not. On winter nights I lay Hearing the tree limbs rattle there like hail, And from the corner eaves the dropping rain Like big dogs lapping all about - and he Spoke not to me. He sat beside his taper But never a line wrote down. Once I had words, Bright dreams, that shone through him, the same fire shone Through both, his songs were mine!
#PIA.
Yes, thine - rest thee, rest thee!
#LISETTA.
But more his, Pia, more his!
#PIA.
Aye, his. Wilt thou not eat the broth?
#LISETTA.
Not now, good Pia, 'tis not for food I die. 'Tis not for food.
#PIA.
Yet thou must eat.
#LISETTA.
Wilt thou not read one song of these to me?
#PIA.
Close then thine eyes and rest. O music locked amid the stones, Beside the - amid the -
#LISETTA.
Read on - and thou hast told me day by day Thou couldst not read.
#PIA.
I read from hearing thee from day to day Repeat the verses.
#LISETTA.
Fie! Give them to me here. O music locked amid the stones, My love hath spoken like to thee, Pia, think you - Pia, do you not hear The mowers and the reapers in the fields Singing the evening song, and the twilight pipes? The twilight is the hour when hearts break! How many lonely twilights will there be Ere God will spare me?
#PIA.
Hush, child, hush, darling! Firefly, firefly, come from the shadows - There! - he is coming now, I hear his steps Upon the gravel road. Good - night, sweet child, I'll get me home.
#LISETTA.
Pia, good - night once more.
#GUIDO.
Asleep, Lisetta?
#LISETTA.
Guido! Ah, I have need of naught, Guido. Thou needst not leave yet the pleasant air.
#GUIDO.
Lisetta, my love, I have been long from thee.
#LISETTA.
Let not that trouble thee, my needs are few, And Pia is most kind.
#GUIDO.
So little I may do.
#LISETTA.
Thou hast already served to weariness.
#GUIDO.
My love, I have been long from thee, but now I will not leave thee any more. Oh, God, Let these kisses tell my heart to her.
#LISETTA.
Guido, my love, perhaps I dream of thee! Perhaps God sends a dream to solace me.
#GUIDO.
Along the stream I went and where it crossed Bevagna road - where the chestnut grows, thou knowest - Lisetta, I saw him.
#LISETTA.
Yes, yes, I know, whom sawest thou?
#GUIDO.
The brother, Francis of Assisi.
#LISETTA.
Guido, sawest thou him?
#GUIDO.
Aye, him. There had he stopped to rest, being spent; And round him came the birds, beating their wings Upon his cloak and lighting on his arm. I saw him smile on them and heard him speak! "My brother birds, little brothers, ye should love God Who gave you your wings and your bright songs and spread The soft air for you." He stroked their necks And blessed them. And then I saw his eyes. "Father," I cried, "speak thou to me, I faint Beside my way!"
#LISETTA.
Aye, and he said? Guido, what said he?
#GUIDO.
"Thou art as one that lieth at the gate Of Paradise and entereth not. For God Hath given thee thy soul for its own life, And not for glory among men."
#LISETTA.
Guido!
#GUIDO.
Lisetta, from his kind eyes I drank, and knew How God had magnified my soul through him, And sent me peace. And I returned to thee; For here in thee have I my glory.
#LISETTA.
Guido, the old spring comes back again. And now I may speak. Guido, look through my window vines there Where the stars rise. O Love, I have not slept For lacking thee. And often have I seen The moonlight lie like sleep upon the hill, And in the garden of the sky the moon Drift like a blown rose, Guido, and yet I might not speak.
#GUIDO.
Thou art my saint and shrine!
#LISETTA.
Now shall my dream become thy song again, And the long twilight be more sweet, Guido!
#GUIDO.
I pray thee rest thee now and sleep. Good - night. My full heart breaks in song; and I will sit Hearing the blessed saints within my soul, And will not stir from thee lest thou shouldst wake When I might not be near to serve thy need.
