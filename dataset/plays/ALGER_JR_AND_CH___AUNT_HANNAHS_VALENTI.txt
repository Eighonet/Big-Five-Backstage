#CARRIE.
So Mrs. Montgomery’s nephew is coming to - day. I hope he is agreeable. I wonder if he is engaged. It must be nice to marry a rich man, and live in the city, and go to balls, parties, and the theatre. I don’t understand why Mrs. Montgomery doesn’t feel so. She married a merchant, and can live in fine style in the city, but yet she prefers the country. And to - day her nephew is coming here. He thinks people on a farm are countrified, but I guess we can show him they are not all so. I’ve a good mind to flirt with him a little, by way of variety. I don’t believe it would be very difficult to captivate him. Perhaps, I can teach him a lesson. Ah, Herbert—just going to work?
#HERBERT.
Yes. Won’t you go, too?
#CAROLINE.
What inducement have you to offer? ride home on the hay after it is put into the wagon.
#CAROLINE.
That might be sufficient sometimes, but not now, for I must hurry home. Do you know, Herbert, we are to have a new - comer at our house, this afternoon?
#HARRY.
No. Who is it?
#CAROLINE.
Mrs. Montgomery’s nephew. Adolphus Fitz - William is his name, I believe. His aunt says he has never been in the country at all, and he thinks farmers’ families are countrified to the last degree. She has his picture, and it looks very foppish.
#HARRY.
And he is coming to - day, is he?
#CAROLINE.
Yes; he’s expected in the first afternoon train, and it’s about time for that to be here. I guess that’s he now. I must go.
#ADOLPHUS.
Can you tell me, aw, where Fawmer Leland lives, Jawnathan?
#HARRY.
I think I’ll humor him. Wal, there now, who’d ’a’ thought you’d known what my name was? Who told yer?
#MRS. FADD.
You’re vewy familiah. Do you know where Fawmer Leland lives?
#HARRY.
You aint come to court his daughter, be ye?
#MRS. FADD.
Ah, has he a daughter?
#HARRY.
He has that, an’ a pooty one, too. Rosy cheeks an’ bright eyes she’s got. I tell ye, she’s harnsome. I think some o’ sparkin’ her myself.
#MRS. FADD.
You, aw! Impossible! She wouldn’t look at such a fellaw.
#HARRY.
You dunno. Love goes whar it’s sent, an’ mebbe it’ll be sent to me.
#MRS. FADD.
But, aw, you haven’t answered my question. Can you tell me, aw, where Fawmer Leland lives?
#HARRY.
Oh, yes, I remember. But, ’say, did yer come from the city to - day?
#MRS. FADD.
No, aw didn’t.
#HARRY.
Is that so? I swar, I thought yer did—yer look so ’mazin’ spruce. How long be yer goin’ to stay, now?
#MRS. FADD.
No mattaw.
#HARRY.
Sho, now, don’t go ter gittin’ mad over it.
#MRS. FADD.
Will you tell me, aw, where Fawmer Leland lives or will you not, aw?
#HARRY.
In course I will; but you needn’t git so mighty mad. Ye haint asked me yit.
#MRS. FADD.
I’ve asked you fower sevewal times.
#HARRY.
It’s no sich a thing. Ye asked me if I could tell yer where he lived and ef I knowed where he lived. In course I couldn’t arnser a question ’fore ’twas put. I was eddicated to be perlite even ter my inferiors. When yer ask the question, I’ll arnser it.
#MRS. FADD.
You impertinent fellaw, where does Fawmer Leland live?
#HARRY.
Don’t go to puttin’ on airs, now. D’ye see them chimblys over there?
#MRS. FADD.
Yes, aw do.
#HARRY.
Well, then, make a bee - line for ’em. Them’s the chimblys to Farmer Leland’s house. If he’d been a civil feller, I’d ’a’ shown him the path. Now he’ll have to climb four rickety stone walls, and I dunno as how he can do it safely with them tight breeches on. But I must go to work. Tempus fuggit, as the schoolmaster says.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Well, I declare, haint you begun your baking yet, Car’line? It’s nigh onto noon, and you won’t get dinner ready in season.
#CAROLINE.
Well, you know I can’t make my pies till the apples are ready. You’ll have to talk to Caleb. I’ve been trying to hurry him.
#AUNT HANNAH.
I should be ashamed, if I was a boy, to be so long peeling a few apples.
#CALEB.
Oh, what’s the use in hurrying? There’s plenty of time.
#AUNT HANNAH.
In my young days things didn’t go on so. Good house - keepers got their bakin’ done by eight o’clock in the morning. They didn’t spend all day in the kitchen, as they do now.
#CAROLINE.
Don’t be troubled, Aunt Hannah; everything will be finished early, and dinner on the table at the usual time.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Well, I hope ’twill, but things don’t look much like it now.
#CALEB.
Aunt Hannah is never happy except when she’s finding fault with somebody. She’s gone off mad, and I’m glad of it. I hope she’ll stay away.
#ADOLPHUS.
I’ve been looking for you, Miss Carwy. Will you, aw, go out and walk with me this morning?
#CAROLINE.
I don’t think I could. Mother is away, you know, and I have all the housework to do.
#MRS. FADD.
Couldn’t I, aw, assist you, so you could go?
#CAROLINE.
I think not. I’m afraid there’s none of my work that you could do.
#CALEB.
You jest make me that offer, Mr. Fitz. I’ll warrant you I won’t refuse. I know you’ll be able to do my work. And I can show you round a great deal better than Carrie can.
#CAROLINE.
I declare, I’m afraid my bread is burning. I nearly forgot it.
#CALEB.
Heigho! I don’t feel like peeling apples. I guess I’ll see what girl loves me best. Sure’s the world, that’s an L, an’ stands for Lizy Blake. I was most sure ’twould be so. That sign always comes true.
#MRS. FADD.
What are you doing, aw, Caleb?
#CALEB.
I’ve been finding out who was my true love. Want to try your hand at it?
#MRS. FADD.
Well, aw, I might try.
#CALEB.
That one’s broken, but I’ll soon make you another.
#CALEB.
I declare, Mr. Fitz, you’re about as graceful as a cow.
#MRS. FADD.
That’s a C, aw, plain enough.
#CALEB.
It’s an exact H. Who can that stand for? Oh, I know. It must be that you’re going to marry Aunt Hannah.
#MRS. FADD.
What do you mean, aw, by such a fawlshood?
#CAROLINE.
Why, what’s the matter?
#CALEB.
Nothing, only Mr. Fitz has been telling me who his sweetheart is, and he don’t like it ’cause I won’t promise not to tell anybody.
#CAROLINE.
You’d better go out in the kitchen, and finish your work. I’m in a hurry for the apples.
#MRS. FADD.
You must be tired, aw, with your labors.
#CAROLINE.
Oh no, indeed; but I am waiting for that lazy Caleb to finish the apples, so I can be making my pies.
#MRS. FADD.
Miss Leland—Carwy, I have long sought, aw, this opportunity to confess, aw, my love for you. Do not deny me, aw, and doom me to dwead despair.
#CAROLINE.
Mr. Fitz - William, rise, I beseech you.
#MRS. FADD.
Not until you give me a favorable answer to my suit.
#CAROLINE.
I cannot—I—
#CALEB.
Ha! ha! ha!
#MRS. MONTGOMERY.
What can be the matter?
#AUNT HANNAH.
What’s all this noise about? Anybody’d think the house was afire, to hear such a racket.
#MRS. FADD.
It’s that impertinent young wascal, aw, who’s been scweaming like a locomotive whistle.
#CALEB.
Who wouldn’t ’a’ laughed, if they’d come in, as I did, and seen Mr. Fitz - William on his knees asking Carrie to marry him?
#MRS. MERRY.
Why, Adolphus, I thought you were engaged to Helen Lindsay, who lives in the city.
#CALEB.
And ’twarn’t more’n ten minutes ago that he spoke about marryin’ Aunt Hannah.
#MRS. FADD.
I did not, aw. I’d sooner marwy Beelzebub’s daughtaw than such a she - dwagon.
#AUNT HANNAH.
You would, would ye? Then, you just git out o’ this house. You shan’t stay in it a minute longer.
#CALEB.
That’s it, Aunt Hannah. Pitch into him lively. Go ahead, an’ I’ll help yer.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Is this stockin’ goin’ to be large enough for Calup?
#MRS. LELAND.
I guess so. It is larger than the last pair.
#CALEB.
Aunt Hannah thinks my understanding is increasing pretty fast.
#AUNT HANNAH.
It’s a pity ’taint your politeness instid o’ your feet that’s agrowin’.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Take another chair, Caleb, and let your aunt have the rocking - chair.
#CALEB.
Of course—age before good looks.
#AUNT HANNAH.
In my day, children warn’t allowed to make fun of their relations.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Caleb doesn’t mean anything, Aunt Hannah, but he ought not to speak so.
#AUNT HANNAH.
P’r’aps he don’t. This aint the fust time he’s been sassy to me.
#CALEB.
Well, why can’t you be jolly, like other folks? I have to make fun so’s to make up for your lookin’ an’ talkin’ so dismal.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Well, I shan’t always be here to trouble you with my looks. When I’m gone, maybe you’ll wish you hadn’t laughed at me as you have.
#CALEB.
There’s the door - bell. Shall I go, mother?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Yes, for I must go upstairs to get some pieces to mend this coat with.
#CALEB.
M - m - iss Lel - land.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Calup, that letter’s for me. Give it to me this minute.
#CALEB.
It aint a letter; it’s a valentine. It’s got all sorts of pretty figures on the envelope. Promise, Aunt Hannah, that you’ll let me see the inside of it, and I’ll give it to you right off.
#AUNT HANNAH.
I shan’t make any promises. Give me that letter, Calup.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Ca - leb! Ca - leb!
#CALEB.
By the time you get it read, Aunt Hannah, I’ll be back all ready to see it.
#AUNT HANNAH.
It is a valentine, as sure as I’m alive. Who could have sent it?
#AUNT HANNAH.
Well, there’s a perspective proposal, and I’m sure it couldn’t come from anybody but Obadiah Rakestraw. His mother’s just died, and he used to go to singing school with me when I was a girl , and he’ll be here to - night. I guess I’ll go and fix up a little, as long as he’s sent me word he’s coming.
#CAROLINE.
Oh, dear, how unhappy I am! it is six months since Herbert went away, and I know it was because he thought I liked that popinjay Adolphus. Of course, he doesn’t know that it was nothing but a flirtation, and that I couldn’t endure the sight of Adolphus afterwards. I didn’t think Herbert would have gone off so suddenly, without even writing me a note to say he was going. Six months ago, and I’ve been so miserable all this weary time! What’s this, a valentine, addressed to Miss Leland? Why, that’s my name, and, of course, I have a right to read it. Yes, it was intended for me, and is in Herbert’s handwriting , and he is to be here this evening! But how came it opened? It must be that Aunt Hannah has opened and read it, thinking it was intended for her. I guess I’ll place the letter where I found it , and leave the room till the time comes for Herbert to arrive.
#CALEB.
Well, that’s pretty treatment, for Aunt Hannah to go off when I told her partic’larly I was coming right back; and most likely she has carried the valentine with her. No, she hasn’t, either. By George! she was quite good, for her. So Aunt Hannah has really got a beau! Who can he be? I guess he don’t know her as well as some folks do. Let’s see He’s coming here to - night to ask her that question. It’ll be worth a great deal to see anybody making love to Aunt Hannah. How can I manage to be round to see how it’s done? Oh, this is just the thing.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Well, there, I was rather ventur’som in leaving this valentine on the table. It’s a wonder that Calup didn’t come in an’ get hold of it. If he had, I’d never have heard the last of it.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Good evening, Mr. Rakestraw.
#OBADIAH RAKESTRAW.
Good - evening, Miss Leland. So you’re all alone this evening.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Yes, I happen to be just now, but I suppose the rest of the folks will be in soon. I wonder if he won’t take the hint.
#CALEB.
Oh, my! aint she sly?
#OBADIAH RAKESTRAW.
I thought I’d just come in and make a neighborly call this evening.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Just so. I’m glad the spirit took ye. It be kind o’ lonesome for you at home.
#OBADIAH RAKESTRAW.
Wall, ’tis so sometimes.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Ye ought to get married.
#OBADIAH RAKESTRAW.
I’m afraid nobody’d have me.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Oh, you’re too shy. There’s nothin’ like tryin’. To - night is St. Valentine’s, and there aint no time like the present. All ye’ve got to do is jest ask the question. I’ll warrant you’ll get a favorable answer.
#CALEB.
Don’t she drive business?
#OBADIAH RAKESTRAW.
Wall, I’ve a good mind to take your advice. As you say, ’tis kind o’ lonesome, an’ I can’t more’n get refused ; so I’ll jest go over an’ ask Hitty Trumbull if she’ll marry me.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Mehitable Trumbull! You don’t mean you’re going to offer yourself to her.
#OBADIAH RAKESTRAW.
That’s jest what I mean.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Well, it’s downright dishonorable treatment, after the letter you sent me to - day.
#OBADIAH RAKESTRAW.
I haven’t sent you any letter.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Didn’t you write that valentine?
#OBADIAH RAKESTRAW.
I never saw it before; and, between you and me, I don’t think it was intended for you.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Do you mean to insult me by saying I open other folks’ letters?
#OBADIAH RAKESTRAW.
Not exactly, but I think this was written to your niece. It aint the kind o’ valentine one would be likely to send to a person of your age.
#AUNT HANNAH.
You mean to twit me about my age, do you? I’ll just let you know that I’m six years younger than Mehitable Trumbull. But I won’t listen to any more of your insultin’ remarks; so just leave this house, or I’ll call somebody to help you.
#OBADIAH RAKESTRAW.
It’s lucky I didn’t offer to marry you, as you asked me to. I see your temper hasn’t improved any since we used to go to singing - school together.
#AUNT HANNAH.
The villain! to treat me so. But it’s lucky none of the folks know anything about it. I must change my dress before any of them come in.
#CALEB.
Wasn’t that rich? To think of Aunt Hannah, who “wouldn’t marry the best man living,” offering herself, and then, after all, that her love should be refused. But who’s that? Perhaps, she’s coming back again. She mustn’t find me here.
#CAROLINE.
It was only by accident that I happened to see your letter at all. Aunt Hannah received and read it, and thought it was sent to her.
#HARRY.
Who could she have supposed sent it?
#CAROLINE.
I don’t know, I’m sure.
#CALEB.
I know all about it.
#HARRY.
But you haven’t answered the question it contained.
#CAROLINE.
Did it contain one? I thought the note said you intended to ask a question; but, as you didn’t do so, I supposed you’d changed your mind.
#HARRY.
You needn’t pretend ignorance. I can’t propose with the same grace that Adolphus did, but you can’t help knowing that I meant to ask you to marry me. Will you be my wife, Carrie?
#CAROLINE.
I suppose it wouldn’t do to say anything but “Yes,” especially as, if I refuse, I couldn’t return your letter, since Aunt Hannah has taken possession of it.
#HARRY.
I shouldn’t be satisfied with any other answer. Now, let’s go and tell your mother about it, and then we’ll set the wedding day.
#CALEB.
Well that was a little addition I didn’t expect. I’ve always wondered how folks popped the question, but I’ve found out all about it, and now I can do it like a book. I guess I’ll go down and see ’Lizy Blake before I forget how it’s done. If she says “Yes” we’ll have a loaf of wedding - cake as big as our new school - house. I don’t know though, but I ought to write a valentine, and send to her, first, to let her know I’m coming. That’s the way Herbert did. But then, just as likely as not, her aunt Lizy’d get it, thinking ’twas for her. She’s cross - eyed, an’ wears false hair an’ store teeth, an’ I couldn’t have her on my hands. No, I guess I’ll go right down, an’ do my sparkin’ in good style, an’ wind up by askin’ ’Lizy if I shan’t be her Valentine.
