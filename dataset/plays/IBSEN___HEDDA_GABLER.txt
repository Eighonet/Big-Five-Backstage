#MISS TESMAN.
Upon my word, I don't believe they are stirring yet!
#BERTA.
I told you so, Miss. Remember how late the steamboat got in last night. And then, when they got home! - good Lord, what a lot the young mistress had to unpack before she could get to bed.
#MISS TESMAN.
Well well - let them have their sleep out. But let us see that they get a good breath of the fresh morning air when they do appear.
#BERTA.
I declare there isn't a bit of room left. I think I'll put it down here, Miss.
#MISS TESMAN.
So you've got a new mistress now, my dear Berta. Heaven knows it was a wrench to me to part with you.
#BERTA.
And do you think it wasn't hard for me, too, Miss? After all the blessed years I've been with you and Miss Rina.
#MISS TESMAN.
We must make the best of it, Berta. There was nothing else to be done. George can't do without you, you see - he absolutely can't. He has had you to look after him ever since he was a little boy.
#BERTA.
Ah but, Miss Julia, I can't help thinking of Miss Rina lying helpless at home there, poor thing. And with only that new girl too! She'll never learn to take proper care of an invalid.
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh, I shall manage to train her. And of course, you know, I shall take most of it upon myself. You needn't be uneasy about my poor sister, my dear Berta.
#BERTA.
Well, but there's another thing, Miss. I'm so mortally afraid I shan't be able to suit the young mistress.
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh well - just at first there may be one or two things -
#BERTA.
Most like she'll be terrible grand in her ways.
#MISS TESMAN.
Well, you can't wonder at that - General Gabler's daughter! Think of the sort of life she was accustomed to in her father's time. Don't you remember how we used to see her riding down the road along with the General? In that long black habit - and with feathers in her hat?
#BERTA.
Yes, indeed - I remember well enough! - But, good Lord, I should never have dreamt in those days that she and Master George would make a match of it.
#MISS TESMAN.
Nor I. - But by - the - bye, Berta - while I think of it: in future you mustn't say Master George. You must say Dr. Tesman.
#BERTA.
Yes, the young mistress spoke of that too - last night - the moment they set foot in the house. Is it true then, Miss?
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, indeed it is. Only think, Berta - some foreign university has made him a doctor - while he has been abroad, you understand. I hadn't heard a word about it, until he told me himself upon the pier.
#BERTA.
Well well, he's clever enough for anything, he is. But I didn't think he'd have gone in for doctoring people.
#MISS TESMAN.
No no, it's not that sort of doctor he is. But let me tell you, we may have to call him something still grander before long.
#BERTA.
You don't say so! What can that be, Miss?
#MISS TESMAN.
H'm - wouldn't you like to know! Ah, dear dear - if my poor brother could only look up from his grave now, and see what his little boy has grown into! But bless me, Berta - why have you done this? Taken the chintz covers off all the furniture.
#BERTA.
The mistress told me to. She can't abide covers on the chairs, she says.
#MISS TESMAN.
Are they going to make this their everyday sitting - room then?
#BERTA.
Yes, that's what I understood - from the mistress. Master George - the doctor - he said nothing. comes from the right into the inner room, humming to himself, and carrying an unstrapped empty portmanteau. He is a middle - sized, young - looking man of thirty - three, rather stout, with a round, open, cheerful face, fair hair and beard. He wears spectacles, and is somewhat carelessly dressed in comfortable indoor clothes.
#MISS TESMAN.
Good morning, good morning, George.
#TESMAN.
Aunt Julia! Dear Aunt Julia! Come all this way - so early! Eh?
#MISS TESMAN.
Why, of course I had to come and see how you were getting on.
#TESMAN.
In spite of your having had no proper night's rest?
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh, that makes no difference to me.
#TESMAN.
Well, I suppose you got home all right from the pier? Eh?
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, quite safely, thank goodness. Judge Brack was good enough to see me right to my door.
#TESMAN.
We were so sorry we couldn't give you a seat in the carriage. But you saw what a pile of boxes Hedda had to bring with her.
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, she had certainly plenty of boxes.
#BERTA.
Shall I go in and see if there's anything I can do for the mistress?
#TESMAN.
No thank you, Berta - you needn't. She said she would ring if she wanted anything.
#BERTA.
Very well.
#TESMAN.
But look here - take this portmanteau with you.
#BERTA.
I'll put it in the attic.
#TESMAN.
Fancy, Auntie - I had the whole of that portmanteau chock full of copies of the documents. You wouldn't believe how much I have picked up from all the archives I have been examining - curious old details that no one has had any idea of -
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, you don't seem to have wasted your time on your wedding trip, George.
#TESMAN.
No, that I haven't. But do take off your bonnet, Auntie. Look here! Let me untie the strings - eh?
#MISS TESMAN.
Well well - this is just as if you were still at home with us.
#TESMAN.
Why, what a gorgeous bonnet you've been investing in!
#MISS TESMAN.
I bought it on Hedda's account.
#TESMAN.
On Hedda's account? Eh?
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, so that Hedda needn't be ashamed of me if we happened to go out together.
#TESMAN.
You always think of everything, Aunt Julia. And now, look here - suppose we sit comfortably on the sofa and have a little chat, till Hedda comes.
#MISS TESMAN.
What a delight it is to have you again, as large as life, before my very eyes, George! My George - my poor brother's own boy!
#TESMAN.
And it's a delight for me, too, to see you again, Aunt Julia! You, who have been father and mother in one to me.
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh yes, I know you will always keep a place in your heart for your old aunts.
#TESMAN.
And what about Aunt Rina? No improvement - eh?
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh, no - we can scarcely look for any improvement in her case, poor thing. There she lies, helpless, as she has lain for all these years. But heaven grant I may not lose her yet awhile! For if I did, I don't know what I should make of my life, George - especially now that I haven't you to look after any more.
#TESMAN.
There there there - !
#MISS TESMAN.
And to think that here are you a married man, George! - And that you should be the one to carry off Hedda Gabler - the beautiful Hedda Gabler! Only think of it - she, that was so beset with admirers!
#TESMAN.
Yes, I fancy I have several good friends about town who would like to stand in my shoes - eh?
#MISS TESMAN.
And then this fine long wedding - tour you have had! More than five - nearly six months -
#TESMAN.
Well, for me it has been a sort of tour of research as well. I have had to do so much grubbing among old records - and to read no end of books too, Auntie.
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh yes, I suppose so. But listen now, George, - have you nothing - nothing special to tell me?
#TESMAN.
As to our journey?
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes.
#TESMAN.
No, I don't know of anything except what I have told you in my letters. I had a doctor's degree conferred on me - but that I told you yesterday.
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, yes, you did. But what I mean is - haven't you any - any - expectations - ?
#TESMAN.
Expectations?
#MISS TESMAN.
Why you know, George - I'm your old auntie!
#TESMAN.
Why, of course I have expectations.
#MISS TESMAN.
Ah!
#TESMAN.
I have every expectation of being a professor one of these days.
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh yes, a professor -
#TESMAN.
Indeed, I may say I am certain of it. But my dear Auntie - you know all about that already!
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, of course I do. You are quite right there. But we were talking about your journey. It must have cost a great deal of money, George?
#TESMAN.
Well, you see - my handsome travelling - scholarship went a good way.
#MISS TESMAN.
But I can't understand how you can have made it go far enough for two.
#TESMAN.
No, that's not easy to understand - eh?
#MISS TESMAN.
And especially travelling with a lady - they tell me that makes it ever so much more expensive.
#TESMAN.
Yes, of course - it makes it a little more expensive. But Hedda had to have this trip, Auntie! She really had to. Nothing else would have done.
#MISS TESMAN.
No no, I suppose not. A wedding - tour seems to be quite indispensable nowadays. - But tell me now - have you gone thoroughly over the house yet?
#TESMAN.
Yes, you may be sure I have. I have been afoot ever since daylight.
#MISS TESMAN.
And what do you think of it all?
#TESMAN.
I'm delighted! Quite delighted! Only I can't think what we are to do with the two empty rooms between this inner parlour and Hedda's bedroom.
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh my dear George, I daresay you may find some use for them - in the course of time.
#TESMAN.
Why of course you are quite right, Aunt Julia! You mean as my library increases - eh?
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, quite so, my dear boy. It was your library I was thinking of.
#TESMAN.
I am specially pleased on Hedda's account. Often and often, before we were engaged, she said that she would never care to live anywhere but in Secretary Falk's villa.
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, it was lucky that this very house should come into the market, just after you had started.
#TESMAN.
Yes, Aunt Julia, the luck was on our side, wasn't it - eh?
#MISS TESMAN.
But the expense, my dear George! You will find it very expensive, all this.
#TESMAN.
Yes, I suppose I shall, Aunt!
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh, frightfully!
#TESMAN.
How much do you think? In round numbers? - Eh?
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh, I can't even guess until all the accounts come in.
#TESMAN.
Well, fortunately, Judge Brack has secured the most favourable terms for me, so he said in a letter to Hedda.
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, don't be uneasy, my dear boy. - Besides, I have given security for the furniture and all the carpets.
#TESMAN.
Security? You? My dear Aunt Julia - what sort of security could you give?
#MISS TESMAN.
I have given a mortgage on our annuity.
#TESMAN.
What! On your - and Aunt Rina's annuity!
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, I knew of no other plan, you see.
#TESMAN.
Have you gone out of your senses, Auntie? Your annuity - it's all that you and Aunt Rina have to live upon.
#MISS TESMAN.
Well well - don't get so excited about it. It's only a matter of form you know - Judge Brack assured me of that. It was he that was kind enough to arrange the whole affair for me. A mere matter of form, he said.
#TESMAN.
Yes, that may be all very well. But nevertheless -
#MISS TESMAN.
You will have your own salary to depend upon now. And, good heavens, even if we did have to pay up a little - ! To eke things out a bit at the start - ! Why, it would be nothing but a pleasure to us.
#TESMAN.
Oh Auntie - will you never be tired of making sacrifices for me!
#MISS TESMAN.
Have I any other happiness in this world except to smooth your way for you, my dear boy. You, who have had neither father nor mother to depend on. And now we have reached the goal, George! Things have looked black enough for us, sometimes; but, thank heaven, now you have nothing to fear.
#TESMAN.
Yes, it is really marvellous how every thing has turned out for the best.
#MISS TESMAN.
And the people who opposed you - who wanted to bar the way for you - now you have them at your feet. They have fallen, George. Your most dangerous rival - his fall was the worst. - And now he has to lie on the bed he has made for himself - poor misguided creature.
#TESMAN.
Have you heard anything of Eilert? Since I went away, I mean.
#MISS TESMAN.
Only that he is said to have published a new book.
#TESMAN.
What! Eilert Lovborg! Recently - eh?
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, so they say. Heaven knows whether it can be worth anything! Ah, when your new book appears - that will be another story, George! What is it to be about?
#TESMAN.
It will deal with the domestic industries of Brabant during the Middle Ages.
#MISS TESMAN.
Fancy - to be able to write on such a subject as that!
#TESMAN.
However, it may be some time before the book is ready. I have all these collections to arrange first, you see.
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, collecting and arranging - no one can beat you at that. There you are my poor brother's own son.
#TESMAN.
I am looking forward eagerly to setting to work at it; especially now that I have my own delightful home to work in.
#MISS TESMAN.
And, most of all, now that you have got the wife of your heart, my dear George.
#TESMAN.
Oh yes, yes, Aunt Julia! Hedda - she is the best part of it all! I believe I hear her coming - eh? enters from the left through the inner room. Her face and figure show refinement and distinction. Her complexion is pale and opaque. Her steel - grey eyes express a cold, unruffled repose. Her hair is of an agreeable brown, but not particularly abundant. She is dressed in a tasteful, somewhat loose - fitting morning gown.
#MISS TESMAN.
Good morning, my dear Hedda! Good morning, and a hearty welcome!
#HEDDA.
Good morning, dear Miss Tesman! So early a call! That is kind of you.
#MISS TESMAN.
Well - has the bride slept well in her new home?
#HEDDA.
Oh yes, thanks. Passably.
#TESMAN.
Passably! Come, that's good, Hedda! You were sleeping like a stone when I got up.
#HEDDA.
Fortunately. Of course one has always to accustom one's self to new surroundings, Miss Tesman - little by little. Oh, there the servant has gone and opened the veranda door, and let in a whole flood of sunshine.
#MISS TESMAN.
Well, then we will shut it.
#HEDDA.
No no, not that! Tesman, please draw the curtains. That will give a softer light.
#TESMAN.
All right - all right. - There now, Hedda, now you have both shade and fresh air.
#HEDDA.
Yes, fresh air we certainly must have, with all these stacks of flowers - But - won't you sit down, Miss Tesman?
#MISS TESMAN.
No, thank you. Now that I have seen that everything is all right here - thank heaven! - I must be getting home again. My sister is lying longing for me, poor thing.
#TESMAN.
Give her my very best love, Auntie; and say I shall look in and see her later in the day.
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, yes, I'll be sure to tell her. But by - the - bye, George - I had almost forgotten - I have something for you here.
#TESMAN.
What is it, Auntie? Eh?
#MISS TESMAN.
Look here, my dear boy.
#TESMAN.
Well, I declare! - Have you really saved them for me, Aunt Julia! Hedda! isn't this touching - eh?
#HEDDA.
Well, what is it?
#TESMAN.
My old morning - shoes! My slippers.
#HEDDA.
Indeed. I remember you often spoke of them while we were abroad.
#TESMAN.
Yes, I missed them terribly. Now you shall see them, Hedda!
#HEDDA.
Thanks, I really don't care about it.
#TESMAN.
Only think - ill as she was, Aunt Rina embroidered these for me. Oh you can't think how many associations cling to them.
#HEDDA.
Scarcely for me.
#MISS TESMAN.
Of course not for Hedda, George.
#TESMAN.
Well, but now that she belongs to the family, I thought -
#HEDDA.
We shall never get on with this servant, Tesman.
#MISS TESMAN.
Not get on with Berta?
#TESMAN.
Why, dear, what puts that in your head? Eh?
#HEDDA.
Look there! She has left her old bonnet lying about on a chair.
#TESMAN.
Why, Hedda -
#HEDDA.
Just fancy, if any one should come in and see it!
#TESMAN.
But Hedda - that's Aunt Julia's bonnet.
#HEDDA.
Is it!
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, indeed it's mine. And, what's more, it's not old, Madam Hedda.
#HEDDA.
I really did not look closely at it, Miss Tesman.
#MISS TESMAN.
Let me tell you it's the first time I have worn it - the very first time.
#TESMAN.
And a very nice bonnet it is too - quite a beauty!
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh, it's no such great things, George. My parasol - ? Ah, here. For this is mine too - - not Berta's. new bonnet and a new parasol! Only think, Hedda.
#HEDDA.
Very handsome indeed.
#TESMAN.
Yes, isn't it? Eh? But Auntie, take a good look at Hedda before you go! See how handsome she is!
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh, my dear boy, there's nothing new in that. Hedda was always lovely.
#TESMAN.
Yes, but have you noticed what splendid condition she is in? How she has filled out on the journey?
#HEDDA.
Oh, do be quiet - !
#MISS TESMAN.
Filled out?
#TESMAN.
Of course you don't notice it so much now that she has that dress on. But I, who can see -
#HEDDA.
Oh, you can't see anything.
#TESMAN.
It must be the mountain air in the Tyrol -
#HEDDA.
I am exactly as I was when I started.
#TESMAN.
So you insist; but I'm quite certain you are not. Don't you agree with me, Auntie?
#MISS TESMAN.
Hedda is lovely - lovely - lovely. God bless and preserve Hedda Tesman - for George's sake.
#HEDDA.
Oh - ! Let me go.
#MISS TESMAN.
I shall not let a day pass without coming to see you.
#TESMAN.
No you won't, will you, Auntie? Eh?
#MISS TESMAN.
Good - bye - good - bye!
#TESMAN.
What are you looking at, Hedda?
#HEDDA.
I am only looking at the leaves. They are so yellow - so withered.
#TESMAN.
Well, you see, we are well into September now.
#HEDDA.
Yes, to think of it! - already in - in September.
#TESMAN.
Don't you think Aunt Julia's manner was strange, dear? Almost solemn? Can you imagine what was the matter with her? Eh?
#HEDDA.
I scarcely know her, you see. Is she not often like that?
#TESMAN.
No, not as she was to - day.
#HEDDA.
Do you think she was annoyed about the bonnet?
#TESMAN.
Oh, scarcely at all. Perhaps a little, just at the moment -
#HEDDA.
But what an idea, to pitch her bonnet about in the drawing - room! No one does that sort of thing.
#TESMAN.
Well you may be sure Aunt Julia won't do it again.
#HEDDA.
In any case, I shall manage to make my peace with her.
#TESMAN.
Yes, my dear, good Hedda, if you only would.
#HEDDA.
When you call this afternoon, you might invite her to spend the evening here.
#TESMAN.
Yes, that I will. And there's one thing more you could do that would delight her heart.
#HEDDA.
What is it?
#TESMAN.
If you could only prevail on yourself to say du to her. For my sake, Hedda? Eh?
#HEDDA.
No, no, Tesman - you really mustn't ask that of me. I have told you so already. I shall try to call her "Aunt"; and you must be satisfied with that.
#TESMAN.
Well well. Only I think now that you belong to the family, you -
#HEDDA.
H'm - I can't in the least see why -
#TESMAN.
Is there anything the matter with you, Hedda? Eh?
#HEDDA.
I'm only looking at my old piano. It doesn't go at all well with all the other things.
#TESMAN.
The first time I draw my salary, we'll see about exchanging it.
#HEDDA.
No, no - no exchanging. I don't want to part with it. Suppose we put it there in the inner room, and then get another here in its place. When it's convenient, I mean.
#TESMAN.
Yes - of course we could do that.
#HEDDA.
These flowers were not here last night when we arrived.
#TESMAN.
Aunt Julia must have brought them for you.
#HEDDA.
A visiting - card. "Shall return later in the day." Can you guess whose card it is?
#TESMAN.
No. Whose? Eh?
#HEDDA.
The name is "Mrs. Elvsted."
#TESMAN.
Is it really? Sheriff Elvsted's wife? Miss Rysing that was.
#HEDDA.
Exactly. The girl with the irritating hair, that she was always showing off. An old flame of yours I've been told.
#TESMAN.
Oh, that didn't last long; and it was before I met you, Hedda. But fancy her being in town!
#HEDDA.
It's odd that she should call upon us. I have scarcely seen her since we left school.
#TESMAN.
I haven't see her either for - heaven knows how long. I wonder how she can endure to live in such an out - of - the way hole - eh?
#HEDDA.
Tell me, Tesman - isn't it somewhere near there that he - that - Eilert Lovborg is living?
#TESMAN.
Yes, he is somewhere in that part of the country. enters by the hall door.
#BERTA.
That lady, ma'am, that brought some flowers a little while ago, is here again. The flowers you have in your hand, ma'am.
#HEDDA.
Ah, is she? Well, please show her in. opens the door for MRS. ELVSTED, and goes out herself. - MRS. ELVSTED is a woman of fragile figure, with pretty, soft features. Her eyes are light blue, large, round, and somewhat prominent, with a startled, inquiring expression. Her hair is remarkably light, almost flaxen, and unusually abundant and wavy. She is a couple of years younger than
#HEDDA.
She wears a dark visiting dress, tasteful, but not quite in the latest fashion.
#HEDDA.
How do you do, my dear Mrs. Elvsted? It's delightful to see you again.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, it's a very long time since we met.
#TESMAN.
And we too - eh?
#HEDDA.
Thanks for your lovely flowers -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, not at all - I would have come straight here yesterday afternoon; but I heard that you were away -
#TESMAN.
Have you just come to town? Eh?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
I arrived yesterday, about midday. Oh, I was quite in despair when I heard that you were not at home.
#HEDDA.
In despair! How so?
#TESMAN.
Why, my dear Mrs. Rysing - I mean Mrs. Elvsted -
#HEDDA.
I hope that you are not in any trouble?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, I am. And I don't know another living creature here that I can turn to.
#HEDDA.
Come - let us sit here on the sofa -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, I am too restless to sit down.
#HEDDA.
Oh no, you're not. Come here.
#TESMAN.
Well? What is it, Mrs. Elvsted - ?
#HEDDA.
Has anything particular happened to you at home?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes - and no. Oh - I am so anxious you should not misunderstand me -
#HEDDA.
Then your best plan is to tell us the whole story, Mrs. Elvsted.
#TESMAN.
I suppose that's what you have come for - eh?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, yes - of course it is. Well then, I must tell you - if you don't already know - that Eilert Lovborg is in town, too.
#HEDDA.
Lovborg - !
#TESMAN.
What! Has Eilert Lovborg come back? Fancy that, Hedda!
#HEDDA.
Well well - I hear it.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
He has been here a week already. Just fancy - a whole week! In this terrible town, alone! With so many temptations on all sides.
#HEDDA.
But, my dear Mrs. Elvsted - how does he concern you so much?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
He was the children's tutor.
#HEDDA.
Your children's?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
My husband's. I have none.
#HEDDA.
Your step - children's, then?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes.
#TESMAN.
Then was he - I don't know how to express it - was he - regular enough in his habits to be fit for the post? Eh?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
For the last two years his conduct has been irreproachable.
#TESMAN.
Has it indeed? Fancy that, Hedda!
#HEDDA.
I hear it.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Perfectly irreproachable, I assure you! In every respect. But all the same - now that I know he is here - in this great town - and with a large sum of money in his hands - I can't help being in mortal fear for him.
#TESMAN.
Why did he not remain where he was? With you and your husband? Eh?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
After his book was published he was too restless and unsettled to remain with us.
#TESMAN.
Yes, by - the - bye, Aunt Julia told me he had published a new book.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, a big book, dealing with the march of civilisation - in broad outline, as it were. It came out about a fortnight ago. And since it has sold so well, and been so much read - and made such a sensation -
#TESMAN.
Has it indeed? It must be something he has had lying by since his better days.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Long ago, you mean?
#TESMAN.
Yes.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No, he has written it all since he has been with us - within the last year.
#TESMAN.
Isn't that good news, Hedda? Think of that.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Ah yes, if only it would last!
#HEDDA.
Have you seen him here in town?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No, not yet. I have had the greatest difficulty in finding out his address. But this morning I discovered it at last.
#HEDDA.
Do you know, it seems to me a little odd of your husband - h'm -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Of my husband! What?
#HEDDA.
That he should send you to town on such an errand - that he does not come himself and look after his friend.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh no, no - my husband has no time. And besides, I - I had some shopping to do.
#HEDDA.
Ah, that is a different matter.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
And now I beg and implore you, Mr. Tesman - receive Eilert Lovborg kindly if he comes to you! And that he is sure to do. You see you were such great friends in the old days. And then you are interested in the same studies - the same branch of science - so far as I can understand.
#TESMAN.
We used to be at any rate.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
That is why I beg so earnestly that you - you too - will keep a sharp eye upon him. Oh, you will promise me that, Mr. Tesman - won't you?
#TESMAN.
With the greatest of pleasure, Mrs. Rysing -
#HEDDA.
Elvsted.
#TESMAN.
I assure you I shall do all I possibly can for Eilert. You may rely upon me.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, how very, very kind of you! Thanks, thanks, thanks! You see, my husband is so very fond of him!
#HEDDA.
You ought to write to him, Tesman. Perhaps he may not care to come to you of his own accord.
#TESMAN.
Well, perhaps it would be the right thing to do, Hedda? Eh?
#HEDDA.
And the sooner the better. Why not at once?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, if you only would!
#TESMAN.
I'll write this moment. Have you his address, Mrs. - Mrs. Elvsted.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes. Here it is.
#TESMAN.
Good, good. Then I'll go in - By - the - bye, - my slippers? Oh, here.
#HEDDA.
Be sure you write him a cordial, friendly letter. And a good long one too.
#TESMAN.
Yes, I will.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
But please, please don't say a word to show that I have suggested it.
#TESMAN.
No, how could you think I would? Eh?
#HEDDA.
There! We have killed two birds with one stone.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
What do you mean?
#HEDDA.
Could you not see that I wanted him to go?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, to write the letter -
#HEDDA.
And that I might speak to you alone.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
About the same thing?
#HEDDA.
Precisely.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
But there is nothing more, Mrs. Tesman! Absolutely nothing!
#HEDDA.
Oh yes, but there is. There is a great deal more - I can see that. Sit here - and we'll have a cosy, confidential chat.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
But, my dear Mrs. Tesman - I was really on the point of going.
#HEDDA.
Oh, you can't be in such a hurry. - Well? Now tell me something about your life at home.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, that is just what I care least to speak about.
#HEDDA.
But to me, dear - ? Why, weren't we schoolfellows?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, but you were in the class above me. Oh, how dreadfully afraid of you I was then!
#HEDDA.
Afraid of me?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, dreadfully. For when we met on the stairs you used always to pull my hair.
#HEDDA.
Did I, really?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, and once you said you would burn it off my head.
#HEDDA.
Oh that was all nonsense, of course.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, but I was so silly in those days. - And since then, too - we have drifted so far - far apart from each other. Our circles have been so entirely different.
#HEDDA.
Well then, we must try to drift together again. Now listen. At school we said du to each other; and we called each other by our Christian names -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No, I am sure you must be mistaken.
#HEDDA.
No, not at all! I can remember quite distinctly. So now we are going to renew our old friendship. There now! You must say du to me and call me Hedda.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, how good and kind you are! I am not used to such kindness.
#HEDDA.
There, there, there! And I shall say du to you, as in the old days, and call you my dear Thora.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
My name is Thea.
#HEDDA.
Why, of course! I meant Thea. So you are not accustomed to goodness and kindness, Thea? Not in your own home?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, if I only had a home! But I haven't any; I have never had a home.
#HEDDA.
I almost suspected as much.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes - yes - yes.
#HEDDA.
I don't quite remember - was it not as housekeeper that you first went to Mr. Elvsted's?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
I really went as governess. But his wife - his late wife - was an invalid, - and rarely left her room. So I had to look after the housekeeping as well.
#HEDDA.
And then - at last - you became mistress of the house.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, I did.
#HEDDA.
Let me see - about how long ago was that?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
My marriage?
#HEDDA.
Yes.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Five years ago.
#HEDDA.
To be sure; it must be that.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh those five years - ! Or at all events the last two or three of them! Oh, if you could only imagine -
#HEDDA.
De? Fie, Thea!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, yes, I will try - Well, if - you could only imagine and understand -
#HEDDA.
Eilert Lovborg has been in your neighbourhood about three years, hasn't he?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Eilert Lovborg? Yes - he has.
#HEDDA.
Had you known him before, in town here?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Scarcely at all. I mean - I knew him by name of course.
#HEDDA.
But you saw a good deal of him in the country?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, he came to us every day. You see, he gave the children lessons; for in the long run I couldn't manage it all myself.
#HEDDA.
No, that's clear. - And your husband - ? I suppose he is often away from home?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes. Being sheriff, you know, he has to travel about a good deal in his district.
#HEDDA.
Thea - my poor, sweet Thea - now you must tell me everything - exactly as it stands.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Well, then you must question me.
#HEDDA.
What sort of a man is your husband, Thea? I mean - you know - in everyday life. Is he kind to you?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
I am sure he means well in everything.
#HEDDA.
I should think he must be altogether too old for you. There is at least twenty years' difference between you, is there not?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, that is true, too. Everything about him is repellent to me! We have not a thought in common. We have no single point of sympathy - he and I.
#HEDDA.
But is he not fond of you all the same? In his own way?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh I really don't know. I think he regards me simply as a useful property. And then it doesn't cost much to keep me. I am not expensive.
#HEDDA.
That is stupid of you.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
It cannot be otherwise - not with him. I don't think he really cares for any one but himself - and perhaps a little for the children.
#HEDDA.
And for Eilert Lovborg, Thea?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
For Eilert Lovborg? What puts that into your head?
#HEDDA.
Well, my dear - I should say, when he sends you after him all the way to town - And besides, you said so yourself, to Tesman.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Did I? Yes, I suppose I did. No - I may just as well make a clean breast of it at once! For it must all come out in any case.
#HEDDA.
Why, my dear Thea - ?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Well, to make a long story short: My husband did not know that I was coming.
#HEDDA.
What! Your husband didn't know it!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No, of course not. For that matter, he was away from home himself - he was travelling. Oh, I could bear it no longer, Hedda! I couldn't indeed - so utterly alone as I should have been in future.
#HEDDA.
Well? And then?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
So I put together some of my things - what I needed most - as quietly as possible. And then I left the house.
#HEDDA.
Without a word?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes - and took the train to town.
#HEDDA.
Why, my dear, good Thea - to think of you daring to do it!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
What else could I possibly do?
#HEDDA.
But what do you think your husband will say when you go home again?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Back to him?
#HEDDA.
Of course.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
I shall never go back to him again.
#HEDDA.
Then you have left your home - for good and all?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes. There was nothing else to be done.
#HEDDA.
But then - to take flight so openly.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, it's impossible to keep things of that sort secret.
#HEDDA.
But what do you think people will say of you, Thea?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
They may say what they like, for aught I care. I have done nothing but what I had to do.
#HEDDA.
And what are your plans now? What do you think of doing.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
I don't know yet. I only know this, that I must live here, where Eilert Lovborg is - if I am to live at all.
#HEDDA.
My dear Thea - how did this - this friendship - between you and Eilert Lovborg come about?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh it grew up gradually. I gained a sort of influence over him.
#HEDDA.
Indeed?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
He gave up his old habits. Not because I asked him to, for I never dared do that. But of course he saw how repulsive they were to me; and so he dropped them.
#HEDDA.
Then you have reclaimed him - as the saying goes - my little Thea.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
So he says himself, at any rate. And he, on his side, has made a real human being of me - taught me to think, and to understand so many things.
#HEDDA.
Did he give you lessons too, then?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No, not exactly lessons. But he talked to me - talked about such an infinity of things. And then came the lovely, happy time when I began to share in his work - when he allowed me to help him!
#HEDDA.
Oh he did, did he?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes! He never wrote anything without my assistance.
#HEDDA.
You were two good comrades, in fact?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Comrades! Yes, fancy, Hedda - that is the very word he used! - Oh, I ought to feel perfectly happy; and yet I cannot; for I don't know how long it will last.
#HEDDA.
Are you no surer of him than that?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
A woman's shadow stands between Eilert Lovborg and me.
#HEDDA.
Who can that be?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
I don't know. Some one he knew in his - in his past. Some one he has never been able wholly to forget.
#HEDDA.
What has he told you - about this?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
He has only once - quite vaguely - alluded to it.
#HEDDA.
Well! And what did he say?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
He said that when they parted, she threatened to shoot him with a pistol.
#HEDDA.
Oh nonsense! No one does that sort of thing here.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No. And that is why I think it must have been that red - haired singing - woman whom he once -
#HEDDA.
Yes, very likely.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
For I remember they used to say of her that she carried loaded firearms.
#HEDDA.
Oh - then of course it must have been she.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
And now just fancy, Hedda - I hear that this singing - woman - that she is in town again! Oh, I don't know what to do -
#HEDDA.
Hush! Here comes Tesman. Thea - all this must remain between you and me.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh yes - yes! For heaven's sake - ! TESMAN, with a letter in his hand, comes from the right through the inner room.
#TESMAN.
There now - the epistle is finished.
#HEDDA.
That's right. And now Mrs. Elvsted is just going. Wait a moment - I'll go with you to the garden gate.
#TESMAN.
Do you think Berta could post the letter, Hedda dear?
#HEDDA.
I will tell her to. enters from the hall.
#BERTA.
Judge Brack wishes to know if Mrs. Tesman will receive him.
#HEDDA.
Yes, ask Judge Brack to come in. And look here - put this letter in the post.
#BERTA.
Yes, ma'am.
#JUDGE BRACK.
May one venture to call so early in the day?
#HEDDA.
Of course one may.
#TESMAN.
You are welcome at any time. Judge Brack - Miss Rysing -
#HEDDA.
Oh - !
#JUDGE BRACK.
Ah - delighted -
#HEDDA.
It's nice to have a look at you by daylight, Judge!
#JUDGE BRACK.
So you find me - altered? little younger, I think.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Thank you so much.
#TESMAN.
But what do you think of Hedda - eh? Doesn't she look flourishing? She has actually -
#HEDDA.
Oh, do leave me alone. You haven't thanked Judge Brack for all the trouble he has taken -
#JUDGE BRACK.
Oh, nonsense - it was a pleasure to me -
#HEDDA.
Yes, you are a friend indeed. But here stands Thea all impatience to be off - so au revoir Judge. I shall be back again presently.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, - is your wife tolerably satisfied -
#TESMAN.
Yes, we can't thank you sufficiently. Of course she talks of a little re - arrangement here and there; and one or two things are still wanting. We shall have to buy some additional trifles.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Indeed!
#TESMAN.
But we won't trouble you about these things. Hedda says she herself will look after what is wanting. - Shan't we sit down? Eh?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Thanks, for a moment. There is something I wanted to speak to you about, my dear Tesman.
#TESMAN.
Indeed? Ah, I understand! I suppose it's the serious part of the frolic that is coming now. Eh?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Oh, the money question is not so very pressing; though, for that matter, I wish we had gone a little more economically to work.
#TESMAN.
But that would never have done, you know! Think of Hedda, my dear fellow! You, who know her so well - ! I couldn't possibly ask her to put up with a shabby style of living!
#JUDGE BRACK.
No, no - that is just the difficulty.
#TESMAN.
And then - fortunately - it can't be long before I receive my appointment.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, you see - such things are often apt to hang fire for a long time.
#TESMAN.
Have you heard anything definite? Eh?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Nothing exactly definite - But by - the - bye - I have one piece of news for you.
#TESMAN.
Well?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Your old friend, Eilert Lovborg, has returned to town.
#TESMAN.
I know that already.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Indeed! How did you learn it?
#TESMAN.
From that lady who went out with Hedda.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Really? What was her name? I didn't quite catch it.
#TESMAN.
Mrs. Elvsted.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Aha - Sheriff Elvsted's wife? Of course - he has been living up in their regions.
#TESMAN.
And fancy - I'm delighted to hear that he is quite a reformed character.
#JUDGE BRACK.
So they say.
#TESMAN.
And then he has published a new book - eh?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes, indeed he has.
#TESMAN.
And I hear it has made some sensation!
#JUDGE BRACK.
Quite an unusual sensation.
#TESMAN.
Fancy - isn't that good news! A man of such extraordinary talents - I felt so grieved to think that he had gone irretrievably to ruin.
#JUDGE BRACK.
That was what everybody thought.
#TESMAN.
But I cannot imagine what he will take to now! How in the world will he be able to make his living? Eh?
#HEDDA.
Tesman is for ever worrying about how people are to make their living.
#TESMAN.
Well you see, dear - we were talking about poor Eilert Lovborg.
#HEDDA.
Oh, indeed? What is the matter with him?
#TESMAN.
Well - no doubt he has run through all his property long ago; and he can scarcely write a new book every year - eh? So I really can't see what is to become of him.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Perhaps I can give you some information on that point.
#TESMAN.
Indeed!
#JUDGE BRACK.
You must remember that his relations have a good deal of influence.
#TESMAN.
Oh, his relations, unfortunately, have entirely washed their hands of him.
#JUDGE BRACK.
At one time they called him the hope of the family.
#TESMAN.
At one time, yes! But he has put an end to all that.
#HEDDA.
Who knows? I hear they have reclaimed him up at Sheriff Elvsted's -
#JUDGE BRACK.
And then this book that he has published -
#TESMAN.
Well well, I hope to goodness they may find something for him to do. I have just written to him. I asked him to come and see us this evening, Hedda dear.
#JUDGE BRACK.
But my dear fellow, you are booked for my bachelor's party this evening. You promised on the pier last night.
#HEDDA.
Had you forgotten, Tesman?
#TESMAN.
Yes, I had utterly forgotten.
#JUDGE BRACK.
But it doesn't matter, for you may be sure he won't come.
#TESMAN.
What makes you think that? Eh?
#JUDGE BRACK.
My dear Tesman - and you too, Mrs. Tesman - I think I ought not to keep you in the dark about something that - that -
#TESMAN.
That concerns Eilert - ?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Both you and him.
#TESMAN.
Well, my dear Judge, out with it.
#JUDGE BRACK.
You must be prepared to find your appointment deferred longer than you desired or expected.
#TESMAN.
Is there some hitch about it? Eh?
#JUDGE BRACK.
The nomination may perhaps be made conditional on the result of a competition -
#TESMAN.
Competition! Think of that, Hedda!
#HEDDA.
Aha - aha!
#TESMAN.
But who can my competitor be? Surely not - ?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes, precisely - Eilert Lovborg.
#TESMAN.
No, no - it's quite impossible! Eh?
#JUDGE BRACK.
H'm - that is what it may come to, all the same.
#TESMAN.
Well but, Judge Brack - it would show the most incredible lack of consideration for me. For - just think - I'm a married man! We have married on the strength of these prospects, Hedda and I; and run deep into debt; and borrowed money from Aunt Julia too. Good heavens, they had as good as promised me the appointment. Eh?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, well, well - no doubt you will get it in the end; only after a contest.
#HEDDA.
Fancy, Tesman, there will be a sort of sporting interest in that.
#TESMAN.
Why, my dearest Hedda, how can you be so indifferent about it?
#HEDDA.
I am not at all indifferent. I am most eager to see who wins.
#JUDGE BRACK.
In any case, Mrs. Tesman, it is best that you should know how matters stand. I mean - before you set about the little purchases I hear you are threatening.
#HEDDA.
This can make no difference.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Indeed! Then I have no more to say. Good - bye! I shall look in on my way back from my afternoon walk, and take you home with me.
#TESMAN.
Oh yes, yes - your news has quite upset me.
#HEDDA.
Good - bye, Judge; and be sure you call in the afternoon.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Many thanks. Good - bye, good - bye!
#TESMAN.
Good - bye my dear Judge! You must really excuse me -
#TESMAN.
Oh Hedda - one should never rush into adventures. Eh?
#HEDDA.
Do you do that?
#TESMAN.
Yes, dear - there is no denying - it was adventurous to go and marry and set up house upon mere expectations.
#HEDDA.
Perhaps you are right there.
#TESMAN.
Well - at all events, we have our delightful home, Hedda! Fancy, the home we both dreamed of - the home we were in love with, I may almost say. Eh?
#HEDDA.
It was part of our compact that we were to go into society - to keep open house.
#TESMAN.
Yes, if you only knew how I had been looking forward to it! Fancy - to see you as hostess - in a select circle! Eh? Well, well, well - for the present we shall have to get on without society, Hedda - only to invite Aunt Julia now and then. - Oh, I intended you to lead such an utterly different life, dear - !
#HEDDA.
Of course I cannot have my man in livery just yet.
#TESMAN.
Oh, no, unfortunately. It would be out of the question for us to keep a footman, you know.
#HEDDA.
And the saddle - horse I was to have had -
#TESMAN.
The saddle - horse!
#HEDDA.
- I suppose I must not think of that now.
#TESMAN.
Good heavens, no! - that's as clear as daylight!
#HEDDA.
Well, I shall have one thing at least to kill time with in the meanwhile.
#TESMAN.
Oh thank heaven for that! What is it, Hedda. Eh?
#HEDDA.
My pistols, George.
#TESMAN.
Your pistols!
#HEDDA.
General Gabler's pistols.
#TESMAN.
No, for heaven's sake, Hedda darling - don't touch those dangerous things! For my sake Hedda! Eh?
#HEDDA.
So you are here again, Judge!
#JUDGE BRACK.
As you see, Mrs. Tesman!
#HEDDA.
Now I'll shoot you, Judge Brack!
#JUDGE BRACK.
No, no, no! Don't stand aiming at me!
#HEDDA.
This is what comes of sneaking in by the back way.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Are you out of your senses - !
#HEDDA.
Dear me - did I happen to hit you?
#JUDGE BRACK.
I wish you would let these pranks alone!
#HEDDA.
Come in then, Judge. BRACK, dressed as though for a men's party, enters by the glass door. He carries a light overcoat over his arm.
#JUDGE BRACK.
What the deuce - haven't you tired of that sport, yet? What are you shooting at?
#HEDDA.
Oh, I am only firing in the air.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Allow me, madam! Ah - I know this pistol well! Where is the case? Ah, here it is. Now we won't play at that game any more to - day.
#HEDDA.
Then what in heaven's name would you have me do with myself?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Have you had no visitors?
#HEDDA.
Not one. I suppose all our set are still out of town.
#JUDGE BRACK.
And is Tesman not at home either?
#HEDDA.
No. He rushed off to his aunt's directly after lunch; he didn't expect you so early.
#JUDGE BRACK.
H'm - how stupid of me not to have thought of that!
#HEDDA.
Why stupid?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Because if I had thought of it I should have come a little - earlier.
#HEDDA.
Then you would have found no one to receive you; for I have been in my room changing my dress ever since lunch.
#JUDGE BRACK.
And is there no sort of little chink that we could hold a parley through?
#HEDDA.
You have forgotten to arrange one.
#JUDGE BRACK.
That was another piece of stupidity.
#HEDDA.
Well, we must just settle down here - and wait. Tesman is not likely to be back for some time yet.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Never mind; I shall not be impatient. seats herself in the corner of the sofa. BRACK lays his overcoat over the back of the nearest chair, and sits down, but keeps his hat in his hand. A short silence. They look at each other.
#HEDDA.
Well?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well?
#HEDDA.
I spoke first.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Come, let us have a cosy little chat, Mrs. Hedda.
#HEDDA.
Does it not seem like a whole eternity since our last talk? Of course I don't count those few words yesterday evening and this morning.
#JUDGE BRACK.
You mean since our last confidential talk? Our last tete - a - tete?
#HEDDA.
Well yes - since you put it so.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Not a day passed but I have wished that you were home again.
#HEDDA.
And I have done nothing but wish the same thing.
#JUDGE BRACK.
You? Really, Mrs. Hedda? And I thought you had been enjoying your tour so much!
#HEDDA.
Oh yes, you may be sure of that!
#JUDGE BRACK.
But Tesman's letters spoke of nothing but happiness.
#HEDDA.
Oh, Tesman! You see, he thinks nothing is so delightful as grubbing in libraries and making copies of old parchments, or whatever you call them.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, that is his vocation in life - or part of it at any rate.
#HEDDA.
Yes, of course; and no doubt when it's your vocation - But I! Oh, my dear Mr. Brack, how mortally bored I have been.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Do you really say so? In downright earnest?
#HEDDA.
Yes, you can surely understand it - ! To go for six whole months without meeting a soul that knew anything of our circle, or could talk about things we were interested in.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes, yes - I too should feel that a deprivation.
#HEDDA.
And then, what I found most intolerable of all -
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well?
#HEDDA.
- was being everlastingly in the company of - one and the same person -
#JUDGE BRACK.
Morning, noon, and night, yes - at all possible times and seasons.
#HEDDA.
I said "everlastingly."
#JUDGE BRACK.
Just so. But I should have thought, with our excellent Tesman, one could -
#HEDDA.
Tesman is - a specialist, my dear Judge.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Undeniable.
#HEDDA.
And specialists are not at all amusing to travel with. Not in the long run at any rate.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Not even - the specialist one happens to love?
#HEDDA.
Faugh - don't use that sickening word!
#JUDGE BRACK.
What do you say, Mrs. Hedda?
#HEDDA.
You should just try it! To hear of nothing but the history of civilisation, morning, noon, and night -
#JUDGE BRACK.
Everlastingly.
#HEDDA.
Yes yes yes! And then all this about the domestic industry of the middle ages - ! That's the most disgusting part of it!
#JUDGE BRACK.
But tell me - in that case, how am I to understand your - ? H'm -
#HEDDA.
My accepting George Tesman, you mean?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, let us put it so.
#HEDDA.
Good heavens, do you see anything so wonderful in that?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes and no - Mrs. Hedda.
#HEDDA.
I had positively danced myself tired, my dear Judge. My day was done - Oh no - I won't say that; nor think it either!
#JUDGE BRACK.
You have assuredly no reason to.
#HEDDA.
Oh, reasons - And George Tesman - after all, you must admit that he is correctness itself.
#JUDGE BRACK.
His correctness and respectability are beyond all question.
#HEDDA.
And I don't see anything absolutely ridiculous about him. - Do you?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Ridiculous? N - no - I shouldn't exactly say so -
#HEDDA.
Well - and his powers of research, at all events, are untiring. - I see no reason why he should not one day come to the front, after all.
#JUDGE BRACK.
I thought that you, like every one else, expected him to attain the highest distinction.
#HEDDA.
Yes, so I did. - And then, since he was bent, at all hazards, on being allowed to provide for me - I really don't know why I should not have accepted his offer?
#JUDGE BRACK.
No - if you look at it in that light -
#HEDDA.
It was more than my other adorers were prepared to do for me, my dear Judge.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, I can't answer for all the rest; but as for myself, you know quite well that I have always entertained a - a certain respect for the marriage tie - for marriage as an institution, Mrs. Hedda.
#HEDDA.
Oh, I assure you I have never cherished any hopes with respect to you.
#JUDGE BRACK.
All I require is a pleasant and intimate interior, where I can make myself useful in every way, and am free to come and go as - as a trusted friend -
#HEDDA.
Of the master of the house, do you mean?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Frankly - of the mistress first of all; but of course of the master too, in the second place. Such a triangular friendship - if I may call it so - is really a great convenience for all the parties, let me tell you.
#HEDDA.
Yes, I have many a time longed for some one to make a third on our travels. Oh - those railway - carriage tete - a - tetes - !
#JUDGE BRACK.
Fortunately your wedding journey is over now.
#HEDDA.
Not by a long - long way. I have only arrived at a station on the line.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, then the passengers jump out and move about a little, Mrs. Hedda.
#HEDDA.
I never jump out.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Really?
#HEDDA.
No - because there is always some one standing by to -
#JUDGE BRACK.
To look at your ankles, do you mean?
#HEDDA.
Precisely.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well but, dear me -
#HEDDA.
I won't have it. I would rather keep my seat where I happen to be - and continue the tete - a - tete.
#JUDGE BRACK.
But suppose a third person were to jump in and join the couple.
#HEDDA.
Ah - that is quite another matter! trusted, sympathetic friend -
#HEDDA.
- with a fund of conversation on all sorts of lively topics -
#JUDGE BRACK.
- and not the least bit of a specialist!
#HEDDA.
Yes, that would be a relief indeed.
#JUDGE BRACK.
The triangle is completed.
#HEDDA.
And on goes the train. TESMAN, in a grey walking - suit, with a soft felt hat, enters from the hall. He has a number of unbound books under his arm and in his pockets.
#TESMAN.
Ouf - what a load for a warm day - all these books. I'm positively perspiring, Hedda. Hallo - are you there already, my dear Judge? Eh? Berta didn't tell me.
#JUDGE BRACK.
I came in through the garden.
#HEDDA.
What books have you got there?
#TESMAN.
Some new books on my special subjects - quite indispensable to me.
#HEDDA.
Your special subjects?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes, books on his special subjects, Mrs. Tesman.
#HEDDA.
Do you need still more books on your special subjects?
#TESMAN.
Yes, my dear Hedda, one can never have too many of them. Of course one must keep up with all that is written and published.
#HEDDA.
Yes, I suppose one must.
#TESMAN.
And look here - I have got hold of Eilert Lovborg's new book too. Perhaps you would like to glance through it, Hedda? Eh?
#HEDDA.
No, thank you. Or rather - afterwards perhaps.
#TESMAN.
I looked into it a little on the way home.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, what do you think of it - as a specialist?
#TESMAN.
I think it shows quite remarkable soundness of judgment. He never wrote like that before. Now I shall take all these into my study. I'm longing to cut the leaves - ! And then I must change my clothes. I suppose we needn't start just yet? Eh?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Oh, dear no - there is not the slightest hurry.
#TESMAN.
Well then, I will take my time. By - the - bye, Hedda - Aunt Julia is not coming this evening.
#HEDDA.
Not coming? Is it that affair of the bonnet that keeps her away?
#TESMAN.
Oh, not at all. How could you think such a thing of Aunt Julia? Just fancy - ! The fact is, Aunt Rina is very ill.
#HEDDA.
She always is.
#TESMAN.
Yes, but to - day she is much worse than usual, poor dear.
#HEDDA.
Oh, then it's only natural that her sister should remain with her. I must bear my disappointment.
#TESMAN.
And you can't imagine, dear, how delighted Aunt Julia seemed to be - because you had come home looking so flourishing!
#HEDDA.
Oh, those everlasting Aunts!
#TESMAN.
What?
#HEDDA.
Nothing.
#TESMAN.
Oh, all right.
#JUDGE BRACK.
What bonnet were you talking about?
#HEDDA.
Oh, it was a little episode with Miss Tesman this morning. She had laid down her bonnet on the chair there - and I pretended to think it was the servant's.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Now my dear Mrs. Hedda, how could you do such a thing? To the excellent old lady, too!
#HEDDA.
Well, you see - these impulses come over me all of a sudden; and I cannot resist them. Oh, I don't know how to explain it.
#JUDGE BRACK.
You are not really happy - that is at the bottom of it.
#HEDDA.
I know of no reason why I should be - happy. Perhaps you can give me one?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well - amongst other things, because you have got exactly the home you had set your heart on.
#HEDDA.
Do you too believe in that legend?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Is there nothing in it, then?
#HEDDA.
Oh yes, there is something in it.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well?
#HEDDA.
There is this in it, that I made use of Tesman to see me home from evening parties last summer -
#JUDGE BRACK.
I, unfortunately, had to go quite a different way.
#HEDDA.
That's true. I know you were going a different way last summer.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Oh fie, Mrs. Hedda! Well, then - you and Tesman - ?
#HEDDA.
Well, we happened to pass here one evening; Tesman, poor fellow, was writhing in the agony of having to find conversation; so I took pity on the learned man -
#JUDGE BRACK.
You took pity? H'm -
#HEDDA.
Yes, I really did. And so - to help him out of his torment - I happened to say, in pure thoughtlessness, that I should like to live in this villa.
#JUDGE BRACK.
No more than that?
#HEDDA.
Not that evening.
#JUDGE BRACK.
But afterwards?
#HEDDA.
Yes, my thoughtlessness had consequences, my dear Judge.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Unfortunately that too often happens, Mrs. Hedda.
#HEDDA.
Thanks! So you see it was this enthusiasm for Secretary Falk's villa that first constituted a bond of sympathy between George Tesman and me. From that came our engagement and our marriage, and our wedding journey, and all the rest of it. Well, well, my dear Judge - as you make your bed so you must lie, I could almost say.
#JUDGE BRACK.
This is exquisite! And you really cared not a rap about it all the time?
#HEDDA.
No, heaven knows I didn't.
#JUDGE BRACK.
But now? Now that we have made it so homelike for you?
#HEDDA.
Uh - the rooms all seem to smell of lavender and dried rose - leaves. - But perhaps it's Aunt Julia that has brought that scent with her.
#JUDGE BRACK.
No, I think it must be a legacy from the late Mrs. Secretary Falk.
#HEDDA.
Yes, there is an odour of mortality about it. It reminds me of a bouquet - the day after the ball. Oh, my dear Judge - you cannot imagine how horribly I shall bore myself here.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Why should not you, too, find some sort of vocation in life, Mrs. Hedda? vocation - that should attract me?
#JUDGE BRACK.
If possible, of course.
#HEDDA.
Heaven knows what sort of a vocation that could be. I often wonder whether - But that would never do either.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Who can tell? Let me hear what it is.
#HEDDA.
Whether I might not get Tesman to go into politics, I mean.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Tesman? No really now, political life is not the thing for him - not at all in his line.
#HEDDA.
No, I daresay not. - But if I could get him into it all the same?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Why - what satisfaction could you find in that? If he is not fitted for that sort of thing, why should you want to drive him into it?
#HEDDA.
Because I am bored, I tell you! So you think it quite out of the question that Tesman should ever get into the ministry?
#JUDGE BRACK.
H'm - you see, my dear Mrs. Hedda - to get into the ministry, he would have to be a tolerably rich man.
#HEDDA.
Yes, there we have it! It is this genteel poverty I have managed to drop into - ! That is what makes life so pitiable! So utterly ludicrous! - For that's what it is.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Now I should say the fault lay elsewhere.
#HEDDA.
Where, then?
#JUDGE BRACK.
You have never gone through any really stimulating experience.
#HEDDA.
Anything serious, you mean?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes, you may call it so. But now you may perhaps have one in store.
#HEDDA.
Oh, you're thinking of the annoyances about this wretched professorship! But that must be Tesman's own affair. I assure you I shall not waste a thought upon it.
#JUDGE BRACK.
No, no, I daresay not. But suppose now that what people call - in elegant language - a solemn responsibility were to come upon you? A new responsibility, Mrs. Hedda?
#HEDDA.
Be quiet! Nothing of that sort will ever happen!
#JUDGE BRACK.
We will speak of this again a year hence - at the very outside.
#HEDDA.
I have no turn for anything of the sort, Judge Brack. No responsibilities for me!
#JUDGE BRACK.
Are you so unlike the generality of women as to have no turn for duties which - ?
#HEDDA.
Oh, be quiet, I tell you! - I often think there is only one thing in the world I have any turn for.
#JUDGE BRACK.
And what is that, if I may ask?
#HEDDA.
Boring myself to death. Now you know it. Yes, as I thought! Here comes the Professor.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Come, come, come, Mrs. Hedda! TESMAN, dressed for the party, with his gloves and hat in his hand, enters from the right through the inner room.
#TESMAN.
Hedda, has no message come from Eilert Lovborg? Eh?
#HEDDA.
No.
#TESMAN.
Then you'll see he'll be here presently.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Do you really think he will come?
#TESMAN.
Yes, I am almost sure of it. For what you were telling us this morning must have been a mere floating rumour.
#JUDGE BRACK.
You think so?
#TESMAN.
At any rate, Aunt Julia said she did not believe for a moment that he would ever stand in my way again. Fancy that!
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well then, that's all right.
#TESMAN.
Yes, but you must really let me wait for him as long as possible.
#JUDGE BRACK.
We have plenty of time yet. None of my guests will arrive before seven or half - past.
#TESMAN.
Then meanwhile we can keep Hedda company, and see what happens. Eh?
#HEDDA.
And at the worst Mr. Lovborg can remain here with me.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Oh, allow me, Mrs. Tesman! - What do you mean by "At the worst"?
#HEDDA.
If he won't go with you and Tesman.
#TESMAN.
But, Hedda dear - do you think it would quite do for him to remain here with you? Eh? Remember, Aunt Julia can't come.
#HEDDA.
No, but Mrs. Elvsted is coming. We three can have a cup of tea together.
#TESMAN.
Oh yes, that will be all right.
#JUDGE BRACK.
And that would perhaps be the safest plan for him.
#HEDDA.
Why so?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, you know, Mrs. Tesman, how you used to gird at my little bachelor parties. You declared they were adapted only for men of the strictest principles.
#HEDDA.
But no doubt Mr. Lovborg's principles are strict enough now. A converted sinner -
#BERTA.
There's a gentleman asking if you are at home, ma'am -
#HEDDA.
Well, show him in.
#TESMAN.
I'm sure it is he! Fancy that! enters from the hall. He is slim and lean; of the same age as TESMAN, but looks older and somewhat worn - out. His hair and beard are of a blackish brown, his face long and pale, but with patches of colour on the cheeks. He is dressed in a well - cut black visiting suit, quite new. He has dark gloves and a silk hat. He stops near the door, and makes a rapid bow, seeming somewhat embarrassed.
#TESMAN.
Well, my dear Eilert - so at last we meet again!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Thanks for your letter, Tesman. Will you too shake hands with me, Mrs. Tesman?
#HEDDA.
I am glad to see you, Mr. Lovborg. I don't know whether you two gentlemen - ?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Judge Brack, I think.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Oh yes, - in the old days -
#TESMAN.
And now you must make yourself entirely at home, Eilert! Mustn't he, Hedda? - For I hear you are going to settle in town again? Eh?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Yes, I am.
#TESMAN.
Quite right, quite right. Let me tell you, I have got hold of your new book; but I haven't had time to read it yet.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
You may spare yourself the trouble.
#TESMAN.
Why so?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Because there is very little in it.
#TESMAN.
Just fancy - how can you say so?
#JUDGE BRACK.
But it has been very much praised, I hear.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
That was what I wanted; so I put nothing into the book but what every one would agree with.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Very wise of you.
#TESMAN.
Well but, my dear Eilert - !
#EILERT LOVBORG.
For now I mean to win myself a position again - to make a fresh start.
#TESMAN.
Ah, that is what you wish to do? Eh?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
But when this one appears, George Tesman, you will have to read it. For this is the real book - the book I have put my true self into.
#TESMAN.
Indeed? And what is it?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
It is the continuation.
#TESMAN.
The continuation? Of what?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Of the book.
#TESMAN.
Of the new book?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Of course.
#TESMAN.
Why, my dear Eilert - does it not come down to our own days?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Yes, it does; and this one deals with the future.
#TESMAN.
With the future! But, good heavens, we know nothing of the future!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
No; but there is a thing or two to be said about it all the same. Look here -
#TESMAN.
Why, that's not your handwriting.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
I dictated it. It falls into two sections. The first deals with the civilising forces of the future. And here is the second - forecasting the probable line of development.
#TESMAN.
How odd now! I should never have thought of writing anything of that sort.
#HEDDA.
H'm - I daresay not.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
I brought it, thinking I might read you a little of it this evening.
#TESMAN.
That was very good of you, Eilert. But this evening - ?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Well then, some other time. There is no hurry.
#JUDGE BRACK.
I must tell you, Mr. Lovborg - there is a little gathering at my house this evening - mainly in honour of Tesman, you know -
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Oh - then I won't detain you -
#JUDGE BRACK.
No, but listen - will you not do me the favour of joining us?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
No, I can't - thank you very much.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Oh, nonsense - do! We shall be quite a select little circle. And I assure you we shall have a "lively time," as Mrs. Hed - as Mrs. Tesman says.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
I have no doubt of it. But nevertheless -
#JUDGE BRACK.
And then you might bring your manuscript with you, and read it to Tesman at my house. I could give you a room to yourselves.
#TESMAN.
Yes, think of that, Eilert, - why shouldn't you? Eh?
#HEDDA.
But, Tesman, if Mr. Lovborg would really rather not! I am sure Mr. Lovborg is much more inclined to remain here and have supper with me.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
With you, Mrs. Tesman?
#HEDDA.
And with Mrs. Elvsted.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Ah - I saw her for a moment this morning.
#HEDDA.
Did you? Well, she is coming this evening. So you see you are almost bound to remain, Mr. Lovborg, or she will have no one to see her home.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
That's true. Many thanks, Mrs. Tesman - in that case I will remain.
#HEDDA.
Then I have one or two orders to give the servant -
#TESMAN.
Tell me, Eilert - is it this new subject - the future - that you are going to lecture about?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Yes.
#TESMAN.
They told me at the bookseller's that you are going to deliver a course of lectures this autumn.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
That is my intention. I hope you won't take it ill, Tesman.
#TESMAN.
Oh no, not in the least! But - ?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
I can quite understand that it must be very disagreeable to you.
#TESMAN.
Oh, I can't expect you, out of consideration for me, to -
#EILERT LOVBORG.
But I shall wait till you have received your appointment.
#TESMAN.
Will you wait? Yes but - yes but - are you not going to compete with me? Eh?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
No; it is only the moral victory I care for.
#TESMAN.
Why, bless me - then Aunt Julia was right after all! Oh yes - I knew it! Hedda! Just fancy - Eilert Lovborg is not going to stand in our way!
#HEDDA.
Our way? Pray leave me out of the question.
#TESMAN.
And you, Judge Brack - what do you say to this? Eh?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, I say that a moral victory - h'm - may be all very fine -
#TESMAN.
Yes, certainly. But all the same -
#HEDDA.
You stand there looking as if you were thunderstruck -
#TESMAN.
Yes - so I am - I almost think -
#JUDGE BRACK.
Don't you see, Mrs. Tesman, a thunderstorm has just passed over?
#HEDDA.
Will you not take a glass of cold punch, gentlemen?
#JUDGE BRACK.
A stirrup - cup? Yes, it wouldn't come amiss. capital idea, Hedda! Just the thing! Now that the weight has been taken off my mind -
#HEDDA.
Will you not join them, Mr. Lovborg?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
No, thank you. Nothing for me.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Why bless me - cold punch is surely not poison.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Perhaps not for everyone.
#HEDDA.
I will keep Mr. Lovborg company in the meantime.
#TESMAN.
Yes, yes, Hedda dear, do.
#HEDDA.
Do you care to look at some photographs, Mr. Lovborg? You know Tesman and I made a tour in the Tyrol on our way home?
#HEDDA.
Do you see this range of mountains, Mr. Lovborg? It's the Ortler group. Tesman has written the name underneath. Here it is: "The Ortler group near Meran."
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Hedda - Gabler!
#HEDDA.
Ah! Hush!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Hedda Gabler!
#HEDDA.
That was my name in the old days - when we two knew each other.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
And I must teach myself never to say Hedda Gabler again - never, as long as I live.
#HEDDA.
Yes, you must. And I think you ought to practise in time. The sooner the better, I should say.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Hedda Gabler married? And married to - George Tesman!
#HEDDA.
Yes - so the world goes.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Oh, Hedda, Hedda - how could you throw yourself away!
#HEDDA.
What? I can't allow this!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
What do you mean?
#HEDDA.
And this is a view from the Val d'Ampezzo, Mr. Lovborg. Just look at these peaks! What's the name of these curious peaks, dear?
#TESMAN.
Let me see. Oh, those are the Dolomites.
#HEDDA.
Yes, that's it! - Those are the Dolomites, Mr. Lovborg.
#TESMAN.
Hedda, dear, - I only wanted to ask whether I shouldn't bring you a little punch after all? For yourself at any rate - eh?
#HEDDA.
Yes, do, please; and perhaps a few biscuits.
#TESMAN.
No cigarettes?
#HEDDA.
No.
#TESMAN.
Very well.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Answer me, Hedda - how could you go and do this?
#HEDDA.
If you continue to say du to me I won't talk to you.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
May I not say du even when we are alone?
#HEDDA.
No. You may think it; but you mustn't say it.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Ah, I understand. It is an offence against George Tesman, whom you - love.
#HEDDA.
Love? What an idea!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
You don't love him then!
#HEDDA.
But I won't hear of any sort of unfaithfulness! Remember that.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Hedda - answer me one thing -
#HEDDA.
Hush!
#TESMAN.
Here you are! Isn't this tempting?
#HEDDA.
Why do you bring it yourself?
#TESMAN.
Because I think it's such fun to wait upon you, Hedda.
#HEDDA.
But you have poured out two glasses. Mr. Lovborg said he wouldn't have any -
#TESMAN.
No, but Mrs. Elvsted will soon be here, won't she?
#HEDDA.
Yes, by - the - bye - Mrs. Elvsted -
#TESMAN.
Had you forgotten her? Eh?
#HEDDA.
We were so absorbed in these photographs. Do you remember this little village?
#TESMAN.
Oh, it's that one just below the Brenner Pass. It was there we passed the night -
#HEDDA.
- and met that lively party of tourists.
#TESMAN.
Yes, that was the place. Fancy - if we could only have had you with us, Eilert! Eh?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Answer me one thing, Hedda -
#HEDDA.
Well?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Was there no love in your friendship for me either? Not a spark - not a tinge of love in it?
#HEDDA.
I wonder if there was? To me it seems as though we were two good comrades - two thoroughly intimate friends. You especially were frankness itself.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
It was you that made me so.
#HEDDA.
As I look back upon it all, I think there was really something beautiful, something fascinating - something daring - in - in that secret intimacy - that comradeship which no living creature so much as dreamed of.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Yes, yes, Hedda! Was there not? - When I used to come to your father's in the afternoon - and the General sat over at the window reading his papers - with his back towards us -
#HEDDA.
And we two on the corner sofa -
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Always with the same illustrated paper before us -
#HEDDA.
For want of an album, yes.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Yes, Hedda, and when I made my confessions to you - told you about myself, things that at that time no one else knew! There I would sit and tell you of my escapades - my days and nights of devilment. Oh, Hedda - what was the power in you that forced me to confess these things?
#HEDDA.
Do you think it was any power in me?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
How else can I explain it? And all those - those roundabout questions you used to put to me -
#HEDDA.
Which you understood so particularly well -
#EILERT LOVBORG.
How could you sit and question me like that? Question me quite frankly -
#HEDDA.
In roundabout terms, please observe.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Yes, but frankly nevertheless. Cross - question me about - all that sort of thing?
#HEDDA.
And how could you answer, Mr. Lovborg?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Yes, that is just what I can't understand - in looking back upon it. But tell me now, Hedda - was there not love at the bottom of our friendship? On your side, did you not feel as though you might purge my stains away - if I made you my confessor? Was it not so?
#HEDDA.
No, not quite.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
What was you motive, then?
#HEDDA.
Do think it quite incomprehensible that a young girl - when it can be done - without any one knowing -
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Well?
#HEDDA.
- should be glad to have a peep, now and then, into a world which - ?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Which - ?
#HEDDA.
- which she is forbidden to know anything about?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
So that was it?
#HEDDA.
Partly. Partly - I almost think.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Comradeship in the thirst for life. But why should not that, at any rate, have continued?
#HEDDA.
The fault was yours.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
It was you that broke with me.
#HEDDA.
Yes, when our friendship threatened to develop into something more serious. Shame upon you, Eilert Lovborg! How could you think of wronging your - your frank comrade.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Oh, why did you not carry out your threat? Why did you not shoot me down?
#HEDDA.
Because I have such a dread of scandal.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Yes, Hedda, you are a coward at heart. terrible coward. But it was a lucky thing for you. And now you have found ample consolation at the Elvsteds'.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
I know what Thea has confided to you.
#HEDDA.
And perhaps you have confided to her something about us?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Not a word. She is too stupid to understand anything of that sort.
#HEDDA.
Stupid?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
She is stupid about matters of that sort.
#HEDDA.
And I am cowardly. But now I will confide something to you.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Well?
#HEDDA.
The fact that I dared not shoot you down -
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Yes!
#HEDDA.
- that was not my arrant cowardice - that evening.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Oh, Hedda! Hedda Gabler! Now I begin to see a hidden reason beneath our comradeship! You and I - ! After all, then, it was your craving for life -
#HEDDA.
Take care! Believe nothing of the sort!
#HEDDA.
Ah, at last! My darling Thea, - come along! enters from the hall. She is in evening dress. The door is closed behind her.
#HEDDA.
My sweet Thea - you can't think how I have been longing for you!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Ought I to go in and talk to your husband for a moment?
#HEDDA.
Oh, not at all. Leave those two alone. They will soon be going.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Are they going out?
#HEDDA.
Yes, to a supper - party.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Not you?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
No.
#HEDDA.
Mr. Lovborg remains with us.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, how nice it is here!
#HEDDA.
No, thank you, my little Thea! Not there! You'll be good enough to come over here to me. I will sit between you.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, just as you please.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Is not she lovely to look at?
#HEDDA.
Only to look at!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Yes. For we two - she and I - we are two real comrades. We have absolute faith in each other; so we can sit and talk with perfect frankness -
#HEDDA.
Not round about, Mr. Lovborg?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Well -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, how happy I am, Hedda! For only think, he says I have inspired him too.
#HEDDA.
Ah! Does he say that, dear?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
And then she is so brave, Mrs. Tesman!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Good heavens - am I brave?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Exceedingly - where your comrade is concerned.
#HEDDA.
Ah, yes - courage! If one only had that!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
What then? What do you mean?
#HEDDA.
Then life would perhaps be liveable, after all. But now, my dearest Thea, you really must have a glass of cold punch.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No, thanks - I never take anything of that kind.
#HEDDA.
Well then, you, Mr. Lovborg.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Nor I, thank you.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No, he doesn't either.
#HEDDA.
But if I say you shall?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
It would be of no use.
#HEDDA.
Then I, poor creature, have no sort of power over you?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Not in that respect.
#HEDDA.
But seriously, I think you ought to - for your own sake.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Why, Hedda - !
#EILERT LOVBORG.
How so?
#HEDDA.
Or rather on account of other people.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Indeed?
#HEDDA.
Otherwise people might be apt to suspect that - in your heart of hearts - you did not feel quite secure - quite confident in yourself.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh please, Hedda - !
#EILERT LOVBORG.
People may suspect what they like - for the present.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, let them!
#HEDDA.
I saw it plainly in Judge Brack's face a moment ago.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
What did you see?
#HEDDA.
His contemptuous smile, when you dared not go with them into the inner room.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Dared not? Of course I preferred to stop here and talk to you.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
What could be more natural, Hedda?
#HEDDA.
But the Judge could not guess that. And I say, too, the way he smiled and glanced at Tesman when you dared not accept his invitation to this wretched little supper - party of his.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Dared not! Do you say I dared not?
#HEDDA.
I don't say so. But that was how Judge Brack understood it.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Well, let him.
#HEDDA.
Then you are not going with them?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
I will stay here with you and Thea.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, Hedda - how can you doubt that?
#HEDDA.
Firm as a rock! Faithful to your principles, now and for ever! Ah, that is how a man should be! Well now, what did I tell you, when you came to us this morning in such a state of distraction -
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Distraction!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Hedda - oh Hedda - !
#HEDDA.
You can see for yourself! You haven't the slightest reason to be in such mortal terror - There! Now we can all three enjoy ourselves!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Ah - what is all this, Mrs. Tesman?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh my God, Hedda! What are you saying? What are you doing?
#HEDDA.
Don't get excited! That horrid Judge Brack is sitting watching you.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
So she was in mortal terror! On my account!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, Hedda - now you have ruined everything!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
So that was my comrade's frank confidence in me?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, my dearest friend - only let me tell you -
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Your health, Thea!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, Hedda, Hedda - how could you do this?
#HEDDA.
I do it? I? Are you crazy?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Here's to your health too, Mrs. Tesman. Thanks for the truth. Hurrah for the truth!
#HEDDA.
Come, come - no more for the present. Remember you are going out to supper.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No, no, no!
#HEDDA.
Hush! They are sitting watching you.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Now, Thea - tell me the truth -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Did your husband know that you had come after me?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, Hedda - do you hear what he is asking?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Was it arranged between you and him that you were to come to town and look after me? Perhaps it was the Sheriff himself that urged you to come? Aha, my dear - no doubt he wanted my help in his office! Or was it at the card - table that he missed me?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, Lovborg, Lovborg - !
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Here's a glass for the old Sheriff too!
#HEDDA.
No more just now. Remember, you have to read your manuscript to Tesman.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
It was stupid of me all this. Thea - to take it in this way, I mean. Don't be angry with me, my dear, dear comrade. You shall see - both you and the others - that if I was fallen once - now I have risen again! Thanks to you, Thea.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, heaven be praised - !
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, Mrs. Tesman, our time has come.
#HEDDA.
I suppose it has.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Mine too, Judge Brack.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, Lovborg, don't do it!
#HEDDA.
They can hear you!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Ow!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
You were good enough to invite me.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, are you coming after all?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Yes, many thanks.
#JUDGE BRACK.
I'm delighted -
#EILERT LOVBORG.
I should like to show you one or two things before I send it to the printers.
#TESMAN.
Fancy - that will be delightful. But, Hedda dear, how is Mrs. Elvsted to get home? Eh?
#HEDDA.
Oh, that can be managed somehow.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Mrs. Elvsted? Of course, I'll come again and fetch her. At ten or thereabouts, Mrs. Tesman? Will that do?
#HEDDA.
Certainly. That will do capitally.
#TESMAN.
Well, then, that's all right. But you must not expect me so early, Hedda.
#HEDDA.
Oh, you may stop as long - as long as ever you please.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Well then, Mr. Lovborg - I shall remain here until you come.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Pray do, Mrs. Elvsted.
#JUDGE BRACK.
And now off goes the excursion train, gentlemen! I hope we shall have a lively time, as a certain fair lady puts it.
#HEDDA.
Ah, if only the fair lady could be present unseen - !
#JUDGE BRACK.
Why unseen?
#HEDDA.
In order to hear a little of your liveliness at first hand, Judge Brack.
#JUDGE BRACK.
I should not advise the fair lady to try it.
#TESMAN.
Come, you're a nice one Hedda! Fancy that!
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, good - bye, good - bye, ladies.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
About ten o'clock, then,
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Hedda - Hedda - what will come of all this?
#HEDDA.
At ten o'clock - he will be here. I can see him already - with vine - leaves in his hair - flushed and fearless -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, I hope he may.
#HEDDA.
And then, you see - then he will have regained control over himself. Then he will be a free man for all his days.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh God! - if he would only come as you see him now!
#HEDDA.
He will come as I see him - so, and not otherwise!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
You have some hidden motive in this, Hedda!
#HEDDA.
Yes, I have. I want for once in my life to have power to mould a human destiny.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Have you not the power?
#HEDDA.
I have not - and have never had it.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Not your husband's?
#HEDDA.
Do you think that is worth the trouble? Oh, if you could only understand how poor I am. And fate has made you so rich! I think I must burn your hair off after all.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Let me go! Let me go! I am afraid of you, Hedda!
#BERTA.
Tea is laid in the dining - room, ma'am.
#HEDDA.
Very well. We are coming
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No, no, no! I would rather go home alone! At once!
#HEDDA.
Nonsense! First you shall have a cup of tea, you little stupid. And then - at ten o'clock - Eilert Lovborg will be here - with vine - leaves in his hair.
#MRS.
ELVSTED, wrapped in a large shawl, and with her feet upon a foot - rest, sits close to the stove, sunk back in the arm - chair. HEDDA, fully dressed, lies sleeping upon the sofa, with a sofa - blanket over her.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Not yet! - Oh God - oh God - not yet! slips cautiously in by the hall door. She has a letter in her hand.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Well - has any one come?
#BERTA.
Yes, a girl has just brought this letter.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
A letter! Give it to me!
#BERTA.
No, it's for Dr. Tesman, ma'am.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, indeed.
#BERTA.
It was Miss Tesman's servant that brought it. I'll lay it here on the table.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, do.
#BERTA.
I think I had better put out the lamp. It's smoking.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, put it out. It must soon be daylight now.
#BERTA.
It is daylight already, ma'am.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, broad day! And no one come back yet - !
#BERTA.
Lord bless you, ma'am - I guessed how it would be.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
You guessed?
#BERTA.
Yes, when I saw that a certain person had come back to town - and that he went off with them. For we've heard enough about that gentleman before now.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Don't speak so loud. You will waken Mrs. Tesman.
#BERTA.
No, no - let her sleep, poor thing. Shan't I put some wood on the fire?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Thanks, not for me.
#BERTA.
Oh, very well.
#HEDDA.
What's that - ?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
It was only the servant.
#HEDDA.
Oh, we're here - ! Yes, now I remember. What o'clock is it, Thea?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
It's past seven.
#HEDDA.
When did Tesman come home?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
He has not come.
#HEDDA.
Not come home yet?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No one has come.
#HEDDA.
Think of our watching and waiting here till four in the morning -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
And how I watched and waited for him!
#HEDDA.
Well well - we might have spared ourselves the trouble.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Did you get a little sleep?
#HEDDA.
Oh yes; I believe I have slept pretty well. Have you not?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Not for a moment. I couldn't, Hedda! - not to save my life.
#HEDDA.
There there there! There's nothing to be so alarmed about. I understand quite well what has happened.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Well, what do you think? Won't you tell me?
#HEDDA.
Why, of course it has been a very late affair at Judge Brack's -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, yes - that is clear enough. But all the same -
#HEDDA.
And then, you see, Tesman hasn't cared to come home and ring us up in the middle of the night. Perhaps he wasn't inclined to show himself either - immediately after a jollification.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
But in that case - where can he have gone?
#HEDDA.
Of course he has gone to his Aunts' and slept there. They have his old room ready for him.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No, he can't be with them for a letter has just come for him from Miss Tesman. There it lies.
#HEDDA.
Indeed? Why yes, it's addressed in Aunt Julia's hand. Well then, he has remained at Judge Brack's. And as for Eilert Lovborg - he is sitting, with vine - leaves in his hair, reading his manuscript.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, Hedda, you are just saying things you don't believe a bit.
#HEDDA.
You really are a little blockhead, Thea.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh yes, I suppose I am.
#HEDDA.
And how mortally tired you look.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, I am mortally tired.
#HEDDA.
Well then, you must do as I tell you. You must go into my room and lie down for a little while.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh no, no - I shouldn't be able to sleep.
#HEDDA.
I am sure you would.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Well, but you husband is certain to come soon now; and then I want to know at once -
#HEDDA.
I shall take care to let you know when he comes.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Do you promise me, Hedda?
#HEDDA.
Yes, rely upon me. Just you go in and have a sleep in the meantime.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Thanks; then I'll try.
#BERTA.
Did you want anything, ma'am?
#HEDDA.
Yes; you must put some more wood in the stove. I am shivering.
#BERTA.
Bless me - I'll make up the fire at once. That was a ring at the front door, ma'am.
#HEDDA.
Then go to the door. I will look after the fire.
#BERTA.
It'll soon burn up.
#HEDDA.
Good morning.
#TESMAN.
Hedda! Good heavens - are you up so early? Eh?
#HEDDA.
Yes, I am up very early this morning.
#TESMAN.
And I never doubted you were still sound asleep! Fancy that, Hedda!
#HEDDA.
Don't speak so loud. Mrs. Elvsted is resting in my room.
#TESMAN.
Has Mrs. Elvsted been here all night?
#HEDDA.
Yes, since no one came to fetch her.
#TESMAN.
Ah, to be sure.
#HEDDA.
Well, did you enjoy yourselves at Judge Brack's?
#TESMAN.
Have you been anxious about me? Eh?
#HEDDA.
No, I should never think of being anxious. But I asked if you had enjoyed yourself.
#TESMAN.
Oh yes, - for once in a way. Especially the beginning of the evening; for then Eilert read me part of his book. We arrived more than an hour too early - fancy that! And Brack had all sorts of arrangements to make - so Eilert read to me.
#HEDDA.
Well? Tell me then -
#TESMAN.
Oh, Hedda, you can't conceive what a book that is going to be! I believe it is one of the most remarkable things that have ever been written. Fancy that!
#HEDDA.
Yes yes; I don't care about that -
#TESMAN.
I must make a confession to you, Hedda. When he had finished reading - a horrid feeling came over me. horrid feeling?
#TESMAN.
I felt jealous of Eilert for having had it in him to write such a book. Only think, Hedda!
#HEDDA.
Yes, yes, I am thinking!
#TESMAN.
And then how pitiful to think that he - with all his gifts - should be irreclaimable, after all.
#HEDDA.
I suppose you mean that he has more courage than the rest?
#TESMAN.
No, not at all - I mean that he is incapable of taking his pleasure in moderation.
#HEDDA.
And what came of it all - in the end?
#TESMAN.
Well, to tell the truth, I think it might best be described as an orgie, Hedda.
#HEDDA.
Had he vine - leaves in his hair?
#TESMAN.
Vine - leaves? No, I saw nothing of the sort. But he made a long, rambling speech in honour of the woman who had inspired him in his work - that was the phrase he used.
#HEDDA.
Did he name her?
#TESMAN.
No, he didn't; but I can't help thinking he meant Mrs. Elvsted. You may be sure he did.
#HEDDA.
Well - where did you part from him?
#TESMAN.
On the way to town. We broke up - the last of us at any rate - all together; and Brack came with us to get a breath of fresh air. And then, you see, we agreed to take Eilert home; for he had had far more than was good for him.
#HEDDA.
I daresay.
#TESMAN.
But now comes the strange part of it, Hedda; or, I should rather say, the melancholy part of it. I declare I am almost ashamed - on Eilert's account - to tell you -
#HEDDA.
Oh, go on - !
#TESMAN.
Well, as we were getting near town, you see, I happened to drop a little behind the others. Only for a minute or two - fancy that!
#HEDDA.
Yes yes yes, but - ?
#TESMAN.
And then, as I hurried after them - what do you think I found by the wayside? Eh?
#HEDDA.
Oh, how should I know!
#TESMAN.
You mustn't speak of it to a soul, Hedda! Do you hear! Promise me, for Eilert's sake. Fancy, dear - I found this.
#HEDDA.
Is not that the parcel he had with him yesterday?
#TESMAN.
Yes, it is the whole of his precious, irreplaceable manuscript! And he had gone and lost it, and knew nothing about it. Only fancy, Hedda! So deplorably -
#HEDDA.
But why did you not give him back the parcel at once?
#TESMAN.
I didn't dare to - in the state he was then in -
#HEDDA.
Did you not tell any of the others that you had found it?
#TESMAN.
Oh, far from it! You can surely understand that, for Eilert's sake, I wouldn't do that.
#HEDDA.
So no one knows that Eilert Lovborg's manuscript is in your possession?
#TESMAN.
No. And no one must know it.
#HEDDA.
Then what did you say to him afterwards?
#TESMAN.
I didn't talk to him again at all; for when we got in among the streets, he and two or three of the others gave us the slip and disappeared. Fancy that!
#HEDDA.
Indeed! They must have taken him home then.
#TESMAN.
Yes, so it would appear. And Brack, too, left us.
#HEDDA.
And what have you been doing with yourself since?
#TESMAN.
Well, I and some of the others went home with one of the party, a jolly fellow, and took our morning coffee with him; or perhaps I should rather call it our night coffee - eh? But now, when I have rested a little, and given Eilert, poor fellow, time to have his sleep out, I must take this back to him.
#HEDDA.
No - don't give it to him! Not in such a hurry, I mean. Let me read it first.
#TESMAN.
No, my dearest Hedda, I mustn't, I really mustn't.
#HEDDA.
You must not?
#TESMAN.
No - for you can imagine what a state of despair he will be in when he wakens and misses the manuscript. He has no copy of it, you must know! He told me so.
#HEDDA.
Can such a thing not be reproduced? Written over again?
#TESMAN.
No, I don't think that would be possible. For the inspiration, you see -
#HEDDA.
Yes, yes - I suppose it depends on that - But, by - the - bye - here is a letter for you.
#TESMAN.
Fancy - !
#HEDDA.
It came early this morning.
#TESMAN.
It's from Aunt Julia! What can it be? Oh, Hedda - she says that poor Aunt Rina is dying!
#HEDDA.
Well, we were prepared for that.
#TESMAN.
And that if I want to see her again, I must make haste. I'll run in to them at once.
#HEDDA.
Will you run?
#TESMAN.
Oh, my dearest Hedda - if you could only make up your mind to come with me! Just think!
#HEDDA.
No, no don't ask me. I will not look upon sickness and death. I loathe all sorts of ugliness.
#TESMAN.
Well, well, then - ! My hat - ? My overcoat - ? Oh, in the hall - I do hope I mayn't come too late, Hedda! Eh?
#HEDDA.
Oh, if you run -
#BERTA.
Judge Brack is at the door, and wishes to know if he may come in.
#TESMAN.
At this time! No, I can't possibly see him.
#HEDDA.
But I can. Ask Judge Brack to come in.
#HEDDA.
The parcel, Tesman!
#TESMAN.
Yes, give it to me!
#HEDDA.
No, no, I will keep it till you come back. enters from the hall.
#HEDDA.
You are an early bird, I must say.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes, don't you think so! Are you on the move, too?
#TESMAN.
Yes, I must rush of to my aunts'. Fancy - the invalid one is lying at death's door, poor creature.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Dear me, is she indeed? Then on no account let me detain you. At such a critical moment -
#TESMAN.
Yes, I must really rush - Good - bye! Good - bye!
#HEDDA.
You seem to have made a particularly lively night of it at your rooms, Judge Brack.
#JUDGE BRACK.
I assure you I have not had my clothes off, Mrs. Hedda.
#HEDDA.
Not you, either?
#JUDGE BRACK.
No, as you may see. But what has Tesman been telling you of the night's adventures?
#HEDDA.
Oh, some tiresome story. Only that they went and had coffee somewhere or other.
#JUDGE BRACK.
I have heard about that coffee - party already. Eilert Lovborg was not with them, I fancy?
#HEDDA.
No, they had taken him home before that.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Tesman too?
#HEDDA.
No, but some of the others, he said.
#JUDGE BRACK.
George Tesman is really an ingenuous creature, Mrs. Hedda.
#HEDDA.
Yes, heaven knows he is. Then is there something behind all this?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes, perhaps there may be.
#HEDDA.
Well then, sit down, my dear Judge, and tell your story in comfort.
#HEDDA.
Now then?
#JUDGE BRACK.
I had special reasons for keeping track of my guests - last night.
#HEDDA.
Of Eilert Lovborg among the rest, perhaps?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Frankly, yes.
#HEDDA.
Now you make me really curious -
#JUDGE BRACK.
Do you know where he and one or two of the others finished the night, Mrs. Hedda?
#HEDDA.
If it is not quite unmentionable, tell me.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Oh no, it's not at all unmentionable. Well, they put in an appearance at a particularly animated soiree.
#HEDDA.
Of the lively kind?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Of the very liveliest -
#HEDDA.
Tell me more of this, Judge Brack -
#JUDGE BRACK.
Lovborg, as well as the others, had been invited in advance. I knew all about it. But he had declined the invitation; for now, as you know, he has become a new man.
#HEDDA.
Up at the Elvsteds', yes. But he went after all, then?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, you see, Mrs. Hedda - unhappily the spirit moved him at my rooms last evening -
#HEDDA.
Yes, I hear he found inspiration.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Pretty violent inspiration. Well, I fancy that altered his purpose; for we menfolk are unfortunately not always so firm in our principles as we ought to be.
#HEDDA.
Oh, I am sure you are an exception, Judge Brack. But as to Lovborg - ?
#JUDGE BRACK.
To make a long story short - he landed at last in Mademoiselle Diana's rooms.
#HEDDA.
Mademoiselle Diana's?
#JUDGE BRACK.
It was Mademoiselle Diana that was giving the soiree, to a select circle of her admirers and her lady friends.
#HEDDA.
Is she a red - haired woman?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Precisely. sort of a - singer?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Oh yes - in her leisure moments. And moreover a mighty huntress - of men - Mrs. Hedda. You have no doubt heard of her. Eilert Lovborg was one of her most enthusiastic protectors - in the days of his glory.
#HEDDA.
And how did all this end?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Far from amicably, it appears. After a most tender meeting, they seem to have come to blows -
#HEDDA.
Lovborg and she?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes. He accused her or her friends of having robbed him. He declared that his pocket - book had disappeared - and other things as well. In short, he seems to have made a furious disturbance.
#HEDDA.
And what came of it all?
#JUDGE BRACK.
It came to a general scrimmage, in which the ladies as well as the gentlemen took part. Fortunately the police at last appeared on the scene.
#HEDDA.
The police too?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes. I fancy it will prove a costly frolic for Eilert Lovborg, crazy being that he is.
#HEDDA.
How so?
#JUDGE BRACK.
He seems to have made a violent resistance - to have hit one of the constables on the head and torn the coat off his back. So they had to march him off to the police - station with the rest.
#HEDDA.
How have you learnt all this?
#JUDGE BRACK.
From the police themselves.
#HEDDA.
So that is what happened. Then he had no vine - leaves in his hair.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Vine - leaves, Mrs. Hedda?
#HEDDA.
But tell me now, Judge - what is your real reason for tracking out Eilert Lovborg's movements so carefully?
#JUDGE BRACK.
In the first place, it could not be entirely indifferent to me if it should appear in the police - court that he came straight from my house.
#HEDDA.
Will the matter come into court then?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Of course. However, I should scarcely have troubled so much about that. But I thought that, as a friend of the family, it was my duty to supply you and Tesman with a full account of his nocturnal exploits.
#HEDDA.
Why so, Judge Brack?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Why, because I have a shrewd suspicion that he intends to use you as a sort of blind.
#HEDDA.
Oh, how can you think such a thing!
#JUDGE BRACK.
Good heavens, Mrs. Hedda - we have eyes in our head. Mark my words! This Mrs. Elvsted will be in no hurry to leave town again.
#HEDDA.
Well, even if there should be anything between them, I suppose there are plenty of other places where they could meet.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Not a single home. Henceforth, as before, every respectable house will be closed against Eilert Lovborg.
#HEDDA.
And so ought mine to be, you mean?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes. I confess it would be more than painful to me if this personage were to be made free of your house. How superfluous, how intrusive, he would be, if he were to force his way into -
#HEDDA.
- into the triangle?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Precisely. It would simply mean that I should find myself homeless.
#HEDDA.
So you want to be the one cock in the basket - that is your aim.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes, that is my aim. And for that I will fight - with every weapon I can command.
#HEDDA.
I see you are a dangerous person - when it comes to the point.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Do you think so?
#HEDDA.
I am beginning to think so. And I am exceedingly glad to think - that you have no sort of hold over me.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well well, Mrs. Hedda - perhaps you are right there. If I had, who knows what I might be capable of?
#HEDDA.
Come come now, Judge Brack! That sounds almost like a threat.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Oh, not at all! The triangle, you know, ought, if possible, to be spontaneously constructed.
#HEDDA.
There I agree with you.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, now I have said all I had to say; and I had better be getting back to town. Good - bye, Mrs. Hedda.
#HEDDA.
Are you going through the garden?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes, it's a short cut for me.
#HEDDA.
And then it is a back way, too.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Quite so. I have no objection to back ways. They may be piquant enough at times.
#HEDDA.
When there is ball practice going on, you mean?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Oh, people don't shoot their tame poultry, I fancy.
#HEDDA.
Oh no, when there is only one cock in the basket - LOVBORG, with his greatcoat on and his hat in his hand, tears open the hall door. He looks somewhat confused and irritated.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
and I tell you I must and will come in! There!
#HEDDA.
Well, Mr Lovborg, this is rather a late hour to call for Thea.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
You mean rather an early hour to call on you. Pray pardon me.
#HEDDA.
How do you know that she is still here?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
They told me at her lodgings that she had been out all night.
#HEDDA.
Did you notice anything about the people of the house when they said that?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Notice anything about them?
#HEDDA.
I mean, did they seem to think it odd?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Oh yes, of course! I am dragging her down with me! However, I didn't notice anything. - I suppose Tesman is not up yet.
#HEDDA.
No - I think not -
#EILERT LOVBORG.
When did he come home?
#HEDDA.
Very late.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Did he tell you anything?
#HEDDA.
Yes, I gathered that you had had an exceedingly jolly evening at Judge Brack's.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Nothing more?
#HEDDA.
I don't think so. However, I was so dreadfully sleepy -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Ah, Lovborg! At last - !
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Yes, at last. And too late!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
What is too late?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Everything is too late now. It is all over with me.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh no, no - don't say that!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
You will say the same when you hear -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
I won't hear anything!
#HEDDA.
Perhaps you would prefer to talk to her alone? If so, I will leave you.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
No, stay - you too. I beg you to stay.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, but I won't hear anything, I tell you.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
It is not last night's adventures that I want to talk about.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
What is it then - ?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
I want to say that now our ways must part.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Part!
#HEDDA.
I knew it!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
You can be of no more service to me, Thea.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
How can you stand there and say that! No more service to you! Am I not to help you now, as before? Are we not to go on working together?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Henceforward I shall do no work.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Then what am I to do with my life?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
You must try to live your life as if you had never known me.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
But you know I cannot do that!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Try if you cannot, Thea. You must go home again -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Never in this world! Where you are, there will I be also! I will not let myself be driven away like this! I will remain here! I will be with you when the book appears.
#HEDDA.
Ah yes - the book!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
My book and Thea's; for that is what it is.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, I feel that it is. And that is why I have a right to be with you when it appears! I will see with my own eyes how respect and honour pour in upon you afresh. And the happiness - the happiness - oh, I must share it with you!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Thea - our book will never appear.
#HEDDA.
Ah!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Never appear!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Can never appear.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Lovborg - what have you done with the manuscript?
#HEDDA.
Yes, the manuscript - ?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Where is it?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
The manuscript - Well then - I have torn the manuscript into a thousand pieces.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh no, no - !
#HEDDA.
But that's not -
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Not true, you think?
#HEDDA.
Oh well, of course - since you say so. But it sounded so improbable -
#EILERT LOVBORG.
It is true, all the same.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh God - oh God, Hedda - torn his own work to pieces!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
I have torn my own life to pieces. So why should I not tear my life - work too - ?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
And you did this last night?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Yes, I tell you! Tore it into a thousand pieces - and scattered them on the fiord - far out. There there is cool sea - water at any rate - let them drift upon it - drift with the current and the wind. And then presently they will sink - deeper and deeper - as I shall, Thea.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Do you know, Lovborg, that what you have done with the book - I shall think of it to my dying day as though you had killed a little child.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Yes, you are right. It is a sort of child - murder.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
How could you, then - ! Did not the child belong to me too?
#HEDDA.
Ah, the child -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
It is all over then. Well well, now I will go, Hedda.
#HEDDA.
But you are not going away from town?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, I don't know what I shall do. I see nothing but darkness before me.
#HEDDA.
So you are not going to see her home, Mr. Lovborg? Through the streets? Would you have people see her walking with me?
#HEDDA.
Of course I don't know what else may have happened last night. But is it so utterly irretrievable?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
It will not end with last night - I know that perfectly well. And the thing is that now I have no taste for that sort of life either. I won't begin it anew. She has broken my courage and my power of braving life out.
#HEDDA.
So that pretty little fool has had her fingers in a man's destiny. But all the same, how could you treat her so heartlessly.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Oh, don't say that I was heartless!
#HEDDA.
To go and destroy what has filled her whole soul for months and years! You do not call that heartless!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
To you I can tell the truth, Hedda.
#HEDDA.
The truth?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
First promise me - give me your word - that what I now confide in you Thea shall never know.
#HEDDA.
I give you my word.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Good. Then let me tell you that what I said just now was untrue.
#HEDDA.
About the manuscript?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Yes. I have not torn it to pieces - nor thrown it into the fiord.
#HEDDA.
No, no - But - where is it then?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
I have destroyed it none the less - utterly destroyed it, Hedda!
#HEDDA.
I don't understand.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Thea said that what I had done seemed to her like a child - murder.
#HEDDA.
Yes, so she said.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
But to kill his child - that is not the worst thing a father can do to it.
#HEDDA.
Not the worst?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Suppose now, Hedda, that a man - in the small hours of the morning - came home to his child's mother after a night of riot and debauchery, and said: "Listen - I have been here and there - in this place and in that. And I have taken our child with - to this place and to that. And I have lost the child - utterly lost it. The devil knows into what hands it may have fallen - who may have had their clutches on it."
#HEDDA.
Well - but when all is said and done, you know - this was only a book -
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Thea's pure soul was in that book.
#HEDDA.
Yes, so I understand.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
And you can understand, too, that for her and me together no future is possible.
#HEDDA.
What path do you mean to take then?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
None. I will only try to make an end of it all - the sooner the better.
#HEDDA.
Eilert Lovborg - listen to me. - Will you not try to - to do it beautifully?
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Beautifully? With vine - leaves in my hair, as you used to dream in the old days - ?
#HEDDA.
No, no. I have lost my faith in the vine - leaves. But beautifully nevertheless! For once in a way! - Good - bye! You must go now - and do not come here any more.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Good - bye, Mrs. Tesman. And give George Tesman my love.
#HEDDA.
No, wait! I must give you a memento to take with you.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
This? Is this the memento?
#HEDDA.
Do you recognise it? It was aimed at you once.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
You should have used it then.
#HEDDA.
Take it - and do you use it now.
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Thanks!
#HEDDA.
And beautifully, Eilert Lovborg. Promise me that!
#EILERT LOVBORG.
Good - bye, Hedda Gabler.
#HEDDA.
Now I am burning your child, Thea! - Burning it, curly - locks! Your child and Eilert Lovborg's. I am burning - I am burning your child.
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, Hedda, here I am, in mourning and forlorn; for now my poor sister has at last found peace.
#HEDDA.
I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.
#MISS TESMAN.
Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to Hedda - here in the house of life - I ought myself to bring the tidings of death.
#HEDDA.
That was very kind of you.
#MISS TESMAN.
Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.
#HEDDA.
She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss Tesman?
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable happiness of seeing George once more - and bidding him good - bye. - Has he not come home yet?
#HEDDA.
No. He wrote that he might be detained. But won't you sit down?
#MISS TESMAN.
No thank you, my dear, dear Hedda. I should like to, but I have so much to do. I must prepare my dear one for her rest as well as I can. She shall go to her grave looking her best.
#HEDDA.
Can I not help you in any way?
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh, you must not think of it! Hedda Tesman must have no hand in such mournful work. Nor let her thought dwell on it either - not at this time.
#HEDDA.
One is not always mistress of one's thoughts -
#MISS TESMAN.
Ah yes, it is the way of the world. At home we shall be sewing a shroud; and here there will soon be sewing too, I suppose - but of another sort, thank God! enters by the hall door.
#HEDDA.
Ah, you have come at last!
#TESMAN.
You here, Aunt Julia? With Hedda? Fancy that!
#MISS TESMAN.
I was just going, my dear boy. Well, have you done all you promised?
#TESMAN.
No; I'm really afraid I have forgotten half of it. I must come to you again to - morrow. To - day my brain is all in a whirl. I can't keep my thoughts together.
#MISS TESMAN.
Why, my dear George, you mustn't take it in this way.
#TESMAN.
Mustn't - ? How do you mean?
#MISS TESMAN.
Even in your sorrow you must rejoice, as I do - rejoice that she is at rest.
#TESMAN.
Oh yes, yes - you are thinking of Aunt Rina.
#HEDDA.
You will feel lonely now, Miss Tesman.
#MISS TESMAN.
Just at first, yes. But that will not last very long, I hope. I daresay I shall soon find an occupant for Rina's little room.
#TESMAN.
Indeed? Who do you think will take it? Eh?
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh, there's always some poor invalid or other in want of nursing, unfortunately.
#HEDDA.
Would you really take such a burden upon you again? burden! Heaven forgive you, child - it has been no burden to me.
#HEDDA.
But suppose you had a total stranger on your hands -
#MISS TESMAN.
Oh, one soon makes friends with sick folk; and it's such an absolute necessity for me to have some one to live for. Well, heaven be praised, there may soon be something in this house, too, to keep an old aunt busy.
#HEDDA.
Oh, don't trouble about anything here.
#TESMAN.
Yes, just fancy what a nice time we three might have together, if - ?
#HEDDA.
If - ?
#TESMAN.
Oh nothing. It will all come right. Let us hope so - eh?
#MISS TESMAN.
Well well, I daresay you two want to talk to each other. And perhaps Hedda may have something to tell you too, George. Good - bye! I must go home to Rina. How strange it is to think that now Rina is with me and with my poor brother as well!
#TESMAN.
Yes, fancy that, Aunt Julia! Eh?
#HEDDA.
I almost believe your Aunt Rina's death affects you more than it does your Aunt Julia.
#TESMAN.
Oh, it's not that alone. It's Eilert I am so terribly uneasy about.
#HEDDA.
Is there anything new about him?
#TESMAN.
I looked in at his rooms this afternoon, intending to tell him the manuscript was in safe keeping.
#HEDDA.
Well, did you find him?
#TESMAN.
No. He wasn't at home. But afterwards I met Mrs. Elvsted, and she told me that he had been here early this morning.
#HEDDA.
Yes, directly after you had gone.
#TESMAN.
And he said that he had torn his manuscript to pieces - eh?
#HEDDA.
Yes, so he declared.
#TESMAN.
Why, good heavens, he must have been completely out of his mind! And I suppose you thought it best not to give it back to him, Hedda?
#HEDDA.
No, he did not get it.
#TESMAN.
But of course you told him that we had it?
#HEDDA.
No. Did you tell Mrs. Elvsted?
#TESMAN.
No; I thought I had better not. But you ought to have told him. Fancy, if, in desperation, he should go and do himself some injury! Let me have the manuscript, Hedda! I will take it to him at once. Where is it?
#HEDDA.
I have not got it.
#TESMAN.
Have not got it? What in the world do you mean?
#HEDDA.
I have burnt it - every line of it.
#TESMAN.
Burnt! Burnt Eilert's manuscript!
#HEDDA.
Don't scream so. The servant might hear you.
#TESMAN.
Burnt! Why, good God - ! No, no, no! It's impossible!
#HEDDA.
It is so, nevertheless.
#TESMAN.
Do you know what you have done, Hedda? It's unlawful appropriation of lost property. Fancy that! Just ask Judge Brack, and he'll tell you what it is.
#HEDDA.
I advise you not to speak of it - either to Judge Brack or to anyone else.
#TESMAN.
But how could you do anything so unheard - of? What put it into your head? What possessed you? Answer me that - eh?
#HEDDA.
I did it for your sake, George.
#TESMAN.
For my sake!
#HEDDA.
This morning, when you told me about what he had read to you -
#TESMAN.
Yes yes - what then?
#HEDDA.
You acknowledged that you envied him his work.
#TESMAN.
Oh, of course I didn't mean that literally.
#HEDDA.
No matter - I could not bear the idea that any one should throw you into the shade.
#TESMAN.
Hedda! Oh, is this true? But - but - I never knew you show your love like that before. Fancy that!
#HEDDA.
Well, I may as well tell you that - just at this time - No, no; you can ask Aunt Julia. She will tell you, fast enough.
#TESMAN.
Oh, I almost think I understand you, Hedda! Great heavens! do you really mean it! Eh?
#HEDDA.
Don't shout so. The servant might hear.
#TESMAN.
The servant! Why, how absurd you are, Hedda. It's only my old Berta! Why, I'll tell Berta myself.
#HEDDA.
Oh, it is killing me, - it is killing me, all this!
#TESMAN.
What is, Hedda? Eh?
#HEDDA.
All this - absurdity - George.
#TESMAN.
Absurdity! Do you see anything absurd in my being overjoyed at the news! But after all - perhaps I had better not say anything to Berta.
#HEDDA.
Oh - why not that too?
#TESMAN.
No, no, not yet! But I must certainly tell Aunt Julia. And then that you have begun to call me George too! Fancy that! Oh, Aunt Julia will be so happy - so happy!
#HEDDA.
When she hears that I have burnt Eilert Lovborg's manuscript - for your sake?
#TESMAN.
No, by - the - bye - that affair of the manuscript - of course nobody must know about that. But that you love me so much, Hedda - Aunt Julia must really share my joy in that! I wonder, now, whether this sort of thing is usual in young wives? Eh?
#HEDDA.
I think you had better ask Aunt Julia that question too.
#TESMAN.
I will indeed, some time or other. And yet the manuscript - the manuscript! Good God! it is terrible to think what will become of poor Eilert now.
#MRS.
ELVSTED, dressed as in the first Act, with hat and cloak, enters by the hall door.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, dear Hedda, forgive my coming again.
#HEDDA.
What is the matter with you, Thea?
#TESMAN.
Something about Eilert Lovborg again - eh?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes! I am dreadfully afraid some misfortune has happened to him.
#HEDDA.
Ah, - do you think so?
#TESMAN.
Why, good Lord - what makes you think that, Mrs. Elvsted?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
I heard them talking of him at my boarding - house - just as I came in. Oh, the most incredible rumours are afloat about him to - day.
#TESMAN.
Yes, fancy, so I heard too! And I can bear witness that he went straight home to bed last night. Fancy that!
#HEDDA.
Well, what did they say at the boarding - house?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, I couldn't make out anything clearly. Either they knew nothing definite, or else - They stopped talking when the saw me; and I did not dare to ask.
#TESMAN.
We must hope - we must hope that you misunderstood them, Mrs. Elvsted.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No, no; I am sure it was of him they were talking. And I heard something about the hospital or -
#TESMAN.
The hospital?
#HEDDA.
No - surely that cannot be!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, I was in such mortal terror! I went to his lodgings and asked for him there.
#HEDDA.
You could make up your mind to that, Thea!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
What else could I do? I really could bear the suspense no longer.
#TESMAN.
But you didn't find him either - eh?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No. And the people knew nothing about him. He hadn't been home since yesterday afternoon, they said.
#TESMAN.
Yesterday! Fancy, how could they say that?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, I am sure something terrible must have happened to him.
#TESMAN.
Hedda dear - how would it be if I were to go and make inquiries - ?
#HEDDA.
No, no - don't you mix yourself up in this affair. BRACK, with his hat in his hand, enters by the hall door, which BERTA opens, and closes behind him. He looks grave and bows in silence.
#TESMAN.
Oh, is that you, my dear Judge? Eh?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes. It was imperative I should see you this evening.
#TESMAN.
I can see you have heard the news about Aunt Rina?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes, that among other things.
#TESMAN.
Isn't it sad - eh?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, my dear Tesman, that depends on how you look at it.
#TESMAN.
Has anything else happened?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes.
#HEDDA.
Anything sad, Judge Brack?
#JUDGE BRACK.
That, too, depends on how you look at it, Mrs. Tesman.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh! it is something about Eilert Lovborg!
#JUDGE BRACK.
What makes you think that, Madam? Perhaps you have already heard something - ?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No, nothing at all, but -
#TESMAN.
Oh, for heaven's sake, tell us!
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, I regret to say Eilert Lovborg has been taken to the hospital. He is lying at the point of death.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh God! oh God - !
#TESMAN.
To the hospital! And at the point of death!
#HEDDA.
So soon then -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
And we parted in anger, Hedda!
#HEDDA.
Thea - Thea - be careful!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
I must go to him! I must see him alive!
#JUDGE BRACK.
It is useless, Madam. No one will be admitted.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, at least tell me what has happened to him? What is it?
#TESMAN.
You don't mean to say that he has himself - Eh?
#HEDDA.
Yes, I am sure he has.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Unfortunately you have guessed quite correctly, Mrs. Tesman.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, how horrible!
#TESMAN.
Himself, then! Fancy that!
#HEDDA.
Shot himself!
#JUDGE BRACK.
Rightly guessed again, Mrs. Tesman.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
When did it happen, Mr. Brack?
#JUDGE BRACK.
This afternoon - between three and four.
#TESMAN.
But, good Lord, where did he do it? Eh?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Where? Well - I suppose at his lodgings.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No, that cannot be; for I was there between six and seven.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well then, somewhere else. I don't know exactly. I only know that he was found - He had shot himself - in the breast.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, how terrible! That he should die like that!
#HEDDA.
Was it in the breast?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes - as I told you.
#HEDDA.
Not in the temple?
#JUDGE BRACK.
In the breast, Mrs. Tesman.
#HEDDA.
Well, well - the breast is a good place, too.
#JUDGE BRACK.
How do you mean, Mrs. Tesman?
#HEDDA.
Oh, nothing - nothing.
#TESMAN.
And the wound is dangerous, you say - eh?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Absolutely mortal. The end has probably come by this time.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, yes, I feel it. The end! The end! Oh, Hedda - !
#TESMAN.
But tell me, how have you learnt all this?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Through one of the police. A man I had some business with.
#HEDDA.
At last a deed worth doing!
#TESMAN.
Good heavens, Hedda! what are you saying?
#HEDDA.
I say there is beauty in this.
#JUDGE BRACK.
H'm, Mrs. Tesman -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, Hedda, how can you talk of beauty in such an act!
#HEDDA.
Eilert Lovborg has himself made up his account with life. He has had the courage to do - the one right thing.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
No, you must never think that was how it happened! It must have been in delirium that he did it.
#TESMAN.
In despair!
#HEDDA.
That he did not. I am certain of that.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, yes! In delirium! Just as when he tore up our manuscript.
#JUDGE BRACK.
The manuscript? Has he torn that up?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, last night.
#TESMAN.
Oh, Hedda, we shall never get over this.
#JUDGE BRACK.
H'm, very extraordinary.
#TESMAN.
To think of Eilert going out of the world in this way! And not leaving behind him the book that would have immortalised his name -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, if only it could be put together again!
#TESMAN.
Yes, if it only could! I don't know what I would not give -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Perhaps it can, Mr. Tesman.
#TESMAN.
What do you mean?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Look here. I have kept all the loose notes he used to dictate from.
#HEDDA.
Ah - !
#TESMAN.
You have kept them, Mrs. Elvsted! Eh?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, I have them here. I put them in my pocket when I left home. Here they still are -
#TESMAN.
Oh, do let me see them!
#MRS. ELVSTED.
But they are in such disorder - all mixed up.
#TESMAN.
Fancy, if we could make something out of them, after all! Perhaps if we two put our heads together -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh yes, at least let us try -
#TESMAN.
We will manage it! We must! I will dedicate my life to this task.
#HEDDA.
You, George? Your life?
#TESMAN.
Yes, or rather all the time I can spare. My own collections must wait in the meantime. Hedda - you understand, eh? I owe this to Eilert's memory.
#HEDDA.
Perhaps.
#TESMAN.
And so, my dear Mrs. Elvsted, we will give our whole minds to it. There is no use in brooding over what can't be undone - eh? We must try to control our grief as much as possible, and -
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Yes, yes, Mr. Tesman, I will do the best I can.
#TESMAN.
Well then, come here. I can't rest until we have looked through the notes. Where shall we sit? Here? No, in there, in the back room. Excuse me, my dear Judge. Come with me, Mrs. Elvsted.
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, if only it were possible!
#HEDDA.
Oh, what a sense of freedom it gives one, this act of Eilert Lovborg's.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Freedom, Mrs. Hedda? Well, of course, it is a release for him -
#HEDDA.
I mean for me. It gives me a sense of freedom to know that a deed of deliberate courage is still possible in this world, - a deed of spontaneous beauty.
#JUDGE BRACK.
H'm - my dear Mrs. Hedda -
#HEDDA.
Oh, I know what you are going to say. For you are a kind of specialist too, like - you know!
#JUDGE BRACK.
Eilert Lovborg was more to you than perhaps you are willing to admit to yourself. Am I wrong?
#HEDDA.
I don't answer such questions. I only know that Eilert Lovborg has had the courage to live his life after his own fashion. And then - the last great act, with its beauty! Ah! that he should have the will and the strength to turn away from the banquet of life - so early.
#JUDGE BRACK.
I am sorry, Mrs. Hedda, - but I fear I must dispel an amiable illusion.
#HEDDA.
Illusion?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Which could not have lasted long in any case.
#HEDDA.
What do you mean?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Eilert Lovborg did not shoot himself - voluntarily.
#HEDDA.
Not voluntarily?
#JUDGE BRACK.
No. The thing did not happen exactly as I told it.
#HEDDA.
Have you concealed something? What is it?
#JUDGE BRACK.
For poor Mrs. Elvsted's sake I idealised the facts a little.
#HEDDA.
What are the facts?
#JUDGE BRACK.
First, that he is already dead.
#HEDDA.
At the hospital?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes - without regaining consciousness.
#HEDDA.
What more have you concealed?
#JUDGE BRACK.
This - the event did not happen at his lodgings.
#HEDDA.
Oh, that can make no difference.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Perhaps it may. For I must tell you - Eilert Lovborg was found shot in - in Mademoiselle Diana's boudoir.
#HEDDA.
That is impossible, Judge Brack! He cannot have been there again to - day.
#JUDGE BRACK.
He was there this afternoon. He went there, he said, to demand the return of something which they had taken from him. Talked wildly about a lost child -
#HEDDA.
Ah - so that is why -
#JUDGE BRACK.
I thought probably he meant his manuscript; but now I hear he destroyed that himself. So I suppose it must have been his pocket - book.
#HEDDA.
Yes, no doubt. And there - there he was found?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes, there. With a pistol in his breast - pocket, discharged. The ball had lodged in a vital part.
#HEDDA.
In the breast - yes?
#JUDGE BRACK.
No - in the bowels.
#HEDDA.
That too! Oh, what curse is it that makes everything I touch turn ludicrous and mean?
#JUDGE BRACK.
There is one point more, Mrs. Hedda - another disagreeable feature in the affair.
#HEDDA.
And what is that?
#JUDGE BRACK.
The pistol he carried -
#HEDDA.
Well? What of it?
#JUDGE BRACK.
He must have stolen it.
#HEDDA.
Stolen it! That is not true! He did not steal it!
#JUDGE BRACK.
No other explanation is possible. He must have stolen it - Hush! and MRS. ELVSTED have risen from the table in the back - room, and come into the drawing - room.
#TESMAN.
Hedda, dear, it is almost impossible to see under that lamp. Think of that!
#HEDDA.
Yes, I am thinking.
#TESMAN.
Would you mind our sitting at your writing - table - eh?
#HEDDA.
If you like. No, wait! Let me clear it first!
#TESMAN.
Oh, you needn't trouble, Hedda. There is plenty of room.
#HEDDA.
No no, let me clear it, I say! I will take these things in and put them on the piano. There!
#HEDDA.
Well, my sweet Thea, - how goes it with Eilert Lovborg's monument?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh, it will be terribly hard to put in order.
#TESMAN.
We must manage it. I am determined. And arranging other people's papers is just the work for me.
#HEDDA.
What did you say about the pistol?
#JUDGE BRACK.
That he must have stolen it.
#HEDDA.
Why stolen it?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Because every other explanation ought to be impossible, Mrs. Hedda.
#HEDDA.
Indeed?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Of course Eilert Lovborg was here this morning. Was he not?
#HEDDA.
Yes.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Were you alone with him?
#HEDDA.
Part of the time.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Did you not leave the room whilst he was here?
#HEDDA.
No.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Try to recollect. Were you not out of the room a moment?
#HEDDA.
Yes, perhaps just a moment - out in the hall.
#JUDGE BRACK.
And where was your pistol - case during that time?
#HEDDA.
I had it locked up in -
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, Mrs. Hedda?
#HEDDA.
The case stood there on the writing - table.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Have you looked since, to see whether both the pistols are there?
#HEDDA.
No.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, you need not. I saw the pistol found in Lovborg's pocket, and I knew it at once as the one I had seen yesterday - and before, too.
#HEDDA.
Have you it with you?
#JUDGE BRACK.
No; the police have it.
#HEDDA.
What will the police do with it?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Search till they find the owner.
#HEDDA.
Do you think they will succeed?
#JUDGE BRACK.
No, Hedda Gabler - not so long as I say nothing.
#HEDDA.
And if you do not say nothing, - what then?
#JUDGE BRACK.
There is always the possibility that the pistol was stolen.
#HEDDA.
Death rather than that.
#JUDGE BRACK.
People say such things - but they don't do them.
#HEDDA.
And supposing the pistol was not stolen, and the owner is discovered? What then?
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, Hedda - then comes the scandal!
#HEDDA.
The scandal!
#JUDGE BRACK.
Yes, the scandal - of which you are so mortally afraid. You will, of course, be brought before the court - both you and Mademoiselle Diana. She will have to explain how the thing happened - whether it was an accidental shot or murder. Did the pistol go off as he was trying to take it out of his pocket, to threaten her with? Or did she tear the pistol out of his hand, shoot him, and push it back into his pocket? That would be quite like her; for she is an able - bodied young person, this same Mademoiselle Diana.
#HEDDA.
But I have nothing to do with all this repulsive business.
#JUDGE BRACK.
No. But you will have to answer the question: Why did you give Eilert the pistol? And what conclusions will people draw from the fact that you did give it to him?
#HEDDA.
That is true. I did not think of that.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Well, fortunately, there is no danger, so long as I say nothing.
#HEDDA.
So I am in your power, Judge Brack. You have me at your beck and call, from this time forward.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Dearest Hedda - believe me - I shall not abuse my advantage.
#HEDDA.
I am in your power none the less. Subject to your will and your demands. slave, a slave then! No, I cannot endure the thought of that! Never!
#JUDGE BRACK.
People generally get used to the inevitable.
#HEDDA.
Yes, perhaps. Well? Are you getting on, George? Eh?
#TESMAN.
Heaven knows, dear. In any case it will be the work of months.
#HEDDA.
Fancy that! Doesn't it seem strange to you, Thea? Here are you sitting with Tesman - just as you used to sit with Eilert Lovborg?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Ah, if I could only inspire your husband in the same way!
#HEDDA.
Oh, that will come too - in time.
#TESMAN.
Yes, do you know, Hedda - I really think I begin to feel something of the sort. But won't you go and sit with Brack again?
#HEDDA.
Is there nothing I can do to help you two?
#TESMAN.
No, nothing in the world. I trust to you to keep Hedda company, my dear Brack.
#JUDGE BRACK.
With the very greatest of pleasure.
#HEDDA.
Thanks. But I am tired this evening. I will go in and lie down a little on the sofa.
#TESMAN.
Yes, do dear - eh?
#MRS. ELVSTED.
Oh - what is that?
#TESMAN.
Why, my dearest Hedda - don't play dance - music to - night! Just think of Aunt Rina! And of Eilert too!
#HEDDA.
And of Aunt Julia. And of all the rest of them. - After this, I will be quiet.
#TESMAN.
It's not good for her to see us at this distressing work. I'll tell you what, Mrs. Elvsted, - you shall take the empty room at Aunt Julia's, and then I will come over in the evenings, and we can sit and work there - eh?
#HEDDA.
I hear what you are saying, Tesman. But how am I to get through the evenings out here?
#TESMAN.
Oh, I daresay Judge Brack will be so kind as to look in now and then, even though I am out.
#JUDGE BRACK.
Every blessed evening, with all the pleasure in life, Mrs. Tesman! We shall get on capitally together, we two!
#HEDDA.
Yes, don't you flatter yourself we will, Judge Brack? Now that you are the one cock in the basket -
#TESMAN.
Oh, now she is playing with those pistols again.
#TESMAN.
Shot herself! Shot herself in the temple! Fancy that!
#JUDGE BRACK.
Good God! - people don't do such things.
