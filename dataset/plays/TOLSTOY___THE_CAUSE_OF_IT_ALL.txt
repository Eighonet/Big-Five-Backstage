#MARTHA.
Oh dear, my heart feels heavy! I know it means trouble; there's nothing to keep him there. It will again be like the other day, when he went to town to sell the firewood and drank nearly half of it. And he blames me for everything.
#AKULÍNA.
Why look for trouble? It is still early, and the town is a long way off. For the present ...
#MARTHA.
What do you mean by early? Akímych is back already. He started after Michael but Michael's not back yet! It's worry worry all day long; that's all the pleasure one gets.
#AKULÍNA.
Akímych took his load straight to a customer; but our man took his to sell at the market.
#MARTHA.
If he were alone I shouldn't worry, but Ignát is with him; and when he's with that lousy hound , he's sure to get drunk. Early and late one toils and moils. Everything is on our shoulders! If one only got anything by it! But no! hustling about all day long is all the pleasure one gets.
#TARÁS.
Good day to you! I've brought a man who wants a night's lodging. It is customary for the village authorities to quarter tramps on each peasant household in a village in turn, or in such order as appears convenient.
#TRAMP.
My respects to you.
#MARTHA.
Why do you bring them to us so often? We put up a tramp last Wednesday night; you always bring them to us. You should make Stepanída put them up; there are no children there. It's more than I can do to look after my own family, and you always bring these people to us.
#TARÁS.
Everyone in turn has to put them up.
#MARTHA.
It's all very well to say "everyone in turn," but I have children, and besides, the master is not at home to - day.
#TARÁS.
Never mind, let the fellow sleep here to - night; he'll not wear out the place he lies on.
#AKULÍNA.
Come in and sit down, and be our guest.
#TRAMP.
I tender my gratitude. I should like a bite of something, if possible.
#MARTHA.
You haven't had time to look round, and want to eat already. Didn't you beg anything in the village?
#TRAMP.
I'm not in the habit of begging because of my position, and having no producks of my own ...
#TRAMP.
Merci. The tramp, who has had some acquaintance with educated Revolutionaries, tries to introduce foreign words, or words not generally used by workmen, into his talk. In this instance he used the French word merci instead of the plain "thank you."
#TARÁS.
And where is Michael?
#MARTHA.
Why, he took hay to the town. It's time he was back, but he's not here. Something must have happened.
#TARÁS.
Why, what should happen?
#MARTHA.
What indeed? Not anything good; it's only bad one has to expect. As soon as he's out of the house he forgets all about us! I expect he'll come back tipsy!
#AKULÍNA.
It's not in her to be quiet. As I always say, we women must find something to grumble about.
#MARTHA.
If he were alone I should not be afraid, but he went with Ignát.
#TARÁS.
Ah well, Ignát Ivánovich certainly is fond of a drop of vódka.
#AKULÍNA.
Doesn't he know what Ignát is like! Ignát is one man, and our Michael's another.
#MARTHA.
It's all very well for you to talk, mother; but I'm sick of his drinking. While he is sober it would be a sin to complain of him, but when he's drunk, you know what he is like. One can't say a word; everything is wrong.
#TARÁS.
Yes, but look at you women too; a man has a drink. Well, he swaggers about a bit, and sleeps it off, and everything goes on all right; but then the likes of you keep on nagging at him.
#MARTHA.
When he's drunk there's no pleasing him, do what you will.
#TARÁS.
But you should understand that we can't help having a drop now and then. Your woman's business is at home, but the likes of us must have a drop when we're on business, or for company's sake. Well, so one drinks, and where is the harm?
#MARTHA.
You may talk, but it's hard on us women. Oh, how hard it is! If one harnessed you men to our work just for a week, you would sing a different tune. Kneading, cooking, baking, spinning, weaving, and the cattle to look after, and all the rest of it, and the brats to keep washed and clothed and fed; it's all on our shoulders, and if anything is the least bit not to his fancy, there you are, especially when he's drunk. Oh dear, what a life ours is!
#TRAMP.
That's quite correct. It's the cause of it all; I mean all the catastrophes of life proceed from alcoholic liquors.
#TARÁS.
It seems to have bowled you over too!
#TRAMP.
No, not exactly that, though I have suffered from that too. The career of my life might have been different but for the drink.
#TARÁS.
Now, to my thinking, if you drink reasonably, there's no manner of harm in it.
#TRAMP.
But I say that it is so strong that it may completely ruin a man.
#MARTHA.
That's what I say: you worry and do your best, and the only comfort you get is to be scolded and beaten like a dog.
#TRAMP.
And that's not all. There are some people, persons I mean, that are quite deprived of their reason through it and commit entirely inappropriate actions. While he does not drink, give him anything you like and he won't take what is not his; but when drunk, he grabs whatever comes handy. Many a time one gets beaten and put in prison. As long as I don't drink, all goes honestly and honourably, but as soon as I drink, I mean as soon as that same person drinks, he at once begins grabbing whatever comes his way.
#AKULÍNA.
And I think it's all in oneself.
#TRAMP.
Of course it's in oneself as long as one is well, but this is a kind of disease. nice kind of disease. A good hiding would soon cure that disease. Well, goodbye for the present.
#AKULÍNA.
Martha, I say, Martha! Cut him another piece.
#MARTHA.
Bother him, I must get the samovár to boil.
#TRAMP.
Merci, I have acquired a great appetite.
#AKULÍNA.
Are you a workman?
#TRAMP.
Who? I? I was a mechanic.
#AKULÍNA.
And what wages did you get?
#TRAMP.
I used to get fifty, and even seventy roubles, a month.
#AKULÍNA.
That's a good lot! Then how have you come down so low?
#TRAMP.
Come down! I'm not the only one. I've come down because the times are such that it is impossible for an honest man to live.
#MARTHA.
Oh Lord! it's certain sure he'll come home drunk. I feel it in my heart.
#AKULÍNA.
I'm afraid he must really have gone on the spree.
#MARTHA.
There it is. One struggles and struggles and kneads and bakes and cooks and spins and weaves and tends the cattle; everything on one's own shoulders. Paráshka, rock the boy. Oh dear, what a life it is for us women. And when he is drunk, nothing is right!... If one only says a word he doesn't like ...
#AKULÍNA.
And this is the last of the tea. Did you tell him to get some?
#MARTHA.
Of course. He said he would, but he'll have forgotten all about his home!...
#AKULÍNA.
Why do you leave the table? We are going to drink tea.
#TRAMP.
I tender my gratitude for the hearty hospitality. he was smoking and comes to the table]. The "cigar" will have probably consisted of some bad tobacco rolled up in a bit of newspaper.
#MARTHA.
And what sort do you belong to? Peasants, or some other?
#TRAMP.
Well, I'm not of the peasant class, nor of the aristocracy. I'm of the double - edged class.
#MARTHA.
What's that?
#TRAMP.
Merci. Why this; that my father was a Polish Count, and besides him I had many others; and I also had two mothers. In general my biography presents many difficulties.
#MARTHA.
Have another cup? Well, did you get any learning?
#TRAMP.
My learning has also been very uncircumstantial. Not my mother, but my godmother apprenticed me to a blacksmith. That blacksmith was my first perdagogue; and his perdagogy consisted in this - that he did not beat his anvil as often as he beat my unfortunate head. Nevertheless, however much he hit me, he could not deprive me of talent. Then I went to a locksmith's, and there I was appreciated, and became foreman. I made acquaintance with educated people, and belonged to a political faction. I was able to master intellectual literature; and my life might have been elevated for I possessed immense talent.
#AKULÍNA.
Of course.
#TRAMP.
But here came an upset. The despotic yoke oppressing the life of the people! I got into prison; I mean, I suffered the incarceration of freedom.
#MARTHA.
What for?
#TRAMP.
For our rights.
#MARTHA.
What rights?
#TRAMP.
What rights? Why the rights that the bourgeois should not feast continually, and that the labouring proletariat might reap the rewards of labour.
#AKULÍNA.
And get back the land, I suppose?
#TRAMP.
Well naturally. The Agromoric question too.
#AKULÍNA.
May God and the Holy Queen of Heaven grant it. We are that pressed for land. Well, and how are things now?
#TRAMP.
Now? I am off to Moscow. I shall go to an exploiter of labour. Can't be helped; I shall humble myself and say - give me what work you will, only take me.
#AKULÍNA.
Well, have some more tea.
#TRAMP.
Thank you; merci I mean.
#AKULÍNA.
Here's Michael, just in time for tea.
#MARTHA.
Oh, my goodness, Ignát is with him! That means he's drunk.
#IGNÁT.
How are you all? Here we are, damn you, just in time for tea. We went to church, service was done; we went to dine, all eaten and gone; to the pub, we went in, just time to begin. Ha, ha, ha! You give us some tea and we'll give you some vódka. That's fair.
#MICHAEL.
Where has this swell come from? Bring some cups.
#AKULÍNA.
Well, did you get on all right?
#IGNÁT.
Nothing could be better, damn you; drank, and had a spree, and have brought some home.
#MICHAEL.
Drink, you too!
#TRAMP.
I offer most heartfelt thanks. Your health.
#IGNÁT.
Fine fellow, how he swills, damn him! I should think hunger makes it run through all his veins.
#TRAMP.
I wish you success in all your undertakings.
#AKULÍNA.
Well, did you get a good price for the hay?
#IGNÁT.
Good or bad, we've drunk it all, damn you! Am I right, Michael?
#MICHAEL.
Why, of course. It's not made to be looked at! One must have some fun once in a hundred years.
#MARTHA.
What are you swaggering for? There's not much good in that. We've nothing to eat at home, and see what you're doing.
#MICHAEL.
Martha!
#MARTHA.
Well, what of Martha? I know I'm Martha. Oh, it makes me sick to look at you.
#MICHAEL.
Martha, look!
#MARTHA.
There's nothing to see. I don't want to look.
#MICHAEL.
Pour out the vódka and serve it round to our visitors.
#MARTHA.
Faugh, you bleary - eyed hound. I don't want to speak to you.
#MICHAEL.
You don't? Ah, you baggage, what did you say?
#MARTHA.
What I said? I said I do not want to talk to you, that's all.
#MICHAEL.
Have you forgotten? One!
#MARTHA.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
#MICHAEL.
You'll not get away, you jade!
#TRAMP.
You have no kind of complete right.
#MICHAEL.
Is it long since you had a thrashing?
#TRAMP.
You have no complete right to subject the female sex to insults.
#MICHAEL.
Oh, you son of a bitch! Do you see this?
#TRAMP.
I will not allow exploitations to be performed on the female sex.
#MICHAEL.
I'll give you such an extolpation that you'll not know which end you stand on....
#TRAMP.
Go on, strike away! Why don't you?
#MICHAEL.
Suppose I really go for you?
#TRAMP.
I tell you, strike!
#MICHAEL.
Well, you are a rum chap, now I come to look at you.
#IGNÁT.
One sees at once that you're pretty sweet on the women, damn you!
#TRAMP.
I stand up for their rights.
#MICHAEL.
Well Martha, you must set a big candle before the saints for his sake. But for him, I'd have beaten you to a jelly.
#MARTHA.
What else can one expect of you. One worries all one's life, baking and cooking; and as soon as ...
#MICHAEL.
Now, have done, have done! Drink. And what are you slobbering for? Mayn't a fellow have his joke? There you are , put it away. Here are two three - rouble notes and two twenty - copeck pieces.
#MARTHA.
And the tea and sugar I wanted?
#MICHAEL.
What an unreasonable lot these women are. There, drink.
#TRAMP.
Drink it yourself.
#MICHAEL.
Come now, don't fuss.
#TRAMP.
Success to you.
#IGNÁT.
You must have seen many a strange sight, I suppose. Oh, what a fine coat you've got! Latest fashion. Where did you get it from? Don't you mend it, it's fine as it is! It's getting on in years, I fancy. Well, it can't be helped. If I had one like it, the women would be sweet on me too! Ain't that true?
#AKULÍNA.
You should not, Ignát Iványch. Before seeing anything of him, why go and hold up a man to laughter?
#TRAMP.
It comes of his uneducatedness.
#IGNÁT.
I'm doing it friendly - like. Drink
#AKULÍNA.
He says himself - it's the cause of all evil - and he's been in prison because of it.
#MICHAEL.
What were you in prison for?
#TRAMP.
I've suffered for expropriation.
#MICHAEL.
What's that?
#TRAMP.
Why, this way. Came up to a fat paunch: "Give up your money, else here's a levolver." He tries this way and that, but forks out 2,300 roubles. As usual he mispronounces his word and calls a "revolver" "a levolver."
#AKULÍNA.
Oh Lord!
#TRAMP.
We meant to dispose of it the proper way. Zembrikóf was our leader. Then those ravens swooped down on us. At once under arrest, and into prison.
#IGNÁT.
And took the money away?
#TRAMP.
Of course. Only they could not convict me. At the trial the procurator said these words to me: "You've stolen money" says he; and I answer him straight: "Thieves steal, but we have performed an expropriation for our Party." And he didn't know what to say. He tried this way and that, but couldn't answer me. "Lead him," says he, "to prison," that is - to the incarceration of free life.
#IGNÁT.
Clever dog! A regular brick! Drink, damn you.
#AKULÍNA.
Fie, how nastily you speak!
#IGNÁT.
I, Grannie? I don't mean it for abuse; it's a manner of speech of mine. Damn you, damn you!... Your good health, Grannie.
#MICHAEL.
That's right. Fancy taking offence! I say, it's thanks to him. What do you think? I cherish my old woman. See, how I cherish her. In a word, my old woman is first - rate. I would not change her for anybody.
#IGNÁT.
There, that's good. Grannie, drink! I stand treat.
#TRAMP.
What it means - the power of enershy! One was in a state of melancholy, and now there's nothing but pleasantness and friendly disposition. Grannie, I feel much love for you and for everybody. Brothers dear
#MICHAEL.
It has got right hold of him in his hunger.
#MARTHA.
I must go and chop some firewood.
#AKULÍNA.
He'd have beaten you black and blue yesterday, had it not been for that fellow. I don't see him. Has he gone? I suppose he has.
#MICHAEL.
Just look, the sun's already quite high. She must have gone to fetch water with mother. How my head aches! I won't do it again; the devil take it! I'll go and harness.
#MARTHA.
And yesterday's beggar? Has he gone?
#MICHAEL.
Must have gone. Can't see him.
#MARTHA.
Oh well, let him go. He seemed a clever chap though.
#MICHAEL.
He took your part!
#MARTHA.
What of that!
#MARTHA.
And the tea and sugar? Did you put them away last night, eh?
#MICHAEL.
I thought you did.
#MARTHA.
Mother, have you taken the parcel?
#AKULÍNA.
No, I know nothing about it. I haven't seen it.
#MARTHA.
Last night, I put it on the window - sill.
#AKULÍNA.
Yes, I saw it there.
#MARTHA.
Where can it be?
#AKULÍNA.
Dear me, what a shame!
#NEIGHBOUR.
Well Michael Tikhónych, are we to go for the wood?
#MICHAEL.
Yes, of course. I'm just going to harness; but you see we've lost something.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Dear me! What is it?
#MARTHA.
Why, you see, my old man brought a parcel from town yesterday, with tea and sugar in it, and I put it down here on the window - sill and didn't remember to put it away; and now it's gone.
#MICHAEL.
And we're committing the sin of suspecting a tramp who spent the night here.
#NEIGHBOUR.
What sort of tramp?
#MARTHA.
Well, he's rather thin and has no beard.
#MICHAEL.
His coat's all in rags.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Curly hair and rather hooked nose?
#MICHAEL.
Yes, yes!
#NEIGHBOUR.
I've just met him, and wondered why he was stepping out so fast.
#MICHAEL.
It must be him. Where was he?
#NEIGHBOUR.
I don't think he can have crossed the bridge yet.
#MICHAEL.
I'll catch the knave. It's him.
#MARTHA.
Oh, what a shame, what a shame! It's surely him.
#AKULÍNA.
And suppose it's not. It happened once, some twenty years ago, that they accused a man of having stolen a horse. A crowd collected. One says: "I myself saw him catching it." Another says he saw him leading it. It was a big piebald horse, easily noticed. All the people began searching for it, and in the forest they found the lad. "It's you," they say. He protests and swears it was not him. They say: "What's the good of listening to him; the women said quite certainly it's him." Then he said something rude. George Lapúshkin was a hot - tempered man. He dashed at him slap bang, and struck him on the mouth. "It was you," said he, and hit out at him. Then all the others fell on him and began beating him with sticks and fists till they killed him. And what do you think!.... Next day the real thief was found. The lad they killed had only gone into the forest to choose a tree to cut down.
#MARTHA.
Yes, of course, we may be sinning against him. He has come down very low, but seemed a good fellow.
#AKULÍNA.
Yes, he has sunk very low. One can't expect much from the likes of him.
#MARTHA.
They're shouting. I expect they're bringing him back.
#MICHAEL.
It was found on him. You thief! You dog!
#AKULÍNA.
It's him, poor soul. See how he hangs his head.
#MARTHA.
It seems it was himself he spoke about yesterday that grabs anything that's handy when he's had some drink.
#TRAMP.
I'm not a thief; I'm an expropriator. I am a worker and must live. You can't understand it. Do what you like with me.
#NEIGHBOUR.
Take him to the village Elder or straight to the police!
#TRAMP.
I tell you, do whatever you like. I am not afraid, and am ready to suffer for my convictions. If you were educated you would understand.
#MARTHA.
Suppose we let him go, in God's name. We've got the parcel back. Let him go and let's not commit another sin.
#MICHAEL.
"Another sin!" Taken to teaching? One wouldn't know what to do without you, eh?
#MARTHA.
Why not let him go?
#MICHAEL.
"Let him go!" One knows what to do without you, you fool. "Let him go!" Go he may, but he must hear a word or two so that he should feel. Well then, listen, you sir, to what I have to say to you. Though you are in a very low state, still you have done very wrong - very wrong. Another man would have caved your ribs in, and have taken you to the police; but I will only say this. You've done wrong, as wrong as may be; only you are in a very bad way and I don't want to hurt you. Go, and God be with you, and do not do it again. And you want to teach me!
#NEIGHBOUR.
You shouldn't, Michael; oh, you should not. You're encouraging that sort of thing.
#MICHAEL.
Whether I should or not is my business. And you tried to teach me! Take it, you can drink it on the way. And you wanted to teach me! Go, you've been told to go. Then go, and no palavering.
#TRAMP.
You think I don't understand. I fully understand. Had you beaten me like a dog, it would have felt less hard. Don't I understand what I am? I am a rascal, a degenerate, I mean. Forgive me for the Lord's sake. good thing he didn't take the tea, or we should have had none to drink.
#MICHAEL.
And you wanted to teach me!
#NEIGHBOUR.
How he cried, poor soul.
#AKULÍNA.
He too was a man.
