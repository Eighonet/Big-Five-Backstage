#MRS. DESMYTHE.
There's positively nothing like it! Nothing anywhere near it!
#MADAM SATEENE.
No, and nothing that can be used.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
There! That's a lover's knot pattern. Why, it -
#MADAM SATEENE.
No, that's a sailor's knot. There is a great difference.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
I don't see it.
#MADAM SATEENE.
You see the loop in this bends down and in this, it bends - goes up. Every difference in the world, my dear Mrs. De Smythe.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Wouldn't it do? All bunched up?
#MADAM SATEENE.
But it is not to be bunched up!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
What can we do? And I threatened with an attack!
#MADAM SATEENE.
I don't know! I am at my wit's end. Let me think.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Take the lace off!
#MADAM SATEENE.
My dear Mrs. De Smythe, the gown is modelled for lace.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Oh!
#MADAM SATEENE.
Let me see; Wednesday morning. Ten o'clock. It might be done. Practically two days. No, it couldn't! We might use chiffon.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Maude hates chiffon.
#MADAM SATEENE.
Chiffon is a very artistic trimming.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
It may be - it may be, but you know Maude.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Jennie, you look ready to faint!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Sit down. Don't stand there like - a - wooden Indian!
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
They don't keel over every few minutes, anyhow! You look ready to faint!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
I feel ready to faint; the lace has given out.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
The lace - ?
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
The lace, you know, for Maude's dress.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Eh - what dress?
#MADAM SATEENE.
Why, Miss Hoppenhoer, what dress?
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
What dress, - oh, Matilda!
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Oh, is that all? I thought the President had been assassinated!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Matilda! I must say you don't seem much interested. I should think you would, - your own niece, too!
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Look at this room, - look at this room! It is a disgrace to a Christian community! Think of the breakfast we had - or rather, that we didn't have! And yesterday! And now you down sick - down sick! Does it take a month to graduate? It's such such non - nonsense!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Nonsense to graduate! Matilda Hoppenhoer! Do stop thrashing about! Ugh, that dust! Katherine will do that.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Katherine is busy; she has ten miles of flutin' to flute!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Well, stop, anyway! My nerves are bad today.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
You are worn out. We're all as cross as bears!
#MADAM SATEENE.
What shall I do? And only a yard needed! I think chiffon -
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Use ribbon.
#MADAM SATEENE.
They used ribbon last year.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Fringe, then, - fringe is very dressy.
#MADAM SATEENE.
They used fringe two years ago.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Well, what's the idea? To use something that hasn't never been used?
#MAUDE.
Goodness, I'm tired! Auntie, your grammar is bad - very bad. What are you doing?
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Getting you ready to graduate.
#MAUDE.
Well sir, I've just been racing around! O, Valeria's going to have chiffon.
#MADAM SATEENE.
Chiffon!
#MAUDE.
Yes, and it's awfully pretty.
#MADAM SATEENE.
Chiffon! Is she?
#MAUDE.
Yes, and - why, what's the matter?
#MADAM SATEENE.
Chiffon!
#MAUDE.
Am I? Am I?
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Am you what? Sit down, child, sit down, you look like a statute!
#MAUDE.
Am I to have chiffon?
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
You are.
#MAUDE.
We can't both have chiffon! I won't be a copy - tale! I won't!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Listen, dearie. The lace has given out.
#MAUDE.
Get more!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
We can't.
#MADAM SATEENE.
And the gown is so modelled that we can use nothing else.
#MAUDE.
I won't have chiffon! I won't - I won't - I won't.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Do not let Madame Sateene see you in a passion.
#MAUDE.
Madam would be in a passion herself! She knows how I feel! O dear! Everything is going wrong! I w - w - won't graduate, so there now!
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
That's sensible! You needn't. I never did.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Matilda, do not encourage the child! Of course she must graduate. Everybody does.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
If everybody stood on their heads, I suppose we'd have to!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
You cannot judge in such matters, Matilda. You are very old - fashioned.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Maybe so, maybe so, but I am alive, and that child'll be dead if -
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Matilda, for heaven's sake, stop!
#MAUDE.
I'll telephone Valeria. May be she -
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Maude, sit down! You will do nothing of the sort. Mrs. Reynolds is such a talker! The whole town would know it in ten minutes. Besides, at the Tuesday Club she cut me - actually cut me! I will not permit it.
#MAUDE.
I don't think that ought to count, now. I suppose I have to have something to wear.
#MADAM SATEENE.
What do you say to a Paris muslin?
#MAUDE.
What is a Paris muslin? sort of fine organdie.
#MAUDE.
Swell?
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Maudie! Would Madam Sateene propose anything else? She doesn't want you to look like a fright. Now, I think, - Why there is papa's voice!
#MAUDE.
Papa, bless his old bones! Papa, come in here, quick! Hurry up!
#MR. DESMYTHE.
What is it - what is it? Is Mamma worse?
#MAUDE.
I can't graduate!
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Can't graduate? Can't graduate? Didn't you pass?
#MAUDE.
Pass! That doesn't matter! My dress, my dress, my dress!
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Oh, your dress! Isn't it fine enough?
#MADAM SATEENE.
Why, you see, Mr. De Smythe, the -
#MAUDE.
I got to have chiffon, ugly, limp, old chiffon! It is so - so - d - drabbled!
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Well, never mind! Hus - s - h! You'll make Mamma worse. You needn't graduate! Never mind.
#MAUDE.
Oh, oh!
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Never mind, little girl, you needn't graduate! Never mind!
#MAUDE.
Oh, I - I must. The presents are coming in.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Return 'em.
#MAUDE.
You wouldn't, if they were yours! You know you wouldn't! Oh, you're all so mean!
#MADAM SATEENE.
Let's have Paris muslin. It'll be lovely.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
It's too stiff.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
And sounds too furrin! Haven't we got any American muslin? I'd rather wear gunny sack.
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Hurrah for Matilda! A female Patrick Henry!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Papa, don't speak so loud!
#MR. DESMYTHE.
I beg your pardon, Mamma, - your poor head!
#MAUDE.
I want something pretty! Not - not just - just any old thing!
#MADAM SATEENE.
Paris muslin is beautiful.
#MAUDE.
The other girls have silk.
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Then you must have silk, too, - decidedly. Mustn't she, Mamma?
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
I do not know, Papa, I do not know. This is a dreadful time, - a dreadful time. I fear I shall not live to see her graduate! But you will all enjoy it. Matilda, will you heat the salt bags?
#MAUDE.
O, you precious, precious Mamma! Don't you dare get sick and die!
#KATHERINE.
Miss Reynolds and Mr. Hamilton.
#MAUDE.
Hello, Valeria, how you vas? Jack, did you get 'em?
#JACK.
Couldn't MAUDE, nothing but red.
#MAUDE.
Red! I can't wear red! Madam Sateene, can I?
#MADAM SATEENE.
Yes, you can. You will need a touch of color.
#VALERIA.
Why don't you carry pink ones?
#JACK.
Pink roses are lovely. You carried pink ones at the Junior Banquet, didn't you, Val?
#VALERIA.
Did I? Yes, I did! Bridesmaid, I think they were.
#MAUDE.
I hate pink roses!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Maudie, Maudie, do not be so vehement!
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Never mind about the roses. They are a side issue. The question is, "Wherewithal shall you be clothed!" I must be off to earn your daily cake. Let's decide.
#MAUDE.
Jack, do you like Paris muslin?
#JACK.
Is it anything like Plaster of Paris?
#MAUDE.
Jack, behave! I am so worried!
#VALERIA.
She's just tired, poor dear; don't tease her, Jack.
#MAUDE.
I am not tired. He can't tease me, thank you,
#VALERIA.
I think, Madam, I will have Paris muslin. Silk is so common.
#JACK.
Why don't you have bobinet?
#VALERIA.
Why, Jack, bobinet is -
#JACK.
I know what bobinet is; heavy and kind of corded, - dead swell.
#MAUDE.
That's pique!
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Well, children, defer that discussion until the Fourth of July. Is there time for a whole new rig?
#MADAM SATEENE.
Y - e - s, - I think so.
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Cheer up, everybody! We'll have the prettiest frock in the outfit, if it breaks the R.I.P. Railroad! We are the people! I must go hunt those papers - things are stirred up so! Good - bye, Mamma, don't worry! Madam Sateene will save us!
#MADAM SATEENE.
I shall go look at Paris muslins. Shall I bring you samples?
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
No, I am not able to decide. We trust to you absolutely,
#MADAM SATEENE.
Sateene, absolutely. I believe I am going to have an attack! Oh, dear, my nerves! They actually twitch! I wish Matilda were of some use in such matters. Because she never graduated, she thinks
#MAUDE.
shouldn't! Jack, do you see my smelling salts?
#MADAM SATEENE.
Miss Maude, how would you like ribbon, very narrow satin ribbon?
#MAUDE.
Kate Saunders had that in - let me see, - oh, in 1900.
#VALERIA.
And that French Girl, - Giggre - wore it last year.
#MADAM SATEENE.
O dear! Anybody ever use rope?
#JACK.
Only men - for neck - ties mostly. I can't find it, Mrs. De Smythe.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Then Matilda has put it in the medicine chest. She is so neat! I can't help it - I don't want to have an attack! What shall I do? But I am afraid I - I am going to have one!
#MAUDE.
O, Mamma, don't have an attack! What shall I do? No roses, no dress, no nothing!
#MADAM SATEENE.
Well, you shall have a dress, about noon, to give you if it is my last effort! Mrs. De Smythe, I'll drop in and report!
#VALERIA.
I must go. I stopped for a list of my committee.
#MAUDE.
Don't go. What committee?
#VALERIA.
Committee on Decorations.
#MAUDE.
Committee on - ?
#VALERIA.
Decorations. Wake up!
#MAUDE.
O yes! This desk is disgraceful! Here it is! "Be it resolved - " goodness, that's about poor Ned Woodruff! Jack, who was on that committee?
#JACK.
Miss Secretary, I do not keep the minutes.
#MAUDE.
Well, you were presiding! Here it is, - six, - is that enough? Five, rather, - Hal Taylor won't serve.
#VALERIA.
O yes, he will.
#MAUDE.
Said he wouldn't! Told Mabel Hopeland so last night.
#VALERIA.
Yes, he will.
#MAUDE.
Well, he said he wouldn't.
#VALERIA.
He will if I ask him.
#MAUDE.
Oh!
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Jennie, you'd better go to bed.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
I will. I hope I shall not have an attack.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Attack! We'll all have an attack before Friday night!
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Now, can you walk, do you think? I'd better call Katherine, hadn't I? Katherine! Be careful of that bag - it's hot - awful hot! Lean on me -
#JACK.
Can't I help you! A fellow never knows what to do when - when - anybody has an attack.
#JACK.
Come on, Maude, I've got an old tandem out there. Let's take a spin.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Got a what?
#JACK.
Go get ready, Maude. A tandem.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
You ride it?
#JACK.
Yes, ma'am.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Ride it?
#JACK.
Yessum. Yes, ma'am.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Ride a tantrum! Well, such goings on! And all of it comes from graduating! Thank Heaven, I never graduated!
#MISS RANTUM.
It is best to hold it in one hand.
#JACK.
Oh, are you going to read it?
#MAUDE.
W - e - l - l, not exactly read it, you know.
#MAUDE.
I really know it - almost.
#JACK.
Then don't hold the paper.
#MAUDE.
Oh, but if I should forget!
#JACK.
You won't!
#MAUDE.
I might! Oh, it's very easy for you to say orate, for you can!
#JACK.
Yes, but you could, too.
#MISS RANTUM.
What is the subject of your oration, Mr. Hamilton?
#JACK.
"Universality in Statecraft."
#MAUDE.
And it's a dandy! You ought to hear him when he comes to, "For of all the nations, builded of power and sealed with blood - "
#JACK.
Oh, now, Maude, I say, let up.
#MAUDE.
Well, honest, you are fine. No I should die if I forgot, - just simply die.
#MISS RANTUM.
It is wiser for her to hold her manuscript, I think. This is an essay, not an oration.
#MAUDE.
Of course, Jack, don't you see? It is an essay, not an oration. Now, did I get up right?
#MISS RANTUM.
Try it again.
#MAUDE.
Is that it?
#JACK.
Too corky.
#MISS RANTUM.
Be leisurely. Leisure is elegance. And bend more. Try it again, - so.
#MAUDE.
I do hope I won't drop anything. How was that?
#MISS RANTUM.
A trifle - just a trifle - well, er - stiff. Of all things, a lady must rise well.
#JACK.
Yes, not as if she were shot out of a cannon!
#MAUDE.
Jack, you keep still!
#MISS RANTUM.
Try it again - so. Bend from the waist.
#JACK.
That was better.
#MISS RANTUM.
Now, go on.
#MAUDE.
"Life's Inner Meanings."
#MISS RANTUM.
Louder and more deliberately. "Life's Inner Meanings."
#MAUDE.
"Life's Inner Meanings."
#MISS RANTUM.
Go on, not too fast. Don't hold it so high and bend the body forward from the waist.
#MAUDE.
"As a traveler, among the mighty mountains, fails to realize the height to which he has climbed - "
#MISS RANTUM.
Compose yourself, compose yourself! Your voice is - well, unnatural.
#JACK.
Yes, it's squeaky.
#MAUDE.
It isn't! You're awfully mean! I've got to be heard!
#MISS RANTUM.
Try it again. Use a deeper tone. "As a traveler, among the mighty mountains, fails to realize the height - " Now, go on.
#MAUDE.
"As a traveler, among the mighty mountains, fails to realize the height to which he has climbed, so we, in Life's dusty pathway, cannot estimate the distance we have traveled." O, Miss Rantum, that isn't right!
#MISS RANTUM.
No, not exactly, not precisely right. You see, you -
#JACK.
Why don't you use "journeyed" instead of "traveled"?
#MAUDE.
Miss Rantum, what is the matter with it? I'm not doing as well as I did last week!
#MISS RANTUM.
No, you really aren't, but -
#JACK.
I say, why don't you change -
#MAUDE.
What is the matter, Miss Rantum?
#MISS RANTUM.
It isn't firm. You don't seem to know what you are saying.
#MAUDE.
"As the traveler, among the mighty mountains, fails to - "
#JACK.
Finally, my beloved brethren -
#MISS RANTUM.
Lighter, but firmly. Use a conversational tone, "As the traveler, among the mountains;" "It is a very pleasant day," "How do you do?" See?
#MAUDE.
"As a traveler, among the mountains - mighty mountains - fails to realize the height to which he has climbed - has climbed, so we, in Life's dusty pathway, cannot estimate the distance we have traveled."
#JACK.
"Climbed - climbed." I don't like "climbed" there; wouldn't "attained" be better?
#MAUDE.
Professor Grindem didn't say so.
#JACK.
"Attained" is a prettier word.
#MAUDE.
Do you think so?
#MISS RANTUM.
"Climbed" is better. It is a real traveler and real mountains, hence "climbed." "Attained" sounds as if it were ideals, you know.
#MAUDE.
Yes, I think so, too. Besides, it's too late to change it now. I'd forget.
#JACK.
All right! "On with the dance." I'm no judge.
#MISS RANTUM.
Go on with the next paragraph.
#MAUDE.
The next isn't a paragraph.
#MISS RANTUM.
Well, go on with the next.
#MAUDE.
"Among life's bright flowers, its rugged slopes, its pleasant walleys - "
#MISS RANTUM.
Valleys.
#MAUDE.
"Its pleasant walleys, its - "
#MISS RANTUM.
Valleys.
#MAUDE.
Let me start over.
#MISS RANTUM.
Well, only use deeper tones.
#MAUDE.
"Among life's bright flowers, its rugged slopes, its pleasant walleys - valleys, its dangerous pitfalls, we cannot realize the magnitood of the common things about us."
#MISS RANTUM.
"Magnitude," not "tood."
#MAUDE.
"The magnitude of the common things about us."
#MISS RANTUM.
Touch "common things" more lightly; "of the common things about us," - "common things."
#MAUDE.
We cannot realize the magnitood - tude - of the "common - " oh, dear, I can never say it!"
#MISS RANTUM.
Yes, you can. You are doing well, - remarkably well.
#MAUDE.
O Miss Rantum!
#JACK.
You are, honest Injun! It'll be dandy.
#MISS RANTUM.
Please read, - are you tired standing?
#MAUDE.
No, - I got to get it.
#MISS RANTUM.
Please read that second paragraph - sentence - again.
#MAUDE.
Among life's bright flowers, its rugged slopes -
#MISS RANTUM.
R - r - r - rugged slopes.
#MAUDE.
Rugged slopes.
#MISS RANTUM.
No, r - r - rugged slopes. Trill your "r."
#MAUDE.
I can't.
#JACK.
What's the use? I don't think she need. People only do that on Decoration Day. "Br - rave, r - rugged heroes," you know.
#KATHERINE.
Miss Maude, a letter from you - for you, I mean.
#JACK.
That girl is scared to death at anything that looks like writing. Did you see her?
#MISS RANTUM.
Is she of foreign extraction?
#JACK.
No, foreign distraction.
#MAUDE.
From Valeria. She can't come over this afternoon. She's got to, to - I can't make it out. B - a - an, B - a - n -
#JACK.
Banana, maybe. She's got to banana. Let me see it, I'm used to her hand.
#MAUDE.
Indeed! Indeed, you are! Maybee this is your note?
#JACK.
You needn't get so mad. Let her banana. I don't care!
#MAUDE.
Neither do I! Take the note!
#KATHERINE.
Perfesser Grindem.
#JACK.
All right Katherine, we are perpared!
#GRINDEM.
Ah, good morning, ladies, good morning! Mr. Hamilton, ah, good morning! How is the work progressing?
#MAUDE.
I shall be scared to death.
#GRINDEM.
Not at all, Miss Maude, ah, not at all! Not at all! You will feel power, - power is ahem! - power is a great thing - a great thing.
#MAUDE.
Yes, Professor.
#GRINDEM.
May I hear the - ah, Mrs. De Smythe, good morning!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Yes, Maudie, dear, read it all to us. O Matilda, Matilda, my salts! Now, Maudie!
#MAUDE.
"Life's Inner Meanings." very pretty subject, I think.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
A very pretty broad one, I think!
#MAUDE.
"Life's Inner Meanings."
#MISS RANTUM.
Stand straighter, Miss Maude - so.
#JACK.
I think that's awkward, - looks as if she were going to cry "Lay on, Macduff!"
#MAUDE.
Why, Jack Hamilton!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Jack's only joking. Why don't you go on?
#MAUDE.
"Life's Inner Meanings," "As a traveler among the mighty mountains, fails to realize the height to which he has climbed, so we, in Life's dusty pathway, cannot estimate the distance we have traveled. Among life's bright flowers, its rugged slopes, its pleasant walleys - valleys, its dangerous pitfalls, we cannot realize the magnitood - tude - magnitude of the common things about us."
#MISS RANTUM.
Don't sway so. Hold the body firm.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
There's no hurry, child.
#JACK.
That pace would kill!
#MISS RANTUM.
Her voice is not deep enough. It lacks impressiveness.
#GRINDEM.
Yes, it lacks power - power, I should say.
#MAUDE.
I can't get a new voice for this old essay!
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Yes, you ought to; you ought to be made over if you're going to graduate!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Do go on; I am very fond of the next part.
#MAUDE.
"We stand upon the brink - "
#MISS RANTUM.
More rapidly there, "We stand upon the brink!"
#MAUDE.
"We stand upon the brink."
#JACK.
That is, if we don't fall off -
#MAUDE.
Make Jack be still or I - I - can't!
#JACK.
Beg your pardon, but really, 'a brink,' you know.
#MAUDE.
"We stand upon the brink - who can guess what say the dashing waters beneath? Who can interpret the silence of the eternal stars? We rest in the walley - valley, who can understand the whispering of the leaves? Who can read the secrets of the ocean blue? O, deep are the inner meanings, - deep, deep are the mysteries of nature, infinite are the suggestions of life!"
#GRINDEM.
Too, rapidly, Miss Maude, - too rapidly. Those are grand sentiments, - give 'em time - give 'em time.
#MISS RANTUM.
There is not enough emotion in the climax: "Deep, deep are the mysteries of nature!" Read it "Deep, deep are the mysteries of nature!"
#MAUDE.
"Deep, deep are the mysteries of nature!"
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
You are not doing so well, Maudie, today.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
No, I think you get worse.
#MAUDE.
Nobody c - could! You all find fault. You couldn't do any better - none of you - so there now!
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Never mind! It doesn't matter. Don't graduate.
#MAUDE.
It does matter! It d - does! I don't want to disgrace the family.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Ought to have commenced sooner, then, if you didn't!
#VOICE FROM WITHOUT.
Who's going to disgrace the family? I'd like to see 'em try it.
#MAUDE.
I am!
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Oh, no, you're not, - not by the R.I.P. Railroad! You won't be permitted to, Miss! Doesn't the dress fit?
#MAUDE.
The dress! Oh, Papa, my piece!
#MR. DESMYTHE.
O, you're piece! Say it to me! I haven't heard it today.
#MAUDE.
You're making fun of me!
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
The child is worn out.
#MAUDE.
I am not worn out! I am not a baby! I wish I was d - d - dead!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
O dear! O dear! Maudie, child!
#MAUDE.
I just w - wish I was.
#MR. DESMYTHE.
W - h - y - ee! When I have brought you your present! I am astonished!
#MAUDE.
Have you? Oh, Papa, have you? Let me see!
#MR. DESMYTHE.
No more tears?
#MAUDE.
No - never.
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Honest? I've never seen so many tears. We are a Johnstown flood lately. watch! A w - a - t - c - h!!
#MR. BULBUS.
I come to see about them decorations.
#MAUDE.
A watch!
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Guess we don't need 'em, Mr. Bulbus. There is something going on at the school that night.
#MAUDE.
I was afraid it would be books.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
We might have a reception.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Jennie, you'll be sick! Mark my words, you'll have an attack!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
But it's so nearly over -
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Ought we to have one? Does everybody?
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Does everybody have what? Have an attack?
#MR. DESMYTHE.
A reception.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
It's the thing to do, isn't it, Miss Rantum?
#MISS RANTUM.
I beg your pardon, Mrs. De Smythe?
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
It's the thing to do - to have a reception, isn't it?
#MISS RANTUM.
They always do in Boston.
#MAUDE.
Do what in Boston?
#MISS RANTUM.
They have receptions.
#JACK.
And Beans.
#MR. DESMYTHE.
And here is Mr. Bulbus waiting! He is a business man, you know. When do you want him, Jennie?
#MR. BULBUS.
Yes, sir.
#MAUDE.
You'd just as soon wait, wouldn't you, Mr. Bulbus?
#MR. BULBUS.
Yes, I - d - I'd - I'd rather.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
We must decide while Mr. Bulbus is here, so we can get his suggestions.
#MR. BULBUS.
Yes'sum.
#MISS RANTUM.
Well, Miss Maude, I think we will not need another rehearsal.
#MAUDE.
Oh, Miss Rantum, do you think I can do it all right?
#MISS RANTUM.
Yes, I think so. You must rest this evening.
#MAUDE.
The Juniors are to give us a spread.
#MISS RANTUM.
But you must not go. Mr. De Smythe, may I speak to you?
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Go on with your reception business. Mr. Bulbus hasn't all day.
#MR. BULBUS.
Yes, sir.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Won't you be seated, Mr. Bulbus?
#MR. BULBUS.
Yessum, thank yer.
#MAUDE.
Let's have just the graduating class.
#JACK.
No, I'm dead tired of the push! Let's have a picked crowd, - friends of "the highly contracting parties," you know.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
We ought to have your professors.
#MAUDE.
We'd have to invite Grindem, and he's so awfully -
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Professor Grindem is a very delightful gentleman, Maudie!
#JACK.
Yes, ahem, he has - power - ahem, - power is - power is a wonderful thing, a wonderful thing!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Well, as to the decorations.
#MAUDE.
Smilax from the chandelier -
#JACK.
Don't let's have any smilax. It's too much like funerals.
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Well, Mr. Bulbus, have they decided?
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
No, Papa, we can't decide who to have.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Let that slide now, and go into a committee of the whole on decorations.
#MAUDE.
Let's - but I don't want the faculty.
#JACK.
You'd like to have Professor Graham. All girls are gone on him.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
We needn't order cut flowers. All of Maudie's -
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Jennie, you'll have an attack! I won't be no committee! I won't encourage this nonsense. Education is all right; everybody needs a little, - enough to make an honest livin'. But look at your mother, look at your father! They're plumb wore out settin' up nights to get you graduated! In my day when girls got through school they quit, they didn't go to Commencin' and carrin' on! I won't be no committee of the whole nor no other kind. When you're all dead nobody can blame me!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Oh, dear, now she'll go sweep every room in the house!
#MAUDE.
Mamma mustn't wear herself out. It would be all right if Auntie had graduated.
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Matilda's Declaration of Independence! Draw up your chairs, gentlemen. We'll have to 'wait til the clouds roll by'.
#KATHERINE.
The bill's been a - ringin' all morning like that.
#MR. BULBUS.
I should think you'd be tired. Ain't yer?
#KATHERINE.
No, it's as exciting as a wedding.
#MR. BULBUS.
You wimmen like weddin's. I never see a woman as didn't.
#KATHERINE.
Are you going to decorate the hall?
#MR. BULBUS.
Of course, - palms and ropes of smilax -
#JACK.
Good morning, Katherine. I let myself in, you not being a regiment. Good morning, Mr. Bulbus. You look pretty festive in here. "Compliments of Harold Taylor." - Umph, got them here in time, I should say. "With love of Edith." - girls always put on "with love of." "Wishing you a joyous day. Dick Dowell." That's nice of Dick, considering the late unpleasantness. "Lucile," of course; "Lucile" in white and gold! A girl couldn't graduate unless she had three 'Luciles' and a 'Maurine!' Golden Gate roses! Whew, that means dough! Professor Graham, I'll bet! He's got dough and cheek -
#JACK.
O, hello, Maude! Aren't we fine? Swagger!
#MAUDE.
Jack, how do I look?
#JACK.
Turn around, - slowly.
#MAUDE.
Well?
#JACK.
You look - you look - out of sight! By George, you do!
#MAUDE.
You like the train?
#JACK.
It's splendid. You're a - a queen! I'd kiss you -
#MAUDE.
H - u - s - h! Mr. Bulbus!
#JACK.
Oh, he's gone.
#MAUDE.
Goodness, what if he'd been there!
#JACK.
He wasn't.
#MAUDE.
But you didn't know it!
#JACK.
Don't you think I didn't know it! 'Spose I want to make the poor duffer green with envy? I can't kiss you anyway, you're too fine.
#MAUDE.
No, I can't even sit down! Jack, you look awfully handsome.
#JACK.
Thank you. Would you wear a rose?
#MAUDE.
Of course - one of Dick's. Nice of Dick, wasn't it?
#JACK.
Don't leave so much green show. I want a contrast, not a study in tints.
#MAUDE.
Don't touch me! Hold your arms out straight.
#JACK.
Then hurry up! I am not the stuff martyrs are made of.
#MAUDE.
Is that all right?
#JACK.
Stand off and get the effect. How can I tell?
#MAUDE.
Put down your arms!
#JACK.
Well?
#MAUDE.
Perfectly lovely! My, I shall be proud of you! For pity's sake, don't look at me!
#JACK.
Can't help it.
#MAUDE.
I don't mean now - goosey! I mean when I read. If I should forget!
#JACK.
You won't! Keep your eye on Old South Church and -
#MAUDE.
On what?
#JACK.
I beg your pardon. On Miss Rantum.
#MAUDE.
Oh! It must be time, - where is everybody?
#JACK.
I'm here,
#MAUDE.
O you, yes! But I mean mamma! I am so nervous!
#JACK.
You girls just try to be nervous. You think it's becoming.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
The carriages have come. Where can Papa be?
#MAUDE.
O, it isn't time, is it? O horrors, where is my essay? Jack, please look in my desk.
#MAUDE.
Mamma, is my hair all right?
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Yes, Maudie, yes, you look lovely.
#JACK.
Here it is, but don't practice now.
#MAUDE.
"As a traveler, among the mighty mountains, fails to realize - to realize the heights to which he has climbed, so we, in Life's dusty pathway, cannot estimate the distance we have - we have, - cannot estimate the distance we have - " There, I knew I didn't know it! What shall I do?
#JACK.
Open your manuscript.
#MAUDE.
"Deep, deep are the mysteries of nature, infinite are - are - "
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Maudie, here is a letter from Uncle John.
#MAUDE.
O, I wonder what he sent! Is this all!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Why, Maudie! Read it.
#MAUDE.
"My dearest Niece: Hail to the happy day! 'Way down here in South Africa, 'mong monkeys and Boers, I feel the excitement. We don't graduate down here, but we know people who do. Never, I know, has the house of De Smythe been so shaken. In honor thereof, I am sending a - a - " O, goodness, I can't - "a diamond ring," - a diamond! Hasn't it come?
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Does he say when?
#MAUDE.
He says "I am sending - " Katherine is such a stupy! Katherine -
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Maybe this is it.
#MAUDE.
O, O. O.! Isn't it a beauty! Jack, look!
#JACK.
Umph! Yes, I see.
#MAUDE.
Dear Uncle John! Everybody is so good! It's bigger than VALERIA's. Must I wear gloves? I don't care, I just won't.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Your roses, Maudie.
#MAUDE.
O, your roses, Jack! They're lovely!
#JACK.
The red weren't pretty, so I got pink. I hope you'll -
#MAUDE.
I just love pink roses!
#MAUDE.
"With Valeria's dearest love." A bonbon dish! Isn't it lovely! And violets on it!
#JACK.
It will hold two pounds!
#MAUDE.
It isn't a bit too big! If you won't fill it - well, there are others. I'm forgetting my piece. "Deep, deep are the mysteries - "
#JACK.
Are you going to say it?
#MAUDE.
No, but I must really know it, you know, so I can look up often.
#JACK.
"O, I see clearly," said the blind man.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Dear, dear, this is just as if you were getting married! The presents and the flowers and the carriages and - and everything. O, suppose you were - suppose you were!
#MAUDE.
But I'm not! I'm graduating!
#JACK.
I don't think they're much alike! Mrs. De S. But where is Papa?
#JACK.
As I came, I saw him at the drug store.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
The drug store! Why in the world - oh, I remember now, - I sent him. We'll never get off.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
I wonder what's happened now? I hope Papa isn't killed!
#MAUDE.
Aren't my presents pretty?
#JACK.
Yes, but you are prettier.
#MAUDE.
Thank you, Mr. Hamilton, but aren't you a little rash?
#JACK.
No, I think not, on mature consideration. Your hair looks like gold - California gold, and those lovely lilies! Who gave you those lilies - of - the - valley?
#MAUDE.
Why California gold?
#JACK.
O, it's redder, and then, it is a native product. You'd be mad if I said antique gold.
#MAUDE.
But do you like antique gold better?
#JACK.
That isn't the point. Who gave you those lilies?
#MAUDE.
Aren't they dear?
#JACK.
Don't know, - didn't buy 'em. Whose tribute are they?
#MAUDE.
"Tribute" sounds like a funeral.
#JACK.
There may be a funeral. Whose are they?
#MAUDE.
Mine.
#JACK.
You know what I mean, Who gave you those?
#MAUDE.
You're awfully cross, I think.
#JACK.
Who gave you those?
#MAUDE.
Mr. Bulbus, the lilies are lovely.
#MR. BULBUS.
Yes'sum, I'm glad you - you like 'em.
#JACK.
Oh! That's awfully nice of you.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Where is your father? It's time to go.
#JACK.
Past time. Grindem said to be there at 9:30.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
What shall we do? I knew he would be late! I hope I shall not have an attack!
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
No, I hope not - in that dress!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
As if one's dress made any difference with an attack! O, there he is! Well, Papa, you - good morning, Madam.
#MR. DESMYTHE.
My, how fine we look!
#MAUDE.
Madam Sateene, this shoulder - wrinkles.
#MADAM SATEENE.
Let me see.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
We ought to go.
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Miss Rantum hasn't come.
#JACK.
O, I forgot! Miss Baked Beans will meet us there. She couldn't come here.
#MAUDE.
She promised she would!
#MR. DESMYTHE.
All ready. How many of these do we take? Need a dray?
#MAUDE.
Only Jack's - and I carry them. Jack, you carry my essay and fan. Is it straight? Where are my roses?
#MADAM SATEENE.
Wait one moment. Now.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
Have you any lemon drops?
#MAUDE.
Of course not, - nobody carries lemon drops! Where is my handkerchief!
#JACK.
Here it is.
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Come on, you people.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
O dear, dear, I shall never stand it.
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
We're coming.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
O dear, - kiss me, Maudie. It's just like a wedding! I can't stand it! Some day you'll be getting married!
#JACK.
I hope so.
#MAUDE.
Poor Mamma!
#MR. DESMYTHE.
Come on! Matilda, bring Mamma!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
O, O, O!
#MAUDE.
Brace up, Mamma, you must.
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
And only yesterday she was a baby!
#MISS HOPPENHOER.
And only day before yesterday you were!
#MRS. DESMYTHE.
Come on - we must go. We're coming!
#MAUDE.
O, look out for my flowers! Jack, got my piece? I know I shall forget! What if we're late? Good - bye, Mr. Bulbus!
#MAUDE.
Well, Well! I am not angry - not in the least. You dear old girl! You dear old girl! I know better, - you wouldn't! W - h - y! Why! O goodness gracious! Jack!
#MAUDE.
Jack, what do you think? Only fancy - Valeria is - Jack, listen! Put down your horrid paper! Valeria is married.
#JACK.
Well?
#MAUDE.
Well? Listen: Valeria is married.
#JACK.
Is that so! Valeria - well, well. I'm not astonished.
#MAUDE.
Why not?
#JACK.
O, because - she is so - so handsome.
#MAUDE.
She isn't handsome! Where are your eyes? She's clever - clever, that's what Valeria is. But not handsome, - certainly not. She squints.
#JACK.
I thought you were so fond of her.
#MAUDE.
I am, I am awfully fond of her - I've always been. But affection doesn't blind me. I can love her and see her faults. Nobody ever called Valeria handsome.
#JACK.
Maybe it was stunning.
#MAUDE.
Stunning!
#JACK.
Hal used to rave over her.
#MAUDE.
O! Hal, he - don't rattle your paper so, you make me nervous! Hal didn't care for her.
#JACK.
No, I suppose not, I suppose not. Of course, nobody could.
#MAUDE.
I wonder what she wore! She is too old for white. "You'll be surprised, my dear." Yes, I confess I am. Yes, I am. Where was I? "I want to tell you first, dear." Here it is. So she did wear white - now, I am astonished. For pity sakes! Jack
#JACK.
A man might as well live on Vesuvius.
#MAUDE.
But, Jack, guess who married her.
#JACK.
The man in the Moon. He's too jolly to mind squints.
#MAUDE.
Just guess. You never can.
#JACK.
Then tell me.
#MAUDE.
Hal!
#JACK.
Hal!
#MAUDE.
Hal Taylor.
#JACK.
Hal Taylor. Well, I am - bobbed!
#MAUDE.
I'm not surprised.
#JACK.
You said Hal didn't care for her.
#MAUDE.
He doesn't, Jack. Hal was - roped in.
#JACK.
Well, you women!
#MAUDE.
Don't talk to me. I am disgusted!
#JACK.
Well!
#MAUDE.
Don't sit there, just saying "Well" all the time!
#JACK.
Say, what is it to you?
#MAUDE.
She h - has deceived me - basely deceived me. But I don't care. I shall send her a cut - glass berry dish, - maybe a Tiffany c - c - cut! Coffee, dear?
#JACK.
Yes, don't I always take coffee?
#MAUDE.
Don't scold me. I cannot endure much more. To think Valeria -
#JACK.
Don't think, then. Drop it. What's your other letter?
#MAUDE.
I don't care - I don't care for anything. The biscuits are burned.
#JACK.
No, they are not. Never mind - give the letter to me.
#JACK.
Of course, it's money, - always money. Only a dollar and fifty cents apiece, - a man ought not growl. Umph! "The happy old days." Yes, I remember.
#MAUDE.
Remember what, Jack, dear?
#JACK.
By George!
#MAUDE.
What is it?
#JACK.
By George!
#MAUDE.
What is it? A woman might as well live on - on Vesuvius!
#JACK.
George Graham is in the New York legislature!
#MAUDE.
Professor George De Witt Graham!
#JACK.
The same, my dear. We're to banquet him; it seems he's made a big speech.
#MAUDE.
He was very handsome, and nice to us girls. He pulled us all through chemistry.
#JACK.
Yes, he was a good wire puller. And now he's Senator, Senator in New York. That's great.
#MAUDE.
How do you know? Is that from him?
#JACK.
This is the Alumni Letter.
#MAUDE.
Alumni?
#JACK.
Yes, my dear, the Alumni Letter, - Alumni. We graduated in 1902, - possibly you remember the circumstances. You ought to.
#MAUDE.
How long ago it seems, - how long, long ago!
#JACK.
Thank you. It is. Three years.
#MAUDE.
The lace for my dress gave out, - do you remember? And I wore Paris muslin and Mamma was sick.
#JACK.
It was a great day! You remember your Aunt?
#MAUDE.
Poor Aunty! I can see her now - so 'fraid I would forget - sitting on the edge of her chair! And those lemon drops, - I thought I should faint when Bob brought 'em up!
#JACK.
Yes, I remember how his shoes squeaked! And Bob would usher!
#MAUDE.
Poor Aunty, I hope she is happier now out among the Hottentots. Aren't they Hottentots?
#JACK.
Your Aunt, my dear, is in Korea. Korea is an island just east of -
#MAUDE.
Well aren't the Hottentots there, too? I thought they were all together over there somewhere, - all fat and dusty together, with their queer hats like plates, - all praying and embroidering lovely silks.
#JACK.
As I was saying, Korea is east of - of Asia.
#MAUDE.
Asia was always hard for me. The rivers had such dreadful names! "1902! 1902! We are the people, who are you?" What fun we had! Let's go back!
#JACK.
Haven't time. You write 'em greetings and so on, and enclose three dollars. I wonder where old Grindem is?
#MAUDE.
Old Grindem! You remember his side whiskers? I couldn't bear that man! He was horrid on Commencement day - wouldn't wait one second! Not one second! And Valeria, Poor Valeria!
#JACK.
You looked mighty pretty that day. You didn't need any lace.
#JACK.
And your hair was like gold, - and those lilies - of - the - valley! I remember I went so far as to think of Solomon. How is it? "Solomon in all his glory - all his glory was - was - Solomon was" - how is it?
#MAUDE.
"Was not arrayed like one of these."
#JACK.
O yes - "like one of these," of course. "Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these." You were a sort of female Solomon. Not a Mrs. Solomon, - perish the thought!
#MAUDE.
Jack!
#JACK.
Who gave you those lilies? Come on - tell me now. This is a sort of anniversary when "all things shall be made clear." Old Bulbus?
#JACK.
It was awfully hard on me, your just carrying my roses and putting old Bulbus' lilies in your Solomon hair.
#MAUDE.
They weren't B - B - Bulbuses.
#JACK.
Honest?
#MAUDE.
H - honest.
#JACK.
Whose were they?
#JACK.
Whose were they, Mrs. Hamilton?
#MAUDE.
You won't be mad?
#JACK.
Do I get "mad"? I am not a two - year - old!
#MAUDE.
Nor cross?
#JACK.
Whose lilies were those, I ask!
#MAUDE.
I am going to tell you!
#JACK.
See that you do.
#MAUDE.
Hal sent those lilies.
#JACK.
Hal Taylor?
#MAUDE.
Hal Taylor.
#JACK.
Therefore, Valeria squints!
#MAUDE.
O don't, Jack!
#JACK.
The vanity of woman!
#MAUDE.
But I have your roses, Jack, in the box with my dress! And I shall send Valeria a cut - glass berry - bowl - maybe a Tiffany cut!
