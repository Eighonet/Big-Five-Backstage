#BIGELOW.
Do you know, I'm getting so I'm actually afraid to leave them alone with that governess. She's too romantic. I'll wager she's got a whole book full of ghost stories, superstitions, and yellow - journal horrors up her sleeve.
#MARTHA.
Oh, pooh! Don't go milling around for trouble. When I was a kid I used to get fun out of my horrors.
#BIGELOW.
But I imagine you were more courageous than most of us.
#MARTHA.
Why?
#BIGELOW.
Well, Nevada - the Far West at that time - I should think a child would have grown so accustomed to violent scenes -
#MARTHA.
Oh, in the mining camps; but you don't suppose my father lugged me along on his prospecting trips, do you? Why, I never saw any rough scenes until I'd finished with school and went to live with father in Goldfield.
#BIGELOW.
And then you met Curt.
#MARTHA.
Yes - but I didn't mean he was a rough scene. He was very mild even in those days. Do tell me what he was like at Cornell. romanticist - and he still is!
#MARTHA.
What! That sedate man! Never!
#CURTIS.
Don't mind him, Martha. He always was crazy.
#BIGELOW.
Why did you elect to take up mining engineering at Cornell instead of a classical degree at the Yale of your fathers and brothers? Because you had been reading Bret Harte in prep. school and mistaken him for a modern realist. You devoted four years to grooming yourself for another outcast of Poker Flat.
#CURTIS.
It was you who were hypnotized by Harte - so much so that his West of the past is still your blinded New England - movie idea of the West at present. But go on. What next?
#BIGELOW.
Next? You get a job as engineer in that Goldfield mine - but you are soon disillusioned by a laborious life where six - shooters are as rare as nuggets. You try prospecting. You find nothing but different varieties of pebbles. But it is necessary to your nature to project romance into these stones, so you go in strong for geology. As a geologist, you become a slave to the Romance of the Rocks. It is but a step from that to anthropology - the last romance of all. There you find yourself - because there is no further to go. You win fame as the most proficient of young skull - hunters - and wander over the face of the globe, digging up bones like an old dog.
#CURTIS.
The man is mad, Martha.
#BIGELOW.
Mad! What an accusation to come from one who is even now considering setting forth on a five - year excavating contest in search of the remains of our gibbering ancestor, the First Man!
#CURTIS.
I'm not considering it any longer. I've decided to go.
#MARTHA.
When did you decide?
#CURTIS.
I only really came to a decision this morning. It's a case of got to go. It's a tremendous opportunity that it would be a crime for me to neglect.
#BIGELOW.
And a big honor, too, isn't it, to be picked as a member of such a large affair?
#CURTIS.
I guess it's just that they want all the men with considerable practical experience they can get. There are bound to be hardships and they know I'm hardened to them. We haven't roughed it in the queer corners for the last ten years without knowing how it's done, have we, Martha?
#MARTHA.
No, Curt.
#CURTIS.
And this expedition IS what you call a large affair, Big. It's the largest thing of its kind ever undertaken. The possibilities, from the standpoint of anthropology, are limitless.
#BIGELOW.
Aha! Now we come to the Missing Link!
#CURTIS.
Darn your Barnum and Bailey circus lingo, Big. This isn't a thing to mock at. I should think the origin of man would be something that would appeal even to your hothouse imagination. Modern science believes - knows - that Asia was the first home of the human race. That's where we're going, to the great Central Asian plateau north of the Himalayas.
#BIGELOW.
And there you hope to dig up - our first ancestor?
#CURTIS.
It's a chance in a million, but I believe we may, myself - at least find authentic traces of him so that we can reconstruct his life and habits. I was up in that country a lot while I was mining advisor to the Chinese government - did some of my own work on the side. The extraordinary results I obtained with the little means at my disposal convinced me of the riches yet to be uncovered. The First Man may be among them.
#BIGELOW.
And you were with him on that Asian plateau?
#MARTHA.
Yes, I've always been with him.
#CURTIS.
You bet she has. Martha's more efficient than a whole staff of assistants and secretaries. She knows more about what I'm doing than I do half the time. Well, I guess I'll go in and work some.
#MARTHA.
Do you need me now, Curt?
#BIGELOW.
Yes, if you two want to work together, why just shoo me -
#CURTIS.
No. Sit down, Big. I don't need Martha now. I couldn't deprive Big of an audience for his confessions of a fond parent.
#BIGELOW.
Aha! Now it's you who are mocking at something you know nothing about.
#CURTIS.
I guess you're forgetting, aren't you, Big?
#MARTHA.
Poor Curt.
#BIGELOW.
I had forgotten -
#MARTHA.
The years have made me reconciled. They haven't Curt. I suppose it's hard for any of you back here to realize that Curt and I ever had any children.
#BIGELOW.
How old were they when - ?
#MARTHA.
Three years and two - both girls. We had a nice little house in Goldfield. We were very respectable home folks then. The wandering came later, after - It was a Sunday in winter when Curt and I had gone visiting some friends. The nurse girl fell asleep - or something - and the children sneaked out in their underclothes and played in the snow. Pneumonia set in - and a week later they were both dead.
#BIGELOW.
Good heavens!
#MARTHA.
We were real lunatics for a time. And then when we'd calmed down enough to realize - how things stood with us - we swore we'd never have children again - to steal away their memory. It wasn't what you thought - romanticism - that set Curt wandering - and me with him. It was a longing to lose ourselves - to forget. He flung himself with all his power into every new study that interested him. He couldn't keep still, mentally or bodily - and I followed. He needed me - then - so dreadfully!
#BIGELOW.
And is it that keeps driving him on now?
#MARTHA.
Oh, no. He's found himself. His work has taken the place of the children.
#BIGELOW.
And with you, too?
#MARTHA.
Well, I've helped - all I could. His work has me in it, I like to think - and I have him.
#BIGELOW.
I think people are foolish to stand by such an oath as you took - forever. Children are a great comfort in one's old age, I've tritely found.
#MARTHA.
Old age!
#BIGELOW.
I'm knocking at the door of fatal forty.
#MARTHA.
You're not very tactful, I must say. Don't you know I'm thirty - eight?
#BIGELOW.
A woman is as old as she looks. You're not thirty yet.
#MARTHA.
After that nice remark I'll have to forgive you everything, won't I?
#LILY.
Hello, Martha. Hello, Big. I walked right in regardless. Hope I'm not interrupting.
#MARTHA.
Not at all.
#LILY.
I must say it sounded serious. I heard you tell Big you'd forgive him everything, Martha. You're letting yourself in for a large proposition.
#BIGELOW.
The past is never past for a dog with a bad name, eh, Lily? If you want to reward me for my truthfulness, Mrs. Jayson, help me take the kids for an airing in the car. I know it's an imposition but they've grown to expect you. By Jove, I'll have to run along. I'll get them and then pick you up here. Is that all right?
#MARTHA.
Fine.
#BIGELOW.
I'll run, then. Good - by, Lily.
#MARTHA.
Come on over here, Lily.
#LILY.
You were forgetting, weren't you?
#MARTHA.
What?
#LILY.
That you'd invited all the family over here to tea this afternoon. I'm the advance guard.
#MARTHA.
So I was! How stupid!
#LILY.
Do you like Bigelow?
#MARTHA.
Yes, very much. And Curt thinks the world of him.
#LILY.
Oh, Curt is the last one to be bothered by anyone's morals. Curt and I are the unconventional ones of the family. The trouble with Bigelow, Martha, is that he was too careless to conceal his sins - and that won't go down in this Philistine small town. You have to hide and be a fellow hypocrite or they revenge themselves on you. Bigelow didn't. He flaunted his love - affairs in everyone's face. I used to admire him for it. No one exactly blamed him, in their secret hearts. His wife was a terrible, straitlaced creature. No man could have endured her. After her death he suddenly acquired a bad conscience. He'd never noticed the children before. I'll bet he didn't even know their names. And then, presto, he's about in our midst giving an imitation of a wet hen with a brood of ducks. It's a bore, if you ask me.
#MARTHA.
I think it's very fine of him.
#LILY.
His reform is too sudden. He's joined the hypocrites, I think.
#MARTHA.
I'm sure he's no hypocrite. When you see him with the children -
#LILY.
Oh, I know he's a good actor. Lots of women have been in love with him. You won't be furious if I'm very, very frank, will you, Martha?
#MARTHA.
No, of course not, Lily.
#LILY.
Well, I'm the bearer of a message from the Jayson family.
#MARTHA.
A message? For me?
#LILY.
Don't think that I have anything to do with it. I'm only a Victor record of their misgivings. Shall I switch it going? Well, then, father thinks, brother John and wife, sister Esther and husband all think that you are unwisely intimate with this same Bigelow.
#MARTHA.
I? Unwisely intimate - ? Well, you sure are funny people!
#LILY.
No, we're not funny. We'd be all right if we were. On the contrary, we're very dull and deadly. Bigelow really has a villainous rep. for philandering. But, of course, you didn't know that.
#MARTHA.
No, I didn't - and I don't care to know it now.
#LILY.
I told them you wouldn't relish their silly advice. Oh, I hate their narrow small - town ethics as much as you do, Martha. I sympathize with you, indeed I do. But I have to live with them and so, for comfort's sake, I've had to make compromises. And you're going to live in our midst from now on, aren't you? Well then, you'll have to make compromises, too - if you want any peace.
#MARTHA.
But - compromises about what? I refuse to take it seriously. How anyone could think - it's too absurd.
#LILY.
What set them going was Big's being around such an awful lot the weeks Curt was in New York, just after you'd settled down here. You must acknowledge he was - very much present then, Martha.
#MARTHA.
But it was on account of his children. They were always with him.
#LILY.
The town doesn't trust this sudden fond parenthood, Martha. We've known him too long, you see.
#MARTHA.
But he's Curt's oldest and best friend.
#LILY.
We've found they always are.
#MARTHA.
It's a case of evil minds, it seems to me - and it would be extremely insulting if I didn't have a sense of humor. You can tell your family, that as far as I'm concerned, the town may -
#LILY.
Go to the devil. I knew you'd say that. Well, fight the good fight. You have all my best wishes. I wish I had something worth fighting for. Now that I'm through with college, my occupation's gone. All I do is read book after book. The only live people are the ones in books, I find, and the only live life.
#MARTHA.
You're lonely, that's what, Lily.
#LILY.
Don't pity me, Martha - or I'll join the enemy.
#MARTHA.
I'm not. But I'd like to help you if I could. Have you ever thought of marrying?
#LILY.
Martha! How banal! The men I see are enough to banish that thought if I ever had it.
#MARTHA.
Marriage isn't only the man. It's children. Wouldn't you like to have children?
#LILY.
Wouldn't you?
#MARTHA.
But - Lily -
#LILY.
Oh, I know it wasn't practicable as long as you elected to wander with Curt - but why not now when you've definitely settled down here? I think that would solve things all round. If you could present Father with a grandson, I'm sure he'd fall on your neck. He feels piqued at the John and Esther families because they've had a run of girls. A male Jayson! Aunt Davidson would weep with joy. You're thirty - eight, aren't you, Martha?
#MARTHA.
Yes. LILY - Then why don't you - before it's too late? You won't want to tag along with Curt to the ends of the earth forever, will you? Wasn't that queer life like any other? I mean, didn't it get to pall on you?
#MARTHA.
Yes - perhaps - in the last two years.
#LILY.
It's time for both of you to rest on your laurels. Why can't Curt keep on with what he's doing now - stay home and write his books?
#MARTHA.
Curt isn't that kind. The actual work - the romance of it - that's his life.
#LILY.
But if he goes and you have to stay, you'll be lonesome - alone.
#MARTHA.
Horribly. I don't know what I'll do.
#LILY.
Then why - why? Think, Martha. If Curt knew - that was to happen - he'd want to stay here with you. I'm sure he would.
#MARTHA.
No. Curt has grown to dislike children. They remind him of - ours that were taken. He adored them so - he's never become reconciled.
#LILY.
If you confronted Curt with the actual fact, he'd be reconciled soon enough, and happy in the bargain.
#MARTHA.
Do you really think so?
#LILY.
And you, Martha - I can tell from the way you've talked that you'd like to.
#MARTHA.
Yes, I - I never thought I'd ever want to again. For many years after they died I never once dreamed of it - But lately - the last years - I've felt - and when we came to live here - and I saw all around me - homes - and children, I -
#LILY.
I know. You must, that's all there is to it! If you want my advice, you go right ahead and don't tell Curt until it's a fact he'll have to learn to like, willy - nilly. You'll find, in his inmost heart, he'll be tickled to death.
#MARTHA.
Yes, I - I'll confess I thought of that. In spite of my fear, I - I've - I mean - I -
#LILY.
Why, Martha, what - Martha! I know! It is so, isn't it? It is!
#MARTHA.
Yes.
#LILY.
You dear, you! How long have you known?
#MARTHA.
For over two months.
#LILY.
I'll bet that's we Jaysons now. Yes, it's Esther and husband and Aunt Davidson. The first wave of attack, Martha! Be brave! The Young Guard dies but never surrenders!
#MARTHA.
You make me feel terribly ill at ease when you put it that way, Lily. Will you have tea now or shall we wait for the others?
#ESTHER.
Let's wait. They ought to be here any moment.
#LILY.
Just think, Martha had forgotten you were coming. She was going motoring with Bigelow.
#SHEFFIELD.
Where is Curt, Martha?
#MARTHA.
Hard at work in his study. I'm afraid he's there for the day.
#SHEFFIELD.
Still plugging away at his book, I suppose. Well, I hope it will be a big success.
#LILY.
As big a success as the brief you're writing to restrain the citizens from preventing the Traction Company robbing them, eh Mark? You don't mind if I smoke, Aunt?
#ESTHER.
Lily!
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
We'll get you married, young lady, and that very soon. What you need to bring you down to earth is a husband and the responsibility of children. Every woman who is able should have children. Don't you believe that, Martha Jayson?
#MARTHA.
Yes, I do, Mrs. Davidson.
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
You must call me aunt, my dear. All the Jaysons do.
#MARTHA.
Thank you, aunt.
#LILY.
Why don't the others come, darn 'em? I'm dying for my tea.
#CURTIS.
Hello, everybody. Martha, I don't want to interrupt you - but -
#MARTHA.
You want my help?
#CURTIS.
Yes - not for long - just a few notes before I forget them.
#MARTHA.
You'll excuse me for a few moments, all of you, won't you?
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
Why doesn't Curt hire a secretary? That is no work for his wife.
#MARTHA.
A paid secretary could hardly give the sympathy and understanding Curt needs, Mrs. Davidson. And she would have to study for years, as I have done, in order to take my place.
#LILY.
Sure. I love to serve drinks. If I were a man, I'd be a bartender - in Mexico or Canada.
#MARTHA.
I'll be with you again in a minute, I hope.
#ESTHER.
Even people touched by a smattering of science seem to get rude, don't they?
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
I have heard much silly talk of this being an age of free women, and I have always said it was tommyrot. She is an example. She is more of a slave to Curt's hobbies than any of my generation were to anything but their children. Where are her children?
#LILY.
They died, Aunt, as children have a bad habit of doing. However, I wouldn't despair if I were you.
#ESTHER.
What do you mean, Lily? What are you so mysterious about? What did she say? What - ?
#LILY.
Mark, your frau seems to have me on the stand. Can I refuse to answer? Here comes the rest of our Grand Fleet. Now I'll have my tea.
#ESTHER.
Goodness, Lily is trying on the nerves.
#DICK.
Well, the gang's all here. Looks like the League of Nations. Let's get down to cases, folks. I want to know why I've been summoned here. I'm due for tournament mixed - doubles at the Casino at five. Where's the tea - and has Curt a stick in the cellar to put in it?
#LILY.
Here's tea - but no stick for you, sot.
#JOHN GALE.
It seems it would be more to the point to inquire where our hostess -
#JAYSON.
Yes. And where is Curt?
#LILY.
Working at his book. He called Martha to take notes on something.
#ESTHER.
She left us as if she were glad of the excuse.
#LILY.
Stuff, Esther! She knows how much Curt depends on her - and we don't.
#EMILY.
Martha seems to be a model wife.
#LILY.
How well you say what you don't mean, Emily! Twinkle, twinkle, little bat! But I'm forgetting to do the honors. Tea, everybody? Tea, everybody!
#JAYSON.
Stop fooling, Lily. Let's get to our muttons. Did you talk with Martha?
#LILY.
I did, sir.
#JAYSON.
What did she say?
#LILY.
She said you could all go to the devil! Oh, not in those words. Martha is a perfect lady. But she made it plain she will thank you to mind your own business.
#ESTHER.
And just imagine, she'd even forgotten she'd asked us here this afternoon and was going motoring with Bigelow.
#LILY.
With his three children, too, don't forget.
#EMILY.
They have become such well - behaved and intelligent children, they say.
#LILY.
You'd better let Martha train yours for a while, Emily. I'm sure she'd improve their manners - though, of course, she couldn't give them any intelligence.
#EMILY.
Oh!
#DICK.
So it's Bigelow you're up in the air about? The deuce you say!
#LILY.
Look at our soldier boy home from the wars getting serious about the family honor! It's too bad this is a rough, untutored country where they don't permit dueling, isn't it, Dick?
#DICK.
Go to the devil!
#SHEFFIELD.
This wrangling is getting us nowhere. You say she was resentful about our well - meant word to the wise? JAYSON - Surely she must realize that some consideration is due the position she occupies in Bridgetown as Curt's wife.
#LILY.
Martha is properly unimpressed by big frogs in tiny puddles. And there you are.
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
The idea! She takes a lot upon herself - the daughter of a Wild Western coal - miner.
#LILY.
Gold miner, Aunt.
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
It makes no difference - a common miner! SHEFFIELD - Just before the others came, Lily, you gave out some hints - very definite hints, I should say -
#ESTHER.
Yes, you did, Lily. What did you mean?
#LILY.
Perhaps I shouldn't have. It's not my secret. Shall I tell you? Yes, I can't help telling. Well, Martha is going to have a son.
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
A son! Curt's son!
#JAYSON.
A son?
#DICK.
Lily's kidding you. How can she know it's a son - unless she's a clairvoyant.
#ESTHER.
Yes, how stupid!
#LILY.
I am clairvoyant in this case. Allah is great and it will be a son - if only to make you and Emily burst with envy among your daughters.
#ESTHER.
Lily!
#EMILY.
Oh!
#JAYSON.
Keep still for a moment, Lily, for God's sake. This is no subject to joke about, remember.
#LILY.
Martha told me. I know that.
#JAYSON.
And does Curt know this?
#LILY.
No, not yet. Martha has been afraid to tell him.
#JAYSON.
Ah, that explains matters. You know I asked Curt some time ago - and he said it was impossible.
#EMILY.
Impossible? Why, what a funny thing to say.
#SHEFFIELD.
And why is Martha afraid to tell him, Lily?
#LILY.
It's all very simple. When the two died years ago, they said they would never have one again. Martha thinks Curt is still haunted by their memory and is afraid he will resent another as an intruder. I told her that was all foolishness - that a child was the one thing to make Curt settle down for good at home here and write his books.
#JAYSON.
Yes, I believe that myself. Well, this is fine news.
#EMILY.
Still it was her duty to tell Curt, don't you think? I don't see how she could be afraid of Curt - for those reasons.
#ESTHER.
I don't, either. Why, Curt's the biggest - hearted and kindest -
#EMILY.
I wonder how long she's known - this?
#LILY.
Two months, she said.
#EMILY.
Two months?
#JOHN GALE.
What do you mean, Emily? Two months? But before that - Curt was away in New York almost a month!
#LILY.
So! You got someone to say it for you as you always do, Poison Mind! Oh, I wish the ducking stool had never been abolished!
#EMILY.
I - I didn't mean -
#JOHN GALE.
Where the honor of the family is at stake -
#LILY.
Ssshh, you empty barrel! I think I hear -
#MARTHA.
How do you do, everybody? So sorry I wasn't here when you came. I hope Lily made proper excuses for me. I hope Lily - but I see you've all had tea.
#LILY.
Yes. You can trust me as understudy for the part of hostess any time.
#MARTHA.
Well, I'm glad to know I wasn't missed.
#EMILY.
We were talking about you - at least, we were listening to Lily talk about you.
#MARTHA.
About me?
#EMILY.
Yes - about how devoted you were to Curt's work.
#MARTHA.
Oh, but you see I consider it my work, too, I've helped him with it so long now.
#JAYSON.
And how is Curt's book coming, Martha?
#MARTHA.
Finely, thank you. The book will cause quite a stir, I believe. It will make the name of Jayson famous in the big world outside of Bridgetown.
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
The name of Jayson has been -
#JAYSON.
Aunt Elizabeth!
#LILY.
Aunt means it's world famous already, Martha. John was once a substitute on the Yale Freshman soccer team, you know. If it wasn't for his weak shins he would have made the team, fancy!
#DICK.
Lily wins! Heavens, I'll have to hustle! I'm due at the Casino. I'm sorry I can't stay.
#MARTHA.
So glad you came. Do come in again any time. We keep open house, you know - Western fashion.
#DICK.
Delighted to.
#LILY.
Wait a second! I'm coming with you -
#DICK.
Sure thing - only hurry, darn you!
#LILY.
Phew! I need fresh air!
#ESTHER.
Thank goodness, she's gone. What a vixen! What would you do if you had a sister like that, Martha?
#MARTHA.
I'd love her - and try to understand her.
#SHEFFIELD.
She's a bad ally to rely on - this side of the fence one day, and that the next.
#MARTHA.
Is that why you advised her to become a lawyer, Mr. Sheffield?
#SHEFFIELD.
Now, now, that remark must be catalogued as catty.
#MARTHA.
It seems to be in the Bridgetown atmosphere. I never was - not the least bit - in the open air.
#JAYSON.
Oh, Bridgetown isn't so bad, Martha, once you get used to us.
#JOHN GALE.
It's one of the most prosperous and wealthy towns in the U.S. - and that means in the world, nowadays.
#EMILY.
That isn't what Martha means, you silly. I know what she's thinking about us, and I'm not sure that I don't agree with her - partly. She feels that we're so awfully strict - about certain things. It must be so different in the Far West - I suppose - so much freer.
#MARTHA.
Then you believe broad - mindedness and clean thinking are a question of locality? I can't agree with you. I know nothing of the present Far West, not having lived there for ten years, but Curt and I have lived in the Far East and I'm sure he'd agree with me in saying that Chinese ancestor worship is far more dignified than ours. After all, you know, theirs is religion, not snobbery. That must be Mr. Bigelow. I suppose Lily told you I had an engagement to go motoring with him. So sorry I must leave. But I'm like Lily. I need fresh air. I'll call Curt. Curt! Come out! It's important. He'll be out when he's through swearing.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, of all the damned cheek!
#ESTHER.
She shows her breeding, I must say.
#EMILY.
Oh, how rude - and insulting.
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
I will never set foot in this house again! JAYSON - Now, Aunt Elizabeth, do keep your head! We must have no scandal of any sort. Remember there are servants about. Do sit down.
#SHEFFIELD.
One must make allowances for one in her condition, Aunt.
#JAYSON.
Exactly. Remember her condition. Aunt and do sit down.
#EMILY.
Yes, the family mustn't forget - her condition.
#CURTIS.
Where's Martha? What's the important thing she called me out for?
#ESTHER.
To play host, you big bear, you! Don't you think we came to see you, too? Sit down here and be good.
#EMILY.
Martha had to leave us to go motoring with Mr. Bigelow.
#ESTHER.
And the three children.
#CURTIS.
Hm! Big and his eternal kids. But what the deuce! I must be getting selfish to grudge Martha her bit of fresh air. You don't know what it means to outdoor animals like us to be pent up. We're used to living with the sky for a roof - Did Martha tell you I'd definitely decided to go on the five year Asian expedition?
#ESTHER.
Curt! You're not!
#EMILY.
And leave Martha here - all alone - for five years?
#JAYSON.
Yes, you can't take Martha with you this time, you know.
#CURTIS.
No? What makes you so sure of that? I'll let you in on the secret - only you must all promise not to breathe a word to Martha - until to - morrow. To - morrow is her birthday, you know, and this is a surprise I've saved for her. I've been intriguing my damnedest for the past month to get permission for Martha to go with me. It was difficult because women are supposed to be barred. But I've succeeded. The letter came this morning. How tickled to death she'll be when she hears! I know she's given up hope. I suppose it's that has been making her act so out - of - sorts lately.
#JAYSON.
Hmm! But would you persist in going - alone - if you knew it was impossible for her - ?
#CURTIS.
I can't imagine it without her. You people can't have any idea what a help - a chum - she's been. You can't believe that a woman could be - so much that - in a life of that kind - how I've grown to depend on her. The thousand details - she attends to them all. She remembers everything. Why, I'd be lost. I wouldn't know how to start. I know this sounds like a confession of weakness but it's true just the same. However, naturally my work must always be the first consideration. Yes, absolutely! But what's the use of rambling on this way? We can both go, thank heaven!
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
No. SHE cannot go. And it is YOUR duty -
#CURTIS.
Oh, come! That's all nonsense, Aunt. You don't understand the kind of woman Martha is.
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
The women I understand prefer rearing their children to selfish gallivanting over the world.
#CURTIS.
But we have no children now, Aunt.
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
I know that, more's the pity. But later -
#CURTIS.
No, I tell you! It's impossible!
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
I have said my last word. Go your own road and work your own ruin.
#CURTIS.
I think I'll change my togs and go for a walk. Excuse me for a second. I'll be right down again.
#EMILY.
Curt acts so funny, doesn't he? Did you notice how emphatic he was about its being impossible? And he said Martha seemed to him to be acting queer lately - with him, I suppose he meant.
#ESTHER.
He certainly appeared put out when he heard she'd gone motoring with Big.
#JAYSON.
This dislike of the very mention of children. It isn't like Curt, not a bit.
#JOHN GALE.
There's something rotten in Denmark somewhere. This family will yet live to regret having accepted a stranger -
#SHEFFIELD.
Come now! This is all only suspicion. There is no evidence; you have no case; and the defendant is innocent until you have proved her guilty, remember. Well, let's break up. Esther, you and I ought to be getting home.
#JAYSON.
Well, if I were sure it would all blow over without any open scandal, I'd offer up a prayer of thanks.
#BIGELOW.
Listen to that rumpus, will you! The kids are having the time of their lives. Your wife is playing hide and seek with them. Come and look.
#CURTIS.
Oh, I can see well enough from here.
#BIGELOW.
She seems to get as much fun out of it as they do. Ah, Eddy discovered her behind the tree. Isn't he tickled now! Jove, what a hand she is with children!
#CURTIS.
Oh, Martha gets along well with anyone.
#BIGELOW.
You think so? With everyone?
#CURTIS.
Yes - with everyone we've ever come in contact with - even aboriginal natives.
#BIGELOW.
With the aboriginal natives of Bridgetown? With the well - known Jayson family, for example?
#CURTIS.
Why, everything's all right between Martha and them, isn't it? What do you mean, Big? I certainly imagined - but I'll confess this damn book has had me so preoccupied -
#BIGELOW.
Too darn preoccupied, if you'll pardon my saying so. It's not fair to leave her to fight it alone.
#CURTIS.
Fight what? Martha has a sense of humor. I'm sure their petty prejudices merely amuse her.
#BIGELOW.
A mosquito is a ridiculous, amusing creature, seen under a microscope; but when a swarm has been stinging you all night -
#CURTIS.
You speak from experience, eh?
#BIGELOW.
You bet I do. Touch me anywhere and you'll find a bite. This, my native town, did me the honor of devoting its entire leisure attention for years to stinging me to death.
#CURTIS.
Well, if I am to believe one - tenth of the family letters I used to receive on the subject of my old friend, Bigelow, they sure had just cause.
#BIGELOW.
Oh, I'll play fair. I'll admit they did - then. But it's exasperating to know they never give you credit for changing - I almost said, reforming, One ought to be above the gossip of a town like this - but say what you like, it does get under your skin.
#CURTIS.
So you'd like to be known as a reformed character, eh?
#BIGELOW.
Et tu! Your tone is sceptical. But I swear to you, Curt, I'm an absolutely new man since my wife's death, since I've grown to love the children. Before that I hardly knew them. They were hers, not mine, it seemed. Now we're the best of pals, and I've commenced to appreciate life from a different angle. I've found a career at last - the children - the finest career a man could have, I believe.
#CURTIS.
Yes, I suppose so - if you're made that way.
#BIGELOW.
Meaning you're not?
#CURTIS.
Not any more. I tried that once.
#BIGELOW.
But we're wandering from the subject of Martha versus the mosquitoes.
#CURTIS.
Oh, to the deuce with that! Trust Martha to take care of herself. Besides, I'll have her out of this stagnant hole before so very long - six months, to be exact.
#BIGELOW.
Where do you think of settling her then?
#CURTIS.
No settling about it. I'm going to take her with me.
#BIGELOW.
On the Asian expedition?
#CURTIS.
Yes. I haven't told her yet but I'm going to to - day. It's her birthday - and I've been saving the news to surprise her with.
#BIGELOW.
Her birthday? I wish the children and I had known - but it's not too late yet.
#CURTIS.
Thirty - nine candles, if you're thinking of baking a cake!
#BIGELOW.
That's not old - but it's not young either, Curt.
#CURTIS.
You talk like an old woman, Big. What have years to do with it? Martha is young in spirit and always will be. Sure thing!
#MARTHA.
I've had to run away and leave them with the governess. They're too active for me. Phew! I'm all tired out. I must be getting old.
#CURTIS.
Big was just this minute remarking that, Martha.
#MARTHA.
Well, I declare! Of all the horrid things to hear -
#BIGELOW.
He - prevaricates, Mrs. Jayson.
#MARTHA.
There now, Curt! I'm sure it was you who said it. It sounds just like one of your horrid facts.
#BIGELOW.
And how can I offer my felicitations now? But I do, despite your husband's calumny. May your shadow never grow less!
#MARTHA.
Thank you.
#BIGELOW.
And now I'll collect my flock and go home.
#CURTIS.
So long, Big. Be sure you don't mislay one of your heirs!
#BIGELOW.
No fear - but they might mislay me.
#MARTHA.
There they go. What darlings they are! Whoever did say it was right, Curt, I am getting old.
#CURTIS.
Nonsense!
#MARTHA.
No. I feel it.
#CURTIS.
Nonsense! You're not the sort that ever grows old.
#MARTHA.
I'm afraid we're all that sort, dear. Even you. Circumstantial evidence. I'll have to dye it when you're asleep some time - and then nobody'll know.
#CURTIS.
You haven't any silver threads. Am I to suspect - ?
#MARTHA.
No, I don't. Honest, cross my heart, I wouldn't even conceal that from you, if I did. But gray hairs prove nothing. I am actually older than you, don't forget.
#CURTIS.
One whole year! That's frightful, isn't it?
#MARTHA.
I'm a woman, remember; so that one means at least six. Ugh! Let's not talk about it. Do you know, it really fills me with a queer panic sometimes?
#CURTIS.
Silly girl!
#MARTHA.
Will you always love me - even when I'm old and ugly and feeble and you're still young and strong and handsome?
#CURTIS.
Martha! What a foolish question, sweetheart. If we ever have to grow old, we'll do it together just as we've always done everything.
#MARTHA.
That's my dream of happiness, Curt. Oh, it has been a wonderful, strange life we've lived together, Curt, hasn't it? You're sure you've never regretted - never had the weest doubt that it might have been better with - someone else?
#CURTIS.
Martha!
#MARTHA.
And I have helped - really helped you, haven't I?
#CURTIS.
You've been the best wife a man could ever wish for, Martha. You've been - you are wonderful. I owe everything to you - your sympathy and encouragement. Don't you know I realize that?
#MARTHA.
Yes, it's been a wonderful, glorious life. I'd live it over again if I could, every single second of it - even the terrible suffering - the children.
#CURTIS.
Don't. I wouldn't want that over again. But why have you been putting all our life into the past tense? It seems to me the most interesting part is still ahead of us.
#MARTHA.
I mean - together - Curt.
#CURTIS.
So do I!
#MARTHA.
But you're going away - and I can't go with you this time.
#CURTIS.
Yes, that does complicate matters, doesn't it?
#MARTHA.
Curt! How indifferently you say that - as if you didn't care!
#CURTIS.
What do you think you'll do all the time I'm gone?
#MARTHA.
Oh, I'll be lost - dead - I won't know what to do. I'll die of loneliness - unless -
#CURTIS.
Unless what?
#MARTHA.
Oh, Curt, I love you so! Swear that you'll always love me no matter what I do - no matter what I ask -
#CURTIS.
But, sweetheart -
#MARTHA.
Then don't go!
#CURTIS.
Why, I've got to go. You know that.
#MARTHA.
Yes, I suppose you have. Of course you have!
#CURTIS.
But, Martha - you said you'd be lonely unless - unless what? Martha - Unless I - I mean we - oh, I'm so afraid of what you'll - hold me close, very close to you and I'll whisper it.
#CURTIS.
But that's impossible, Martha!
#MARTHA.
Now don't be angry with me, Curt - not till you've heard everything. It isn't impossible, Curt. It's so! It's happened! I was saving it as a secret - to tell you to - day - on my birthday.
#CURTIS.
You mean it - is a fact?
#MARTHA.
Yes. Oh, Curt, don't look that way! You seem so cold - so far away from me. Why don't you hold me close to you? Why don't you say you're glad - for my sake?
#CURTIS.
But Martha - you don't understand. How can I pretend gladness when - Why, it would spoil all our plans!
#MARTHA.
Plans? OUR plans? What do you mean?
#CURTIS.
Why, you're going with me, of course! I've obtained official permission. I've been working for it for months. The letter came yesterday morning.
#MARTHA.
Permission - to go with you -
#CURTIS.
Yes. I couldn't conceive going without you. And I knew how you must be wishing -
#MARTHA.
Oh!
#CURTIS.
Martha! You don't mean to tell me you weren't!
#MARTHA.
I was wishing you would finally decide not to go - to stay at home.
#CURTIS.
But you must realize that's impossible. Martha, are you sure you've clearly understood what I've told you? You can go with me, do you hear? Everything is arranged. And I've had to fight so hard - I was running the risk of losing my own chance by my insistence that I couldn't go without you.
#MARTHA.
I understand all that, Curt.
#CURTIS.
And yet - you hesitate! Why, this is the greatest thing of its kind ever attempted! There are unprecedented possibilities! A whole new world of knowledge may be opened up - the very origin of Man himself! And you will be the only woman -
#MARTHA.
I realize all that, Curt.
#CURTIS.
You can't - and hesitate! And then - think, Martha! - it will mean that you and I won't have to be separated. We can go on living the old, free life together.
#MARTHA.
You are forgetting - what I told you, Curt. You must face the fact. I cannot go.
#CURTIS.
How long have you known - this?
#MARTHA.
Two months, about.
#CURTIS.
But why didn't you tell me before?
#MARTHA.
I was afraid you wouldn't understand - and you haven't, Curt. But why didn't you tell me before - what you were planning?
#CURTIS.
You mean - then - you would have been glad to go - before this had happened?
#MARTHA.
I would have accepted it.
#CURTIS.
Martha, how could you ever have allowed this to happen? Oh, I suppose I'm talking foolishness. It wasn't your seeking, I know.
#MARTHA.
Yes it was, Curt. I wished it. I sought it.
#CURTIS.
Martha! You have broken the promise we made when they died. We were to keep their memories inviolate. They were to be always - our only children.
#MARTHA.
They forgive me, Curt. And you will forgive me, too - when you see him - and love him.
#CURTIS.
Him?
#MARTHA.
I know it will be a boy.
#CURTIS.
Martha! You have blown my world to bits.
#MARTHA.
You must make allowances for me. Curt, and forgive me. I AM getting old. No, it's the truth. I've reached the turning point. Will you listen to my side of it, Curt, and try to see it - with sympathy - with true understanding - forgetting your work for the moment?
#CURTIS.
That's unfair, Martha. I think of it as OUR work - and I have always believed you did, too.
#MARTHA.
I did, Curt! I do! All in the past is our work. It's my greatest pride to think so. But, Curt, I'll have to confess frankly - during the past two years I've felt myself - feeling as if I wasn't complete - with that alone.
#CURTIS.
Martha! And all the time I believed that more and more it was becoming the aim of your life, too.
#MARTHA.
I'm glad of that, dear. I tried my best to conceal it from you. It would have been so unfair to let you guess while we were still in harness. But oh, how I kept looking forward to the time when we would come back - and rest - in our own home! You know - you said that was your plan - to stay here and write your books - and I was hoping -
#CURTIS.
I loathe this book - writing. It isn't my part, I realize now. But when I made the plans you speak of, how could I know that then?
#MARTHA.
You've got to go. I won't try to stop you. I'll help all in my power - as I've always done. Only - I can't go with you any more. And you must help me - to do my work - by understanding it. Oh, Curt, I wish I could tell you what I feel, make you feel with me the longing for a child. If you had just the tiniest bit of feminine in you - ! But you're so utterly masculine, dear! That's what has made me love you, I suppose - so I've no right to complain of it. I don't. I wouldn't have you changed one bit! I love you! And I love the things you love - your work - because it's a part of you. And that's what I want you to do - to reciprocate - to love the creator in me - to desire that I, too, should complete myself with the thing nearest my heart!
#CURTIS.
But I thought -
#MARTHA.
I know; but, after all, your work is yours, not mine. I have been only a helper, a good comrade, too, I hope, but - somehow - outside of it all. Do you remember two years ago when we were camped in Yunnan, among the aboriginal tribes? It was one night there when we were lying out in our sleeping - bags up in the mountains along the Tibetan frontier. I couldn't sleep. Suddenly I felt oh, so tired - utterly alone - out of harmony with you - with the earth under me. I became horribly despondent - like an outcast who suddenly realizes the whole world is alien. And all the wandering about the world, and all the romance and excitement I'd enjoyed in it, appeared an aimless, futile business, chasing around in a circle in an effort to avoid touching reality. Forgive me, Curt. I meant myself, not you, of course. Oh, it was horrible, I tell you, to feel that way. I tried to laugh at myself, to fight it off, but it stayed and grew worse. It seemed as if I were the only creature alive - who was not alive. And all at once the picture came of a tribeswoman who stood looking at us in a little mountain village as we rode by. She was nursing her child. Her eyes were so curiously sure of herself. She was horribly ugly, poor woman, and yet - as the picture came back to me - I appeared to myself the ugly one while she was beautiful. And I thought of our children who had died - and such a longing for another child came to me that I began sobbing. You were asleep. You didn't hear. And when we came back here - to have a home at last, I was so happy because I saw my chance of fulfillment - before it was too late. Now can you understand, dear?
#CURTIS.
Understand? No, I can't understand, Martha.
#MARTHA.
Curt! I don't believe you heard a word I was saying.
#CURTIS.
No, I can't understand. I cannot, cannot! It seems like treachery to me.
#MARTHA.
Curt!
#CURTIS.
I've depended on you. This is the crucial point - the biggest thing of my life - and you desert me!
#MARTHA.
If you had listened to me - if you had even tried to feel -
#CURTIS.
I feel that you are deliberately ruining my highest hope. How can I go on without you? I've been trying to imagine myself alone. I can't! Even with my work - who can I get to take your place? Oh, Martha, why do you have to bring this new element into our lives at this late day? Haven't we been sufficient, you and I together? Isn't that a more difficult, beautiful happiness to achieve than - children? Everyone has children. Don't I love you as much as any man could love a woman? Isn't that enough for you? Doesn't it mean anything to you that I need you so terribly - for myself, for my work - for everything that is best and worthiest in me? Can you expect me to be glad when you propose to introduce a stranger who will steal away your love, your interest - who will separate us and deprive me of you! No, no, I cannot! It's asking the impossible. I am only human.
#MARTHA.
If you were human you would think of my life as well as yours.
#CURTIS.
I do! It is OUR life I am fighting for, not mine - OUR life that you want to destroy.
#MARTHA.
Our life seems to mean your life to you, Curt - and only your life. I have devoted fifteen years to that. Now I must fight for my own.
#CURTIS.
You talk as if we were enemies, Martha! No, you don't mean it! I love you so, Martha! You've made yourself part of my life, my work - I need you so! I can't share you with anyone! I won't! Martha, my own! Say that you won't, dear?
#MARTHA.
Curt! Curt! It won't separate us, dear. Can't you see he will be a link between us - even when we are away from each other - that he will bring us together all the closer?
#CURTIS.
But I can't be away from you!
#MARTHA.
Oh, Curt, why won't you look the fact in the face - and learn to accept it with joy? Why can't you for my sake? I would do that for you.
#CURTIS.
You will not do what I have implored you - for me! And I am looking the fact in the face - the fact that there must be no fact! There are doctors who -
#MARTHA.
Curt! You propose that - to me! Oh, Curt! When I feel him - his life within me - like a budding of my deepest soul - to flower and continue me - you say what you have just said! Oh, you never, never, never will understand!
#CURTIS.
Martha, I - I don't know what I'm saying! This whole situation is so unbearable! Why, why does it have to happen now?
#MARTHA.
It must be now - or not at all - at my age, dear. You have changed, Curt. I remember it used to be your happiness to sacrifice yourself for me.
#CURTIS.
I had no work then - no purpose beyond myself. To sacrifice oneself is easy. But when your only meaning becomes as a searcher for knowledge - you cannot sacrifice that, Martha. You must sacrifice everything for that - or lose all sincerity.
#MARTHA.
I wonder where your work leaves off and you begin. Hasn't your work become you?
#CURTIS.
Yes and no. You can't understand, Martha! ...
#MARTHA.
Nor you.
#CURTIS.
And you and your work? Aren't they one and the same?
#MARTHA.
So you think mine is selfish, too? I can't blame you, Curt. It's all my fault. I've spoiled you by giving up my life so completely to yours. You've forgotten I have one. Oh, I don't mean that I was a martyr. I know that in you alone lay my happiness and fulfillment in those years - after the children died. But we are no longer what we were then. We must, both of us, relearn to love and respect - what we have become.
#CURTIS.
Nonsense! You talk as if love were an intellectual process - I love you - always and forever! You are me and I am you. What use is all this vivisecting?
#MARTHA.
Yes, you love me. But who am I? There is no recognition in your eyes. You don't know.
#CURTIS.
Martha! Stop! This is terrible!
#JAYSON.
Well?
#RICHARD.
No change, sir. God, Dad, I can't stand her moaning and screaming! It's got my nerves shot to pieces. I thought I was hardened. I've heard them out in No Man's Land - dying by inches - when you couldn't get to them or help - but this is worse - a million times! After all, that was war - and they were men -
#JAYSON.
Martha is having an exceptionally hard ordeal.
#RICHARD.
Since three o'clock this morning - yesterday morning, I should say. It's a wonder she isn't dead.
#JAYSON.
Where is Curt?
#RICHARD.
Still out in the garden, walking around bareheaded in the cold like a lunatic.
#JAYSON.
Why didn't you make him come in?
#RICHARD.
Make him! It's easy to say. He's in a queer state, Dad, I can tell you! There's something torturing him besides her pain -
#JAYSON.
Yes, there's a lot in all this we don't know about.
#RICHARD.
I suppose the reason he's so down on the family is because we've rather cut her since that tea affair.
#JAYSON.
He shouldn't blame us. She acted abominably and has certainly caused enough talk since then - always about with Bigelow -
#RICHARD.
And yet he keeps asking everyone to send for Bigelow - says he wants to talk to him - not us. WE can't understand!
#JAYSON.
I'm afraid Curt knows we understand too much. But why does he want Bigelow, in God's name? In his present state - with the suspicions he must have - there's liable to be a frightful scene.
#RICHARD.
Don't be afraid of a scene. The hell of it is he seems to regard Bigelow as his best friend. Damned if I can make it out.
#JAYSON.
I gave orders that they were always to tell Curt Bigelow was out of town and couldn't be reached. What a frightful situation for all of us! It may sound cruel of me - but - I can't help wishing for all our sakes that this child will never -
#RICHARD.
Yes, Dad, I know what you're thinking. It would be the best thing for it, too - although I hate myself for saying it.
#JAYSON.
Well?
#LILY.
Isn't everything gloomy enough? I couldn't bear it upstairs one second longer. Esther and Emily are coming down, too. It's too much for them - and they've had personal experience. I hereby become a life - member of the birth - control league. Let's let humanity cease - if God can't manage its continuance any better than that!
#RICHARD.
Second the motion.
#JAYSON.
You're young idiots. Keep your blasphemous nonsense to yourself, Lily!
#LILY.
I can't stand it. Take me home, Dick, won't you? We're doing no good waiting here. I'll have a fit - or something - if I stay.
#RICHARD.
That's how I feel. I'll drive you home. Come along.
#LILY.
I'll never marry or have a child! Never, never! I'll go into Mark's office to - morrow and make myself independent of marriage.
#ESTHER.
Sssh! Lily! Don't you know you're shouting? And what silly talk!
#LILY.
I'll show you whether it's silly! I'll -
#RICHARD.
Are you coming or not?
#LILY.
Yes - wait - here I am.
#ESTHER.
I thought I went through something when mine were born - but this is too awful.
#EMILY.
And, according to John, Curt actually says he hates it! Isn't that terrible? It's almost as if her suffering was a punishment, don't you think?
#ESTHER.
If it is, she's being punished enough, Heaven knows. It can't go on this way much longer or something dreadful will happen.
#EMILY.
Do you think the baby -
#ESTHER.
I don't know. I shouldn't say it but perhaps it would be better if -
#EMILY.
That's what I think.
#ESTHER.
Oh, I wish I didn't have such evil suspicions - but the way Curt goes on - how can you help feeling there's something wrong?
#JAYSON.
How is Curt?
#EMILY.
John just came in from the garden. John! Well I never! If he isn't falling asleep! John! A nice time to pick out for a nap, I must say.
#JOHN GALE.
Don't forget I have to be at the bank in the morning.
#JAYSON.
I have to be at the bank, too - and you don't notice me sleeping. Tell me about Curt. You just left him, didn't you?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, and I've been walking around that damned garden half the night watching over him. Isn't that enough to wear anyone out? I can feel I've got a terrible cold coming on -
#ESTHER.
For goodness sake, don't you start to pity yourself!
#JOHN GALE.
I'm not. I think I've showed my willingness to do everything I could. If Curt was only the least bit grateful! He isn't. He hates us all and wishes we were out of his home. I would have left long ago if I didn't want to do my part in saving the family name from disgrace.
#JAYSON.
Has he quieted down, that's what I want to know?
#JOHN GALE.
Not the least bit. He's out of his head - and I'd be out of mine if a child was being born to my wife that -
#JAYSON.
Keep that to yourself! Remember you have no proof. Think all you want - but don't talk.
#EMILY.
The whole town knows it, anyway; I'm sure they must.
#JAYSON.
There's only been gossip - no real scandal. Let's do our united best to keep it at that. Where's Aunt Elizabeth? We'll have to keep an eye on her, too, or she's quite liable to blurt out the whole business before all comers.
#ESTHER.
You needn't be afraid. She's forgotten all about the scandalous part. No word of it has come to her out in the country and she hasn't set foot in town since that unfortunate tea, remember. And at present she's so busy wishing the child will be a boy, that she hasn't a thought for another thing.
#JAYSON.
Well, Mark? Where's Curt?
#SHEFFIELD.
Inside. I think he'll be with us in a minute. Just now he's 'phoning to Bigelow.
#JAYSON.
For God's sake, couldn't you stop him?
#SHEFFIELD.
Not without a scene. Your Aunt persuaded him to come into the house - and he rushed for the 'phone. I think he guessed we had been lying to him -
#JAYSON.
Then he - Bigelow will be here soon?
#SHEFFIELD.
It depends on his sense of decency. As he seems lacking in that quality, I've no doubt he'll come.
#JOHN GALE.
Then I, for one, will go. Come, Emily. Since Curt seems bound to disgrace everyone concerned, I want it thoroughly understood that we wash our hands of the whole disgraceful affair.
#EMILY.
Go if you want to! I won't! I think it is our duty to stay.
#JAYSON.
Sit down. Wash your hands indeed! Aren't you as much concerned as any of us?
#SHEFFIELD.
Sshh! I think I hear Curt now.
#CURTIS.
Liars! Well, he's coming now. Why didn't you want him to come, eh? He's my oldest friend. I've got to talk to someone - and I can't to you. What do you want here, anyway? Why don't you go? God, why must she go through such agony? Why? Why?
#SHEFFIELD.
Sstt! Let's go out and leave him alone. Perhaps he'll sleep.
#JAYSON.
Curt. Remember I'm your father. Can't you confide in me? I'll do anything to help.
#CURTIS.
No, Dad. Leave me alone.
#JAYSON.
As you wish.
#CURTIS.
And send Big in to me as soon as he comes.
#JAYSON.
Very well - if you insist.
#CURTIS.
Oh, Martha, Martha! Martha, darling! Come in. Close that door, Big, for God's sake!
#BIGELOW.
I got over as soon as I could. By Jove, old man, you look as though you'd been through hell!
#CURTIS.
I have. I am.
#BIGELOW.
Buck up! How's Martha?
#CURTIS.
She's in hell, too -
#BIGELOW.
You're surely not worrying, are you? Martha is so strong and healthy there's no doubt of her pulling through in fine shape.
#CURTIS.
She should never have attempted this. I've a grudge against you, Big. It was you bringing your children over here that first planted this in her mind.
#BIGELOW.
I've guessed you thought that. That's why you haven't noticed me - or them - over here so much lately. I'll confess that I felt you - And the infernal gossip - I'll admit I thought that you - oh, damn this rotten town, anyway!
#CURTIS.
Oh, for God's sake! I didn't want you here to discuss Bridgetown gossip.
#BIGELOW.
I know, old man, forgive me.
#CURTIS.
She has been moaning like that hour after hour. I shall have those sounds in my ears until the day I die. Nothing can ever make me forget - nothing.
#BIGELOW.
Deuce take it, Curt, what's the matter with you? I never thought you'd turn morbid.
#CURTIS.
I've changed, Big - I hardly know myself any more.
#BIGELOW.
Once you're back on the job again, you'll be all right. You're still determined to go on this expedition, aren't you?
#CURTIS.
Yes. I was supposed to join them this week in New York but I've arranged to catch up with them in China - as soon as it's possible for us to go.
#BIGELOW.
Us? You mean you still plan to take -
#CURTIS.
Yes, certainly! Why not? Martha ought to be able to travel in a month or so.
#BIGELOW.
Yes, but - do you think it would be safe to take the child?
#CURTIS.
Yes - I was forgetting the child, wasn't But perhaps - Oh, damn all children, Big!
#BIGELOW.
Curt!
#CURTIS.
I can't help it - I've fought against it. But it's there - deep down in me - and I can't drive it out. I can't!
#BIGELOW.
What, Curt?
#CURTIS.
Hatred! Yes, hatred! What's the use of denying it? I must tell someone and you're the only one who might understand. For you - hated your wife, didn't you?
#BIGELOW.
Good God, you don't mean you hate - Martha?
#CURTIS.
Hate Martha? How dare you, you fool! I love Martha - love her with every miserable drop of blood in me - with all my life - all my soul! She is my whole world - everything! Hate Martha! God, man, have you gone crazy to say such a mad thing? No. I hate it. It!
#BIGELOW.
Curt! Don't you know you can't talk like that - now - when - CURTIS - It has made us both suffer torments - not only now - every day, every hour, for months and months. Why shouldn't I hate it, eh?
#BIGELOW.
Curt! Can't you realize how horrible -
#CURTIS.
Yes, it's horrible. I've told myself that a million times. But it's true!
#BIGELOW.
Shut up! You're not yourself. Come, think for a moment. What would Martha feel if she heard you going on this way? Why - it would kill her!
#CURTIS.
Oh, I know, I know! She read it in my eyes. Yes, it's horrible, but when I saw her there suffering so frightfully - I couldn't keep it out of my eyes. I tried to force it back - for her sake - but I couldn't. I was holding her hands and her eyes searched mine with such a longing question in them - and she read only my hatred there, not my love for her. And she screamed and seemed to try to push me away. I wanted to kneel down and pray for forgiveness - to tell her it was only my love for her - that I couldn't help it. And then the doctors told me to leave - and now the door is locked against me -
#BIGELOW.
This is only your damned imagination. They put you out because you were in their way, that's all. And as for Martha, she was probably suffering so much -
#CURTIS.
No. She read it in my eyes. I saw that look in hers - of horror - horror of me!
#BIGELOW.
You're raving, damn it!
#CURTIS.
It came home to her then - the undeniable truth. Isn't it fiendish that I should be the one to add to her torture - in spite of myself - in spite of all my will to conceal it! She will never forgive me, never! And how can I forgive myself?
#BIGELOW.
For God's sake, don't think about it! It's absurd - ridiculous!
#CURTIS.
She's guessed it ever since that day when we quarreled - her birthday. Oh, you can have no idea of the misery there has been in our lives since then. You haven't seen or guessed the reason. No one has. It has been - the thought of IT.
#BIGELOW.
Curt!
#CURTIS.
For years we had welded our lives together so that we two were sufficient, each to each. There was no room for a third. And it was a fine, free life we had made - a life of new worlds, of discovery, of knowledge invaluable to mankind. Isn't such a life worth all the sacrifice it must entail?
#BIGELOW.
But that life was your life, Curt -
#CURTIS.
No, it was her life, too - her work as well as mine. She had made the life, our life - the work, our work. Had she the right to repudiate what she had built because she suddenly has a fancy for a home, children, a miserable ease! I had thought I was her home, her children. I had tried to make my life worthy of being that to her. And I had failed. I was not enough.
#BIGELOW.
Curt!
#CURTIS.
Oh, I tried to become reconciled. I tried my damnedest. I tried to love this child as I had loved those that died. But I couldn't. And so, this being estranged us. We loved as intensely as ever but IT pushed us apart. I grew to dread the idea of this intruder. She saw this in me. I denied it - but she knew. There was something in each of us the other grew to hate. And still we loved as never before, perhaps, for we grew to pity each other's helplessness.
#BIGELOW.
Curt! Are you sure you ought to tell anyone this?
#CURTIS.
One day, when I was trying to imagine myself without her, and finding nothing but hopelessness - yet knowing I must go - a thought suddenly struck me - a horrible but fascinating possibility that had never occurred to me before. Can you guess what it was?
#BIGELOW.
No. And I think you've done enough morbid raving, if you ask me.
#CURTIS.
The thought that came to me was that if a certain thing happened, Martha could still go with me. And I knew, if it did happen, that she would want to go, that she would fling herself into the spirit of our work to forget, that she would be mine more than ever.
#BIGELOW.
Curt!
#CURTIS.
Yes. My thought was that the child might be born dead.
#BIGELOW.
Damn it, man, do you know what you're saying? No, Curt, old boy, do stop talking. If you don't I'll send for a doctor, damned if I won't. That talk belongs in an asylum. God, man, can't you realize this is your child - yours as well as hers?
#CURTIS.
I've tried. I cannot. There is some inexorable force in me -
#BIGELOW.
Do you realize how contemptible this confession makes you out? Why, if you had one trace of human kindness in you - one bit of unselfish love for your wife - one particle of pity for her suffering -
#CURTIS.
I have - all the love and pity in the world for her! That's why I can't help hating - the cause of her suffering.
#BIGELOW.
Have you never thought that you might repay Martha for giving up all her life to you by devoting the rest of yours to her?
#CURTIS.
She can be happy without me. She will have this child - to take my place. You think I would not give up my work for her? But I would! I will stay here - do anything she wishes - if only we can make a new beginning again - together - ALONE!
#BIGELOW.
Curt, for God's sake, don't return to that! Why, good God, man - even now - while you're speaking - don't you realize what may be happening? And you can talk as if you were wishing -
#CURTIS.
I can't help but wish it!
#BIGELOW.
For the love of God, if you have such thoughts, keep them to yourself. I won't listen! You make me despise life!
#CURTIS.
And would you have me love life? My God! My God! Will - this - never - end!
#JAYSON.
Sh - h - h, they say this is the crisis. Bear up, my boy, it will soon be over now.
#ESTHER.
She has stopped -
#JAYSON.
Thank God, it's over at last.
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
A son, Curt - a son. Let us all give thanks to God!
#CURTIS.
No! No! You lie!
#NURSE.
Mr. Jayson, your wife is asking for you.
#BIGELOW.
There! What did I tell you? Run, you chump!
#CURTIS.
Martha! Darling, I'm coming -
#BIGELOW.
Pardon me, please.
#EMILY.
Some people seem to have no sense of decency!
#BIGELOW.
No, I quite agree with you.
#JOHN GALE.
Scoundrel!
#JAYSON.
Do get up, Aunt Elizabeth! How ridiculous! What a scene if anyone should see you like that.
#ESTHER.
So it's a boy.
#EMILY.
Did you hear Curt - how he yelled out "No"? It's plain as the nose on your face he didn't want -
#ESTHER.
How awful!
#JOHN GALE.
Well, can you blame him?
#EMILY.
And the awful cheek of that Bigelow person - coming here -
#ESTHER.
They appeared as friendly as ever when we came in.
#JOHN GALE.
Curt is a blind simpleton - and that man is a dyed - in - the - wool scoundrel.
#JAYSON.
Shhh! Suppose we were overheard!
#EMILY.
When Curt leaves we can put her in her proper place. I'll soon let her know she hasn't fooled me, for one.
#DOROTHEA.
has gotten up and is going silently toward the door.]
#JAYSON.
Aunt Elizabeth, where are you going?
#MRS.
D. - I must see him again, the dear!
#ESTHER.
I think I - come on, Emily. Let's go up and see -
#EMILY.
Not I! I never want to lay eyes on it.
#JOHN GALE.
Nor I.
#ESTHER.
I was only thinking - everyone will think it funny if we don't.
#JAYSON.
Yes, yes. We must keep up appearances. Yes, I think we had better all go up - make some sort of inquiry about Martha, you know. It's expected of us and -
#NURSE.
It's a wonder some of you wouldn't come up - here, help me! Take him, can't you? I've got to run back!
#JAYSON.
Curt! Curt, my boy! What is it, son?
#EMILY.
Nurse! What is the matter?
#NURSE.
His wife is dead. She lived just long enough to recognize him.
#EMILY.
And - the baby?
#NURSE.
Oh, it's a fine, healthy baby - eleven pounds - that's what made it so difficult.
#ESTHER.
Oh, I'm so sorry I said - or thought - anything wrong about her. Forgive me, Martha!
#SHEFFIELD.
De mortuis nil nisi bonum.
#JAYSON.
Curt! Curt!
#EMILY.
Hadn't the doctor better -
#JAYSON.
Shhh! He begins to recognize me. Curt!
#CURTIS.
Yes. Martha! Gone! Dead! Oh! Her eyes - she knew me - she smiled - she whispered - forgive me, Curt, - forgive her - when it was I who should have said forgive me - but before I could - she -
#EMILY.
Oh!
#CURTIS.
But she loved me again - only me - I saw it in her eyes! She had forgotten - IT. Never let me see it! Never let it come near me! It has murdered her! I hate it from the bottom of my soul - I will never see it - never - never - I take my oath! Let me go! I am going back to her!
#EMILY.
Well!
#JAYSON.
Please do sit down, Aunt. And do stop crying.
#LILY.
What ridiculous things funerals are, anyway! That stupid minister - whining away through his nose! Why does the Lord show such a partiality for men with adenoids, I wonder.
#JAYSON.
Sshhh! Have you no respect for anything?
#LILY.
If I had, I'd have lost it when I saw all of you pulling such long faces in the church where you knew you were under observation. Pah! Such hypocrisy! And then, to cap it all, Emily has to force out a few crocodile tears at the grave!
#EMILY.
When I saw Curt - that's why I cried - not for her!
#JAYSON.
What a scene Curt made! I actually believe he wanted to throw himself into the grave!
#DICK.
You BELIEVE he wanted to! Why, it was all Mark and I could do to hold him, wasn't it, Mark?
#JAYSON.
Intolerable! I never expected he'd turn violent like that. He's seemed calm enough the past three days.
#LILY.
Calm! Yes, just like a corpse is calm!
#JAYSON.
And now this perfectly mad idea of going away to - day to join that infernal expedition - leaving that child on our hands - the child he has never even looked at! Why, it's too monstrously flagrant! He's deliberately flaunting this scandal in everyone's face!
#JOHN GALE.
He must be brought to time.
#SHEFFIELD.
Yes, we must talk to him - quite openly, if we're forced to. After all, I guess he realizes the situation more keenly than any of us.
#LILY.
You mean you think he believes - Well, I don't. And you had better be careful not to let him guess what you think. There's my proof. There he is walking about with Bigelow. Can you imagine Curt doing that - if he thought for a moment -
#DICK.
Oh, I guess Curt isn't all fool. He knows that's the very best way to keep people from suspecting.
#ESTHER.
But wouldn't you think that Bigelow person - It's disgusting, his sticking to Curt like this.
#SHEFFIELD.
Well, for one, I'm becoming quite resigned to Bigelow's presence. In the first place, he seems to be the only one who can bring Curt to reason. Then again, I feel that it is to Bigelow's own interest to convince Curt that he mustn't provoke an open scandal by running away without acknowledging this child.
#LILY.
Oh, I hate you, all of you! I loathe your suspicions - and I loathe myself because I'm beginning to be poisoned by them, too.
#EMILY.
Really, Lily, at this late hour - after the way Curt has acted - and her last words when she was dying -
#LILY.
I know! Shut up! Haven't you told it a million times already?
#JAYSON.
Aunt Elizabeth! Where are you going? Esther, go with her and see that she doesn't -
#ESTHER.
She's only going up to see the baby. She's simply forgotten everything else in the world!
#LILY.
She probably realizes what we are too mean to remember - that the baby, at least, is innocent. Wait, Esther. I'll come with you.
#JAYSON.
Yes, hurry, she shouldn't be left alone.
#DICK.
Well, what next? I don't see what good we are accomplishing. May I run along?
#JAYSON.
You will stay, if you please. There's to be no shirking on anyone's part. It may take all of us to induce Curt -
#SHEFFIELD.
I wouldn't worry. Bigelow is taking that job off our hands, I imagine.
#DICK.
He certainly seems to be doing his damnedest. The stage missed a great actor in him.
#JAYSON.
But, if Bigelow should fail -
#SHEFFIELD.
Then we'll succeed. By God, we'll have to.
#JAYSON.
Curt has already packed his trunks and had them taken down to the station - told me he was leaving on the five o'clock train.
#SHEFFIELD.
But didn't you hint to him there was now this matter of the child to be considered in making his plans?
#JAYSON.
I started to. He simply flared up at me with insane rage.
#DICK.
Say, I believe they're coming in.
#JAYSON.
Bigelow?
#DICK.
Yes, they're both making for the front door.
#SHEFFIELD.
I suggest we beat a retreat to Curt's study and wait there.
#JAYSON.
Yes, let's do that - come on, all of you.
#BIGELOW.
Curt, damn it, wake up! Are you made of stone? Has everything I've said gone in one ear and out the other? I know it's hell for me to torment you at this particular time but it's your own incredibly unreasonable actions that force me to. I know how terribly you must feel but - damn it, man, postpone this going away! Face this situation like a man! Be reconciled to your child, stay with him at least until you can make suitable arrangements -
#CURTIS.
I will never see it! Never!
#BIGELOW.
How can you keep repeating that - with Martha hardly cold in her grave! I ask you again, what would she think, how would she feel - If you would only consent to see this baby, I know you'd realize how damnably mad and cruel you are. Won't you - just for a second?
#CURTIS.
No. If I saw it I'd be tempted to - No more of that talk, Big. I've heard enough. I've reached the limit.
#BIGELOW.
That's your final answer, eh? Well, I'm through. I've done all I could. If you want to play the brute - to forget all that was most dear in the world to Martha - to go your own damn selfish way - well, there's nothing more to be said. You will be punished for it, believe me! And I - I want you to understand that all friendship ceases between us from this day. You are not the Curt I thought I knew - and I have nothing but a feeling of repulsion - good - by.
#CURTIS.
Good - by, Big.
#BIGELOW.
Curt! Forgive me! I ought to know better. This isn't you. You'll come to yourself when you've had time to think it over. The memory of Martha - she'll tell you what you must do. Good - by, old scout!
#CURTIS.
Good - by. Martha! Martha!
#SHEFFIELD.
Curt -
#CURTIS.
What time is it, do you know!
#SHEFFIELD.
Two minutes to four.
#CURTIS.
Still an hour more of this!
#JAYSON.
Curt -
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
He's such a dear! I could stay watching him forever.
#JAYSON.
Sshhh! Aunt! Surely you're not still thinking of going on the five o'clock train, are you, Curt?
#CURTIS.
Yes.
#SHEFFIELD.
Then Mr. Bigelow didn't persuade you -
#CURTIS.
I'm not to be persuaded by Big or anyone else. And I'll thank you not to talk any more about it.
#JAYSON.
You mustn't be unreasonable, Curt. After all we are your family - your best friends in the world - and we are only trying to help you -
#CURTIS.
I don't want your help. You will help me most by keeping silent.
#EMILY.
Yes, no doubt.
#ESTHER.
Sshhh, Emily!
#JAYSON.
But, you see, Curt -
#SHEFFIELD.
If you'll all allow me to be the spokesman, I think perhaps that I - Well, then, will you listen to me, Curt?
#CURTIS.
Yes, I'm listening. What else can I do when you've got me cornered? Say what you like and let's get this over.
#SHEFFIELD.
First of all, Curt, I hope it is needless for me to express how very deeply we all feel for you in your sorrow. But we sincerely trust that you are aware of our heartfelt sympathy.
#ESTHER.
Poor Martha!
#EMILY.
Esther! For goodness sake!
#SHEFFIELD.
I may truthfully say we all feel - as Esther does - even if we do not give vent - I know how terrible a day this must be for you, Curt. We all do. And we feel guilty in breaking in upon the sanctity of your sorrow in any way. But, if you will pardon my saying so, your own course of action - the suddenness of your plans - have made it imperative that we come to an understanding about certain things - about one thing in particular, I might say.
#JAYSON.
Yes, it is for the best, Curt.
#ESTHER.
Yes, Curt dear, you mustn't be unreasonable.
#DICK.
Yes, old man, you've got to face things like a regular. Facts are facts.
#LILY.
Phew! it's close in here. I'm going out in the garden. You can call me when these - orations - are finished.
#JAYSON.
Lily!
#CURTIS.
What time is it?
#SHEFFIELD.
You have plenty of time to listen to what I - I should rather say we - have to ask you, Curt. I promise to be brief. But first let me again impress upon you that I am talking in a spirit of the deepest friendliness and sympathy with you - as a fellow - member of the same family, I may say - and with the highest ideals and the honor of that family always in view. First, let me ask you, is it your intention to take that five o'clock train to - day?
#CURTIS.
I've told you that.
#SHEFFIELD.
And then you'll join this expedition to Asia?
#CURTIS.
You know that.
#SHEFFIELD.
To be gone five years?
#CURTIS.
More or less.
#SHEFFIELD.
Is it your intention to return here at any time before you leave for Asia?
#CURTIS.
No!
#SHEFFIELD.
And your determination on these plans is irrevocable?
#CURTIS.
Irrevocable! Exactly. Please remember that.
#SHEFFIELD.
That being your attitude, I will come bluntly to the core of the whole matter - the child whose coming into the world cost Martha her life.
#CURTIS.
Her murderer! You are right!
#SHEFFIELD.
You can hardly hold the child responsible for the terrible outcome. Women die every day from the same cause. Why do you attribute guilt to the child in this case, Curt?
#CURTIS.
It lives and Martha is gone - But, enough! I've said I never wanted it mentioned to me. Will you please remember that?
#SHEFFIELD.
Its name is Jayson. Curt - in the eyes of the law. Will YOU please remember that?
#CURTIS.
I don't want to remember anything! Please, for God's sake, leave me alone!
#SHEFFIELD.
I am sorry, Curt, but you cannot act as if you were alone in this affair.
#CURTIS.
Why not? Am I not alone - more alone this minute than any creature on God's earth?
#SHEFFIELD.
In your great grief. Yes, yes, of course. We all appreciate - and we hate to - Yes, it would be much wiser to postpone these practical considerations until you are in a calmer mood. And if you will only give us the chance - why not put off this precipitate departure - for a month, say - and in the meantime -
#CURTIS.
I am going when I said I was. I must get away from this horrible hole - as far away as I can. I must get back to my work for only in it will I find Martha again. But you - you can't understand that. What is the good of all this talking which leads nowhere?
#SHEFFIELD.
You're mistaken. It leads to this: Do you understand that your running away from this child - on the very day of its mother's funeral! - will have a very queer appearance in the eyes of the world?
#EMILY.
And what are you going to do with the baby, Curt? Do you think you can run off regardless and leave it here - on our hands?
#CURTIS.
I'll give it this home. And someone - anyone - Esther, Lily - can appoint a nurse to live here and - Oh, don't bother me!
#SHEFFIELD.
In the world's eyes, it will appear precious like a desertion on your part.
#CURTIS.
Oh, arrange it to suit yourselves - anything you wish -
#SHEFFIELD.
I'll take you at your word. Then let us arrange it this way. You will remain here a month longer at least -
#CURTIS.
No!
#SHEFFIELD.
You can make plans for the child's future in that time, become reconciled to it -
#CURTIS.
No!
#JAYSON.
Curt - please - for all our sakes - when the honor of the family is at stake.
#DICK.
Yes, old man, there's that about it, you know.
#CURTIS.
No!
#EMILY.
Oh, he's impossible!
#SHEFFIELD.
Perhaps Curt misunderstood me. Be reconciled to it in the eyes of the public, Curt. That's what I meant. Your own private feelings in the matter - are no one's business but your own, of course.
#CURTIS.
But - I don't see - Oh, damn your eyes of the public!
#EMILY.
It's all very well for you to ignore what people in town think - you'll be in China or heaven knows where. The scandal won't touch you - but we've got to live here and have our position to consider.
#CURTIS.
Scandal? What scandal? Oh, you mean the imbecile busy - bodies will call me an unnatural father. Well, let them! I suppose I am. But they don't know -
#EMILY.
Perhaps they know more than you think they do.
#CURTIS.
Just what do you mean by that, eh?
#ESTHER.
Emily! Shhh!
#JAYSON.
Be still, Emily. Let Mark do the talking.
#SHEFFIELD.
What Emily means is simply this, Curt: You haven't even been to look at this child since it has been born - not once, have you?
#CURTIS.
No, and I never intend -
#SHEFFIELD.
And don't you suppose the doctors and nurses - and the servants - have noticed this? It is not the usual procedure, you must acknowledge, and they wouldn't be human if they didn't think your action - or lack of action - peculiar and comment on it outside.
#CURTIS.
Well, let them! Do you think I care a fiddler's curse how people judge me?
#SHEFFIELD.
It is hardly a case of their judging - you. This is a small town, Curt, and you know as well as I do, gossip is not the least of its faults. It doesn't take long for such things to get started. Now I ask you frankly, is it wise to provoke deliberately what may easily be set at rest by a little - I'll be frank - a little pretense on your part?
#JAYSON.
Yes, my boy. As a Jayson, I know you don't wish -
#ESTHER.
Yes, you really must think of us, Curt.
#CURTIS.
But - I - you - how are you concerned? Pretense? You mean you want me to stay and pretend - in order that you won't be disturbed by any silly tales they tell about me? Good God, this is too much! Why does a man have to be maddened by fools at such a time! Leave me alone! You're like a swarm of poisonous flies.
#JAYSON.
Curt! This is - really - when we've tried to be so considerate -
#JOHN GALE.
It's an outrage to allow such insults!
#DICK.
You're not playing the game, Curt.
#EMILY.
It seems to me it's much more for Martha's sake, we're urging you than for our own. After all, the town can't say anything against us.
#CURTIS.
Martha's sake? Martha is gone. Leave her out of this.
#SHEFFIELD.
But unfortunately, Curt, others will not leave her out of this. They will pry and pry - you know what they are - and -
#EMILY.
Curt couldn't act the way he is doing if he ever really cared for her.
#CURTIS.
You dare to say that! What do know of love - women like you! You call your little rabbit - hutch emotions love - your bread - and - butter passions - and you have the effrontery to judge -
#EMILY.
Oh! John!
#JOHN GALE.
I protest! I cannot allow even my own brother -
#DICK.
Keep your head, old boy.
#SHEFFIELD.
You are making a fool of yourself, Curt - and you are damned insulting in the bargain. I think I may say that we've all about reached the end of our patience. What Emily said is for your own best interest, if you had the sense to see it. And I put it to you once and for all: Are you or are you not willing to act like a man of honor to protect your own good name, the family name, the name of this child, and your wife's memory? Let me tell you, your wife's good name is more endangered by your stubbornness than anything else.
#CURTIS.
I - I begin to think - you - all of you - are aiming at something against Martha in this. Yes - in back of your words - your actions - I begin to feel - Go away! Get out of this house - all of you! Oh, I know your meanness! I've seen how you've tried to hurt her ever since we came - because you resented in your small minds her evident superiority -
#EMILY.
Superiority, indeed!
#CURTIS.
Her breadth, of mind and greatness of soul that you couldn't understand. I've guessed all this, and if I haven't interfered it's only because I knew she was too far above you to notice your sickening malice -
#EMILY.
You're only acting - acting for our benefit because you think we don't -
#CURTIS.
Why, you - you poor little nonentity!
#EMILY.
But we know - and the whole town knows - and you needn't pretend you've been blind. You've given the whole thing away yourself - the silly way you've acted - telling everyone how you hated that baby - letting everyone see -
#JAYSON.
Emily!
#EMILY.
But you might as well leave off your idiotic pretending. It doesn't fool us - or anyone else - your sending for Bigelow that night - your hobnobbing with him ever since - your pretending he's as much your friend as ever. They're all afraid of you - but I'm not! I tell you to your face - it's all acting you're doing - just cheap acting to try and pull the wool over our eyes until you've run away like a coward - and left us to face the disgrace for you with this child on our hands!
#ESTHER.
Emily! Keep still, for Heaven's sake!
#EMILY.
Well, someone had to show him his place. He thinks he's so superior to us just because - telling us how much better she was than - But I won't stand for that. I've always had a clean name - and always will - and my children, too, thank God!
#CURTIS.
Bigelow! Big? Pretending he's as much my friend - Oh! Oh, you - you - you - filth!
#JOHN GALE.
How dare you insult my wife!
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
What is the matter? Why is John mad at Curt?
#CURTIS.
So - that's - what has been in your minds. Oh, this is bestial - disgusting! And there is nothing to be done. I feel defenseless. One would have to be as low as you are - She would have been defenseless, too. It is better she is dead. And you think - you all think -
#ESTHER.
Curt, dear, we don't think anything except what you've made us think with your crazy carrying - on.
#CURTIS.
Yes - all of you - it's on your faces. No, you don't - you don't - Don't what, Curtis? My, how sick you look, poor boy!
#CURTIS.
You - don't believe - this child -
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
He's the sweetest baby I ever saw and Jayson right to the tips of his toes.
#CURTIS.
Ah, I know you - But look at them - Wait! I'll give you the only answer -
#DICK.
It's all right. I saw him go in.
#JAYSON.
But - good God - he's liable - why didn't you follow him?
#DICK.
The doctor and nurse are there. They would have called out, wouldn't they, if -
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
I understand less and less of this. Where has Curtis gone? Why did he act so sick? What is the matter with all of you?
#ESTHER.
Nothing, Aunt dear, nothing!
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
No, you'll not hush me up! You all look guilty. Have you been saying anything against Curtis' baby? That was what Curtis seemed to think. A fine time you've picked out - with his wife not cold in her grave!
#JAYSON.
Aunt!
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
I never liked that woman. I never understood her. But now - now I love her and beg her forgiveness. She died like a true woman in the performance of her duty. She died gloriously - and I will always respect her memory. I feel that you are all hostile to her baby - poor, little, defenseless creature! Yes, you'd hate the idea of Curtis' having a son - you and your girls! Well, I'll make you bitterly regret the day you -
#EMILY.
I fear it will be necessary to tell Aunt -
#JAYSON.
Sshh! You have made enough trouble with your telling already! It should never have come to this pass. Curt will never forgive us, never!
#ESTHER.
See what not holding your tongue has done - and my children will have to suffer for it, too!
#SHEFFIELD.
If Emily had permitted me to conduct this business uninterruptedly, this would never have occurred.
#EMILY.
That's right! All pick on me! Cowards!
#DICK.
Sstt! Here he comes!
#CURTIS.
Well - my answer to you - your rotten world - I kissed him - he is mine! He looked at me - it was as if Martha looked at me - through his eyes.
#ESTHER.
Oh, Curt! You won't go now? You'll stay?
#CURTIS.
Ha! Now you think you have conquered, do you? No, I'm not going to stay! Do you think your vile slander could influence me to give up my work? And neither shall you influence the life of my son. I leave him here. I must. But not to your tender mercies. No, no! Thank God, there still remains one Jayson with unmuddled integrity to whom I can appeal. I will leave him in your care, Aunt - while I am gone.
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
It will be a great happiness. He will be - the one God never granted me. God has answered my prayer at last.
#CURTIS.
I thank you, Aunt.
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
But I cannot approve of your running away like this. It isn't natural. But you always were a queer person - and a man must do faithfully the work ordained for him.
#CURTIS.
Yes, I must go! What would I be for him - or anyone - if I stayed? Thank God, you understand. But I will come back. When he is old enough, I will teach him to know and love a big, free life. Martha used to say that he would take her part in time. My goal shall be his goal, too. Martha shall live again for me in him. And you, Aunt, swear to keep him with you - out there in the country - never to let him know this obscene little world.
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
Yes, I promise, Curtis. Let anyone dare - !
#CURTIS.
I must go. Teach him his mother was the most beautiful soul that ever lived. Good - by, Aunt.
#MRS. DAVIDSON.
Good - by, Curtis!
#JAYSON.
Curt! You're not leaving us that way?
#ESTHER.
Curt - you're going - without a word!
#LILY.
You're not going, Curt?
#CURTIS.
Yes. Good - by, Lily. You loved her, didn't you? You are not like - Take my advice and get away before you become - But I see in your face it's too late.
#LILY.
No, Curt - I swear -
#CURTIS.
Yes, I am going without a word - because I cannot find the fitting one. Be thankful I can't. It would shrivel up your souls like flame,
#JAYSON.
My boy! We are wrong - we know - but - at least say you forgive us.
#CURTIS.
Ask forgiveness of her. She - yes - she was so fine - I feel she - so you are forgiven. Good - by.
#LILY.
Then he did find out? Oh, a fine mess you've made of everything! But no - I should say "we," shouldn't I? Curt guessed that. Oh, I hate you - and myself!
#DICK.
Well, it isn't as bad as it might have been, anyway. He did acknowledge the kid - before witnesses, too.
#JAYSON.
Keep your remarks to yourself, if you please!
