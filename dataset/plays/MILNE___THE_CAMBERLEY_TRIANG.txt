#MAID.
Mr. Cyril Norwood.
#NORWOOD.
Ah, good evening, Mrs. Camberley!
#KATE.
Good evening!
#NORWOOD.
My darling!
#KATE.
Cyril!
#NORWOOD.
You let me yesterday. Why mayn't I kiss you to - day?
#KATE.
Not just yet, dear. I want to talk to you. Come and sit down.
#NORWOOD.
You aren't sorry for what you said yesterday?
#KATE.
No.
#NORWOOD.
Then what's happened?
#KATE.
I've just had a letter from Dennis.
#NORWOOD.
Dennis - your husband?
#KATE.
Yes.
#NORWOOD.
Where does he write from?
#KATE.
India.
#NORWOOD.
Oh, well!
#KATE.
He says I may expect him home almost as soon as I get the letter.
#NORWOOD.
Good Heavens!
#KATE.
Yes. .
#NORWOOD.
Perhaps he didn't catch the boat that he expected to. Wouldn't he have cabled from somewhere on the way?
#KATE.
You can't depend on cables nowadays. I don't know - What are we to do, Cyril?
#NORWOOD.
You know what I always wanted you to do. Come away with me.
#KATE.
And let Dennis come home and find - an empty house?
#NORWOOD.
You are nothing to him, and he is nothing to you. A war - wedding! - after you'd been engaged to each other for a week! And forty - eight hours afterwards he is sent out to India - and you haven't seen him since.
#KATE.
Yes. I keep telling myself that.
#NORWOOD.
The world may say that you're his wife and he's your husband, but - what do you know of him? He won't even be the boy you married. He'll be a stranger whom you'll hardly recognise. And you aren't the girl he married. You're a woman now, and you're just beginning to learn what love is. Come with me.
#KATE.
It's true, it's true. But he has been fighting for us. And to come home again after those four years of exile, and find -
#NORWOOD.
Exile - that's making much too much of it. He's come through the war safely, and he's probably had what he'd call a topping good time. Like enough he's been in love half - a - dozen times himself since - on leave in India and that sort of thing. India! Well, you should read Kipling.
#KATE.
I wonder. Of course, as you say, I don't know him. But I feel that we should be happier afterwards if we were quite straight about it and told him just what had happened. If he had been doing what you say, he would understand - and perhaps be glad of it.
#NORWOOD.
Really, darling, it's hardly a thing you can talk over calmly with a husband, even if he - We don't want any unpleasantness, and - er - Besides, I want you, Kate. It may be weeks before he comes back. We can't go on like this . Kate!
#KATE.
Do you love me so very much?
#NORWOOD.
My darling!
#KATE.
Well, let us wait till the end of the week - in case he comes. I don't want to seem to be afraid of him.
#NORWOOD.
And then?
#KATE.
Then I'll come with you.
#NORWOOD.
My darling! . There! And now what are you going to do? Ask me to stay to dinner or what?
#KATE.
Certainly not, sir. I'm going out to dinner to - night.
#NORWOOD.
Who with?
#KATE.
You.
#NORWOOD.
At our little restaurant? Good girl! Then go and put on a hat, while I ring 'em up and see if they've got a table.
#KATE.
What fun! I won't be a moment. Cyril, you will always love me?
#NORWOOD.
Of course I will, darling. Gerrard 11,001. Yes . I want a table for two. To - night . Mr. Cyril Norwood . Oh, in about half an hour . Yes, for two. Is that all right? . Thank you.
#NORWOOD.
Hallo!
#DENNIS.
Hallo!
#NORWOOD.
You - er - ?
#DENNIS.
I just came in, Mr. Norwood.
#NORWOOD.
You know my name?
#DENNIS.
Oh yes, I've heard a good deal about you, Mr. Cyril Norwood.
#NORWOOD.
I don't think I've had the pleasure of - er -
#DENNIS.
Oh, but I'm sure you must have heard a good deal about me.
#NORWOOD.
Good God, you don't mean -
#DENNIS.
I do, indeed. Dennis Camberley, the missing husband. You have heard about me, haven't you?
#NORWOOD.
I - er - Mr. Camberley, yes, of course. So you're back?
#DENNIS.
Yes, I'm back. Sometimes they don't come back, Mr. Norwood, and sometimes - they do. . Even after four years. . But you did talk about me sometimes?
#NORWOOD.
How did you know my name? little bird told me about you.
#NORWOOD.
Pooh!
#DENNIS.
One of those little Eastern birds, which sit on the backs of crocodiles, searching for - well, let us say, breakfast. He said to me one morning: "Talking of parasites," he said, "do you know Mr. Cyril Norwood?" he said, "because I could tell you an interesting story about him," he said, "if you care to - "
#NORWOOD.
Look here, sir, we'd better have it out quite plainly. I don't want any veiled insults and sneers from you. I admit that an unfortunate situation has arisen, but we must look facts in the face. You may be Mrs. Camberley's husband, but she has not seen you for four years, and - well, she and I love each other. There you have it. What are you going to do?
#DENNIS.
You don't feel that I have neglected her, Mr. Norwood? You see, I couldn't come home for week - ends very well, and -
#NORWOOD.
What are you going to do?
#DENNIS.
Well, what do you suggest?
#NORWOOD.
Really, sir, I - er -
#DENNIS.
You see, I feel so out of it all. I've been leading such a nasty, uncivilised life for the last four years, I really hardly know what is - what is being done. Now you have been mixing in Society . making munitions .
#NORWOOD.
I have been engaged on important work for the Government of a confidential nature -
#DENNIS.
You, as I was saying, have been mixing in Society, engaged on important work for the Government of a confidential nature -
#NORWOOD.
It was my great regret that I had no opportunity of enlisting -
#DENNIS.
With no opportunity, as I was about to say, of enlisting, but with many opportunities, fortunately, of making love to my wife.
#NORWOOD.
Now look here, Mr. Camberley, I've already told you -
#DENNIS.
But, my dear Mr. Norwood, I'm only doing what you said. I'm looking facts in the face. You aren't ashamed of having made love to my wife, are you?
#NORWOOD.
What are you going to do? That's all that matters between you and me. What are you going to do?
#DENNIS.
Well, that was what I was going to ask you. You're so much more in the swim than I am. What is being done in Society just now? You must have heard a good deal of gossip about it. All your friends, who were also engaged on important work of a confidential nature, with no opportunity of enlisting - don't they tell you their own experiences? What have the husbands been doing lately when they came back from the front?
#NORWOOD.
Now, once and for all, sir -
#KATE.
Oh, Cyril - which of these two hats - Dennis!
#DENNIS.
How are you, Kate?
#KATE.
You've - you've come back?
#DENNIS.
I've come back. As I was telling Mr. Norwood.
#KATE.
You - ?
#DENNIS.
Oh, we're quite old friends.
#NORWOOD.
I've told him, Kate.
#KATE.
What are you going to do?
#DENNIS.
Well, that's what Cyril keeps asking me. You don't mind my calling you Cyril? - such an old friend of my wife's -
#KATE.
Dennis!
#NORWOOD.
It's all right, dear.
#DENNIS.
Do let's sit down and talk it over in a friendly way.
#KATE.
Dennis, can you ever forgive me? We never ought to have got married - we knew each other so little - you had to go away so soon - I - I was going to write and tell you - oh, I wish -
#DENNIS.
That's all right, Kate. You've altered.
#KATE.
That's just it, Dennis. I'm not the girl who -
#DENNIS.
You've grown four years younger and four years prettier.
#KATE.
Have I?
#DENNIS.
Yes. . You do your hair a new way.
#KATE.
Do you like it?
#DENNIS.
I love it.
#NORWOOD.
Yes, well, perhaps we'd better -
#DENNIS.
I beg your pardon, Cyril. I was forgetting you for the moment. Well, now do sit down, That's right.
#KATE.
Well?
#DENNIS.
You want to marry him, eh?
#NORWOOD.
We have already told you the circumstances, Mr. Camberley. I need hardly say how regrettable it is that - er - but at the same time these - er - things will happen, and since it - er - has happened -
#KATE.
I feel I hardly know you, Dennis. Did I love you when I married you? I don't know. It was so sudden. We had no time to find out anything about each other. And now you come back - a stranger -
#DENNIS.
And he's not a stranger, eh?
#KATE.
N - no.
#DENNIS.
You feel you know all about him?
#KATE.
I - we -
#NORWOOD.
We have discovered that we love each other. My darling one, this is distressing for you. Let me -
#DENNIS.
It wouldn't be distressing for her, if you didn't keep messing her about. Why the devil can't you sit on a chair by yourself?
#NORWOOD.
Really!
#KATE.
What are you going to do, Dennis?
#DENNIS.
I don't know. . It's difficult. I don't want to do anything melodramatic. I mean it wouldn't really help matters if I did shoot him, would it?
#DENNIS.
You don't think so, do you?
#DENNIS.
No, I'm quite sure you're right. It wouldn't really help. It is difficult, isn't it? You see you love him - and he says he loves you, but at the same time I am your husband. . I'll tell you what - I'll fight you for her.
#NORWOOD.
I think we'd better leave this eighteenth - century nonsense out of it.
#DENNIS.
They fight in the twentieth century, too, Mr. Norwood. Perhaps you hadn't heard what we've been doing these last four years? Oh, quite a lot of it. . Well?
#NORWOOD.
You don't wish me to believe that you're serious?
#DENNIS.
Perfectly. Swords, pistols, fists, catch - as - catch - can - what would you like?
#NORWOOD.
I do not propose to indulge in an undignified scuffle for the - er - lady of my heart.
#DENNIS.
Nothing doing in scuffles, eh? All right, then, I'll toss you for her.
#NORWOOD.
Now you're merely being vulgar. My dear -
#DENNIS.
Really, Mr. Norwood, you're a little hard to please. If you don't like my suggestions, perhaps you will make one of your own.
#NORWOOD.
This is obviously a matter in which it is for the - er - lady to choose.
#DENNIS.
You think Mrs. Camberley should choose between us?
#NORWOOD.
Certainly.
#DENNIS.
What do you say, Kate?
#KATE.
You are very generous, Dennis.
#DENNIS.
Very well, you shall choose.
#NORWOOD.
Ah!
#DENNIS.
Wait a moment, Mr. Norwood. When did you first meet him? year ago.
#DENNIS.
And he's been making love to you for a year? He's been making love to you for a year?
#NORWOOD.
I think, sir, that the sooner the lady makes her choice, and brings this distressing scene to a close - After all, is it fair to her to - ?
#DENNIS.
Are you fair to me? You've been making love to her for a year. I made love to her for a fort - night - four years ago. And now you want her to choose between us. Is that fair?
#NORWOOD.
You hardly expect us to wait a year before she is allowed to make up her mind?
#DENNIS.
I waited four years for her out there. . However, I won't ask you to wait a year. I'll ask you to wait for five minutes.
#KATE.
What is it you want us to do, Dennis?
#DENNIS.
I want you to listen to both of us, for five minutes each; that's all. After all, we're your suitors, aren't we? You're going to choose between us. Very well, then, you must hear what we have to say. Mr. Norwood shall have five minutes alone with you in which to present his case; five minutes in which to tell you how beautiful you are. . and how rich he is . and how happy you'll be together. And I shall have my five minutes.
#NORWOOD.
Five minutes in which to tell her lies about me, eh?
#DENNIS.
Damn it, you've had a whole year in which to tell her lies about yourself; you oughtn't to grudge me five minutes. Well?
#KATE.
I agree, Dennis.
#DENNIS.
Good. Call!
#NORWOOD.
What on earth -
#DENNIS.
Choice of innings.
#NORWOOD.
I never heard of anything so - Tails.
#DENNIS.
Heads. You shall have first knock.
#NORWOOD.
What do you - I don't -
#DENNIS.
You have five minutes in which to lay your case before Mrs. Camberley. Five minutes - and then I shall come back. . Is there a fire in the dining - room, Kate?
#KATE.
A gas - fire; it isn't lit.
#DENNIS.
Then I shall light it. That will make the room nice and warm for you by the time you've finished. Five minutes.
#NORWOOD.
What's the fellow's game, eh?
#KATE.
Game?
#NORWOOD.
Yes. What's he up to?
#KATE.
Is he up to anything?
#NORWOOD.
I don't like it. Why the devil did he choose to - day to come back? If he'd waited another week, we'd have been safely away together. What's his game, I wonder?
#KATE.
I don't think he's playing a game. He's just giving me my chance.
#NORWOOD.
What chance? chance to decide between you.
#NORWOOD.
You've decided that, Kate. You've had a year to think about it in, and you've decided. We love each other; you're coming away with me; that's all settled. Only . what the deuce is he up to?
#KATE.
You're quite right about my not knowing him. . How one rushed into marriage in those early days of the war - knowing nothing about each other. And then they come back, and even the little one thought one did know is different. . I suppose he feels the same about me.
#NORWOOD.
Damn him!
#KATE.
Well, Cyril?
#NORWOOD.
Well?
#KATE.
We haven't got very long.
#NORWOOD.
He really means to come back - in five minutes?
#KATE.
You heard him say so.
#NORWOOD.
What's the matter with slipping out now? You've got a hat here. We can slip out quietly. He won't hear us. He'll come back and find us gone - well, what can he do? Probably he'll hang about for a bit and then go to his club. We'll have a bit of dinner; ring up your maid; get her to meet you with some things, and go off by the night mail. Scotland - anywhere you like. Let the whole business simmer down a bit. We don't want any melodramatic eighteenth - century nonsense.
#KATE.
Go out now, and not wait for him to have his five minutes?
#NORWOOD.
What does he want with five minutes? What's the good of it to him? Just to take a pathetic farewell of you, and pretend that you've ruined his life, when all the time he's chuckling in his sleeve at having got rid of you so easily. I know these young fellows. Some Major's wife in India is what he's got his eye on. . Or else he'll try fooling around with the hands - up business. You don't want to be mixed up with any scandal of that sort. No, the best thing we can do - I'm speaking for your sake, Kate - is to slip off quietly, while we've got the chance. We can write and explain all that we want to explain.
#KATE.
Is that playing quite fair to Dennis?
#NORWOOD.
Good Lord, this isn't a game! Camberley may think so with his tossing - up and all the rest of it, but you and I aren't children. Everything's fair in a case like this. Put your hat on - quickly - here you are -
#KATE.
I'm not sure, Cyril.
#NORWOOD.
What d'you mean?
#KATE.
He expects me to wait for him.
#NORWOOD.
If it comes to that, he expected you to wait for him four years ago.
#KATE.
Yes. . Thank you for reminding me.
#NORWOOD.
Kate, don't be stupid. What's happened to you? Of course, I know it's been beastly upsetting for you, all this - but then, why do you want to go on with it? Why do you want more upsetting scenes? You've got a chance now of getting out of it all, and - Good Lord!
#KATE.
Is the five minutes over?
#NORWOOD.
Quick, quick! Quietly.
#KATE.
Cyril!
#NORWOOD.
H'sh!
#KATE.
It's no good, Cyril, I must wait for him.
#DENNIS.
Innings declared closed. The dining - room is nicely warmed now, and I've left you an evening paper.
#NORWOOD.
Look here, Mr. Camberley, Kate and I -
#DENNIS.
Mrs. Camberley, no doubt, will tell me.
#NORWOOD.
I don't know what your game is -
#DENNIS.
You've never been in Mesopotamia, Mr. Norwood?
#NORWOOD.
Never.
#DENNIS.
It's a very trying place for the temper. . I'm waiting for you.
#NORWOOD.
Well, I - Well, I shall come back for Kate in five minutes.
#DENNIS.
Mrs. Camberley and I will be ready for you. You know your way?
#KATE.
Well?
#DENNIS.
No, don't move. I just want to look at you. . I've seen you like that for four years. Don't move. . I've been in some dreary places, but you've been with me most of the time. Just let's have a last look. last look?
#DENNIS.
Yes.
#KATE.
You're saying good - bye to me?
#DENNIS.
I don't know whether it's to you, Kate. To the girl who has been with me these last four years. Was that you?
#KATE.
I don't know, Dennis.
#DENNIS.
I wish to God I wasn't your husband.
#KATE.
What would you do if you weren't my husband?
#DENNIS.
Make love to you.
#KATE.
Can't you do that now?
#DENNIS.
Being your husband rather handicaps me, you know. I never really stood a chance against the other fellow.
#KATE.
I was to choose between you, you said. You think that I have already made up my mind?
#DENNIS.
I think so.
#KATE.
And chosen him?
#DENNIS.
Oh, no!
#KATE.
You think I have chosen you?
#DENNIS.
M'm.
#KATE.
Really, Dennis! Considering that I had practically arranged to run away with him twenty minutes ago! You must think me very fickle.
#DENNIS.
Not fickle. Imaginative.
#KATE.
What do you mean? And why are you so certain that I am going to choose you? And why in that case did you talk about taking a last look at me? And what - ?
#DENNIS.
Of course, we've only got five minutes, but I think that if you asked your questions one at a time -
#KATE.
Well, you needn't answer them all together.
#DENNIS.
All right then, one at a time. Why am I certain that you will choose me? Because for the first time in your life you have just been alone with Mr. Cyril Norwood. That's what I meant by saying you were imaginative. The Norwood you've been thinking yourself in love with doesn't exist. I'm certain that you've seen him for the first time in these last few minutes. Why, the Archangel Gabriel would have made a hash of a five minutes like that; it would have been impossible for him to have said the right thing to you. Norwood? Good Lord, he didn't stand a chance. You were judging him all the time, weren't you?
#KATE.
You're very clever, Dennis.
#DENNIS.
Four years' study of the Turkish character.
#KATE.
But how do you know I'm not judging you all the time?
#DENNIS.
Of course you are. But there's all the difference in the world between judging a stranger like me, and judging the man you thought you were in love with.
#KATE.
You are a stranger to me.
#DENNIS.
I know. That's why I said good - bye to the girl who had been with me these last four years, the girl I had married. Well, I've said good - bye to her. You're not my wife any longer, Kate; but if you don't mind pretending that I'm not your husband, and just give me a chance of making love to you - well, that's all I want.
#KATE.
You're very generous, Dennis.
#DENNIS.
No, I'm not. I'm very much in love; and for a man very much in love I'm being rather less of a silly ass than usual. Why should you love me? You fell in love with my uniform at the beginning of the war. I was ordered out, and you fell in love with the departing hero. After that? Well, I had four years - alone - in which to think about you, and you had four years - with other men - in which to forget me. Is it any wonder that - ?
#NORWOOD.
Well?
#DENNIS.
You arrive just in time, Mr. Norwood. I was talking too much. Mrs. Camberley, we are both at your disposal. Will you choose between us, which one is to have the happiness of - serving you?
#NORWOOD.
Kate!
#KATE.
Good - bye, Mr. Norwood.
#NORWOOD.
Kate! You devil!
#DENNIS.
And only a moment ago I was comparing you to the Archangel Gabriel.
#NORWOOD.
So you're going to be a loving wife to him after all?
#DENNIS.
You'll remember what I said about Mesopotamia?
#NORWOOD.
Good - bye, Mrs. Camberley. I can only hope that you will be happy.
#DENNIS.
Well, there we agree.
#KATE.
What a stupid little fool I have been. Dennis!
#DENNIS.
Oh no, you don't! We're not going to rush it this time.
#KATE.
Dennis!
#DENNIS.
I think you should call me Mr. Camberley.
#KATE.
Mr. Camberley.
#DENNIS.
That's better. Now our courtship begins. Madam, will you do me the great honour of dining with me this evening?
#KATE.
I shall be charmed.
#DENNIS.
Then let us hasten. The carriage waits.
#KATE.
Which of these two chapeaux do you prefer, Mr. Camberley?
#DENNIS.
Might I express a preference for the black one with the pink roses?
#KATE.
It is very elegant, is it not?
#DENNIS.
Vastly becoming, upon my life. . I might mention that I am staying at the club. Is your ladyship doing anything to - morrow?
#KATE.
Nothing of any great importance.
#DENNIS.
Then perhaps I may be permitted to call round to - morrow morning about eleven, and make inquiries as to your ladyship's health.
#KATE.
It would be very obliging of you, sir.
