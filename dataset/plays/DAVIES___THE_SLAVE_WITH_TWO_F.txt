#FIRST GIRL.
For whom are you waiting?
#SECOND GIRL.
I am waiting for Life.
#FIRST GIRL.
I am waiting for Life also.
#SECOND GIRL.
They said that he would pass this way. Do you believe that he will pass this way?
#FIRST GIRL.
He passes all ways.
#SECOND GIRL.
I ran to meet Life.
#FIRST GIRL.
Are you not afraid of him?
#SECOND GIRL.
Yes. That is why I ran to meet him.
#FIRST GIRL.
I, too, ran to meet him.
#SECOND GIRL.
Ah! he is coming!
#FIRST GIRL.
No. It is only the little quarreling words of the leaves, and the winds that are always urging them to go away.
#SECOND GIRL.
The leaves do not go.
#FIRST GIRL.
Some day they will go. And that the wind knows.
#FIRST GIRL.
Why are you not wearing your crown?
#SECOND GIRL.
Why should we wear crowns?
#FIRST GIRL.
Do you not know?
#SECOND GIRL.
No.
#FIRST GIRL.
That is all of wisdom - the wearing of crowns before the eyes of Life.
#SECOND GIRL.
I do not understand you.
#FIRST GIRL.
Few understand wisdom - even those who need it most -
#SECOND GIRL.
He is coming! I heard a sound.
#FIRST GIRL.
It was only the sound of a petal dreaming that it had fallen from the rose - tree.
#SECOND GIRL.
I have waited -
#FIRST GIRL.
We all long for him. We cry out to him. When he comes, he hurts us, he tortures us. He kills us, unless we know the secret.
#SECOND GIRL.
What is the secret?
#FIRST GIRL.
That he is a slave. He pretends! He pretends! But always he knows in his heart that he is a slave. Only of those who have learned his secret is he afraid.
#SECOND GIRL.
Tell me more!
#FIRST GIRL.
Over those who are afraid of him he is a tyrant. He obeys - Kings and Queens!
#SECOND GIRL.
Then that -
#FIRST GIRL.
- Is why we must never let him see us without our crowns!
#SECOND GIRL.
How do you know these things?
#FIRST GIRL.
They were told me by an old wise man, who sits outside the gate of our town.
#SECOND GIRL.
How did he know? Because he was one of those who are kings?
#FIRST GIRL.
No. Because he was one of those who are afraid.
#SECOND GIRL.
I have heard that Life is very beautiful. Is he so? I have heard also that he is supremely ugly; that his mouth is wide and grinning, that his eyes slant, and his nostrils are thick. Is he so? - or is he - very beautiful?
#FIRST GIRL.
Perhaps you will see - for yourself - Ah!
#FIRST GIRL.
He has seen our crowns!
#SECOND GIRL.
Ah!
#FIRST GIRL.
Remember! You are only safe - as long as you remain his master. Never forget that he is a slave, and that you are a queen.
#SECOND GIRL.
I must never let him see me without my crown.
#FIRST GIRL.
Hush! He is coming!
#SECOND GIRL.
He is very beautiful -
#FIRST GIRL.
While he is a slave.
#SECOND GIRL.
He is - very beautiful -
#FIRST GIRL.
Life!
#SECOND GIRL.
Ah!
#FIRST GIRL.
Life, I would have opals on a platter.
#SECOND GIRL.
Oh - h!
#FIRST GIRL.
And pearls!
#SECOND GIRL.
Ah!
#FIRST GIRL.
And a little castle set within a hedge.
#SECOND GIRL.
Yes -
#FIRST GIRL.
I would have a fair prince to think tinkling words about me. And I would have a strawberry tart, with little flutings in the crust. Go, see that these things are made ready for me.
#SECOND GIRL.
Ah!
#FIRST GIRL.
See? It is so that one must act. It is thus one must manage him. So and not otherwise it is done. Now - do you try.
#SECOND GIRL.
Life! I have a wish for a gown of gold.
#FIRST GIRL.
Yes!
#SECOND GIRL.
And a little garden where I may walk and think of trumpets blowing.
#SECOND GIRL.
It is a good rule.
#FIRST GIRL.
I have a wish for a gray steed. Bring me a little page, too. With golden hair. And with a dimple.
#FIRST GIRL.
Life! With two dimples!
#SECOND GIRL.
And an amber necklace! Bring me an amber necklace!
#FIRST GIRL.
And a fresh rose.
#FIRST GIRL.
Life!
#SECOND GIRL.
What are you going to do?
#FIRST GIRL.
Come here!
#SECOND GIRL.
How can you dare?
#FIRST GIRL.
What you see you must take.
#SECOND GIRL.
Ah!
#FIRST GIRL.
Go!
#SECOND GIRL.
But why -
#FIRST GIRL.
He does not like beggars, Life. You see, he is a slave himself.
#SECOND GIRL.
He is so beautiful.
#FIRST GIRL.
Do not forget that he is your slave.... This rosebush is a queen who forgot.
#SECOND GIRL.
Ah!
#FIRST GIRL.
Those are the bones of others who forgot.
#SECOND GIRL.
But he is beautiful!
#FIRST GIRL.
Only so long as you are his master.
#SECOND GIRL.
But he is kind!
#FIRST GIRL.
Only so long as you are not afraid of him.
#SECOND GIRL.
But you snatched -
#FIRST GIRL.
Life is the only person to whom one should be rude.
#SECOND GIRL.
What is that?
#FIRST GIRL.
Come! We must not be seen!
#SECOND GIRL.
What will be done to us?
#FIRST GIRL.
Hush! If he should see you! He is always watching for the first sign of fear.
#SECOND GIRL.
What is the first sign of fear?
#FIRST GIRL.
It is a thought -
#SECOND GIRL.
But can he see one's thoughts -
#FIRST GIRL.
Only thoughts of fear.
#SECOND GIRL.
If one hides them well even from oneself?
#FIRST GIRL.
Even then. But words are more dangerous still. If we say we are afraid we will be more afraid, because whatever we make into words makes itself into our bodies.
#VOICES OFF STAGE.
Oh, master! Mercy, master!
#FIRST GIRL.
It spoils him, this cringing. It spoils a good servant. As long as he is kept in his place -
#FIRST GIRL.
But he is only a slave. Do you not see that he is a slave?
#FATHER.
How can you say that? Look at his terrible face. Who that has seen his face can doubt that he is a master, and a cruel one?
#FIRST GIRL.
He cannot be a master unless you make him so.
#FATHER.
What is this that you are saying? Is it true?
#FIRST GIRL.
Yes, it is true. Even though it can be put into words it is true.
#FATHER.
Yes. I see that it is true. But go away.
#FIRST GIRL.
Ah!
#LIFE.
You! Give me your ideals. Three ideals! Is that all you have?
#YOUNG MAN.
Life has robbed me of my ideals.
#WORKMAN.
He robbed me too.
#YOUNG MAN.
But I had so few.
#WORKMAN.
When you have toiled to possess more, he will take those from you also.
#LIFE.
For twelve hours you shall toil at what you hate. For an hour you shall work at what you love, to keep the wound fresh, to make the torture keener.
#OLD MAN.
Ah, pity! Do not be so cruel! Let me forget the work I love!
#LIFE.
Dog! Take what I give you! It is not by begging that you may win anything from me!
#A VOICE.
Give me a dream! A dream to strengthen my hands! little love to make the day less terrible!
#THIRD VOICE.
Only rest, a little rest! Time to think of the sea, and of grasses blowing in the wind.
#A WOMAN.
Master!
#SECOND GIRL.
Oh! I wish never to see his face as they saw it!
#FIRST GIRL.
You will not, unless you kneel - never kneel, little queen.
#SECOND GIRL.
I shall never kneel to Life. I shall stand upright, as you have taught me, and I shall say, "Bring me another necklace, Life - "
#FIRST GIRL.
I must go now for a little while. I shall come back. Do not forget.
#SECOND GIRL.
I shall say -
#SECOND GIRL.
Slave! I would have the chain with the red stone! And this!
#LIFE.
Are you afraid of me?
#SECOND GIRL.
No.
#LIFE.
There are many who are afraid of me.
#SECOND GIRL.
You are a slave.
#LIFE.
There are many who are afraid.
#SECOND GIRL.
You are only a slave. slave may become a master.
#SECOND GIRL.
No.
#LIFE.
I may become -
#SECOND GIRL.
You are my slave.
#LIFE.
If I were your master -
#SECOND GIRL.
You are a slave.
#LIFE.
If I were your master, I would be kind to you. You are beautiful.
#SECOND GIRL.
Ah!
#LIFE.
You are very beautiful.
#SECOND GIRL.
It is my crown that makes me beautiful.
#LIFE.
If you should take your crown from your head, you would still be beautiful.
#SECOND GIRL.
That I will not do.
#LIFE.
You are beautiful as the slight burning of the apple - petal's cheek when the sun glances at the great flowers near it. You are beautiful as the little pool far in the forest which holds lily - buds in its hands. You are beautiful -
#SECOND GIRL.
I think he wants me to be afraid, so I will say it. I have heard that men are like that. I am not afraid, but I will say it to please him.
#LIFE.
Are you afraid of me?
#SECOND GIRL.
Yes.
#LIFE.
Are you afraid?
#SECOND GIRL.
Yes, I am afraid.
#LIFE.
Ah, that pleases me.
#SECOND GIRL.
I knew that I would be able to please him! Whatever I make into words makes itself into my body, she said, like fear - but she does not know everything! It is impossible that she should know everything! And it is so pleasant to please him - And so easy! I am not afraid of him. I have only said that I am afraid.
#LIFE.
Will you not take your crown from your head?
#SECOND GIRL.
No.
#LIFE.
There is nothing so beautiful as a woman's hair flying in the wind. I can see your hair beneath your crown. Your hair would be beautiful flying in the wind.
#SECOND GIRL.
It is only for a moment.
#LIFE.
Yes, you are beautiful.
#SECOND GIRL.
It may be that I was not wise -
#LIFE.
You are like a new flower opening, and dazzling a passing bird with sudden color.
#SECOND GIRL.
She said that I must not -
#LIFE.
You are like the bird that passes. Your hair lifts like winks in the sun.
#SECOND GIRL.
He has not harmed me.
#LIFE.
Your crown is like jewels gathered from old galleons beneath the sea. May I see your crown?
#SECOND GIRL.
No -
#LIFE.
Let me hold it in my fingers. I shall give it back to you.
#SECOND GIRL.
No.
#LIFE.
I shall give it back.
#SECOND GIRL.
If you will surely give it back to me -
#LIFE.
But your hair is lovelier without a crown.
#SECOND GIRL.
What have you done?
#LIFE.
It was only in jest.
#SECOND GIRL.
But you promised -
#LIFE.
In jest.
#SECOND GIRL.
But -
#LIFE.
Ho - ho! Laugh with me. What a jest!
#LIFE.
Dance for me. You are young. You are happy. Dance!
#SECOND GIRL.
What shall my dance say?
#LIFE.
That it is Spring, and that there are brooks flowing, newly awakened and mad to be with the sea. That there is a white bud widening under the moon, and in a curtained room a young girl sleeping. That the sun has wakened her -
#SECOND GIRL.
And now give me back my crown.
#LIFE.
You do not need a crown, pretty one.
#SECOND GIRL.
I am afraid of you!
#LIFE.
Afraid of me! What have I done?
#SECOND GIRL.
I do not know.
#LIFE.
Do not be afraid.
#SECOND GIRL.
I am afraid.
#LIFE.
I shall be a kind master to you.
#SECOND GIRL.
Master? kind master.
#SECOND GIRL.
You are my slave.
#LIFE.
I shall never be your slave again.
#SECOND GIRL.
And if she were right? If it is true?
#LIFE.
What are you saying?
#SECOND GIRL.
Nothing -
#LIFE.
You must call me master.
#SECOND GIRL.
No. That I will not do.
#LIFE.
Call me master. Then I shall be kind to you.
#SECOND GIRL.
No. I can not.
#LIFE.
Then I shall be kind.
#SECOND GIRL.
Master -
#LIFE.
It has a good sound.
#SECOND GIRL.
You will give me -
#LIFE.
Greedy one! Be grateful that I do not punish you.
#SECOND GIRL.
You would not strike me?
#LIFE.
If you do not obey -
#SECOND GIRL.
You would not strike -
#LIFE.
You must kneel.
#SECOND GIRL.
Never kneel, little queen -
#LIFE.
You must kneel to me.
#SECOND GIRL.
No.
#LIFE.
On your knees! Slave!
#SECOND GIRL.
You were kind! Life, you were kind! You said beautiful words to me.
#LIFE.
Kneel.
#SECOND GIRL.
You would be always kind, you said -
#LIFE.
Will you obey?
#SECOND GIRL.
I shall never -
#SECOND GIRL.
Do not flog me. I will kneel.
#LIFE.
So? In that way I can win obedience.
#SECOND GIRL.
Master!
#LIFE.
It has a good sound.
#SECOND GIRL.
Pity! Have pity!
#LIFE.
Do not whine.
#SECOND GIRL.
Spare me!
#LIFE.
I shall beat you, for the cries of those who fear me are sweet in my ears.
#SECOND GIRL.
Master!
#LIFE.
But sweeter yet are stilled cries -
#SECOND GIRL.
He is too strong - I can struggle no longer!
#FIRST GIRL.
Heigho, in April, All the town in April Heigho, in April, Love came a - riding Heigho, in April, She was young ... he was cruel.... She also was a queen. She snatched his trinkets.
