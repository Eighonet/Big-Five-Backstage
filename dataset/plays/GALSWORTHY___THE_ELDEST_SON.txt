#SIR WILLIAM.
Well, Freda! Nice roses. Who are they for?
#FREDA.
My lady told me to give the yellow to Mrs. Keith, Sir William, and the white to Miss Lanfarne, for their first evening.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Capital. Your father coming up to - night?
#FREDA.
Yes.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Be good enough to tell him I specially want to see him here after dinner, will you?
#FREDA.
Yes, Sir William.
#SIR WILLIAM.
By the way, just ask him to bring the game - book in, if he's got it.
#CHRISTINE.
Hullo, Freda! How are YOU?
#FREDA.
Quite well, thank you, Miss Christine - Mrs. Keith, I mean. My lady told me to give you these.
#CHRISTINE.
Oh! Thanks! How sweet of mother!
#FREDA.
The others are for Miss Lanfarne. My lady thought white would suit her better.
#CHRISTINE.
They suit you in that black dress. What do you think of Joan's engagement?
#FREDA.
It's very nice for her.
#CHRISTINE.
I say, Freda, have they been going hard at rehearsals?
#FREDA.
Every day. Miss Dot gets very cross, stage - managing.
#CHRISTINE.
I do hate learning a part. Thanks awfully for unpacking. Any news?
#FREDA.
The under - keeper, Dunning, won't marry Rose Taylor, after all.
#CHRISTINE.
What a shame! But I say that's serious. I thought there was - she was - I mean -
#FREDA.
He's taken up with another girl, they say.
#CHRISTINE.
Too bad! D'you know if Mr. Bill's come?
#FREDA.
Yes, by the six - forty.
#KEITH.
Hallo! Roses in December. I say, Freda, your father missed a wigging this morning when they drew blank at Warnham's spinney. Where's that litter of little foxes?
#FREDA.
I expect father knows, Captain Keith.
#KEITH.
You bet he does. Emigration? Or thin air? What?
#CHRISTINE.
Studdenham'd never shoot a fox, Ronny. He's been here since the flood.
#KEITH.
There's more ways of killing a cat - eh, Freda?
#CHRISTINE.
Young Dunning won't marry that girl, Ronny.
#KEITH.
Phew! Wouldn't be in his shoes, then! Sir William'll never keep a servant who's made a scandal in the village, old girl. Bill come?
#HAROLD.
Hallo, Freda! Patience on the monument. Let's have a sniff! For Miss Lanfarne? Bill come down yet?
#FREDA.
No, Mr. Harold.
#JOAN.
Am I all right behind, Freda? That beast, Dot!
#FREDA.
Quite, Miss Joan.
#DOT.
You little being!
#JOAN.
Oh! Dot! You're pinching!
#FREDA.
For you, Miss Lanfarne, from my lady.
#MABEL.
How sweet! And how are you, Freda?
#FREDA.
Very well, thank you.
#MABEL.
And your father? Hope he's going to let me come out with the guns again.
#FREDA.
He'll be delighted, I'm sure.
#MABEL.
Ye - es! I haven't forgotten his face - last time.
#FREDA.
You stood with Mr. Bill. He's better to stand with than Mr. Harold, or Captain Keith?
#MABEL.
He didn't touch a feather, that day.
#FREDA.
People don't when they're anxious to do their best.
#BILL.
Freda! what's the matter? Aren't you glad to see me?
#FREDA.
I've something to say to you, Mr. Bill. After dinner.
#BILL.
Mister - ?
#SIR WILLIAM.
Ah! Bill.
#MABEL.
How do you do?
#KEITH.
How are you, old chap?
#DOT.
Do you know your part?
#HAROLD.
Hallo, old man! gives her brother a flying kiss. JOAN and LATTER pause and look at him shyly without speech.
#BILL.
Good luck, you two! Well mother?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Well, my dear boy! Nice to see you at last. What a long time!
#CHRISTINE.
Mother, is it true about young Dunning and Rose Taylor?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I'm afraid so, dear.
#CHRISTINE.
But can't they be -
#DOT.
Ah! ah - h! My child, I'm not the young person.
#CHRISTINE.
No, of course not - only -
#DOT.
Look here! This is just an instance of what I hate.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
My dear? Another one?
#DOT.
Yes, mother, and don't you pretend you don't understand, because you know you do.
#CHRISTINE.
Instance? Of what? and MABEL have ceased talking, and listen, still at the fire.
#DOT.
Humbug, of course. Why should you want them to marry, if he's tired of her?
#CHRISTINE.
Well! If your imagination doesn't carry you as far as that!
#DOT.
When people marry, do you believe they ought to be in love with each other?
#CHRISTINE.
That's not the point.
#DOT.
Oh? Were you in love with Ronny?
#CHRISTINE.
Don't be idiotic!
#DOT.
Would you have married him if you hadn't been?
#CHRISTINE.
Of course not!
#JOAN.
Dot! You are! -
#DOT.
Hallo! my little snipe!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Dot, dear!
#DOT.
Don't shut me up, mother! Are you in love with John? Would you be going to marry him if you were not?
#CHRISTINE.
You are a brute, Dot.
#DOT.
Is Mabel in love with - whoever she is in love with?
#MABEL.
And I wonder who that is.
#DOT.
Well, would you marry him if you weren't?
#MABEL.
No, I would not.
#DOT.
Now, mother; did you love father?
#CHRISTINE.
Dot, you really are awful.
#DOT.
Well, it is a bit too thick, perhaps.
#JOAN.
Dot!
#DOT.
Well, mother, did you - I mean quite calmly?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Yes, dear, quite calmly.
#DOT.
Would you have married him if you hadn't? Then we're all agreed!
#MABEL.
Except yourself.
#DOT.
Even if I loved him, he might think himself lucky if I married him.
#MABEL.
Indeed, and I'm not so sure.
#DOT.
What I was going to -
#LADY CHESHIRE.
But don't you think, dear, you'd better not?
#DOT.
Well, I won't say what I was going to say, but what I do say is - Why the devil -
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Quite so, Dot!
#DOT.
If they're tired of each other, they ought not to marry, and if father's going to make them -
#CHRISTINE.
You don't understand in the least. It's for the sake of the -
#DOT.
Out with it, Old Sweetness! The approaching infant! God bless it!
#LATTER.
That must be so, Ronny.
#KEITH.
No, John; not a bit of it!
#LATTER.
You don't think!
#KEITH.
Good Gad, who wants to think after dinner!
#DOT.
Come on! Let's play pool. Look here! Rehearsal to - morrow is directly after breakfast; from "Eccles enters breathless" to the end.
#MABEL.
Whatever made you choose "Caste," DOT? You know it's awfully difficult.
#DOT.
Because it's the only play that's not too advanced.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Where's Bill, Ronny?
#KEITH.
I rather think Sir William and he are in Committee of Supply - Mem - Sahib.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Oh!
#LATTER.
There can't be two opinions about it, Ronny. Young Dunning's refusal is simply indefensible.
#KEITH.
I don't agree a bit, John.
#LATTER.
Of course, if you won't listen.
#KEITH.
Draw it mild, my dear chap. We've had the whole thing over twice at least.
#LATTER.
My point is this -
#KEITH.
I know - I know - but the point is, how far your point is simply professional.
#LATTER.
If a man wrongs a woman, he ought to right her again. There's no answer to that.
#KEITH.
It all depends.
#LATTER.
That's rank opportunism.
#KEITH.
Rats! Look here - Oh! hang it, John, one can't argue this out with a parson.
#LATTER.
Why not?
#HAROLD.
Pull devil, pull baker!
#KEITH.
Shut up, Harold!
#LATTER.
"To play the game" is the religion even of the Army.
#KEITH.
Exactly, but what is the game?
#LATTER.
What else can it be in this case?
#KEITH.
You're too puritanical, young John. You can't help it - line of country laid down for you. All drag - huntin'! What!
#LATTER.
Look here!
#HAROLD.
'Come hup, I say, you hugly beast!'
#KEITH.
You're not going to draw me, old chap. You don't see where you'd land us all.
#LATTER.
How do you imagine vice takes its rise? From precisely this sort of thing of young Dunning's.
#KEITH.
From human nature, I should have thought, John. I admit that I don't like a fellow's leavin' a girl in the lurch; but I don't see the use in drawin' hard and fast rules. You only have to break 'em. Sir William and you would just tie Dunning and the girl up together, willy - nilly, to save appearances, and ten to one but there'll be the deuce to pay in a year's time. You can take a horse to the water, you can't make him drink.
#LATTER.
I entirely and absolutely disagree with you.
#HAROLD.
Good old John!
#LATTER.
At all events we know where your principles take you.
#KEITH.
Where, please? Dry up, Harold!
#LATTER.
Did you ever hear the story of Faust?
#KEITH.
Now look here, John; with all due respect to your cloth, and all the politeness in the world, you may go to - blazes.
#LATTER.
Well, I must say, Ronny - of all the rude boors -
#KEITH.
Sorry I smashed the glass, old chap.
#KEITH.
Deuced odd, the way a parson puts one's back up! Because you know I agree with him really; young Dunning ought to play the game; and I hope Sir William'll make him.
#KEITH.
Hullo! Studdenham!
#STUDDENHAM.
Evenin', Captain Keith.
#JACKSON.
Sir William still in the dining - room with Mr. Bill, sir?
#HAROLD.
He is, Jackson.
#KEITH.
You've shot no pheasants yet, Studdenham?
#STUDDENHAM.
No, Sir. Only birds. We'll be doin' the spinneys and the home covert while you're down.
#KEITH.
I say, talkin' of spinneys -
#SIR WILLIAM.
Ah! Studdenham. Bad business this, about young Dunning!
#STUDDENHAM.
Yes, Sir William.
#SIR WILLIAM.
He definitely refuses to marry her?
#STUDDENHAM.
He does that.
#SIR WILLIAM.
That won't do, you know. What reason does he give?
#STUDDENHAM.
Won't say other than that he don't want no more to do with her.
#SIR WILLIAM.
God bless me! That's not a reason. I can't have a keeper of mine playing fast and loose in the village like this. That affair of young Dunning's, my dear.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Oh! Yes! I'm so sorry, Studdenham. The poor girl!
#STUDDENHAM.
Fancy he's got a feeling she's not his equal, now, my lady.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Yes, I suppose he has made her his superior.
#SIR WILLIAM.
What? Eh! Quite! Quite! I was just telling Studdenham the fellow must set the matter straight. We can't have open scandals in the village. If he wants to keep his place he must marry her at once.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Is it right to force them? Do you know what the girl wishes, Studdenham?
#STUDDENHAM.
Shows a spirit, my lady - says she'll have him - willin' or not. spirit? I see. If they marry like that they're sure to be miserable.
#SIR WILLIAM.
What! Doesn't follow at all. Besides, my dear, you ought to know by this time, there's an unwritten law in these matters. They're perfectly well aware that when there are consequences, they have to take them.
#STUDDENHAM.
Some o' these young people, my lady, they don't put two and two together no more than an old cock pheasant.
#SIR WILLIAM.
I'll give him till to - morrow. If he remains obstinate, he'll have to go; he'll get no character, Studdenham. Let him know what I've said. I like the fellow, he's a good keeper. I don't want to lose him. But this sort of thing I won't have. He must toe the mark or take himself off. Is he up here to - night?
#STUDDENHAM.
Hangin' partridges, Sir William. Will you have him in?
#SIR WILLIAM.
Yes - yes. I'll see him.
#STUDDENHAM.
Good - night to you, my lady.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Freda's not looking well, Studdenham.
#STUDDENHAM.
She's a bit pernickitty with her food, that's where it is.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I must try and make her eat.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Oh! Studdenham. We'll shoot the home covert first. What did we get last year?
#STUDDENHAM.
Two hundred and fifty - three pheasants, eleven hares, fifty - two rabbits, three woodcock, sundry.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Sundry? Didn't include a fox did it? I was seriously upset this morning at Warnham's spinney -
#STUDDENHAM.
You don't say, Sir William; that four - year - old he du look a handful!
#SIR WILLIAM.
You know well enough what I mean.
#STUDDENHAM.
Shall I send young Dunning, Sir William?
#SIR WILLIAM.
Old fox!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Don't be too hard on Dunning. He's very young.
#SIR WILLIAM.
My dear, you don't understand young fellows, how should you?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
A husband and two sons not counting. Bill, now do -
#SIR WILLIAM.
I'll be gentle with him. Come in!
#SIR WILLIAM.
Evenin', Dunning.
#DUNNING.
Evenin', Sir William.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Studdenham's told you what I want to see you about?
#DUNNING.
Yes, Sir.
#SIR WILLIAM.
The thing's in your hands. Take it or leave it. I don't put pressure on you. I simply won't have this sort of thing on my estate.
#DUNNING.
I'd like to say, Sir William, that she
#SIR WILLIAM.
Yes, I daresay - Six of one and half a dozen of the other. Can't go into that.
#DUNNING.
No, Sir William.
#SIR WILLIAM.
I'm quite mild with you. This is your first place. If you leave here you'll get no character.
#DUNNING.
I never meant any harm, sir.
#SIR WILLIAM.
My good fellow, you know the custom of the country.
#DUNNING.
Yes, Sir William, but -
#SIR WILLIAM.
You should have looked before you leaped. I'm not forcing you. If you refuse you must go, that's all.
#DUNNING.
Yes. Sir William.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Well, now go along and take a day to think it over.
#DUNNING.
Very good, Sir William. My old mother's dependent on me -
#SIR WILLIAM.
Now, Dunning, I've no more to say.
#SIR WILLIAM.
And look here! Just understand this
#MABEL.
Against my will I am bidden to bring you in to pool.
#BILL.
Sorry! I've got letters.
#MABEL.
You seem to have become very conscientious.
#BILL.
Oh! I don't know.
#MABEL.
Do you remember the last day of the covert shooting?
#BILL.
I do.
#MABEL.
What a pretty girl Freda Studdenham's grown!
#BILL.
Has she?
#MABEL.
"She walks in beauty."
#BILL.
Really? Hadn't noticed.
#MABEL.
Have you been taking lessons in conversation?
#BILL.
Don't think so.
#MABEL.
Oh! Mr. Cheshire!
#BILL.
Miss Lanfarne!
#MABEL.
What's the matter with you? Aren't you rather queer, considering that I don't bite, and was rather a pal!
#BILL.
I'm sorry.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Mabel, dear, do take my cue. Won't you play too, Bill, and try and stop Ronny, he's too terrible?
#BILL.
Thanks. I've got these letters. taking the cue passes back into the billiard - room, whence comes out the sound of talk and laughter.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Anything wrong, darling?
#BILL.
Nothing, thanks. I say, I wish you hadn't asked that girl here.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Mabel! Why? She's wanted for rehearsals. I thought you got on so well with her last Christmas.
#BILL.
A year ago.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
The girls like her, so does your father; personally I must say I think she's rather nice and Irish.
#BILL.
She's all right, I daresay.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I'm afraid your father's been talking to you, Bill.
#BILL.
He has.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Debts? Do try and make allowances. Of course he is a little -
#BILL.
He is.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I wish I could -
#BILL.
Oh, Lord! Don't you get mixed up in it!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
It seems almost a pity that you told him.
#BILL.
He wrote and asked me point blank what I owed.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Oh! I happen to have a little money, Bill - I think it would be simpler if -
#BILL.
Now look here, mother, you've tried that before. I can't help spending money, I never shall be able, unless I go to the Colonies, or something of the kind.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Don't talk like that, dear!
#BILL.
I would, for two straws!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
It's only because your father thinks such a lot of the place, and the name, and your career. The Cheshires are all like that. They've been here so long; they're all - root.
#BILL.
Deuced funny business my career will be, I expect!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
But, Bill, why must you spend more than your allowance?
#BILL.
Why - anything? I didn't make myself.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I'm afraid we did that. It was inconsiderate, perhaps.
#BILL.
Yes, you'd better have left me out.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
But why are you so - Only a little fuss about money!
#BILL.
Ye - es.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
You're not keeping anything from me, are you?
#BILL.
No. I must write these letters, please.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Bill, if there's any real trouble, you will tell me, won't you?
#BILL.
There's nothing whatever.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Isn't it a pity about young Dunning? I'm so sorry for Rose Taylor.
#BILL.
Oh! well, - you can't help these things in the country.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
It seems dreadful to force him. I do so believe in people doing things of their own accord. Do you want me, Freda?
#FREDA.
Only your cloak, my lady. Shall I - begin it?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Yes, yes.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Can you give me another five minutes, Bill? We'll come directly, my dear.
#SIR WILLIAM.
I shall give young Dunning short shrift. Now, about you, Bill! I don't want to bully you the moment you come down, but you know, this can't go on. I've paid your debts twice. Shan't pay them this time unless I see a disposition to change your mode of life. You get your extravagance from your mother. She's very queer - All the Winterleighs are like that about money....
#BILL.
Mother's particularly generous, if that's what you mean.
#SIR WILLIAM.
We will put it that way. At the present moment you owe, as I understand it, eleven hundred pounds.
#BILL.
About that.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Mere flea - bite. I've a proposition to make.
#BILL.
Won't it do to - morrow, sir?
#SIR WILLIAM.
"To - morrow" appears to be your motto in life.
#BILL.
Thanks!
#SIR WILLIAM.
I'm anxious to change it to - day. It's time you took your position seriously, instead of hanging about town, racing, and playing polo, and what not.
#BILL.
Go ahead! SIR, WILLIAM. The proposition's very simple. I can't suppose anything so rational and to your advantage will appeal to you, but I mention it. Marry a nice girl, settle down, and stand for the division; you can have the Dower House and fifteen hundred a year, and I'll pay your debts into the bargain. If you're elected I'll make it two thousand. Plenty of time to work up the constituency before we kick out these infernal Rads. Carpetbagger against you; if you go hard at it in the summer, it'll be odd if you don't manage to get in your three days a week, next season. You can take Rocketer and that four - year - old - he's well up to your weight, fully eight and a half inches of bone. You'll only want one other. And if Miss - if your wife means to hunt -
#BILL.
You've chosen my wife, then?
#SIR WILLIAM.
I imagine, you've some girl in your mind.
#BILL.
Ah! Used not to be unnatural at your age. I married your mother at twenty - eight. Here you are, eldest son of a family that stands for something. The more I see of the times the more I'm convinced that everybody who is anybody has got to buckle to, and save the landmarks left. Unless we're true to our caste, and prepared to work for it, the landed classes are going to go under to this infernal democratic spirit in the air. The outlook's very serious. We're threatened in a hundred ways. If you mean business, you'll want a wife. When I came into the property I should have been lost without your mother.
#BILL.
I thought this was coming.
#SIR WILLIAM.
My dear fellow, I don't want to put a pistol to your head. You've had a slack rein so far. I've never objected to your sowing a few wild oats - so long as you - er - Short of that - at all events, I've not inquired into your affairs. I can only judge by the - er - pecuniary evidence you've been good enough to afford me from time to time. I imagine you've lived like a good many young men in your position - I'm not blaming you, but there's a time for all things.
#BILL.
Why don't you say outright that you want me to marry Mabel Lanfarne?
#SIR WILLIAM.
Well, I do. Girl's a nice one. Good family - got a little money - rides well. Isn't she good - looking enough for you, or what?
#BILL.
Quite, thanks.
#SIR WILLIAM.
I understood from your mother that you and she were on good terms.
#BILL.
Please don't drag mother into it.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Perhaps you'll be good enough to state your objections.
#BILL.
Must we go on with this?
#SIR WILLIAM.
I've never asked you to do anything for me before; I expect you to pay attention now. I've no wish to dragoon you into this particular marriage. If you don't care for Miss Lanfarne, marry a girl you're fond of.
#BILL.
I refuse.
#SIR WILLIAM.
In that case you know what to look out for. You young.... This means, I suppose, that you've got some entanglement or other.
#BILL.
Suppose what you like, sir.
#SIR WILLIAM.
I warn you, if you play the blackguard -
#BILL.
You can't force me like young Dunning.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
What is it?
#SIR WILLIAM.
You deliberately refuse! Go away, Dorothy.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I haven't seen Bill for two months.
#SIR WILLIAM.
What! Well - we must talk it over again.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Come to the billiard - room, both of you! Bill, do finish those letters!
#BILL.
I say, this is dangerous, you know.
#FREDA.
Yes - but I must.
#BILL.
Well, then - Aren't you going to kiss me?
#BILL.
Do you know you haven't seen me for eight weeks?
#FREDA.
Quite - long enough - for you to have forgotten.
#BILL.
Forgotten! I don't forget people so soon.
#FREDA.
No?
#BILL.
What's the matter with you, Freda?
#FREDA.
It'll never be as it was.
#BILL.
How d'you mean?
#FREDA.
I've got something for you. I've not worn it since Cromer.
#BILL.
Now, look here
#FREDA.
I've had my holiday; I shan't get another in a hurry.
#BILL.
Freda!
#FREDA.
You'll be glad to be free. That fortnight's all you really loved me in.
#BILL.
I swear -
#FREDA.
Miss Lanfarne need never know about me.
#BILL.
So that's it! I've told you a dozen times - nothing's changed.
#BILL.
Oh! very well! If you will make yourself miserable.
#FREDA.
Everybody will be pleased.
#BILL.
At what?
#FREDA.
When you marry her.
#BILL.
This is too bad.
#FREDA.
It's what always happens - even when it's not a - gentleman.
#BILL.
That's enough.
#FREDA.
But I'm not like that girl down in the village. You needn't be afraid I'll say anything when - it comes. That's what I had to tell you.
#BILL.
What!
#FREDA.
I can keep a secret.
#BILL.
Do you mean this?
#BILL.
Good God!
#FREDA.
Father brought me up not to whine. Like the puppies when they hold them up by their tails. Oh! Bill!
#BILL.
Freda! Good God!
#BILL.
By Jove! This is - !
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Well, Freda, suppose you just give it up!
#FREDA.
I don't like to be beaten.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
You're not to worry over your work. And by the way, I promised your father to make you eat more.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
It's all very well to smile. You want bracing up. Now don't be naughty. I shall give you a tonic. And I think you had better put that cloak away.
#FREDA.
I'd rather have one more try, my lady.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Very well.
#JACKSON.
Excuse me, my lady. There's a young woman from the village, says you wanted to see her.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Rose Taylor? Ask her to come in. Oh! and Jackson the car for the meet please at half - past ten.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Well, Rose. Do come in!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I just wondered whether you'd like to ask my advice. Your engagement with Dunning's broken off, isn't it?
#ROSE.
Yes - but I've told him he's got to marry me.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I see! And you think that'll be the wisest thing?
#ROSE.
I don't know, my lady. He's got to.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I do hope you're a little fond of him still.
#ROSE.
I'm not. He don't deserve it. And - do you think he's quite lost his affection for you?
#ROSE.
I suppose so, else he wouldn't treat me as he's done. He's after that - that - He didn't ought to treat me as if I was dead.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
No, no - of course. But you will think it all well over, won't you?
#ROSE.
I've a - got nothing to think over, except what I know of.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
But for you both to marry in that spirit! You know it's for life, Rose. I'm always ready to help you.
#ROSE.
Thank you, my lady, but I think he ought to marry me. I've told him he ought.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Well, that's all I wanted to say. It's a question of your self - respect; I can't give you any real advice. But just remember that if you want a friend -
#ROSE.
I'm not so 'ard, really. I only want him to do what's right by me.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Yes, yes - I see.
#ROSE.
I don't like meeting the servants.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Come along, I'll take you out another way.
#DOT.
Can we have this room for the mouldy rehearsal, Mother?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Yes, dear, you can air it here.
#DOT.
Chair - chair - table - chair - Dash! Table - piano - fire - window! Comb for Eccles. Cradle? - Cradle - Brat! "Enter Eccles breathless. Esther and Polly rise - Esther puts on lid of bandbox." Bandbox! Searching for something to represent a bandbox, she opens the workroom door.
#DOT.
Freda?
#DOT.
I say, Freda. Anything the matter? You seem awfully down.
#DOT.
You haven't looked anything of a lollipop lately.
#FREDA.
I'm quite all right, thank you, Miss Dot.
#DOT.
Has Mother been givin' you a tonic?
#FREDA.
Not yet.
#DOT.
That doesn't account for it then. What is it, Freda?
#FREDA.
Nothing.
#DOT.
Are you very busy this morning?
#FREDA.
Only this cloak for my lady.
#DOT.
Oh! that can wait. I may have to get you in to prompt, if I can't keep 'em straight. They stray so. Would you mind?
#FREDA.
I shall be very glad, Miss Dot.
#DOT.
All right. Let's see - what did I want?
#JOAN.
Look here, Dot; about the baby in this scene. I'm sure I ought to make more of it.
#DOT.
Romantic little beast! Let's see you try!
#JOAN.
But, Dot, what are we really going to have for the baby? I can't rehearse with that thing. Can't you suggest something, Freda?
#FREDA.
Borrow a real one, Miss Joan. There are some that don't count much.
#JOAN.
Freda, how horrible!
#DOT.
You'll just put up with what you're given.
#DOT.
Buck up! Where are Bill and Harold? Go and find them, mouse - cat.
#DOT.
Drop that cradle, John! Leave the baby in! Now then! Bill, you enter there! John! get off the stage! Now then, "Eccles enters breathless, Esther and Polly rise." Wait a minute. I know now. Freda, I wanted a bandbox.
#HAROLD.
I hate beginning to rehearse, you know, you feel such a fool.
#DOT.
You'll feel more of a fool when you have begun. Shut the door. Now.
#LATTER.
Look here! I want to clear up a point of psychology before we start.
#DOT.
Good Lord!
#LATTER.
When I bring in the milk - ought I to bring it in seriously - as if I were accustomed - I mean, I maintain that if I'm -
#JOAN.
Oh! John, but I don't think it's meant that you should -
#DOT.
Shut up! Go back, John! Blow the milk! Begin, begin, begin! Bill!
#LATTER.
But I think you underrate the importance of my entrance altogether.
#MABEL.
Oh! no, Mr. Latter!
#LATTER.
I don't in the least want to destroy the balance of the scene, but I do want to be clear about the spirit. What is the spirit?
#DOT.
Rollicking!
#LATTER.
Well, I don't think so. We shall run a great risk, with this play, if we rollick.
#DOT.
Shall we? Now look here - !
#MABEL.
Mr. Cheshire!
#BILL.
Let's get on!
#DOT.
Begin, begin! At last!
#JACKSON.
Studdenham says, Mm, if the young ladies want to see the spaniel pups, he's brought 'em round.
#JOAN.
Oh! come 'on, John!
#DOT.
Stop! You -
#DOT.
First pick! Pigs! Devils!
#MABEL.
And don't you want one of the spaniel pups?
#BILL.
Can't keep a dog in town. You can have one, if you like. The breeding's all right.
#MABEL.
Sixth Pick?
#BILL.
The girls'll give you one of theirs. They only fancy they want 'em. Mann. You know, you remind me awfully of your father. Except that you're not nearly so polite. I don't understand you English - lords of the soil. The way you have of disposing of your females. What was the matter with you last night? Won't you tell me?
#BILL.
Nothing to tell.
#MABEL.
Ah! no, Mr. Bill.
#BILL.
Worried, I suppose.
#MABEL.
Quite got over it?
#BILL.
Don't chaff me, please.
#MABEL.
You really are rather formidable.
#BILL.
Thanks. MABEL, But, you know, I love to cross a field where there's a bull.
#BILL.
Really! Very interesting.
#MABEL.
The way of their only seeing one thing at a time. And overturning people on the journey.
#BILL.
Hadn't you better be a little careful?
#MABEL.
And never to see the hedge until they're stuck in it. And then straight from that hedge into the opposite one.
#BILL.
What makes you bait me this morning of all mornings?
#MABEL.
The beautiful morning! It must be dull for poor Freda working in there with all this fun going on?
#BILL.
Fun you call it? MABEL, To go back to you, - now - Mr. Cheshire.
#BILL.
No. MABEL, You always make me feel so Irish. Is it because you're so English, d'you think? Ah! I can see him moving his ears. Now he's pawing the ground - He's started!
#BILL.
Miss Lanfarne!
#MABEL.
You can't help coming after me! Can you? You'll feel that when I've gone.
#MABEL.
Here's the stile. Adieu, Monsieur le taureau!
#BILL.
I haven't slept all night.
#FREDA.
No?
#BILL.
Have you been thinking it over?
#BILL.
Don't! We must make a plan. I'll get you away. I won't let you suffer. I swear I won't.
#FREDA.
That will be clever.
#BILL.
I wish to Heaven my affairs weren't in such a mess.
#FREDA.
I shall be - all - right, thank you.
#BILL.
You must think me a blackguard. Abuse me - say something! Don't look like that!
#FREDA.
Were you ever really fond of me?
#BILL.
Of course I was, I am now. Give me your hands.
#BILL.
Look here! I'll prove it. There, there!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I beg your pardon.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Yes?
#BILL.
Don't say anything against her!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Please - go!
#BILL.
No.
#BILL.
Stop, mother!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I think perhaps not.
#BILL.
It's a d - d shame!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
It is.
#BILL.
It's not as you think. I'm engaged to be married to her.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I don't think I - quite - understand.
#BILL.
What I said was plain enough.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Bill!
#BILL.
I tell you I am going to marry her.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Is that true?
#BILL.
If you want to say anything, say it to me, mother.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Give me a chair, please.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Please sit down too.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Now!
#BILL.
I fell in love with her. And she with me.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
When?
#BILL.
In the summer.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Ah!
#BILL.
It wasn't her fault.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
No?
#BILL.
Mother!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Forgive me, I am not quite used to the idea. You say that you - are engaged?
#BILL.
Yes.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
The reasons against such an engagement have occurred to you, I suppose? Bill! what does it mean?
#BILL.
If you think she's trapped me into this -
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I do not. Neither do I think she has been trapped. I think nothing. I understand nothing.
#BILL.
Good!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
How long has this - engagement lasted?
#BILL.
Two months.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
This is - this is quite impossible.
#BILL.
You'll find it isn't.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
It's simple misery.
#BILL.
Go and wait in there, Freda.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
And are you still in love with her?
#BILL.
Of course I am.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Bill! Oh, Bill! What does it all mean? You are not in love with her now. It's no good telling me you are.
#BILL.
I am.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
That's not exactly how you would speak if you were.
#BILL.
She's in love with me.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I suppose so.
#BILL.
I mean to see that nobody runs her down.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Bill! Am I a hard, or mean woman?
#BILL.
Mother!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
It's all your life - and - your father's - and - all of us. I want to understand - I must understand. Have you realised what an awful thins this would be for us all? It's quite impossible that it should go on.
#BILL.
I'm always in hot water with the Governor, as it is. She and I'll take good care not to be in the way.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Tell me everything!
#BILL.
I have.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I'm your mother, Bill.
#BILL.
What's the good of these questions?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
You won't give her away - I see!
#BILL.
I've told you all there is to tell. We're engaged, we shall be married quietly, and - and - go to Canada.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
If there weren't more than that to tell you'd be in love with her now.
#BILL.
I've told you that I am.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
You are not. I know - I know there's more behind.
#BILL.
There - is - nothing.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Do you mean that your love for her has been just what it might have been for a lady?
#BILL.
Why not?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
It is not so as a rule.
#BILL.
Up to now I've never heard you or the girls say a word against Freda. This isn't the moment to begin, please.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
All such marriages end in wretchedness. You haven't a taste or tradition in common. You don't know what marriage is. Day after day, year after year. It's no use being sentimental - for people brought up as we are to have different manners is worse than to have different souls. Besides, it's poverty. Your father will never forgive you, and I've practically nothing. What can you do? You have no profession. How are you going to stand it; with a woman who - ? It's the little things.
#BILL.
I know all that, thanks.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Nobody does till they've been through it. Marriage is hard enough when people are of the same class. Oh! my dear - before it's too late!
#BILL.
It's no good.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
It's not fair to her. It can only end in her misery.
#BILL.
Leave that to me, please.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Only the very finest can do such things. And you don't even know what trouble's like.
#BILL.
Drop it, please, mother.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Bill, on your word of honour, are you acting of your own free will?
#BILL.
I can't stand any more.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
What in God's name shall I do?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Come in here, please, Freda.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
No, Bill. I want to speak to her alone.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I must ask you to leave us.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
How did it come about?
#FREDA.
I don't know, my lady.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
For heaven's sake, child, don't call me that again, whatever happens. I know well enough how love comes. I don't blame you. Don't cry. But, you see, it's my eldest son. Yes, I know. Women always get the worst of these things. That's natural. But it's not only you is it? Does any one guess?
#FREDA.
No.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Not even your father? There's nothing more dreadful than for a woman to hang like a stone round a man's neck. How far has it gone? Tell me!
#FREDA.
I can't.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Come!
#FREDA.
I - won't.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Won't give him away? Both of you the same. What's the use of that with me? Look at me! Wasn't he with you when you went for your holiday this summer?
#FREDA.
He's - always - behaved - like - a - gentleman.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Like a man you mean!
#FREDA.
It hasn't been his fault! I love him so.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I don't know what to say to you. It's simple madness! It can't, and shan't go on.
#FREDA.
I know I'm not his equal, but I am - somebody.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Does he love you now?
#FREDA.
That's not fair - it's not fair.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
If men are like gunpowder, Freda, women are not. If you've lost him it's been your own fault.
#FREDA.
But he does love me, he must. It's only four months.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Listen to me. I love my son, but I know him - I know all his kind of man. I've lived with one for thirty years. I know the way their senses work. When they want a thing they must have it, and then - they're sorry.
#FREDA.
He's not sorry.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Is his love big enough to carry you both over everything?... You know it isn't.
#FREDA.
If I were a lady, you wouldn't talk like that.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
If you were a lady there'd be no trouble before either of you. You'll make him hate you.
#FREDA.
I won't believe it. I could make him happy - out there.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I don't want to be so odious as to say all the things you must know. I only ask you to try and put yourself in our position.
#FREDA.
Ah, yes!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
You ought to know me better than to think I'm purely selfish.
#FREDA.
Would you like to put yourself in my position?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
What!
#FREDA.
Yes. Just like Rose.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Oh!
#FREDA.
Oh! Yes - it's the truth. I never meant to tell.
#BILL.
Well, are you satisfied?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
This is terrible!
#BILL.
The Governor had better know.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Oh! no; not yet!
#BILL.
Waiting won't cure it!
#JOAN.
The car's round. What's the matter?
#DOT.
Shut up!
#SIR WILLIAM.
Just off, my dear. Rehearsin'? What! Button that for me, Freda, would you? It's a bit stiff!
#SIR WILLIAM.
Thank you! "Balmy as May"; scent ought to be first - rate. Good - bye, my dear! Sampson's Gorse - best day of the whole year. Wish you were cumin' out, Joan.
#CHRISTINE.
Mother! What - ?
#JOAN.
They've started - ! Chris! What is it? Dot?
#DOT.
Bill, and her!
#JOAN.
But what?
#DOT.
Heaven knows! Go away, you're not fit for this.
#JOAN.
I am fit.
#DOT.
I think not.
#JOAN.
Chris?
#CHRISTINE.
Mother ought to have told us.
#JOAN.
It can't be very awful. Freda's so good.
#DOT.
Call yourself in love, you milk - and - water - kitten!
#CHRISTINE.
It's horrible, not knowing anything! I wish Runny hadn't gone.
#JOAN.
Shall I fetch John?
#DOT.
John!
#CHRISTINE.
Perhaps Harold knows.
#JOAN.
He went out with Studdenham.
#DOT.
It's always like this, women kept in blinkers. Rose - leaves and humbug! That awful old man!
#JOAN.
Dot!
#CHRISTINE.
Don't talk of father like that!
#DOT.
Well, he is! And Bill will be just like him at fifty! Heaven help Freda, whatever she's done! I'd sooner be a private in a German regiment than a woman.
#JOAN.
Dot, you're awful.
#DOT.
You - mouse - hearted - linnet!
#CHRISTINE.
Don't talk that nonsense about women!
#DOT.
You're married and out of it; and Ronny's not one of these terrific John Bulls. Looking for John? No good, my dear; lath and plaster.
#JOAN.
Here's Mabel!
#DOT.
Heavens, and the waters under the earth!
#CHRISTINE.
If we only knew!
#MABEL.
The silent company.
#DOT.
We're chucking it for to - day.
#MABEL.
What's the matter?
#CHRISTINE.
Oh! nothing.
#DOT.
Something's happened.
#MABEL.
Really! I am sorry. Is it bad enough for me to go?
#CHRISTINE.
Oh! no, Mabel!
#DOT.
I should think very likely.
#BILL.
Exactly! Fact of the matter is, Miss Lanfarne, I'm engaged to my mother's maid.
#BILL.
Thought you might like to know.
#CHRISTINE.
Great heavens!
#JOAN.
How awful!
#CHRISTINE.
I never thought of anything as bad as that.
#JOAN.
Oh! Chris! Something must be done!
#DOT.
Ha! When Father went up to have his glove buttoned!
#JACKSON.
If you please, Miss, Studdenham's brought up the other two pups. He's just outside. Will you kindly take a look at them, he says?
#DOT.
We can't.
#CHRISTINE.
Not just now, Jackson.
#JACKSON.
Is Studdenham and the pups to wait, Mm?
#STUDDENHAM.
This fellow's the best, Miss DOT. I was keeping him for my girl - a proper greedy one - takes after his father.
#DOT.
Thanks, Studdenham, I see.
#STUDDENHAM.
I won't take 'em out in here. They're rather bold yet.
#CHRISTINE.
No, no, of course.
#STUDDENHAM.
Then you think you'd like him, Miss DOT? The other's got a white chest; she's a lady.
#DOT.
Oh, yes! Studdenham; thanks, thanks awfully.
#STUDDENHAM.
Wonderful faithful creatures; follow you like a woman. You can't shake 'em off anyhow. My girl, she'd set her heart on him, but she'll just have to do without.
#DOT.
Oh! no, I can't take it away from her.
#STUDDENHAM.
Bless you, she won't mind! That's settled, then. Ah! would you! Tryin' to wriggle out of it! Regular young limb!
#CHRISTINE.
How ghastly!
#DOT.
"Caste!"
#BILL.
What's the time?
#HAROLD.
Nearly five. They won't be in yet, if that's any consolation. Always a tough meet - as the tiger said when he ate the man.
#BILL.
By Jove! You're the only person I can stand within a mile of me, Harold.
#HAROLD.
Old boy! Do you seriously think you're going to make it any better by marrying her?
#BILL.
Look here! I'm not the sort that finds it easy to say things.
#HAROLD.
No, old man.
#BILL.
But I've got a kind of self - respect though you wouldn't think it!
#HAROLD.
My dear old chap!
#BILL.
This is about as low - down a thing as one could have done, I suppose - one's own mother's maid; we've known her since she was so high. I see it now that - I've got over the attack.
#HAROLD.
But, heavens! if you're no longer keen on her, Bill! Do apply your reason, old boy.
#BILL.
If you think I care two straws about the morality of the thing.
#HAROLD.
Oh! my dear old man! Of course not!
#BILL.
It's simply that I shall feel such a d - d skunk, if I leave her in the lurch, with everybody knowing. Try it yourself; you'd soon see!
#HAROLD.
Poor old chap!
#BILL.
It's not as if she'd tried to force me into it. And she's a soft little thing. Why I ever made such a sickening ass of myself, I can't think. I never meant -
#HAROLD.
No, I know! But, don't do anything rash, Bill; keep your head, old man!
#BILL.
I don't see what loss I should be, if I did clear out of the country. Who's that knocking the balls about?
#HAROLD.
John, I expect.
#BILL.
He's coming in here. Can't stand that!
#LATTER.
Was that Bill?
#HAROLD.
Yes.
#LATTER.
Well?
#HAROLD.
Rat in a cage is a fool to him. This is the sort of thing you read of in books, John! What price your argument with Runny now? Well, it's not too late for you luckily.
#LATTER.
What do you mean?
#HAROLD.
You needn't connect yourself with this eccentric family!
#LATTER.
I'm not a bounder, Harold.
#HAROLD.
Good!
#LATTER.
It's terrible for your sisters.
#HAROLD.
Deuced lucky we haven't a lot of people staying here! Poor mother! John, I feel awfully bad about this. If something isn't done, pretty mess I shall be in.
#LATTER.
How?
#HAROLD.
There's no entail. If the Governor cuts Bill off, it'll all come to me.
#LATTER.
Oh!
#HAROLD.
Poor old Bill! I say, the play! Nemesis! What? Moral! Caste don't matter. Got us fairly on the hop.
#LATTER.
It's too bad of Bill. It really is. He's behaved disgracefully.
#HAROLD.
Well! There are thousands of fellows who'd never dream of sticking to the girl, considering what it means.
#LATTER.
Perfectly disgusting!
#HAROLD.
Hang you, John! Haven't you any human sympathy? Don't you know how these things come about? It's like a spark in a straw - yard.
#LATTER.
One doesn't take lighted pipes into strawyards unless one's an idiot, or worse.
#HAROLD.
H'm! You're not allowed tobacco. In the good old days no one would hive thought anything of this. My great - grandfather -
#LATTER.
Spare me your great - grandfather.
#HAROLD.
I could tell you of at least a dozen men I know who've been through this same business, and got off scot - free; and now because Bill's going to play the game, it'll smash him up.
#LATTER.
Why didn't he play the game at the beginning?
#HAROLD.
I can't stand your sort, John. When a thing like this happens, all you can do is to cry out: Why didn't he - ? Why didn't she - ? What's to be done - that's the point!
#LATTER.
Of course he'll have to -
#HAROLD.
Ha!
#LATTER.
What do you mean by - that?
#HAROLD.
Look here, John! You feel in your bones that a marriage'll be hopeless, just as I do, knowing Bill and the girl and everything! Now don't you?
#LATTER.
The whole thing is - is most unfortunate.
#HAROLD.
By Jove! I should think it was!
#CHRISTINE.
I've told Ronny.
#JOAN.
This waiting for father to be told is awful.
#HAROLD.
Where did you leave the old man?
#KEITH.
Clackenham. He'll be home in ten minutes.
#DOT.
Mabel's going. She walked into Gracely and sent herself a telegram.
#HAROLD.
Phew!
#DOT.
And we shall say good - bye, as if nothing had happened.
#HAROLD.
It's up to you, Ronny.
#KEITH.
Dot?
#DOT.
I'm not a squeamy squirrel.
#KEITH.
Anybody seen the girl since?
#DOT.
Yes.
#HAROLD.
Well?
#DOT.
She's just sitting there.
#CHRISTINE.
As we're all doing.
#DOT.
She's so soft, that's what's so horrible. If one could only feel - !
#KEITH.
She's got to face the music like the rest of us.
#DOT.
Music! Squeaks! Ugh! The whole thing's like a concertina, and some one jigging it!
#HAROLD.
Did you get a run, Ronny? What point?
#KEITH.
Eight mile.
#FOOTMAN.
Will you take tea, sir?
#KEITH.
No, thanks, Charles!
#HAROLD.
Good Gad! That's a squeeze of it!
#KEITH.
What's our line of country to be?
#CHRISTINE.
All depends on father.
#KEITH.
Sir William's between the devil and the deep sea, as it strikes me.
#CHRISTINE.
He'll simply forbid it utterly, of course.
#KEITH.
H'm! Hard case! Man who reads family prayers, and lessons on Sunday forbids son to - CHRISTINE, Ronny!
#KEITH.
Great Scott! I'm not saying Bill ought to marry her. She's got to stand the racket. But your Dad will have a tough job to take up that position.
#DOT.
Awfully funny!
#CHRISTINE.
What on earth d'you mean, Dot?
#DOT.
Morality in one eye, and your title in the other!
#CHRISTINE.
Rubbish!
#HAROLD.
You're all reckoning without your Bill.
#KEITH.
Ye - es. Sir William can cut him off; no mortal power can help the title going down, if Bill chooses to be such a -
#HAROLD.
I won't take what Bill ought to have; nor would any of you girls, I should think. and DOT. Of course not!
#KEITH.
Hardly the point, is it?
#DOT.
If it wasn't for mother! Freda's just as much of a lady as most girls. Why shouldn't he marry her, and go to Canada? It's what he's really fit for.
#HAROLD.
Steady on, Dot!
#DOT.
Well, imagine him in Parliament! That's what he'll come to, if he stays here - jolly for the country!
#CHRISTINE.
Don't be cynical! We must find a way of stopping Bill.
#DOT.
Me cynical!
#CHRISTINE.
Let's go and beg him, Ronny!
#KEITH.
No earthly! The only hope is in the girl.
#DOT.
She hasn't the stuff in her!
#HAROLD.
I say! What price young Dunning! Right about face! Poor old Dad!
#CHRISTINE.
It's past joking, Harold!
#DOT.
Old Studdenham's better than most relations by marriage!
#KEITH.
Thanks!
#CHRISTINE.
It's ridiculous - monstrous! It's fantastic!
#HAROLD.
There's his horse going round. He's in!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Thank you, Ronny!
#DOT.
Mother, you're shivering! Shall I get you a fur?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
No, thanks, dear!
#DOT.
Play up, mother darling!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
What sort of a run, Ronny?
#KEITH.
Quite fair, M'm. Brazier's to Caffyn's Dyke, good straight line.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
And the young horse?
#KEITH.
Carries his ears in your mouth a bit, that's all. Cheer up, Mem - Sahib!
#CHRISTINE.
Mother, must anything be said to father? Ronny thinks it all depends on her. Can't you use your influence?
#CHRISTINE.
But, mother, it's desperate.
#DOT.
Shut up, Chris! Of course mother can't. We simply couldn't beg her to let us off!
#CHRISTINE.
There must be some way. What do you think in your heart, mother?
#DOT.
Leave mother alone!
#CHRISTINE.
It must be faced, now or never.
#DOT.
Haven't you any self - respect?
#CHRISTINE.
We shall be the laughing - stock of the whole county. Oh! mother do speak to her! You know it'll be misery for both of them. Well, then?
#CHRISTINE.
Not even for Bill's sake?
#DOT.
Chris!
#CHRISTINE.
Well, for heaven's sake, speak to Bill again, mother! We ought all to go on our knees to him.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
He's with your father now.
#HAROLD.
Poor old Bill!
#CHRISTINE.
He didn't think of us! That wretched girl!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Chris!
#CHRISTINE.
There are limits!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Not to self - control.
#CHRISTINE.
No, mother! I can't I never shall - Something must be done! You know what Bill is. He rushes at things so, when he gets his head down. Oh! do try! It's only fair to her, and all of us!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
There are things one can't do.
#CHRISTINE.
But it's Bill! I know you can make her give him up, if you'll only say all you can. And, after all, what's coming won't affect her as if she'd been a lady. Only you can do it, mother: Do back me up, all of you! It's the only way!
#CHRISTINE.
Mother!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
What have you done?
#SIR WILLIAM.
You there!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Don't keep me in suspense!
#SIR WILLIAM.
The fool! My God! Dorothy! I didn't think I had a blackguard for a son, who was a fool into the bargain.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
If he were a blackguard he would not be what you call a fool.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Very well!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Bill, don't be harsh. It's all too terrible.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Sit down, my dear.
#SIR WILLIAM.
In all my life I've never been face to face with a thing like this. You ask me to be calm. I am trying to be. Be good enough in turn not to take his part against me.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Bill!
#SIR WILLIAM.
I am trying to think. I understand that you've known this - piece of news since this morning. I've known it ten minutes. Give me a little time, please. Where's the girl?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
In the workroom.
#SIR WILLIAM.
What in God's name is he about?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
What have you said to him?
#SIR WILLIAM.
Nothing - by a miracle. My family goes back to the thirteenth century. Nowadays they laugh at that! I don't! Nowadays they laugh at everything - they even laugh at the word lady. I married you, and I don't .... Married his mother's maid! By George! Dorothy! I don't know what we've done to deserve this; it's a death blow! I'm not prepared to sit down and wait for it. By Gad! I am not. There are plenty in these days who'll be glad enough for this to happen; plenty of these d - d Socialists and Radicals, who'll laugh their souls out over what they haven't the bowels to sees a - tragedy. I say it would be a tragedy; for you, and me, and all of us. You and I were brought up, and we've brought the children up, with certain beliefs, and wants, and habits. A man's past - his traditions - he can't get rid of them. They're - they're himself! It shan't go on.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
What's to prevent it?
#SIR WILLIAM.
I utterly forbid this piece of madness. I'll stop it.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
But the thing we can't stop.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Provision must be made.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
The unwritten law!
#SIR WILLIAM.
What! You're thinking of young - young - I don't see the connection.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
What's so awful, is that the boy's trying to do what's loyal - and we - his father and mother - !
#SIR WILLIAM.
I'm not going to see my eldest son ruin his life. I must think this out.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I've tried that - it doesn't help.
#SIR WILLIAM.
This girl, who was born on the estate, had the run of the house - brought up with money earned from me - nothing but kindness from all of us; she's broken the common rules of gratitude and decency - she lured him on, I haven't a doubt!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
In a way, I suppose.
#SIR WILLIAM.
What! It's ruin. We've always been here. Who the deuce are we if we leave this place? D'you think we could stay? Go out and meet everybody just as if nothing had happened? Good - bye to any prestige, political, social, or anything! This is the sort of business nothing can get over. I've seen it before. As to that other matter - it's soon forgotten - constantly happening - Why, my own grandfather - !
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Does he help?
#SIR WILLIAM.
You must go to the girl. She's soft. She'll never hold out against you.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I did before I knew what was in front of her - I said all I could. I can't go again now. I can't do it, Bill.
#SIR WILLIAM.
What are you going to do, then - fold your hands? If he marries her, I've done with him. As far as I'm concerned he'll cease to exist. The title - I can't help. My God! Does that meet your wishes?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
You've no right to put such an alternative to me. I'd give ten years of my life to prevent this marriage. I'll go to Bill. I'll beg him on my knees.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Then why can't you go to the girl? She deserves no consideration. It's not a question of morality: Morality be d - d!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
But not self - respect....
#SIR WILLIAM.
What! You're his mother!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
I've tried; I can't get it out.
#SIR WILLIAM.
You won't go to her? It's the only chance.
#SIR WILLIAM.
In the whole course of our married life, Dorothy, I've never known you set yourself up against me. I resent this, I warn you - I resent it. Send the girl to me. I'll do it myself.
#SIR WILLIAM.
This is a nice end to my day!
#SIR WILLIAM.
Come in!
#SIR WILLIAM.
I've asked you to be good enough to come, in order that - You may sit down.
#SIR WILLIAM.
This is a sad business.
#FREDA.
Yes, Sir William.
#SIR WILLIAM.
I - er - are you attached to my son?
#FREDA.
Yes.
#SIR WILLIAM.
It's very painful to me to have to do this. I sent for you - to - ask - How old are you?
#FREDA.
Twenty - two.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Do you expect me to sanction such a mad idea as a marriage?
#FREDA.
I don't expect anything.
#SIR WILLIAM.
You know - you haven't earned the right to be considered.
#FREDA.
Not yet!
#SIR WILLIAM.
What! That oughtn't to help you! On the contrary. Now brace yourself up, and listen to me!
#SIR WILLIAM.
I've not a word to say for my son. He's behaved like a scamp.
#FREDA.
Oh! no!
#SIR WILLIAM.
At the same, time - What made you forget yourself? You've no excuse, you know.
#FREDA.
No.
#SIR WILLIAM.
You'll deserve all you'll get. Confound it! To expect me to - It's intolerable! Do you know where my son is?
#FREDA.
I think he's in the billiard - room with my lady.
#SIR WILLIAM.
I wanted to - to put it to you - as a - as a - what! I'll speak to him first. Come in here, please! Go in, and wait!
#SIR WILLIAM.
Your mother and I have spoken of this - calamity. I imagine that even you have some dim perception of the monstrous nature of it. I must tell you this: If you do this mad thing, you fend for yourself. You'll receive nothing from me now or hereafter. I consider that only due to the position our family has always held here. Your brother will take your place. We shall - get on as best we can without you. Well!
#BILL.
I shall marry her.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Oh! Bill! Without love - without anything!
#BILL.
All right, mother! you've mistaken your man, sir. Because I'm a rotter in one way, I'm not necessarily a rotter in all. You put the butt end of the pistol to Dunning's head yesterday, you put the other end to mine to - day. Well! Let the d - d thing off!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Bill!
#BILL.
I'm not going to leave her in the lurch.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Do me the justice to admit that I have not attempted to persuade you to.
#BILL.
No! you've chucked me out. I don't see what else you could have done under the circumstances. It's quite all right. But if you wanted me to throw her over, father, you went the wrong way to work, that's all; neither you nor I are very good at seeing consequences.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Do you realise your position?
#BILL.
I've a fair notion of it.
#SIR WILLIAM.
You have none - not the faintest, brought up as you've been.
#BILL.
I didn't bring myself up.
#SIR WILLIAM.
You - ungrateful young dog!
#LADY CHESHIRE.
How can you - both?
#SIR WILLIAM.
I am speaking under the stress of very great pain - some consideration is due to me. This is a disaster which I never expected to have to face. It is a matter which I naturally can never hope to forget. I shall carry this down to my death. We shall all of us do that. I have had the misfortune all my life to believe in our position here - to believe that we counted for something - that the country wanted us. I have tried to do my duty by that position. I find in one moment that it is gone - smoke - gone. My philosophy is not equal to that. To countenance this marriage would be unnatural.
#BILL.
I know. I'm sorry. I've got her into this - I don't see any other way out. It's a bad business for me, father, as well as for you -
#JACKSON.
Will you speak to Studdenham, Sir William? It's about young Dunning.
#BILL.
He'd better be told.
#SIR WILLIAM.
He shall be.
#STUDDENHAM.
Good evenin', my lady! Evenin', Sir William!
#STUDDENHAM.
Glad to be able to tell you, the young man's to do the proper thing. Asked me to let you know, Sir William. Banns'll be up next Sunday. Beg pardon, my lady, you're shakin' like a leaf!
#BILL.
I've a painful piece of news for you, Studdenham; I'm engaged to your daughter. We're to be married at once.
#STUDDENHAM.
I - don't - understand you - sir.
#BILL.
The fact is, I've behaved badly; but I mean to put it straight.
#STUDDENHAM.
I'm a little deaf. Did you say - my daughter?
#SIR WILLIAM.
There's no use mincing matters, Studdenham. It's a thunderbolt - young Dunning's case over again.
#STUDDENHAM.
I don't rightly follow. She's - You've - ! I must see my daughter. Have the goodness to send for her, m'lady.
#STUDDENHAM.
YOU tell me that my daughter's in the position of that girl owing to your son? Men ha' been shot for less.
#BILL.
If you like to have a pot at me, Studdenham you're welcome.
#STUDDENHAM.
I've been in your service five and twenty years, Sir William; but this is man to man - this is!
#SIR WILLIAM.
I don't deny that, Studdenham.
#STUDDENHAM.
No - 'twouldn't be very easy. Did I understand him to say that he offers her marriage?
#SIR WILLIAM.
You did.
#STUDDENHAM.
Well - that's something! I'm tryin' to see the rights o' this.
#SIR WILLIAM.
You've all your work cut out for you, Studdenham.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Don't, Studdenham! Please!
#STUDDENHAM.
What's that, m'lady?
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Your - your - hands.
#STUDDENHAM.
Come here! You! When did you start this?
#FREDA.
In the summer, father.
#LADY CHESHIRE.
Don't be harsh to her!
#STUDDENHAM.
Harsh! And when did you tell him about - what's come to you?
#FREDA.
Last night.
#STUDDENHAM.
Oh! You young - ! I want to clear me mind a bit - I don't see it plain at all. 'Tis said there's been an offer of marriage?
#BILL.
I've made it, I stick to it.
#STUDDENHAM.
Oh! I want time to get the pith o' this. You don't say anything, Sir William?
#SIR WILLIAM.
The facts are all before you.
#STUDDENHAM.
M'lady?
#STUDDENHAM.
My girl was - was good enough for any man. It's not for him that's - that's to look down on her. You hear the handsome offer that's been made you? Well? If nobody's to speak a word, we won't get much forrarder. I'd like for you to say what's in your mind, Sir William.
#SIR WILLIAM.
I - If my son marries her he'll have to make his own way.
#STUDDENHAM.
I'm not puttin' thought to that.
#SIR WILLIAM.
I didn't suppose you were, Studdenham. It appears to rest with your daughter. Infernal fires they make up here! CHESHIRE, who is again shivering desperately, as if with intense cold, makes a violent attempt to control her shuddering.
#STUDDENHAM.
There's luxuries that's got to be paid for. Speak up, now.
#FREDA.
I want - No!
#SIR WILLIAM.
Ah!
#STUDDENHAM.
Don't be afraid, Sir William! We want none of you! She'll not force herself where she's not welcome. She may ha' slipped her good name, but she'll keep her proper pride. I'll have no charity marriage in my family.
#SIR WILLIAM.
Steady, Studdenham!
#STUDDENHAM.
If the young gentleman has tired of her in three months, as a blind man can see by the looks of him - she's not for him!
#BILL.
I'm ready to make it up to her.
#STUDDENHAM.
Keep back, there? Well! She's not the first this has happened to since the world began, an' she won't be the last. Come away, now, come away! Taking FREDA by the shoulders, he guides her towards the door.
#SIR WILLIAM.
D - n 'it, Studdenham! Give us credit for something!
#STUDDENHAM.
Ah! I do that, Sir William. But there's things that can't be undone!
#DOT.
Mabel's just going, mother! Where's Freda? Is it - Has she really had the pluck? The curtain falls.
