#THE GIRL.
God knows what 'e'll say, Jim.
#THE MAN.
Let 'im. 'E's come too late, that's all.
#THE GIRL.
He couldn't come before. I'm frightened. 'E was fond o' me.
#THE MAN.
And aren't I fond of you?
#THE GIRL.
I ought to 'a waited, Jim; with 'im in the fightin'.
#THE MAN.
And what about me? Aren't I been in the fightin' - earned all I could get?
#THE GIRL.
Ah!
#THE MAN.
Did you - ?
#THE GIRL.
Not like you, Jim - not like you.
#THE MAN.
Have a spirit, then.
#THE GIRL.
I promised him.
#THE MAN.
One man's luck's another's poison.
#THE GIRL.
I ought to 'a waited. I never thought he'd come back from the fightin'.
#THE MAN.
Maybe 'e'd better not 'ave.
#THE GIRL.
What'll he be like, I wonder?
#THE MAN.
Daisy, don't you never go back on me, or I should kill you, and 'im too.
#THE GIRL.
I never could.
#THE MAN.
Will you run for it? 'E'd never find us!
#THE MAN.
What's the good o' stayin'? The world's wide.
#THE GIRL.
I'd rather have it off me mind, with him home.
#THE MAN.
It's temptin' Providence.
#THE GIRL.
What's the time, Jim?
#THE MAN.
'Alf past four.
#THE GIRL.
He said four o'clock. Jim, you better go.
#THE MAN.
Not I. I've not got the wind up. I've seen as much of hell as he has, any day. What like is he?
#THE GIRL.
I dunno, just. I've not seen him these three years. I dunno no more, since I've known you.
#THE MAN.
Big or little chap?
#THE GIRL.
'Bout your size. Oh! Jim, go along!
#THE MAN.
No fear! What's a blighter like that to old Fritz's shells? We didn't shift when they was comin'. If you'll go, I'll go; not else.
#THE GIRL.
Jim, do you love me true? I ain't ashamed - I ain't ashamed. If 'e could see me 'eart.
#THE MAN.
Daisy! If I'd known you out there, I never could 'a stuck it. They'd 'a got me for a deserter. That's how I love you!
#THE GIRL.
Jim, don't lift your hand to 'im! Promise!
#THE MAN.
That's according.
#THE GIRL.
Promise!
#THE MAN.
If 'e keeps quiet, I won't. But I'm not accountable - not always, I tell you straight - not since I've been through that.
#THE GIRL.
Nor p'raps he isn't.
#THE MAN.
Like as not. It takes the lynch pins out, I tell you.
#THE GIRL.
God 'elp us!
#THE MAN.
Ah! We said that a bit too often. What we want we take, now; there's no one else to give it us, and there's no fear'll stop us; we seen the bottom of things.
#THE GIRL.
P'raps he'll say that too.
#THE MAN.
Then it'll be 'im or me.
#THE GIRL.
I'm frightened:
#THE MAN.
No, Daisy, no! The river's handy. One more or less. 'E shan't 'arm you; nor me neither.
#THE GIRL.
Oh, no! Give it to me, Jim!
#THE MAN.
No fear! Shan't 'ave no need for it like as not. All right, little Daisy; you can't be expected to see things like what we do. What's life, anyway? I've seen a thousand lives taken in five minutes. I've seen dead men on the wires like flies on a flypaper. I've been as good as dead meself a hundred times. I've killed a dozen men. It's nothin'. He's safe, if 'e don't get my blood up. If he does, nobody's safe; not 'im, nor anybody else; not even you. I'm speakin' sober.
#THE GIRL.
Jim, you won't go fightin' in the sun, with the birds all callin'?
#THE MAN.
That depends on 'im. I'm not lookin' for it. Daisy, I love you. I love your hair. I love your eyes. I love you.
#THE GIRL.
And I love you, Jim. I don't want nothin' more than you in all the world.
#THE MAN.
Amen to that, my dear. Kiss me close!
#THE GIRL.
It's him!
#THE MAN.
Don't get the wind up, Daisy. I'm here!
#SOLDIER.
Daisy! Daisy! Hallo, old pretty girl!
#THE GIRL.
Hallo, Jack! I got things to tell you!
#SOLDIER.
What sort o' things, this lovely day? Why, I got things that'd take me years to tell. Have you missed me, Daisy?
#THE GIRL.
You been so long.
#SOLDIER.
So I 'ave. My Gawd! It's a way they 'ave in the Army. I said when I got out of it I'd laugh. Like as the sun itself I used to think of you, Daisy, when the trumps was comin' over, and the wind was up. D'you remember that last night in the wood? "Come back and marry me quick, Jack." Well, here I am - got me pass to heaven. No more fightin', no more drillin', no more sleepin' rough. We can get married now, Daisy. We can live soft an' 'appy. Give us a kiss, my dear.
#THE GIRL.
No.
#SOLDIER.
Why not?
#THE MAN.
That's why, soldier.
#SOLDIER.
'Oo are you, Pompey? The sun don't shine in your inside, do it? 'Oo is he, Daisy?
#THE GIRL.
My man.
#SOLDIER.
Your - man! Lummy! "Taffy was a Welshman, Taffy was a thief!" Well, mate! So you've been through it, too. I'm laughin' this mornin' as luck will 'ave it. Ah! I can see your knife.
#THE MAN.
Don't laugh at me, I tell you.
#SOLDIER.
Not at you, not at you. I'm laughin' at things in general. Where did you get it, mate?
#THE MAN.
Through the lung.
#SOLDIER.
Think o' that! An' I never was touched. Four years an' never was touched. An' so you've come an' took my girl! Nothin' doin'! Ha! Well! The world's before me! I'll give you Daisy for a lung protector.
#THE MAN.
You won't. I've took her.
#SOLDIER.
That's all right, then. You keep 'er. I've got a laugh in me you can't put out, black as you look! Good - bye, little Daisy!
#THE MAN.
Don't touch 'im!
#SOLDIER.
Look 'ere, mate; shake 'ands! I don't want to see a girl cry, this day of all, with the sun shinin'. I seen too much of sorrer. You and me've been at the back of it. We've 'ad our whack. Shake!
#THE MAN.
Who are you kiddin'? You never loved 'er!
#SOLDIER.
Oh! I thought I did.
#THE MAN.
I'll fight you for her.
#SOLDIER.
Mate, you done your bit, an' I done mine. It's took us two ways, seemin'ly.
#THE GIRL.
Jim!
#THE MAN.
I don't want 'is charity. I only want what I can take.
#SOLDIER.
Daisy, which of us will you 'ave?
#THE GIRL.
Oh! Him!
#SOLDIER.
You see, mate! Put your 'ands down. There's nothin' for it but a laugh. You an' me know that. Laugh, mate!
#THE MAN.
You blarsted - !
#SOLDIER.
It's no use, mate. I can't do it. I said I'd laugh to - day, and laugh I will. I've come through that, an' all the stink of it; I've come through sorrer. Never again! Cheerio, mate! The sun's a - shinin'! He turns away.
#THE GIRL.
Jack, don't think too 'ard of me!
#SOLDIER.
No fear, my dear! Enjoy your fancy! So long! Gawd bless you both! He sings, and goes along the path, and the song fades away.
#THE MAN.
'E's mad!
#THE GIRL.
The sun has touched 'im, Jim!
