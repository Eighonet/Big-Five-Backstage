#YOUNG OFFICER.
I say; what's the matter? You were crying when I spoke to you.
#MARY.
Oh! nothing. The beautiful evening - that's all.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Cheer up!
#MARY.
Cheer up! You are not lonelee, like me.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
I say, how did you how did you get into this? Isn't it an awfully hopeless sort of life?
#MARY.
Yees, it ees. You haf been wounded?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Just out of hospital to - day.
#MARY.
The horrible war - all the misery is because of the war. When will it end?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
I say, what nationality are you?
#MARY.
Rooshian.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Really! I never met a Russian girl. I say, is it as bad as they make out?
#MARY.
Not when I haf anyone as ni - ice as you; I never haf had, though. You stopped because I was sad, others stop because I am gay. I am not fond of men at all. When you know - you are not fond of them.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Well, you hardly know them at their best, do you? You should see them in the trenches. By George! They're simply splendid - officers and men, every blessed soul. There's never been anything like it - just one long bit of jolly fine self - sacrifice; it's perfectly amazing.
#MARY.
I expect you are not the last at that. You see in them what you haf in yourself, I think.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Oh, not a bit; you're quite out! I assure you when we made the attack where I got wounded there wasn't a single man in my regiment who wasn't an absolute hero. The way they went in - never thinking of themselves - it was simply ripping.
#MARY.
It is the same too, perhaps, with - the enemy.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Oh, yes! I know that.
#MARY.
Ah! You are not a mean man. How I hate mean men!
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Oh! they're not mean really - they simply don't understand.
#MARY.
Oh! You are a babee - a good babee aren't you?
#MARY.
But I li - ke you for it. It is so good to find a ni - ice man.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
About being lonely? Haven't you any Russian friends?
#MARY.
Rooshian? No. The town is so beeg. Were you at the concert before you spoke to me?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Yes.
#MARY.
I too. I lofe music.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
I suppose all Russians do.
#MARY.
I go there always when I haf the money.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
What! Are you as badly on the rocks as that?
#MARY.
Well, I haf just one shilling now!
#YOUNG OFFICER.
I say, what's your name?
#MARY.
May. Well, I call myself that. It is no good asking yours.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
You're a distrustful little soul; aren't you?
#MARY.
I haf reason to be, don't you think?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Yes. I suppose you're bound to think us all brutes.
#MARY.
Well, I haf a lot of reasons to be afraid all my time. I am dreadfully nervous now; I am not trusding anybody. I suppose you haf been killing lots of Germans?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
We never know, unless it happens to be hand to hand; I haven't come in for that yet.
#MARY.
But you would be very glad if you had killed some.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Oh, glad? I don't think so. We're all in the same boat, so far as that's concerned. We're not glad to kill each other - not most of us. We do our job - that's all.
#MARY.
Oh! It is frightful. I expect I haf my brothers killed.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Don't you get any news ever?
#MARY.
News? No indeed, no news of anybody in my country. I might not haf a country; all that I ever knew is gone; fader, moder, sisters, broders, all; never any more I shall see them, I suppose, now. The war it breaks and breaks, it breaks hearts. Do you know what I was thinking when you came up to me? I was thinking of my native town, and the river in the moonlight. If I could see it again I would be glad. Were you ever homeseeck?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Yes, I have been - in the trenches. But one's ashamed with all the others.
#MARY.
Ah! Yees! Yees! You are all comrades there. What is it like for me here, do you think, where everybody hates and despises me, and would catch me and put me in prison, perhaps.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Sorry - sorry.
#MARY.
You are the first who has been kind to me for so long! I will tell you the truth - I am not Rooshian at all - I am German.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
My dear girl, who cares. We aren't fighting against women.
#MARY.
Another man said that to me. But he was thinkin' of his fun. You are a veree ni - ice boy; I am so glad I met you. You see the good in people, don't you? That is the first thing in the world - because - there is really not much good in people, you know.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
You are a dreadful little cynic! But of course you are!
#MARY.
Cyneec? How long do you think I would live if I was not a cyneec? I should drown myself to - morrow. Perhaps there are good people, but, you see, I don't know them.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
I know lots.
#MARY.
Well now - see, ni - ice boy - you haf never been in a hole, haf you?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
I suppose not a real hole.
#MARY.
No, I should think not, with your face. Well, suppose I am still a good girl, as I was once, you know; and you took me to your mother and your sisters and you said: "Here is a little German girl that has no work, and no money, and no friends." They will say: "Oh! how sad! A German girl!" And they will go and wash their hands.
#MARY.
You see.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
I'm sure there are people.
#MARY.
No. They would not take a German, even if she was good. Besides, I don't want to be good any more - I am not a humbug; I have learned to be bad. Aren't you going to kees me, ni - ice boy? She puts her face close to his. Her eyes trouble him; he draws back.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Don't. I'd rather not, if you don't mind. It's stupid. I don't know - but you see, out there, and in hospital, life's different. It's - it's - it isn't mean, you know. Don't come too close.
#MARY.
Oh! You are fun - Eesn't it light. No Zeps to - night. When they burn - what a 'orrble death! And all the people cheer. It is natural. Do you hate us veree much?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Hate? I don't know.
#MARY.
I don't hate even the English - I despise them. I despise my people too; even more, because they began this war. Oh! I know that. I despise all the peoples. Why haf they made the world so miserable - why haf they killed all our lives - hundreds and thousands and millions of lives - all for noting? They haf made a bad world - everybody hating, and looking for the worst everywhere. They haf made me bad, I know. I believe no more in anything. What is there to believe in? Is there a God? No! Once I was teaching little English children their prayers - isn't that funnee? I was reading to them about Christ and love. I believed all those things. Now I believe noting at all - no one who is not a fool or a liar can believe. I would like to work in a 'ospital; I would like to go and 'elp poor boys like you. Because I am a German they would throw me out a 'undred times, even if I was good. It is the same in Germany, in France, in Russia, everywhere. But do you think I will believe in Love and Christ and God and all that - Not I! I think we are animals - that's all! Oh, yes! you fancy it is because my life has spoiled me. It is not that at all - that is not the worst thing in life. The men I take are not ni - ice, like you, but it's their nature; and - they help me to live, which is something for me, anyway. No, it is the men who think themselves great and good and make the war with their talk and their hate, killing us all - killing all the boys like you, and keeping poor People in prison, and telling us to go on hating; and all these dreadful cold - blood creatures who write in the papers - the same in my country - just the same; it is because of all of them that I think we are only animals.
#MARY.
Don't mind me talkin', ni - ice boy. I don't know anyone to talk to. If you don't like it, I can be quiet as a mouse.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Oh, go on! Talk away; I'm not obliged to believe you, and I don't.
#MARY.
Well, look here, ni - ice boy, what sort of world is it, where millions are being tortured, for no fault of theirs, at all? A beautiful world, isn't it? 'Umbog! Silly rot, as you boys call it. You say it is all "Comrades" and braveness out there at the front, and people don't think of themselves. Well, I don't think of myself veree much. What does it matter? I am lost now, anyway. But I think of my people at 'ome; how they suffer and grieve. I think of all the poor people there, and here, how lose those they love, and all the poor prisoners. Am I not to think of them? And if I do, how am I to believe it a beautiful world, ni - ice boy?
#MARY.
Look here! We haf one life each, and soon it is over. Well, I think that is lucky.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
No! There's more than that.
#MARY.
Ah! You think the war is fought for the future; you are giving your lives for a better world, aren't you?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
We must fight till we win.
#MARY.
Till you win. My people think that too. All the peoples think that if they win the world will be better. But it will not, you know; it will be much worse, anyway.
#MARY.
I don't care which win. I don't care if my country is beaten. I despise them all - animals - animals. Ah! Don't go, ni - ice boy; I will be quiet now.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Good - night.
#MARY.
Are you really going? Don't you like me enough?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Yes, I like you.
#MARY.
It is because I am German, then?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
No.
#MARY.
Then why won't you stay?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
If you must know - because you upset me.
#MARY.
Won't you kees me once?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Don't! I don't want to feel a brute.
#MARY.
You are a funny boy; but you are veree good. Talk to me a little, then. No one talks to me. Tell me, haf you seen many German prisoners?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
A good many.
#MARY.
Any from the Rhine?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Yes, I think so.
#MARY.
Were they veree sad?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Some were; some were quite glad to be taken.
#MARY.
Did you ever see the Rhine? It will be wonderful to - night. The moonlight will be the same there, and in Rooshia too, and France, everywhere; and the trees will look the same as here, and people will meet under them and make love just as here. Oh! isn't it stupid, the war? As if it were not good to be alive!
#YOUNG OFFICER.
You can't tell how good it is to be alive till you're facing death. You don't live till then. And when a whole lot of you feel like that - and are ready to give their lives for each other, it's worth all the rest of life put together.
#MARY.
How were you wounded, ni - ice boy?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Attacking across open ground: four machine bullets got me at one go off.
#MARY.
Weren't you veree frightened when they ordered you to attack?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
It was great. We did laugh that morning. They got me much too soon, though - a swindle.
#MARY.
You laughed?
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Yes. And what do you think was the first thing I was conscious of next morning? My old Colonel bending over me and giving me a squeeze of lemon. If you knew my Colonel you'd still believe in things. There is something, you know, behind all this evil. After all, you can only die once, and, if it's for your country - all the better!
#MARY.
No; I believe in nothing, not even in my country. My heart is dead.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Yes; you think so, but it isn't, you know, or you wouldn't have 'been crying when I met you.
#MARY.
If it were not dead, do you think I could live my life - walking the streets every night, pretending to like strange men; never hearing a kind word; never talking, for fear I will be known for a German? Soon I shall take to drinking; then I shall be "Kaput" veree quick. You see, I am practical; I see things clear. To - night I am a little emotional; the moon is funny, you know. But I live for myself only, now. I don't care for anything or anybody.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
All the same; just now you were pitying your folk at home, and prisoners and that.
#MARY.
Yees; because they suffer. Those who suffer are like me - I pity myself, that's all; I am different from your English women. I see what I am doing; I do not let my mind become a turnip just because I am no longer moral.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
Nor your heart either, for all you say.
#MARY.
Ni - ice boy, you are veree obstinate. But all that about love is 'umbog. We love ourselves, noting more.
#YOUNG OFFICER.
No; we don't only love ourselves; there is more. I can't explain, but there's something great; there's kindness - and - and -
#MARY.
Take them - I will not haf your English money - take them.
#MARY.
Defeat! Der Vaterland! Defeat! . One shillin'!
