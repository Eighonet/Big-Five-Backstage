#OLD JOE.
Is Matthew in, Mrs. Butterworth?
#MARY.
Yes. You'll hear his loom if you hearken.
#OLD JOE.
It's a sound that isn't often heard outside the factory nowadays.
#MARY.
It's one that isn't often hushed in here. Matthew's busy.
#HENRI.
Too busy to see us, Madame Butterworth?
#OLD JOE.
Tell him the 'Friends of the People are here to see him on the people's business.
#MARY.
I know you. I know you all. You, Joe Healey and young Martin Kendall, and you - you're the Frenchman.
#HENRI.
I am the Frenchman, madame.
#MARY.
Radicals, the three of you.
#OLD JOE.
We are Friends of the People.
#MARY.
Yes. Friends of yourselves.
#OLD JOE.
Yes, of ourselves and of you and of Matthew there. We are the people.
#MARY.
You're Radicals. And my Matthew's not a redcap like that Frenchie there that's fled his country to come disturbing quiet English folk with his nonsense.
#HENRI.
I left my country when the Bourbons entered it again. The blood I'd shed for freedom -
#OLD JOE.
We'll talk to Matthew about all that.
#MARY.
You will not talk to Matthew. I'll not have my man made a Radical, and run his head into a noose for the sake of -
#MARTIN.
For the sake of freedom.
#MARY.
We're free enough.
#HENRI.
You are free to starve. To be slaves of the cotton masters, who treat you worse than any grand seigneur would have treated his peasants under the Bourbons.
#MARY.
Well, Matthew's busy.
#OLD JOE.
He's not too busy to attend to us. We want him out.
#MARY.
And you'll not get him.
#OLD JOE.
I think we shall. Matthew! Matthew Butterworth!
#MARY.
Yes, you may call. You'll burst your lungs before he'll hear in there. He's working. You're idling. Don't try to interrupt a better man.
#OLD JOE.
That's why we want him with us. Because we know him for the best weaver in these parts. Because he's treated by the master different from us and works at home instead of being driven into the factory. We want the best man on the people's side and none of us but gives old Matthew best. That's what we think of your husband, Mrs. Butterworth.
#MARY.
And it's what I think, so you needn't fancy that it's news to me. He's better sense than to go wasting time on a pack of crazy Radicals.
#MATTHEW.
Mary, fetch that candle back. I cannot see to weave properly with only one.
#OLD JOE.
Let your loom be, Matthew, and come here. We've need of you. Matthew. What's the to - do about?
#MARY.
They've come to trap you, Matthew.
#MATTHEW.
Trap me? They'll be wide awake.
#MARY.
Don't listen to them, Matt. They're Radicals. Joe We're Reformers. You know us, Matthew.
#MATTHEW.
Aye, I know you. You, Martin! You become a Radical?
#MARTIN.
Empty bellies make Radicals, Mr. Butterworth. Empty bellies and the Corn Tax and bread at thirteenpence the quartern loaf.
#MATTHEW.
Empty bellies make fools then. I can hear you've picked up the Radical cant. What do you want with me?
#OLD JOE.
We've come to reason with you, Matthew.
#MARY.
Oh, if you're going to listen to them, I'll sit in yonder.
#MATTHEW.
Don't touch the loom, now. Well, what is it? I haven't time to spend on argument.
#HENRI.
Then give us your advice, Mr. Butterworth, your help.
#MATTHEW.
I'm not a politician.
#OLD JOE.
Maybe you're not. But you're a man. And you know how things are with us. They're different with you.
#MATTHEW.
And why?
#HENRI.
Because you're the favourite of Mr. Barlow.
#MATTHEW.
If you weren't an ignorant Frenchman you'd suffer for those words. I'm not a favourite. It isn't me. It's my work. There's never been a yard of faulty cloth made on my loom. It's good. It's the honest work of a man that takes a pride in making it good, not like your rotten machine - made muck that's turned out at the factory. That's why Mr. Barlow sends me yarn to weave. He gets his special price for the cloth I weave and he knows it pays to let me weave it. That's not making a favourite of me. It's business.
#OLD JOE.
It's making an exception of you, Matthew. You're working all the hours God sends, but you're drawing good money every week and you're living in comfort with your missus and your daughter both at home. My girls are in the factory and the wages of the lot of us don't keep the cold and hunger from our door.
#MATTHEW.
What else do you expect but distress when you've let them get machines to do the work of men? It's Arkwright's spinning frames and Watt's steam engines that take the bread from your mouths. It isn't Barlow's, nor Heppenstall's, nor Whitworth's over the hill, nor Mottershead's, nor any of the manufacturers. It's steel and iron that have got you down, and more fools you for letting them.
#HENRI.
You talk like one of us already.
#MATTHEW.
Aye? Only I'm not one of you.
#OLD JOE.
Is it our fault? We can't all weave like you. We're not all master craftsmen with looms of our own and no debts hanging round our necks. The machines are there. We can't get beyond it.
#HENRI.
We can break the machines.
#MATTHEW.
No violence. Violence never did anybody good.
#HENRI.
We did no good in France until we took the Bastille.
#MATTHEW.
And did that do any good? You're here, in exile, because your countrymen forgot the Bastille and welcomed Louis Bourbon back.
#OLD JOE.
I'm against violence myself till all else fails. That what we want of you, Matt. Help us to escape violence.
#MATT.
What help?
#OLD JOE.
Will you go to London?
#MATT.
London?
#OLD JOE.
Yes. They don't know there. They cannot know or else they wouldn't let things go on and let poor weavers starve. Eight shillings have I taken from the factory this week. Eight shillings and the loaf at thirteenpence! We want to tell the Government we're starving while the masters stink of brass. Wages must go higher or taxes lower. They must do something.
#MATTHEW.
Why should I go? I'm not a factory hand.
#HENRI.
That's why they'll listen to a word from you. We'll go too, some of us, but there's little use in that because we're known to be reformers. There are Government spies in every Democratic Club. You can hardly trust your nearest friend. The spies are everywhere.
#MATTHEW.
How do you make out they don't know about us, then?
#OLD JOE.
They can't. Even Parliament men aren't fiends from Hell.
#MATTHEW.
It's no good going to London. Think of the March of the Blanketeers.
#OLD JOE.
Think of it! Wasn't I one of them? One of the thousands who met on Ardwick Green, and the hundreds that met the Yeomanry at Stockport, and the tens that struggled through to Macclesfield?
#MATTHEW.
Yes. You got as far as Macclesfield. Do you think they'll let you get to London to tell them? Do you think they want to know? And if they do get there, and tell them, the manufacturers will be there first telling them another tale, and whose tale do you think they'll believe? Yours or theirs? Going to London's a fool's errand. They do know and they don't care. They're South, we're North, and what the eye doesn't see the heart doesn't grieve at. You made your beds, when you let Arkwright set up his machinery, and you've to lie on them.
#MARTIN.
God help the poor!
#HENRI.
God helps those that help themselves. I'll hear you weavers sing the Marseillaise before I die.
#OLD JOE.
You're against violence and you're against politics. What do you favour?
#MATTHEW.
I favour work and I favour my loom, and if you've said your say I'll be getting back to it.
#OLD JOE.
Aye, that's the old story. Work, and every man for himself and his hand against his neighbour, while the masters join to keep us down.
#MATTHEW.
I've something else to do than falling out with my bread and cheese. I'm not a politician, I'm a weaver, and I've not got time for two jobs. I'm not a Republican neither. I throw the shuttle and I don't throw stones.
#HENRI.
Coward. It is because you do not dare.
#MATTHEW.
It's well for you you're French and it's known you'd break if an Englishman touched you with his hand.
#OLD JOE.
It's well for you you're prosperous with your loom at home and your women at home and your daughter dressed like - - like she is. I'm grieved we've failed to move you, but you're better off than us, and it's the skill of your hands you have to thank for it. Machinery has played the very hangment with the rest of us. Good - night, Matt.
#MATTHEW.
Good - night, Joe Healey. Take your Republican with you. I've a word in season to say to young Martin Kelsall. Now, my lad, you came here to see me a week ago.
#MARTIN.
Yes, Mr. Butterworth.
#MATTHEW.
You said nowt about being a Radical then. Martin. I came on other business.
#MATTHEW.
And you said nowt about starving bellies. If you can't make brass enough to fill one belly, you'll be hard put to it to fill two.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
That's all over, father.
#MATTHEW.
Is it? Did he speak to you?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. I told him "no."
#MARTIN.
Have I no chance? chance of what? Of taking Ruth from here, where she's all a woman wants, and making her starve alongside of you and expecting her to go into the factory to help you to make a livelihood. My daughter's not for your sort, my lad.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I told him that.
#MARTIN.
Yes, you told me, but I haven't finished hoping yet.
#MATTHEW.
If you're hoping for a wife to work for you, you've come to the wrong shop this time.
#MARTIN.
You're a proud man, Mr. Butterworth, and, Ruth, you're proud and all. I'm just a weaver lad that loves you and 'ud work till I drop for you. And maybe you'll find out your mistake some day. Proud you may be and proud you are, but if you're not above taking a warning from me, you'll be careful where you walk o' nights. There's company that's dangerous for you.
#MATTHEW.
What's that?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Who cares what a man says when he's sent about his business?
#MATTHEW.
You're right there, lass. It's not for me to take notice of his words.
#MARTIN.
Then take notice of this, Ruth. I love you. I always shall. No matter what happens, I always shall. And I'm a patient man. I'm used to waiting.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You'll be more used to it if you're going to wait for me.
#MARTIN.
I'm going to wait.
#MATTHEW.
Good - night to you.
#MARTIN.
Good - night.
#MATTHEW.
I'll be getting back to my loom. I've wasted too much time to - night.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Martin! Martin, come back a minute.
#MARTIN.
You want me?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I want to speak to you before you go.
#MARTIN.
Ruth!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
No. Don't mistake me. I haven't changed my mind, but I want you to understand. Just now, you tried to warn me.
#MARTIN.
Yes? I warn you again. It isn't safe.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You mean Guy Barlow?
#MARTIN.
Yes, you know I mean Guy Barlow.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
That's what I wanted to be certain of. I wanted you to know that what I do is done with open eyes.
#MARTIN.
You're playing with fire.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It won't be me that's burnt. I've got my purpose clear and strong before me, Martin. It's you put this thing in my mind and I'm going through with it for your sake.
#MARTIN.
For my sake! A lot you care for me.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
That's neither here nor there.
#MARTIN.
No more than a month ago I'd have broken the jaw of any man that said you weren't my wench. We hadn't spoke it out to each other, but I thought it was that sure it didn't need the speaking. And then you changed and I found out what changed you. So I thought I'd save you if I could. I asked you, and you said "No." I asked your father and I got my answer to - night. And now, you'll go your way, the woman I love. God knows what's changed you, but -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Nothing has changed me, Martin.
#MARTIN.
Then marry me.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
No.
#MARTIN.
You don't love me.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I haven't said I did.
#MARTIN.
Yes, you have. Not in words, I grant you, but if looks mean anything you've told it me a hundred times. Do you think he'll marry you? He won't. Marriage is not what Guy Barlow wants. I could tell you tales -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You needn't. I'll make him marry me.
#MARTIN.
He didn't marry the others.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Had they my beauty?
#MARTIN.
Beauty! Yes, you're beautiful. By God, you are.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I've the gift of beauty, Martin, and I'm going to use it.
#MARTIN.
Because he's rich, and I'm poor.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
No, because he's powerful over others and I want power over him. When you and I have gone our walks and been together on the moors, did we talk of nothing but the stars? You told me dreams, dreams of all the things you'd do if some great god gave you the power. It's I shall have that power, Martin, and use it in the way you taught me. Your thoughts, your dreams - and my pretty face gives me the chance to take your dreams and make them live. That's what I'm going to do.
#MARTIN.
It's nothing but another dream.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It's real this time, Martin.
#MARTIN.
But we did talk of the stars sometimes, and of ourselves and -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
That was the dream. That was happiness.
#MARTIN.
Why shouldn't we be happy? It's a crime to throw yourself away on him for the sake of us.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
No, it's a crusade. I hope We shall be happy, but not together,
#MARTIN.
I shan't do it all in a day, even after he has married me, but I shall manage him in time, and all this misery shall cease. You do believe I shall, don't you, Martin? You do approve?
#MARTIN.
God give you strength.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I think He will. You understand now, Martin?
#MARTIN.
I understand. Ruth, are you sure?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I'm going through with it. Good - night, Martin.
#MARTIN.
Good - night, Ruth.
#MARY.
So you've come in. And where have you been?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Out.
#MARY.
You've a fancy for going out o' nights.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I suppose I'm old enough to please myself when I go out.
#MARY.
I suppose you think you are. Times are changed since I was young. I'd have got the rolling - pin at my head if I'd answered your grandmother back the way you answer me. I'd never any time for going out at nights. Too busy spinning.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Machines spin now.
#MARY.
And women and children watch the machines. But of course I mustn't say owt of that. Send you to the factory and I'd know where to put my hand on you. But no. What's good enough for others isn't good enough for you.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
They're fitted for the factory.
#MARY.
And what are you fitted for? Nowt, but to fancy yourself a fine lady. I know if I was your father, I'd have you working for the bread you eat and the clothes you wear, like every other girl about. But he's got his way and made an idler of you.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Perhaps he's right.
#MARY.
It's not my way of bringing up a girl.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Never mind, mother. I'll be surprising you one of these days.
#MARY.
Yes. You're always in the right. You're like your father. Got stiff neck with pride.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Maybe, I've cause for pride.
#MARY.
And maybe you haven't, and all, and if you have I've never seen cause for it.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You shall do very soon.
#MARY.
You're hiding something.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It won't be hidden long.
#MARY.
What is it now? Out with it, lass.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Not yet, mother. I'll tell you when there's anything to tell.
#EPHRAIM.
Is this Matt Butterworth's?
#MARY.
Surely, Mr. Barlow. Will you step inside?
#EPHRAIM.
It's what I came to do. That'll be Matt at his loom?
#MARY.
Yes. I'll bring him to you. Matt, here's the master.
#MATTHEW.
The master! Ephraim. Good evening, Matt.
#MATTHEW.
You'll sit down, won't you?
#EPHRAIM.
Thanks.
#MATTHEW.
And you too, Mr. Guy.
#GUY.
Thank you.
#MATT.
Well, I'm glad to see you here, and if so be as bread and cheese and ale are not beneath you, there's enough for all.
#EPHRAIM.
Well, thankee, Matt Butterworth -
#GUY.
No. It's business brings us here, not eating. My father has something to say to you.
#EPHRAIM.
Yes, I thought I'd come and tell you here instead of sending for you up to factory.
#MATTHEW.
It's as well you did come. You'd not have got me there by sending. I've never entered factory gate and never will.
#EPHRAIM.
You're a pig - headed old stick in - the - mud,
#MATT.
You won't move with the times.
#MATTHEW.
Not when the times move to factories.
#EPHRAIM.
Well, well, you're an obstinate fellow. What's wrong with factories?
#MATTHEW.
What isn't wrong? They're bits of hell spewed up on earth.
#GUY.
You'd better keep a civil tongue in your head.
#MATTHEW.
I'm talking to your father, Mr. Guy, and we've known each other long enough to speak what's in our minds. You're a young man and the young get used to changes quickly. You find machines a natural state of things. I'll tell you how things were before the factories came and progress got a hold over everything. I'd open yon door in a morning and I'd see children playing in the fields. Where are the children now? Driven into your factory at five in the morning pretty nigh as soon as they can walk and thrashed with a cane to keep the poor little devils awake when all the nature in them's crying out for sleep. I'd go into a neighbour's cottage and I'd see a loom with a warp on it and a weaver taking pride in his work. You've taken the work away from men and given it to machines. And the worst is the machines don't care. You send out miles of cloth for every inch we used to weave, and every yard you send as full of faults as an egg of meat. It's that you've done with your factories, young sir. You've broken the weaver's spirit and you've killed the joy he used to take in honest craftsmanship. It's quality that used to count and a man 'ud think shame to himself to produce a cloth that's full of weaving faults. There are no weavers now. They're servants of a steam engine.
#GUY.
I'm sorry it upsets you, Mr. Butterworth, but facts are too much for you. Hand looms are played out.
#MATTHEW.
Never, while good workmanship endures. If they want the best, they'll come to the handloom weaver for it.
#GUY.
Yes, but you see they don't want the best.
#MATTHEW.
They want designs that a man conceives in joy and executes with pride. They want a cloth that shows he's taken pride in making it, and knows it's his design and not a copy of another's.
#GUY.
We can sell a hundred pieces of the same design with as little trouble as your one.
#MATTHEW.
And which 'ull wear longest?
#GUY.
We don't want cloth to wear, we want it to sell.
#MATTHEW.
Mr. Guy, it's a hard thing to say of your father's son, but I've a fear you're a godless youth. What was it you wanted of me, Mr. Barlow?
#EPHRAIM.
You've made it rather hard to tell you that. I didn't know you thought so badly of the factories. Guy, I think, perhaps -
#GUY.
No. If you won't speak out, I will. We want you to come into the factory, Butterworth.
#MATTHEW.
I? In factory?
#GUY.
Yes.
#MATTHEW.
But -
#GUY.
You're the last man on our pay - sheets working out. We must have uniformity. We want you in.
#MATTHEW.
You want me, Mr. Guy. I can see who 'tis I have to thank for this. It's you that have brought the old master here to stand by while you say these things to me.
#GUY.
Well, as it happened, you're so far wrong that I'd no intention of coming in at all, only I was going home from a walk , and met him on his way here.
#MATTHEW.
Mr. Barlow, it isn't your wish that I -
#EPHRAIM.
Well, Matt, we've had complaints. Weavers nowadays are a grumbling, discontented lot, and -
#MATTHEW.
Aye. Power - loom weavers are, and have cause to be. Before you started factories folk could save. It was a saying here that every man in the valley owned his own house and the one next door to it.
#EPHRAIM.
They complain I make a favourite of you, and, as Guy says, we must have uniformity. It's just a point of discipline.
#MATTHEW.
Yes, I know what discipline means. Discipline means ringing them into your factory at five in the morning and out at seven in the evening, and uniformity means fifty looms in rows all tied to a steam engine and every loom weaving the same pattern.
#GUY.
Look here, Butterworth, you were working when we came in. Working at nine o'clock at night.
#MATTHEW.
Do I complain of that? Not me. I can please myself what hours I work. It's nowt to me what time the engine stops. My engine's here.
#GUY.
Yes, and because it is, you never let it rest. Come into the factory and you've finished at seven.
#MATTHEW.
I'm sent away at seven. I'm under orders. I'm my own master here, Mr. Guy, and have been all my life. If I want to work, I work, and if I want to play, I play, and there's nobody to stop me, whether it's tramping over the moors getting my mind choke full of the new designs that come to me when I'm walking through the green, resting my eyes, or whether it's a cock - fight and a bellyful of ale - and you've no need to look shocked neither, Mr. Barlow, for I've seen time afore you got meddling with machines when you went cock - fighting yourself, and you weren't too big in those days to drink with me, too. And now you're telling me to come and weave in factory.
#EPHRAIM.
Oh, nay, Matt, I'm not.
#MATTHEW.
Well, I don't know. You've stood there and heard him tell me I'm to come in.
#EPHRAIM.
But not as weaver, Matt.
#MATTHEW.
What then?
#EPHRAIM.
As overlooker, and not a man in Lancashire that's better fitted for it.
#MATTHEW.
Aye. That's no more than truth.
#EPHRAIM.
I'm not flattering. I'm a business man, and I'm choosing the best man for the job.
#MATTHEW.
And I'm refusing it, for I'm a business man and I've got a better job. I've an old loom in yonder and as long as she hangs together I'll go on weaving cloth as cloth should be woven, by the skilful hand of a man to designs of his own contriving. To hell with uniformity. There's beauty in a loom and nowt but beastly ugliness in a row of looms.
#GUY.
Where do you get your yarn from, Butter - worth?
#MATTHEW.
Why, from you.
#GUY.
And you've been selling your cloth to us?
#MATTHEW.
Yes.
#GUY.
We can take no more.
#MATTHEW.
You can't take my cloth, my beautiful cloth?
#EPHRAIM.
It's true, Matt. Good cloth means a good price and people won't pay it.
#MATTHEW.
It's your fault, then. That's what you've brought them to. You've spoilt them with your factory rubbish.
#GUY.
They want cheap cloth. We provide it. Yours is dear. We can't sell it.
#MATTHEW.
Then I'll sell my own. I'll find buyers.
#EPHRAIM.
It's no use, Matt. Take my word for it, there are no customers to - day for cloth like yours. What between paying the country's bill for licking Bonaparte and power looms for silk and linen there's no demand for cotton cloth of your quality.
#GUY.
And you'll get no more yarn from us.
#MATTHEW.
You're not the only ones.
#GUY.
Nor from others. We're going to make an end of the whole breed of hand - loom weavers.
#MATTHEW.
We'll not be ended easy.
#GUY.
We want you in the factories. The factories are hungering for the right men.
#MATTHEW.
And men are hungry because of the factories. Don't tell me my cloth won't sell. It's cloth that sells itself.
#EPHRAIM.
Don't you believe me, Matt?
#MATTHEW.
I don't believe you know what my cloth's like. Do you see it yourself up yonder?
#EPHRAIM.
Well - no.
#MATTHEW.
Then come in here and I'll show you. You'll not be telling me then there are no decent housewives left to buy a cloth like mine.
#GUY.
Oh, what's the good of wasting time on him?
#EPHRAIM.
Best humour him, Guy. Don't come. I'll get him round.
#GUY.
Psh! You're too soft with the old fool.
#EPHRAIM.
And you're too hard. Matt and I were friends before you were born.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I thought you'd gone. I heard no voices.
#GUY.
I schemed to get them into there. Do you think I'd go without a word with you?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
We've parted once to - night. What do you want with me?
#GUY.
I want everything except to part again. You witch, what have you done to me? I haven't a nerve but tingles for the touch of you. I'm all burnt up. The night's a tossing fever, and the day's a cruel nightmare till evening comes and brings me sight of you.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Don't touch me, please.
#GUY.
How long am I to hold myself in leash? It's more than flesh and blood can stand. My God, I wonder if you know how beautiful you are.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I have a mirror in my room.
#GUY.
I'm jealous of that mirror, Ruth. Jealous of a piece of glass because it sees you every day.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You've seen me every evening for a month.
#GUY.
And I'm no farther than when we began. You're hot and cold by turn. You lead me on and thrust me off. You play with me. To - night you said you wouldn't walk with me to - morrow.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And time I did. I've walked with you too much. A change of company is good.
#GUY.
Company? What company?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
My mother's. You say you're where you were when we begun. Perhaps you are. But I am not. It's no new thing for you to go your walks with a weaver's lass. But it's new for me to be the lass. Do you think there are no wagging tongues about?
#GUY.
It's news to me that you give heed to gossip. You're not going to talk about your reputation, are you?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
No. I shan't talk about it, Guy.
#GUY.
I thought you made of finer stuff.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Than those others you have walked with?
#GUY.
What's that to do with you?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Nothing, but that I find it good to know about them.
#GUY.
This is strange talk for a woman.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Folk always say I should have been a man.
#GUY.
Thank God, you're not. It's better to rule a man than be one, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Do I rule you?
#GUY.
You've made a slave of me. I'm at your feet.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You told the others that.
#GUY.
Had they your beauty?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Then I've the greater cause to guard it.
#GUY.
You haven't talked like this outside.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I'm inside now. This is my father's cottage.
#GUY.
You've been like this to - night. Perverse. As if you didn't know what passion meant. As if you laughed at me for being on fire for you. You've come half - way to meet me till to - night. You've answered love with love. You've been a fine free glory of a woman that it was heaven to be near and hell to be away from, that knew to be in love was to be upraised above the talk of fools and what a pair of lovers do is right because they do it for their love.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. What lovers do is right even if it's to renounce.
#GUY.
Renounce? What are you talking about?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I was thinking of a pair of lovers that I know.
#GUY.
Then stop thinking of them. Think of us.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I'm thinking of myself.
#GUY.
You're in a curious mood to - night.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
To - night I'm being prudent.
#GUY.
Prudent! Love isn't prudent. Prudence was made for cowards, not for lovers. Ruth, you're not a coward.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I think that what I'm doing now is the bravest thing I ever did. What do you make of it all?
#GUY.
I think you're a mischievous tease, and -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I'm quite in earnest. I was in earnest when I let you talk to me of love and still in earnest when I told you I could walk with you no more.
#GUY.
Ruth! You didn't mean it?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I meant it all. Did you?
#GUY.
Did I?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
About your love.
#GUY.
Why should you doubt me, Ruth?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I'll tell you. Because in all your talk of love, you have used a lot of words, but there is one word that you haven't spoken yet, and that I'd like to hear before I go my walks with you again.
#GUY.
What word?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Marriage.
#GUY.
Marriage! Well, isn't it early days for that?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
With some men and some women it would be over early. When you're the man and I the woman, it isn't early.
#GUY.
Marriage! There's a directness about you.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, there is.
#GUY.
I'm taken by surprise, but -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Are you?
#GUY.
I've been too busy simply loving you to think of marriage. Yes, Ruth, of course we're going to be married. It would be monstrous in me ever to have intended anything else. But - er - you know, there's my father. We shall have to keep the marriage secret. Just the clergyman and no witnesses to make quite sure of secrecy.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Good - bye, Mr. Barlow.
#GUY.
Ruth!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Good - bye. Yes. Look at me well. It's your last look at close quarters.
#GUY.
No, by Heaven, it's not.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You've told me much about my beauty. You hold my beauty cheap.
#GUY.
Your beauty is the richest, finest thing in all the world. secret marriage!
#GUY.
What's changed you, Ruth? You've shown yourself to me a soft and yielding woman. To - night, you're hard, suspicious.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
To - night, I mean to strike a bargain with you.
#GUY.
Lovers don't talk of bargains.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
There's always time to talk of love. To - night, we'll talk of marriage, if you please.
#GUY.
You mean to be wilful.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I mean that if you want me there's a price to pay, and a secret marriage by a puppet priest with no witnesses is too low a price for me.
#GUY.
You thought that!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Wasn't I right? How badly do you want me, Mr. Guy Barlow? You see me, and you know the price.
#GUY.
You didn't talk this way outside. You've made it all so ugly. You've taken all romance away.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Romance is safe for men. It's dangerous for women. You tell me I was soft and yielding. What if I'd been too soft, and yielded further than I should? You'd still have life, and life would still be beautiful for you and you'd be looking for another woman with a pretty face to make love beautifully with you. But I'd be dead. I should have killed myself and you'd forget me in a little while.
#GUY.
Ruth, stop! I'm not a black - guard.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I'm hoping not, if I'm to be your wife.
#GUY.
I never meant you harm. I simply didn't think.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You thought fast enough of a secret marriage. You remembered to be prudent, and prudence, as I think you said, is made for cowards, not for lovers. Are you a coward, Mr. Guy?
#GUY.
I'm a lover, Ruth. Will you be my wife?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes.
#GUY.
I've got you now.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. For better or for worse, you've got me now.
#GUY.
For better than the best. I never knew till I met you what love could do to a man. Ruth, you won't remember what you fancied that I thought to - night? You won't have that against me? It really wasn't so.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I have only room for one thought now. I remember that you're going to marry me.
#GUY.
In a precious few days, you'll remember that I have married you. I'm not cut out for waiting.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I shall not keep you waiting.
#EPHRAIM.
Well, that's settled now, Matt.
#MATTHEW.
Yes, it's settled. I'll be at factory come five to - morrow morning.
#GUY.
That's good.
#MATTHEW.
Is it? I'll tell you this much, Mr. Barlow, it's a bad night's work you've done.
#GUY.
If you're talking to me, it's the best night's work I've ever done.
#MATTHEW.
I was talking to your father.
#EPHRAIM.
Well, well, we must agree to differ.
#MATTHEW.
And it won't be the last of our differences, neither. It's my punishment, this is. I've been a proud man and I'm humbled. Some weaver lads come here this very night asking me to join in with them.
#EPHRAIM.
Join? In what?
#MATTHEW.
Ah, well, I'll leave you to guess in what. I sent them off with a good big flea in their ear: told them a hand - loom weaver had nowt to do with their sort. I've everything to do with their sort now. I'm one of them, and if they have owt to say, or do against you and your ways, I'll say and do it with them. You've made a Radical to - night.
#EPHRAIM.
Now, Matt, don't try to threaten me. We've met as friends too often in the days gone by for that.
#MATTHEW.
Yes, before you started getting up in the world by climbing on other men's shoulders.
#EPHRAIM.
And if you'll let me, we'll go on being friends.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Of course you will. Now more than ever.
#MATTHEW.
You don't know what you're talking about, lass.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Tell them, Guy.
#EPHRAIM.
Guy?
#GUY.
Mr. Butterworth, you and my father must be friends, because I'm going to marry Ruth.
#MATTHEW.
What's that?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, father, it's true.
#MATTHEW.
Here, Mary! Mary, where are you? Here's our Ruth going to wed the young master. What do you say to that?
#MARY.
I say the young master's doing well for himself.
#EPHRAIM.
Nobody asks what I think.
#GUY.
That'll be all right, father.
#EPHRAIM.
Will it?
#GUY.
Oh, I'll tell you about it walking home. You've Mr. Butterworth's hand to shake.
#EPHRAIM.
It just depends if he's still a Radical.
#MATTHEW.
Me? I'm a maze. I don't know what I am.
#EPHRAIM.
I'll chance it then. Good night, Matt. Good night.
#GUY.
To - morrow, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, Guy, to - morrow.
#MARY.
Well, lass, you said you'd surprise us. You have and all. Biggest surprise I ever had. Wedding the young master. Something like a match now this is.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Don't, mother. I'm so ashamed.
#MARY.
Ashamed? Where's the shame in getting wed? We all come to it.
#MATTHEW.
And you've come to it rare and well. And me thinking in yonder while Mr. Barlow talked to me I'd have small cause now to send young Kelsall off, for I'm a factory hand myself the same as he.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Poor Martin Kelsall.
#MATTHEW.
Aye, poor he is and rich you're going to be. You've little need to think of Kelsall now.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
No. I mustn't think of Martin now. I'm doing what I meant to do. I've got Guy Barlow.
#MARY.
Ruth, there'll be a lot of sewing to be done.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Why?
#MARY.
Why? The girl's a - dream. Against your wedding to be sure. What else are you thinking of?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It's not my wedding that I'm thinking of. It's afterwards. Well, I've begun. I'm going to see it through.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Well, mother.
#MARY.
You're warm in here.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
We need to be.
#MARY.
It's bitter cold to - night. Reading, were you? Well, one way of idling's as bad as another and reading never did anybody good that ever I heard of. That's what your father's always doing with his spare time now. Tom Paine's Rights of Man and The Age of Reason. Stuffing his old head with all manner of new - fangled politics.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But this isn't politics, mother. It's poetry. The Corsair. Lord Byron's poem.
#MARY.
I've heard of him and nothing good neither.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Nothing good! Why, mother, he - lot of things, I dare say. Well, I've gone for fifty years without the power of reading and I reckon I'll go through without it to the end. I've no time to be idle.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I've no time to be anything else.
#MARY.
You've taken to being a lady like a duck to water. Lazybones is the name I'd give you if you were still Ruth Butterworth, but I suppose this vain life is right for Mrs. Guy Barlow.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It isn't right. Idleness is never right, and least of all for me, because I know my idleness is paid for by the toil of others. Something has changed me, mother. I can't think of the past. I've forgotten what I was and what I used to think. I had ideals then, when I was poor. I'd noble thoughts of my own. The only thoughts I have to - day are thoughts of other's thinking. You're right, I'm lazy. Bone lazy, and I like it. I like fine clothes and soft living and hands that aren't work - roughened.
#MARY.
Small blame to you for that. I'd do the same myself.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I'm getting fat. I'm like a pig. I never want to go out. The house is soft and warm and comfortable, and the sights I see outside are hard and cold and comfortless.
#MARY.
You may well say that. Things go from bad to worse, With wages down and food up it's near impossible to make ends meet. And that's for us, with your father an overlooker. What it is for the weavers, I don't know. There's empty hearths and empty bellies this winter time.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I know. I know and I don't care. I used to care. Something's gone dead inside me, killed by the comfort and the ease and the good living and all the things I used to hate and despise until I had them for my own.
#MARY.
Eh, don't you worry! When a lass has got a good husband same as you have it's little room she has in her mind for thoughts of other things.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
That's my punishment. Guy's good to me. Mother, I'll tell you something. I love my husband.
#MARY.
Well, don't tell me that as if it was news to me. What did you marry him for if you didn't love him?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I married him to use him for an instrument. And I don't care now for the things I cared for then. I only care for Guy, and what Guy does is right because he does it.
#MARY.
Well, I never let your father come over me like that. But there's many wives do think that road of their husbands, especially young wives. I'm a bit surprised at you being one of them for all that, Ruth. You'd always a will of your own.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
My will's asleep.
#MARY.
Don't let it waken up too sudden.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
No fear of that. I eat too much.
#MARY.
There's a - many eat too little, Ruth. There was one you used to know came in to us the other night. He'd been short of food for weeks and looked it too, poor lad. friend of mine? What friend?
#MARY.
Martin Kelsall, if you want to know. There was him and others. Friends of the People they call themselves, and your father's joined them now. I never heard such talk in my life. Proper wild it was. Drilling on the moors, and knocking out the engine boiler plugs and breaking the machinery and I don't know what.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And father, too?
#MARY.
As savage as the worst of them, the silly old man. Got to threats before they'd done.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Threats?
#MARY.
Against your Guy. It's him they're bitterest against.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
What's Guy done?
#MARY.
You'd think there was nothing he hadn't done. You'd better tell him to be careful about going out at night. They've guns amongst them.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guns!
#MARY.
Oh, don't be frightened, lass. They won't do owt. Men like to talk. I don't take any notice of them. If they said less I'd fear them more.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Has Martin Kelsall got a gun?
#MARY.
Him! It's bread he wants, not a gun. Gave me a message for you, Martin did. message?
#MARY.
"Tell her to remember me," he says.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I understand. What must he think of me?
#MARY.
What right has he to think of you at all? Impudence I call it.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He has the right to think me traitor. I'm a renegade. I'm -
#MARY.
You're Mrs. Guy Barlow, my lass, and don't you forget it and start thinking of a famished weaver chap without a shirt to his back or a mouthful of bread for his belly.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Is it as bad as that?
#MARY.
It's hard times, Ruth, harder every day.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
The men must be desperate.
#MARY.
They talk as if they were. But what's talking? They talked before you wed. They're talking still and I tell you things are worse.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
What's made them worse?
#MARY.
They say Guy has. RutH. But how?
#MARY.
You'd better ask him. Don't you talk to him of the factory?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
No. I tried to do at first, but he stopped me, and I thought I'd bide my time.
#MARY.
You've a lot more sense than I ever gave you credit for.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Then I fell in love with Guy and I haven't cared for anything since that.
#MARY.
I don't suppose you'd do a scrap of good. Well, that's how it is. A terrible lot of barking, but not a bite amongst the lot of them.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But there is danger there, danger to Guy.
#MARY.
I tell you they, don't mean it.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Perhaps all don't. But one man might, and one would be enough. One man can press a trigger.
#MARY.
There now! I've upset you.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Never mind that. You're sure that's all!
#MARY.
All what?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
All Martin said.
#MARY.
You've got that fellow on the brain. No. 'Twasn't all, then. He wants to meet you.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Tell him I will.
#MARY.
I'll tell him no such thing, and you a married woman.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You'll tell him I will see him. Not here, though. He mustn't come here.
#MARY.
And I'll not have my house put to such a use. So that settles it.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
There is an old quarry on the moors. Martin knows. It's where the stone was quarried when they built the factory. I'll meet him there to - morrow night at eight. Will you tell him that, or must I write?
#MARY.
Can Martin read?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I'm not sure. Tell him, mother.
#MARY.
It isn't right, but -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You will. I'm doing this for Guy. You've stirred me from my sleep at last. To - morrow night at eight. Mary. Well, I'll tell him.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
That's right. There's Guy's step now.
#MARY.
Then I'll be going. God bless you, lass.
#GUY.
Good evening.
#MARY.
I was just going, sir.
#GUY.
Oh, don't hurry away. You'll find it cold outside.
#MARY.
I must go sharp. If you're here it means factory's loosed and Matt'll be at home looking for his supper. Good night, sir.
#GUY.
Well, little wife, how goes it?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy, I want to talk to you.
#GUY.
The sound of your voice is the sweetest thing on earth. I'm all attention.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
This is serious, Guy. I've tried before to talk to you about the factory. You stopped me then.
#GUY.
Of course I did. I won't have you worrying your pretty head about the factory. Besides, think of your long - suffering husband. Don't you think I get all the business I can stand across the way there? I want a change at home. Sit down and tell me what you think of The Corsair.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
No. You must listen to me, Guy. I won't be put off this time.
#GUY.
Oh, well, if I'm in for it, I'm in for it. What's it all about?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You saw mother here. She's been telling me things.
#GUY.
Really, Ruth, you can't expect me to take any notice of your mother's old wives' tales.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You needn't notice them. But when I'm told you're in danger, I notice them.
#GUY.
Danger? What of?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
What have you been doing in the factory?
#GUY.
Leave that alone. That's my affair.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And it's my affair if they murder you.
#GUY.
Oh! So they've got to talking about murder have they? I'll teach them.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy, you must be careful. For my sake.
#GUY.
I shall look after myself, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But what have you done to them? I know that since you married me you've had more power, and your father's done less than he used to. It's something you've done that's upset the weavers.
#GUY.
I found it necessary to make economies and they don't like it.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Economies I You mean you've cut their wages down?
#GUY.
That's it. RutH. And they were so pitifully low. They'd hardly enough for bread before.
#GUY.
I don't fix the price of bread. It's no use discussing it with you. You can't understand.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I'm not thinking of them. At one time I should have done. That's over now. To - day I only think of you. And you're in danger. I know it. I know it.
#GUY.
Nothing's going to happen to me. I've a rough idea of what they think of me. I've taken my precautions.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
No precautions are proof against desperate men.
#GUY.
Then if nothing's any good, why worry?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Something would be good. Raise their wages.
#GUY.
That's impossible. I've told you to drop discussing it.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Why is it impossible? They'd more before you reduced them and you didn't starve.
#GUY.
No. But I wasn't building another factory then. I want every penny I can screw to - day.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Another factory!
#GUY.
Yes. I mean to have another. One was good enough for my father, but it isn't good enough for me. What was enterprising ten years ago isn't enterprising to - day. Machinery's improved since then.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Then you're quite sure factories are right?
#GUY.
I'm quite sure they're money - makers.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But money isn't all.
#GUY.
I keep on telling you not to discuss it. With your upbringing and your father's views, we're bound to differ, so for Heaven's sake talk about Byron, or anything under the sun but factories.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I'm talking about your danger. You won't believe me.
#GUY.
You won't believe me when I say there is no danger because I'm prepared to meet anything.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Including bullets? Do you wear a coat of mail?
#GUY.
That's the worst of reading The Corsair. Put this cock - and - bull story of your mother's on the top of The Corsair and you're ready to imagine anything. We're in England now.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
So is Nottingham.
#GUY.
This is Lancashire. We don't have Luddites here.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
We have plug riots. I've read it in the newspaper.
#GUY.
Women shouldn't read newspapers. It's all right, Ruth. Our fellows won't get out of hand.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You're driving them to desperation, Guy. I know the other side. I've seen. Guy, won't you have mercy on them?
#GUY.
I'll have another factory out of them.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Have mercy on yourself and me. I'm so happy here. You've made me love you till I would cut off my hand to save you from a scratch upon your little finger. I shan't know peace again whenever you're away.
#GUY.
Upon my word, Ruth, it's too bad of your mother. She ought to keep away, and not come here disturbing you with wild tales that haven't a spark of truth in them.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Are they wild tales?
#GUY.
They're wild as wind.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But you said you'd taken precautions. If there's no truth, why take precautions?
#GUY.
I said anything to comfort you. Are you satisfied now?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I'm silenced.
#GUY.
That's good enough.
#EPHRAIM.
Come in here, Heppenstall. Ah! you've met my son's wife?
#JOHN GALE.
Good evening, MRS. Guy. Good evening.
#GUY.
Good evening, Mr. Heppenstall. Ruth, my dear, Mr. Heppenstall has called on a matter of business.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, mayn't I stay and listen? I'll be as quiet as a mouse.
#EPHRAIM.
Never knew anybody like this lass of Guy's, HEPPENSTALL. She's interested in all manner of affairs. You promise to be quiet?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, yes, yes.
#GUY.
No. Ruth's more interested in Byron than anything else. You can't read him here with us talking all the time.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You want me to go?
#GUY.
Please.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes Guy.
#GUY.
That's better. Women are sentimental, and we've to talk business. Won't you sit, Mr. Heppenstall?
#JOHN GALE.
Thank you, Mr. Guy, I will.
#EPHRAIM.
Now, Heppenstall, I'll tell you what it's all about.
#JOHN GALE.
I'm waiting to hear.
#EPHRAIM.
You and I are rival manufacturers, but that's no reason why we shouldn't put our legs under the same table when we find the times difficult. I suppose there's no denying, they are difficult?
#JOHN GALE.
They're more than difficult.
#EPHRAIM.
Then we agree so far. What threatens us threatens you. In fact, our interests are identical.
#JOHN GALE.
Not quite, I think.
#EPHRAIM.
Eh? Well, no. What's mine isn't thine. We've each to make a profit for ourselves. But we get the profit out of weaving, and your weavers are fractious; so are ours.
#JOHN GALE.
But mine aren't - or not to anything like the extent yours are.
#EPHRAIM.
I'm told the grumbling is universal.
#JOHN GALE.
It's general up to a point, but there's a dead set at you.
#EPHRAIM.
At me?
#JOHN GALE.
Well, no, not at you, Barlow. It's this young gentleman who's the mischief - maker.
#GUY.
The mischief - maker, Mr. Heppenstall?
#JOHN GALE.
You reduced wages. You put down fresh machinery, and got rid of men and -
#GUY.
And you've done the same.
#JOHN GALE.
I had to follow suit or see you take my trade away. I didn't want to do it. I believe in treating men as men.
#GUY.
I believe in treating men as servants of the machines. It's all they are.
#JOHN GALE.
No. By your leave, young gentleman, it is not all they are. They're flesh and blood. And I'm surprised, Barlow, at your allowing your men to be reduced.
#GUY.
The men can live on what they're paid.
#JOHN GALE.
They can't.
#GUY.
They do. I'm getting applications every day from men who want to be taken on.
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, so am I. And why? Because the steam power's taken away their living and half a living's better than none to a starving man. You ought to be ashamed of yourself to take advantage of them.
#EPHRAIM.
Well, Heppenstall, it's -
#GUY.
I'm responsible, Mr. Heppenstall. If you've anything to say about the management of Barlow's, say it to me. My father's virtually retired.
#EPHRAIM.
Have I? I'm not dead yet, my lad. I've given you a lot of rope, but be careful or you'll hang yourself.
#JOHN GALE.
That's better, BARLOW. I mislike seeing you knuckle under to a boy. Now, look here, I had to follow your lead when you reduced. Will you follow mine if I put them up again to what they were three months ago?
#GUY.
And let the weavers fancy we're afraid of them?
#JOHN GALE.
I'm not afraid of them. I'm sorry for them.
#GUY.
They know better. Once give in, and they're the masters. Show them they've only to ask and threaten to get what they ask and they'll ask for more. They'll not stop at the old level.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, we can't go beyond the old figure.
#GUY.
No. But you'll have to if once you start putting wages on the basis of a benevolent Charity. I'm in business to buy cheap and sell dear. I want my labour as cheap as I can get it and, by God, I'll get it cheap.
#EPHRAIM.
Are you the head of Barlow's or am I?
#GUY.
Oh, you are, I suppose.
#EPHRAIM.
Then you'd better not forget it or I'll turn you out of the room and finish this talk with Heppenstall alone.
#GUY.
Oh, my God, these old men!
#EPHRAIM.
I agree to that. I'll raise them on condition you do the same.
#GUY.
I object.
#EPHRAIM.
Your objection is overruled.
#GUY.
I'm your partner.
#EPHRAIM.
I am the head of Barlow's and -
#GUY.
The old wages won't satisfy the weavers. They grumbled then. But the point for Mr. Heppenstall is this. It may have hurt his tender heart, but when we reduced, he did the same, and he needn't cant about it now, for actions speak louder than words. The thing is that he acts with us, and we manufacturers can present a solid front and -
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, but you set the bad example. I'm a business man and I had to follow or you'd have cut me out with my customers. But as a humane man, I protest, sir.
#GUY.
Because you look at the men. I look at the system. The system's magnificent, and if the factory system demands sacrifices, I shall sacrifice men without scruple.
#JOHN GALE.
Will you sacrifice yourself?
#GUY.
I do sacrifice myself. I've sacrificed my personal security. I risk my life every day and I value my life, Mr. Heppenstall. I value it so much that I've taken protective measures at the factory. I've a few stout fellows there - an odd prizefighter or two, an old soldier from the French wars, nominally as watchmen, but they're men who can use their fists and handle a gun too if the worst comes.
#JOHN GALE.
Ah! You've a pretty good idea of looking after yourself.
#GUY.
It isn't for my own sake.
#JOHN GALE.
No?
#GUY.
Oh, I've a life I'd like to live. I've a wife and I'm young and so on - but that doesn't matter. My value is as a factory owner.
#EPHRAIM.
Owner?
#GUY.
Manager, then. I believe in the system, I'm here to spread that system, to cover Lancashire with factories and make the county manufacturing centre of the world. That is my dream, sir, the dream of cheap production, and the triumph of machinery.
#JOHN GALE.
You're talking very big, young man. It takes me all my time to run one factory.
#GUY.
I know I'm talking big. I'm seeing big, bigger than will come in your lifetime or in mine. This thing's at the beginning. It's not secure yet, but I mean to do my part to set it firmly on its legs before I die.
#JOHN GALE.
There's nothing wonderful in bigness. A thousand factories are no more wonderful than one.
#GUY.
Oh, you've no vision.
#JOHN GALE.
And maybe you've too much. The future isn't here. The present and those weavers are. And they trouble me.
#GUY.
They trouble me until they've learnt who's master. After that, there'll be no trouble.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy! The men. Don't you hear them?
#GUY.
Men! Where?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
They're in the hall.
#HENRI.
No, Madame Barlow, we are no longer in the hall. We are here.
#EPHRAIM.
What's the meaning of this?
#OLD JOE.
Meaning, Mr. Barlow? The meaning is, you'll either listen to us here and now or you'll have your factory fired. You can take your choice.
#GUY.
Fire then, and be damned to you.
#OLD JOE.
Is that your answer, Mr. Barlow?
#EPHRAIM.
No. Come here and be quiet, Guy. Who am I speaking to?
#MATTHEW.
You know us, Mr. Barlow.
#EPHRAIM.
You're in bad company, Matt.
#MATTHEW.
I told you how 'twould be if you forced me into factory.
#EPHRAIM.
Are you the spokesman? I suppose there's a ringleader. Who is he?
#HENRI.
We are all leaders.
#GUY.
, I've heard of armies that were all generals and no privates.
#MARTIN.
If you mean by leader who it is that's - kept back the riot -
#JOHN GALE.
Riot?
#MARTIN.
There are hundreds round your factories tonight. They're waiting there, waiting for us. I'm leader enough to hold them back until we get your answer. Take care lest I lead them in a different fashion on another night.
#GUY.
Mutiny, eh?
#MARTIN.
Oh, names don't matter, Mr. Guy. We could call you names, and true ones, if we liked.
#EPHRAIM.
So you're their leader, Martin Kelsall?
#MARTIN.
At your service, Mr. Barlow.
#EPHRAIM.
I have my doubts of that. Well now, we'll just sit down and talk this over quietly.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Father, you amongst the rioters!
#MATTHEW.
We're here as peaceful delegates.
#GUY.
With threats of fire and murder on your tongue.
#JOHN GALE.
What's it all about? Never mind who they are. What do they want?
#HENRI.
More wages.
#OLD JOE.
Less machinery.
#MARTIN.
Close the factories.
#MATTHEW.
And whatever you do, give a fellow - creature a chance of living, MR. Barlow.
#EPHRAIM.
Will one of you speak for all? What are your complaints?
#MARTIN.
I'll speak, Mr. Barlow. We complain of starvation, of being driven into your factories and -
#EPHRAIM.
Stop there. We drive nobody. There's no compulsion to enter our factories.
#MARTIN.
There's the compulsion of need. You won't have hand - looms and you've forced us into factories. You've got us there and we've been helpless before you. We've to work your hours and take your pay, and the pay's not fit to keep a dog alive. We're tired of factories. We want to live.
#GUY.
Listen to me, men. Everything must have a beginning. A great system is springing into birth. It isn't perfect yet -
#MARTIN.
Perfect! It's -
#GUY.
You are suffering the lean years. The fat ones are coming.
#MARTIN.
We've heard all that before. You put it down to the war, not to the machines that time.
#GUY.
Even England can't recover in a moment from a war like this one.
#MARTIN.
It was all the war last time we made complaint and when the war was over you promised us fat times, and all of us were going to go hell for leather for prosperity.
#GUY.
Just wait a bit. Think what a great thing this system is. We're going to make calico for the whole world. We've all a share in it.
#HENRI.
You get your share and ours as well.
#GUY.
Do try to follow me. The cotton comes to us from the sun - kissed fields of far America, grown there by planters descended from men of our own blood and -
#MARTIN.
The cotton's grown by slaves.
#GUY.
That's not my business.
#MATTHEW.
No. Your business is to make slaves of us here.
#GUY.
I'll tell you something, Mr. Butterworth. It's this, and it's from a book you know. "Where there is no vision, the people perish."
#MATTHEW.
I don't know about the vision, but I'm sure about the perishing. And I know where we'll go when we've finished perishing. When one of us gets up to the Golden Gate, Peter 'ull ask him what he was and he'll say a weaver, and Peter 'ull ask him no more questions. He'll just open the gate quick and say, "Poor devil, get into heaven, you've had your bellyful of hell on earth."
#GUY.
You'll have prosperity on earth.
#MARTIN.
Aye. So you've said before.
#GUY.
You complain of the machines. You say they've turned men away.
#OLD JOE.
Aye.
#GUY.
Those men will soon find work.
#MARTIN.
Where?
#GUY.
I'm going to build another factory.
#MARTIN.
By God, you're not.
#MATTHEW.
Another! Isn't one hell on earth enough for you?
#GUY.
Patience, patience! I'm trying to explain.
#MARTIN.
We've no time for patience. We're famishing. And you'll build no other factory. You'll change your tune or you'll lose the one you've got. Building new factories is no use to us. We're not builders. We're weavers.
#EPHRAIM.
Hold your tongue, Guy. I'll tackle this.
#MATTHEW.
We'll hear the old master.
#EPHRAIM.
Now, my lads, the factory's there, and it's going to stop there.
#HENRI.
Don't be too sure of it.
#EPHRAIM.
Burn it and we build another. And while it's building you'll have time to think and clear heads to think with, for you'll draw no wages in the meantime. I'm still waiting to know why you're here.
#MATTHEW.
If you'd not reduced wages, maybe we'd not be here.
#EPHRAIM.
That's it, is it?
#OLD JOE.
Yes, that's it.
#EPHRAIM.
Will it make you happy if I put the wages up again?
#MARTIN.
It won't make us happy. There's been no happy weavers since machines came in.
#JOHN GALE.
Is that what you want? Wages back at the old level?
#MARTIN.
No. We want more. The old level isn't good enough. Eight shillings a week won't keep a man, let alone a man's family.
#EPHRAIM.
We give your families work. You men aren't the only wage - earners. Even your children can come to us and be paid. We not only keep them away from mischief at home, but we pay them for it. You can take that answer back. We want willing workers and if you'll go away and be satisfied with the old wages, we'll try to pay them, though it's little less than ruin for the manufacturers.
#MARTIN.
This looks a ruined house, and you look badly fed and all with your wine, and your servants, and your money to build another factory. To hell with your eight shillings! We want ten.
#JOHN GALE.
And we want cent, per cent, profits, my man, only we don't get them.
#EPHRAIM.
This is no time for jesting, Kelsall.
#MARTIN.
I wasn't jesting. Ten shillings a week is what we want.
#EPHRAIM.
Ten is out of the question.
#MATTHEW.
I've made double ten with my old hand - loom. Where's the good of factories to us if that's what they bring us to?
#JOHN GALE.
Ha! Very good. I didn't know you drew.
#GUY.
I've had practice lately. Drawing plans for my new factory.
#EPHRAIM.
Pssh! Well, that's what you're here for, is it? Ten shillings.
#MARTIN.
Yes.
#EPHRAIM.
We offer eight.
#MARTIN.
Then I warn you there'll be consequences.
#GUY.
We're ready for your consequences.
#EPHRAIM.
Guy, I've told you to hold your tongue. We've made a big concession, Kelsall. Martin. You'll make a bigger if you want us satisfied. John. We do want you satisfied. We want this valley peaceful and contented.
#MARTIN.
Then you know what to do.
#EPHRAIM.
Suppose we talk it over and give you an answer to - morrow?
#OLD JOE.
We've come here for an answer to - night, Mr. Barlow.
#EPHRAIM.
Very well. Stay here and we'll come back with an answer. Come into the other room, Mr. Heppenstall. Come, Guy.
#GUY.
Do you want your silver stolen?
#EPHRAIM.
Guy, I'd trust Matt Butterworth with everything I own.
#GUY.
And the others?
#EPHRAIM.
Matt will be there.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Father, what are you doing with these men? Matthew. Mind your own business, my lass.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I am minding it. I'm minding Guy. If anything happens to Guy, I shall hold you responsible. Matthew. Guy has the remedy in his own hands. Ruth. The remedy's in your hands. You have influence with the men. See how they wanted you on their side. They came to you at home before I married. They'll listen to you.
#MATTHEW.
I've no great influence, Ruth. I'm one of the crowd. Martin Kelsall's the man they listen to.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. I'm going to talk to Martin. But not here. I sent him a message to - night. Can you do nothing, father?
#MATTHEW.
I can do nothing but what's right.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Violence is never right.
#MATTHEW.
Oh, yes, it is. Often. I've counselled peace, but there's a time for war, and if the time comes, old as I am, I'll do my share.
#OLD JOE.
Look here, Butter - worth. See that? He drew it. Guy Barlow drew that. That's what he thinks of us.
#MATTHEW.
A drawing?
#OLD JOE.
That's me.
#MATTHEW.
Nay, never.
#OLD JOE.
I pin my waistcoat up that road 'cause all the world don't need to know I haven't got a shirt.
#MATTHEW.
Yes. He's spotted that right enough.
#MARTIN.
And that scarecrow's meant for me.
#MATTHEW.
Well, he's a clever drawer, Mr. Guy.
#HENRI.
What is that writing, Matt? You can read.
#MATTHEW.
Yes, I can read.
#OLD JOE.
What is it?
#MATTHEW.
Something cruel, Joe. It's under your picture.
#OLD JOE.
I can see that.
#MARTIN.
Out with it Matt.
#MATTHEW.
No need to cry aloud the shame of what a young man does in his pride.
#HENRI.
You think to shield him because he is your son - in - law. You are a traitor, Butterworth.
#OLD JOE.
Best read it, Matt. We'll get it done outside, in any ease.
#MATTHEW.
It isn't much. He's wrote "No shirt but dirt" below you.
#OLD JOE.
Dirt! If I'm dirty who's fault is that but his? I don't like dirt. I'd like to be clean like him. How can a man wash properly when his belly's crying out for bread and they've put the tax on soap? I'd like a shirt. I'm weaving yards and yards of Barlow's cloth and I haven't got a shirt.
#MATTHEW.
It's wrong to make a jest of starving men. We've come to ask for fire for our hearths and clothes to cover our nakedness, and food for the children. We don't want fine raiment nor grand houses, nor wine like that. The simple things are good enough for us, and we come here to ask the masters for them, and all we get is a mocking picture and a cruel jest, and I'm sick and sorry that the son of Mr. Barlow and the husband of my lass should be the one that's done it. We're asking for the right to live, and all we get is contumely and shame.
#MARTIN.
That's brought you round at last. We'll have no more peace - preaching from you. You know now what they think of us. We're dogs and worse than dogs. Well, dogs can bite.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Martin!
#MARTIN.
I've no word for you. You've gone wrong. Let's clear away. No need to wait. We've got their answer here in this. To - morrow night we'll meet up on the moors and march down on the factory.
#HENRI.
I said I'd hear you frozen English sing the Marseillaise.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
The moors!
#MATTHEW.
It's not a lawful thing to meet like that. Joe. Lawful! Who cares for the laws of London here? I'd take the Luddites' oath to - night, and that's an oath no man can dare to break.
#MARTIN.
Swear by your vacant concave belly, man. You'll find no stronger oath than that.
#MATTHEW.
They'll have the law of you.
#MARTIN.
The law doesn't care for us. The law lets us starve. We've finished with palaver now. We've got to do.
#EPHRAIM.
Where are you going?
#MARTIN.
We're tired of waiting.
#EPHRAIM.
Come, come! We had to consider our answer.
#OLD JOE.
Well, have you got your answer?
#EPHRAIM.
Yes. Go back to your fellows and tell them this: We will raise wages to the old figure -
#MARTIN.
We've refused that.
#EPHRAIM.
Let me finish, my man. And as to a further increase, when you've tried how you go on and we've all of us thought it over and feel a little calmer than we do now, well, we'll see if we can't do something more for you.
#HENRI.
You will see now if you mean to see at all.
#EPHRAIM.
That's my last word, men. You've got a lot. Now go away and be reasonable.
#MARTIN.
And this is my last word, Mr. Barlow. You've refused, and refused with scorn.
#EPHRAIM.
Scorn? I've not -
#MARTIN.
If you haven't, he has , and we know which of the pair is boss. You think you are, but we and Mr. Guy know better. He's boss and he calls us dirty and makes insulting pictures of us for you to laugh at. We shan't do anything to - night. To - morrow night we're meeting on the moors. Look to your factory, then.
#GUY.
If I'm boss, listen to me. I've told you I believe in factories.
#MARTIN.
And I tell you you'll have no factory to believe in. We're tired of machinery.
#GUY.
The machines are going on. Factories are going on. It's my life's work to push them on.
#HENRI.
Then look to your life.
#GUY.
The system's going on. It may break men in the making. It may break me. But, by God, I'll break you first. Ideas are greater than men. They conquer men. You can burn and kill and scotch the system here, but the idea will go on in spite of you and anything you rioters can do to us. You can crush us perhaps, but you can't kill the idea. Factories will spring up and men will live and die for them and roll themselves against them like waves against the rocks, but the factories are permanent because the world is crying for our cloth.
#OLD JOE.
And I haven't got a shirt. shirt! The world doesn't care for you. It's cloth by the hundred thousand yards they want. It's not your petty wants the system cares about. It's -
#MARTIN.
Then to hell with the system. We're petty, and, as you say, we can't do much. We can't stop factories being built elsewhere. But we can stop them here. We're broken men, but our spirit isn't broken yet. You've set up your last machine. Your system may be all you think, but men come first.
#GUY.
Your men or mine?
#MARTIN.
The men you've driven desperate. The starving, ragged men with wives and children hunger - mad, with everything to win and nowt to lose. It's men like that that win. Men with the choice of fighting hard or dying slow. Men with a bitter hatred in their hearts and knowledge in their heads that machinery's the cause of all. Men fighting for themselves against the men that fight for money and for you. Your hired bullies won't last long. We know they're there, and know we'll see them run.
#GUY.
You'll waste your blood. You may waste life. I've got men there. I don't deny it. And I ask you not to break yourselves against them. You're thinking me a coward, but it isn't that.
#MARTIN.
Oh? What is it then?
#GUY.
It's that I know. I won't be you and it won't be I who will win this fight.
#OLD JOE.
It must be one of us.
#GUY.
No. We may have ups and downs, but the system will conquer us both.
#MARTIN.
To - morrow night your factory will burn. We meet up on the moors, not tens or twenties of us, but every man of Barlow's and of Heppenstall's, and -
#GUY.
And we'll be glad to see you. Good night.
#MATTHEW.
Mr. Barlow -
#EPHRAIM.
My son speaks for me, Matt.
#GUY.
The blazing fools! To give away their meeting - place.
#JOHN GALE.
The moors are wide.
#GUY.
They meet beneath the quarry. I know their place. We'll get them there. One good surprise attack and we shall hear no more of meetings.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy, you're going into danger.
#GUY.
Not I while there are redcoats to fight my battles for me.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Soldiers!
#GUY.
What else are soldiers for? I ride to Blackburn barracks to - night. We'll teach these rioters a lesson that they'll not forget. Write me the summons to the barracks, father. You're a magistrate.
#EPHRAIM.
It's a heavy responsibility, Guy. flaming factory's the alternative.
#EPHRAIM.
Pass me the paper.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy, must you ride yourself? Can't you send somebody you trust?
#GUY.
I'm sending somebody I trust.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It's dangerous.
#GUY.
Rioting's a dangerous pastime - for the rioters.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But soldiers in the valley, Guy! You'll never be forgiven. It always will be war between you and the weavers if you bring soldiers here. They'll be revenged.
#GUY.
Meantime, I've got to save the factory.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And I have got to save the factory and you.
#GUY.
You!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Can I do nothing, Guy?
#EPHRAIM.
The summons, Guy.
#GUY.
Yes. You can pass me the summons.
#GUY.
Ah! That's all right.
#EPHRAIM.
Here's to your ride, Guy.
#GUY.
I'll give you a better toast than that. The factory.
#EPHRAIM.
Ruth! The factory. Ruth. The factory.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Are you there, Martin?
#MARTIN.
I am here.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I had begun to fear you would not come.
#MARTIN.
I know I'm late. To - night I'd work to do, for once in my useless life.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Don't be bitter, Martin.
#MARTIN.
The bitterness is past. My work is done, well done. I came when I was free to come, Mrs. Barlow. Ruth. Is it to be names like that between us two? Martin. I don't know what there is between us two, save that I got a message from your mother to meet you here.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I chose this place because we used to meet here often.
#MARTIN.
In happier days.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I chose it to remind you of them.
#MARTIN.
I don't need to be reminded. I'm striving to forget. I want to kill their memory and I can't.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I thought you had.
#MARTIN.
And why?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Last night.
#MARTIN.
What has last night to do with it?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It seemed to me last night that you'd forgotten.
#MARTIN.
It always seems to me that you forget. It's you forget. Forget our hope of happiness together and why we gave it up, forget the terms on which I gave myself to him.
#MARTIN.
Your plan, your terms. Not mine.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
We both agreed that it was best.
#MARTIN.
Well, if we did? Now you've had your way, now you are Guy Barlow's wife? Have you done anything? Does the plan work, or - ?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It all takes time. And you agreed to that. That it would take time. That I was to be given my chance. And now, last night, you spoilt it all. You -
#MARTIN.
Your plan's been tried and failed. You've done nothing. Less than nothing. Things have gone worse -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And if they have -
#MARTIN.
They have.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Will what you're doing help? Are threats of violence better?
#MARTIN.
No. But we don't threaten.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Not threaten!
#MARTIN.
We burn the factory to - night. And if your - husband tries to interfere, so much the worse for him. There's food and drink for many a day gone to the buying of this.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Martin! A pistol! You!
#MARTIN.
He talks of putting up another factory. It's going to stop at talk. pistol! I've never had a pistol in my hand. Let me feel it, Martin.
#MARTIN.
They're dangerous toys.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But I'll hold it by the handle.
#MARTIN.
It's safer where it is. It's no good, Ruth You haven't wheedled Guy Barlow into being soft with us, and you won't wheedle me into being soft with him. You're no great hand at wheedling for all your pretty face.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, do you think it's Guy I care about?
#MARTIN.
I think somehow it is.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You have no right -
#MARTIN.
What else am I to think? For all these months I get no word from you. Your mother talks of nothing but your happiness with him. I know you're living there in luxury with him, and I see you dressed the way you are. What can I think but that he's won you round?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I'm not a cat to be won over with caresses.
#MARTIN.
You always fancied finery.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Finery! It's good for finery to bring it on the moors to - night.
#MARTIN.
It keeps you warm.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
So does my fire. And yet I've left my fire I'm here.
#MARTIN.
Why are you here?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
To see you.
#MARTIN.
Only that?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
What else?
#MARTIN.
Why do you choose this night of all the nights that have gone by since - since we made our plan and you took him for husband?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
To - night's the first since yesterday.
#MARTIN.
Why yesterday?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You sent a message by my mother. She gave it to me yesterday.
#MARTIN.
I'd forgotten that. So much has happened since.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Then you should trust me all the more. I'm here in spite of all. I'm risking everything to come to tell you what you do is wrong, utterly, hopelessly wrong.
#MARTIN.
What do you risk?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I risk my plan. Let Guy find out I meet you, and where's my chance of influencing him? Where's my reward for sending you away? I risk my life, my hope, my all.
#MARTIN.
It sounds a lot.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It is a lot.
#MARTIN.
Well, I too take risks to - night.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, greater than you know.
#MARTIN.
Ah!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But you shall not take them. That's why I'm here. To stop you. You'll ruin all if this goes on to - night.
#MARTIN.
We'll ruin his factory.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You'll bring black ruin on yourselves. Oh, listen to me, Martin. I know. I know. Guy's got the soldiers coming.
#MARTIN.
They're coming here?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. Didn't you say you all met here below to - night?
#MARTIN.
Yes.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Soldiers, Martin. Can you fight soldiers?
#MARTIN.
After to - night there'll be no factory to fight about.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
There always will be factories.
#MARTIN.
Yes? So he said last night. But we know better.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
There will, there will. They'll build others, and while they're building you'll be starving, and when they're built, do you think there'll be work for you or my father or any man who lifts a hand to - night? You'll all be hanged or rotting in some gaol, and wages for the rest lower than ever to pay them out for the doings of this night. Don't do it, Martin. Leave Guy to me. I'll manage him, but I must bide my time.
#MARTIN.
And meantime we must live a living death. A bullet's better, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, maybe better for the few they hit. Death's not important. Think of the others who'll live on. Don't be selfish, Martin.
#MARTIN.
Selfish! I'm doing all for others. I don't care for myself.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You do. You care to be the leader. You care for your pride, the pride that won't let you draw back because you dare not seem to have an afterthought, the pride that's going to strew that valley with the ruined lives of men and corpses of the dead.
#MARTIN.
I can't draw back now. It's too late, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It's never too late. You are their leader, Martin? They won't do anything without your word?
#MARTIN.
I am their leader, Ruth. To - night's plan is mine.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Then so long as you stay here nothing can happen.
#MARTIN.
I shan't stay long.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You will. I've got you and I mean to keep you here. Thank God, I came.
#MARTIN.
You've come, but I've told you it's too late now.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, no, it's not. You can't deceive me, Martin. I know this is the meeting - place. I heard you all say so last night. The moors below the quarry. Are the men there, Martin?
#MARTIN.
There are men there. Listen. The song that Henri Callard brought from France and made into an English song to put the spirit of a revolution into us. The song of life and hope.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
No, Martin, the song of death.
#MARTIN.
Perhaps it is, for Barlow's bullies at the factory.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Martin, don't go. Don't give the word. For my sake, Martin.
#MARTIN.
The song is calling.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Are we English to be French and lose our senses for a song? Is all that you and I have said and done to go for naught?
#MARTIN.
Ruth, tell the truth
#RUTH GRAHAM.
The truth?
#MARTIN.
Is it you and I or you and that other?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Other?
#MARTIN.
You know whom I mean. Guy Barlow.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I love him, Martin.
#MARTIN.
At last! The truth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I love him, and you're going to kill my husband. If when you said you couldn't lose the memory of me you spoke the truth, you'll spare him, Martin. You won't go down amongst those men and lead them to the factory. I tried my best to carry out our plan. You told me that he wouldn't marry me, but I made him do it. And afterwards I tried. I did try, Martin. Only Guy's my husband and I love him now. I've learnt to love him till my love's the greatest thing in all the world. Don't kill him, Martin.
#MARTIN.
It will not be killing, Ruth. It won't be murder if a bullet finds its way in Guy Barlow's heart. Not murder, but an accident.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You mean to kill him.
#MARTIN.
Not man's vengeance, Ruth, but God's.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You mean to murder him. What shall I do? Martin, you loved me once. Is that love dead?
#MARTIN.
Dead? Love needs nourishment and you have starved my love.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
What if I said I'm here to nourish it? Would you go down there then?
#MARTIN.
Nourish? How?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Am I still beautiful, Martin?
#MARTIN.
Yes. So Guy Barlow thinks.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Don't you?
#MARTIN.
Delilah!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Was Delilah married?
#MARTIN.
No.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Don't look down there. They're singing. Let them sing.
#MARTIN.
And if I stay? You mean it, Ruth?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I mean - everything.
#MARTIN.
My God, you're beautiful! Put out the lantern.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Give me your pistol first.
#MARTIN.
My pistol?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes.
#MARTIN.
The lantern.
#EPHRAIM.
I'm convinced your men won't be needed, Captain.
#GUY.
We shall soon see. Personally I fancy we shall show you a little sport.
#CAPTAIN.
Sorry sport, Mr. Barlow. I fought the French with a relish. They're our natural foes. But this setting English at English goes against the grain with me.
#EPHRAIM.
Excellent sentiments, Captain Lascelles.
#GUY.
I used to think the whole duty of a soldier was to fight.
#CAPTAIN.
The duty of a soldier is to obey orders. That, sir, is why I am at the disposal of your father, who represents the civil authority. But I've no stomach for firing on unarmed men.
#GUY.
Listen! That's very near.
#CAPTAIN.
So are the singers. Look there.
#EPHRAIM.
Torches! There's a big crowd there. Why didn't we hear them?
#CAPTAIN.
We came uphill. The hill cut off the sound.
#EPHRAIM.
Dogs? What are the dogs for?
#GUY.
Well, Captain, like it or not, you'll have warm work to - night.
#CAPTAIN.
To be candid with you, I don't like it at all.
#GUY.
You make me alter my opinion of the British officer.
#CAPTAIN.
Sir! I saw service in the Peninsular and I was under fire at Waterloo -
#GUY.
But a handful of scarecrow weavers is too much for you because they're English. few are not, Mr. Barlow. But those torches don't indicate a few, but a very much larger number than I have force to cope with.
#EPHRAIM.
There certainly is a great number.
#GUY.
In other words, you shirk your duty.
#CAPTAIN.
I don't want to quarrel with a civilian. Am I to get my men into position, sir?
#EPHRAIM.
Well - their number is certainly alarming.
#GUY.
Yes.
#EPHRAIM.
If you please, Captain.
#CAPTAIN.
Very well. You've a copy of the Riot Act with you?
#EPHRAIM.
Yes. I hope I shall not have to read it.
#CAPTAIN.
That is for you to decide.
#EPHRAIM.
Yes. Guy!
#GUY.
One minute, sir. There's a smell of tallow here.
#CAPTAIN.
Your lantern.
#GUY.
That didn't smell before.
#CAPTAIN.
The torches below there, then. The wind would carry their reek.
#GUY.
Yes. Only there doesn't happen to be a wind. Captain The shed?
#GUY.
I'll see. There's no one there. Must have been our lantern. What did you want, father?
#EPHRAIM.
Guy, hadn't we better leave it? I don't want bloodshed. They're decent fellows at heart, and we don't know they mean to attack. I can't believe it of them. Wait till they do and use the soldiers to guard the factory. Guy. What's the use of waiting till they attack? Take them here unprepared and you make a thorough job of it.
#CAPTAIN.
Yes: only I can't promise to take them unprepared.
#GUY.
Why not? Have I to teach you your business? Get your men round them in the dark and -
#CAPTAIN.
It won't be dark. The clouds will be off the moon soon.
#GUY.
Then as Nature won't assist you, Captain, you'll have to draw upon the great store of military tactics you no doubt acquired in your numerous campaigns. How long will it take to get your men placed between that crowd and the factory?
#CAPTAIN.
Oh, say ten minutes. The moon will be clear before then.
#GUY.
I hope it won't. They'll run like hares at the sight of a uniform, and I want them taught a lesson they'll not forget in a hurry.
#EPHRAIM.
Shall we go?
#GUY.
Yes. I'll join you below.
#EPHRAIM.
Join? Aren't you coming?
#GUY.
In a minute. For the moment I have business here.
#CAPTAIN.
What business are we to imagine that can keep you here alone?
#GUY.
You can imagine any business you like. You can imagine me praying for the British Army when it is officered by men like you, but, at any rate, you can leave me here.
#CAPTAIN.
Yes. You'll be quite out of danger here, Mr. Barlow.
#EPHRAIM.
Gentlemen!
#GUY.
Hadn't you better look after your men? Your ten minutes are flying.
#CAPTAIN.
I shall deal with you afterwards.
#GUY.
With pleasure. My business is to deal in cotton cloth with all comers. I don't discriminate.
#CAPTAIN.
Pah! Shopman!
#GUY.
Come out. It's steep, isn't it? You'll not escape that way unless you've wings.
#MARTIN.
Escape? I don't want to escape.
#GUY.
You're looking for a way.
#MARTIN.
I'm looking at the great crowd your father saw.
#GUY.
Yes. You've brought your ragamuffins out, but you'll find it a tougher job to make them fight.
#MARTIN.
I don't intend to let those lads down there fight soldiers.
#GUY.
And I don't intend to let you warn them. You're going to stay here.
#MARTIN.
I can shout.
#GUY.
Why don't you? Shout till you brast your lungs, my lad. It won't carry downhill.
#MARTIN.
Then you must do your butcher's handiwork. Butchers! Yes. That's just the word.
#GUY.
Ah! So you do know when you're beaten. Well, Kelsall, as you heard while you were eavesdropping, I've ten minutes to fill in. Ten minutes isn't long. There's no margin for lies.
#MARTIN.
The truth about your factory is the last thing you'll listen to.
#GUY.
The truth about my wife is what I'm waiting for.
#MARTIN.
Hadn't you better ask her?
#GUY.
I don't question my wife before a workman.
#MARTIN.
Shall I leave you?
#GUY.
You don't seem in any hurry.
#MARTIN.
No. The time for that is past. I've stayed here too long for going now.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Thank God, then I've succeeded.
#GUY.
Succeeded? How?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I've kept him here until the danger passed. He meant to burn the factory and murder you. He told me so and I - I kept him here. I've played with him. I've -
#MARTIN.
You played with fire, and it's not your fault you haven't burnt yourself.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
What did it matter what I said? I've saved your life. I've kept him here.
#GUY.
How did you get him here?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I sent for him.
#GUY.
Why should he come for your sending?
#MARTIN.
You don't question your wife before a workman, do you?
#GUY.
No. You're right. This can wait.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy, I sent because last night I heard him threaten you. I wanted to persuade him -
#GUY.
Your methods of persuasion are peculiar.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
They kept him here. That was what I had to do. At any cost to keep him here.
#GUY.
Ruth, I begin to think that reading Byron isn't good for you.
#MARTIN.
Why put it on to Byron? Hasn't his noble Lordship sins enough of his own?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy, don't you see? He's the men's leader. They won't do anything without him. He told me that. That they would wait for him to give the word.
#MARTIN.
I told you that it was too late. I came up here to - night without imperilling my plans. It didn't matter that how long you kept me here. Succeeded! The only thing you've succeeded in is in arousing your husband's suspicions.
#GUY.
Be careful, Kelsall.
#MARTIN.
I've nothing to be careful about. I could be at Jericho for all the difference it'll make.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You told me you were their leader.
#MARTIN.
The leader of a movement is the brain of it. Brain is scarcer than brawn, and therefore -
#GUY.
Therefore it skulks up here in safety.
#MARTIN.
Yes, that's what that soldier said to you. Oh, but he's wrong, of course. You don't suppose Lord Wellington was in the firing line at Waterloo? He left fools like your soldier friend to feed the powder. A leader's business is direction.
#GUY.
Am I to understand that you direct? You? Martin I have directed. In no long time I hope to see the fruits of my direction.
#GUY.
Down there? There'll be a crop of broken heads if that's the fruit you're looking for. Martin. I'm looking up, not down.
#GUY.
Up? sign in the heavens.
#GUY.
The heavens!
#MARTIN.
Don't you believe in heaven? Sometimes I don't. I find it difficult to believe in a just God who lets you live and lets your machinery be made and lets you starve your weavers. But I have faith to - night, Guy Barlow, a mighty faith in the all - seeing God who's brought us face to face, oppressor and oppressed, avenger and -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Be careful, Guy, he means to do you harm.
#GUY.
My dear Ruth, I'm quite convinced you read too much. Romance and Mrs. Radcliffe are fitting for your withdrawing - room, but please don't bring them out of doors. You told me once romance was dangerous for women. I find it is.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But he was armed. Thank God, I've got his pistol.
#GUY.
You got his pistol! Confound you, what did you do that for? I can't shoot the fellow in cold blood.
#MARTIN.
Oh, you needn't scruple. Life's no use to a weaver in Barlow's factory, and my work is finished now.
#GUY.
Give it him back.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You'll fight together if I do.
#GUY.
Do as I tell you, Ruth.
#MARTIN.
I warn you this is murder.
#GUY.
You shouldn't carry firearms if you're not competent to use them.
#MARTIN.
The murder is of you. This is my night, Guy Barlow. You've had the power to starve and sweat the weavers of the valley, but the tide has turned at last. The luck's on my side now, and if we fight and one of us should fall, it won't be I that has to die to - night. Ruth, You shall not fight. This pistol's mine, I won it from you. I do what I like with my own.
#GUY.
Rebellion is in the air to - night. You've caught the prevalent disease, my Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy, this man means to kill you.
#GUY.
I mean to kill this man. But I've a scruple that prevents my shooting down an unarmed man.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You're both safe then.
#GUY.
Not while my pistol's left. He seems to think the luck is on his side. We'll put that to the test by tossing for the first shot.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But he might win.
#GUY.
That will decide the point at issue. Luck will be on his side. You've got your chance now, Kelsall. What was it? Oppressor and oppressed, avenger and avenged?
#MARTIN.
My God, I wish I had your coolness.
#GUY.
Blood will tell, you know. Do you accept? Martin Yes, I accept.
#GUY.
Good. Shall I spin a coin or you?
#MARTIN.
I don't bring money out. It's scarce with me. Guy. Then I provide both pistol and coin.
#MARTIN.
And corpse.
#GUY.
You're getting back your spirit. Will you call? Now that's really very thoughtful of the moon. The target will be visible, and we can see the coin as soon as you remove your foot.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I shall not remove my foot.
#GUY.
And Kelsall quite forgot to call. He's too busy shivering.
#MARTIN.
I'm cold.
#GUY.
This time, Kelsall.
#MARTIN.
Heads.
#GUY.
The pistol's yours. Oh yes, it's loaded.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Martin, you'll shoot him through my body.
#GUY.
I'm sure that's out of Mrs. Radcliffe, Ruth. It has the true romantic ring. Will you help me to tie her up, Kelsall? It's a bore to have to ask the favour, but -
#MARTIN.
You're smiling and you're going to die.
#GUY.
It's possible, but these cold nights do make a man's hand shake, don't they? Your luck may not be altogether in. The heavens do not send the sign you look for.
#MARTIN.
They sent the moon to shoot you by.
#GUY.
Yes. Get out of the way, Ruth, unless you want to be tied up. Stand clear. This fellow's hand's so shaky he might hit you by mistake. Go ahead, Kelsall. Remember your wrongs and your faith and blaze away.
#MARTIN.
I can't do it. It's the chance I've prayed for and I can't do it.
#GUY.
Oh come, Kelsall. Remember what's expected of a leader of the men.
#MARTIN.
I've beaten you there. Yes, now I understand. I'm not afraid to shoot.
#GUY.
My mistake.
#MARTIN.
Oh, I've a sweeter revenge than that, Shoot, and you'd never know the way that you've been fooled this night.
#GUY.
You didn't shoot because you lacked the pluck.
#MARTIN.
The thing I didn't lack was brain to outwit you and bring you on a fool's errand to the moors while -
#GUY.
While what?
#MARTIN.
Oh, while the moon came out and showed your military friends the truth.
#GUY.
The truth? What is the truth?
#MARTIN.
Oh, you shall know. I'm keeping you alive that you may know.
#GUY.
What is it, you -
#CAPTAIN.
Are you there, Barlow? Oh -
#GUY.
Never mind these people. What is it?
#CAPTAIN.
Confound it, that's what I want to know.
#GUY.
What are you doing here? Why aren't you down there surrounding those weavers?
#CAPTAIN.
Well, you see, the fact is, there are no weavers.
#EPHRAIM.
Dogs, Guy. You remember I noticed the dogs.
#GUY.
Dogs? Have you both gone mad? My patience! What is it?
#CAPTAIN.
You see those torches?
#GUY.
Of course.
#CAPTAIN.
But you can't see who's carrying them from here.
#GUY.
I don't need to see. I know. It's the weavers' meeting.
#CAPTAIN.
Weavers! They're sheep, sir. Sheep with torches fastened to them and not a man in sight.
#GUY.
Sheep!
#MARTIN.
You'll remember I said butchers was the right word.
#GUY.
Sheep! But we heard singing; dozen men can make a noise. They'll have sore throats to - morrow.
#GUY.
Sheep!
#MARTIN.
Look up! I've got my sign in the heavens.
#CAPTAIN.
Fire!
#MARTIN.
This is my night after all, Guy Barlow. The factory's ablaze.
#JOHN GALE.
It's a sad sight, Barlow. sight I cannot bear to see. Shut it out. Shut it out. I built it, Heppenstall, the first factory in these parts, fifteen years ago, and there it's stood through all these years a monument of enterprise, until I'd grown to love the very stone of it. They mocked me when I put it up. They called it Barlow's Folly. But I knew. I knew machinery had come to stay, and now new factories are springing up, and building one to - day is not the same great thing it was. The glamour's gone.
#JOHN GALE.
But you'll rebuild.
#EPHRAIM.
Guy will rebuild. I doubt if I shall care for what he does. This night has broken me.
#JOHN GALE.
Come, come, now, don't give way like that. Ephraim. It's easy talk for you. Your factory is sound. They've left it standing.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye. You were the scapegoats.
#EPHRAIM.
And all my business checked. Customers to disappoint. Connections broken and -
#JOHN GALE.
They will come back to you.
#EPHRAIM.
And when? You can burn fast, but you rebuild slowly. And the misery, Heppenstall, the misery of it.
#JOHN GALE.
You're thinking of your men?
#EPHRAIM.
Aye and their families. merciful man, Barlow.
#EPHRAIM.
Oh, let the leaders swing for it. It's their desert. But all the others, just the heedless fools they've led astray. I'm sorry for them in the bitter days to come. Guy's been too hard on them.
#JOHN GALE.
Yes. Guy's been hard. A wilful, headstrong man. But, hearkee, Barlow, I've a plan that will smooth out the crookedness for you. plan?
#JOHN GALE.
You've been a rival of me, and your son has made the rivalry no pleasant thing. But you and I are friends, and sooner than see you suffer for your son, I'll run my place by night as well as day, and you can put your people there by night and keep faith with your customers.
#EPHRAIM.
Why, Heppenstall, that's generous.
#JOHN GALE.
There's something in the doctrine which that fighting - cock of yours was preaching here last night. We manufacturers must cling together, Barlow, only he wanted us to cling to his policy and, by your leave, we'll cling to mine. It lets you satisfy your customers and keep your weavers living, and it gives me the chance of rapping Mr. Guy Barlow on the knuckles.
#EPHRAIM.
Do you think he'll let - ?
#JOHN GALE.
Why, man alive, I hope that you are master here.
#EPHRAIM.
I shall take no pleasure in it now. That old factory was like another son to me.
#GUY.
And a damned rickety child it was.
#EPHRAIM.
Guy!
#GUY.
You will get a new son, father A lusty son with new machinery in the guts of him.
#EPHRAIM.
It will not be my old factory.
#GUY.
No, by the Lord, it won't. It will be efficient. Come, father, bear up. We'll soon have that site covered up again with another son for you, and there's no love like the love of a man for the child of his old age.
#EPHRAIM.
It won't be my child, Guy.
#GUY.
Then call it your grandson and dote upon him as a grandad should.
#JOHN GALE.
Is this a time for your jesting, Mr. Guy?
#GUY.
Maybe you think you've the laugh of me, Mr. Heppenstall, you with your factory unburnt. Wait till my new building is complete with all the last word in machinery, Look to your business then. I'll show you what a factory should be.
#EPHRAIM.
Guy, you sound - almost - as if you are glad.
#GUY.
Why not? We're well insured.
#EPHRAIM.
And our customers, meantime?
#GUY.
Customers? Fire breaks all contracts.
#EPHRAIM.
Not mine. Not while there exists a way of carrying them out.
#GUY.
There is no way.
#JOHN GALE.
You'll pardon me, there is. I have offered your father the use of my factory by night.
#GUY.
By night? We should lose money. There would be you to pay, and weaving by candlelight is expensive.
#EPHRAIM.
Then let us lose money. I will carry out my contracts. And - think of the weavers, Guy.
#GUY.
Let them starve.
#EPHRAIM.
I won't. I will hang the leaders. But the rest shall live.
#GUY.
They will live somehow. When we want them again, they will be there. Meantime, they shall be punished.
#EPHRAIM.
I say they shall not, and by our good friend's help they need not be.
#GUY.
Our good friend is to run his factory by day and night and take his profit out of us. So much for friendship.
#EPHRAIM.
He must certainly be compensated for turning his place upside down.
#GUY.
Why turn it upside down?
#EPHRAIM.
For the sake of the weavers whom I will not desert.
#GUY.
Did I burn their livelihood? No. They did. Let them suffer for it.
#EPHRAIM.
Guy, I have to remind you again that I am the head of the firm.
#GUY.
Very well, then. I break my connection with the firm.
#EPHRAIM.
Guy! Barlow & Son.
#GUY.
In future there will be two firms. The first is a charitable institution which penalizes itself to find work for riotous weavers who burn its factory. The second firm exists to make money.
#EPHRAIM.
You mustn't do that, Guy. Not the factory and the firm on one black night. I can't stand both.
#GUY.
Then the firm goes on on my terms.
#EPHRAIM.
You mustn't leave me, Guy.
#GUY.
Very well. Barlow & Son decline your offer with thanks, Mr.
#JOHN GALE.
Barlow, do you mean to tell me - ?
#EPHRAIM.
I give him best, Heppenstall. The lad is a stronger man than I am. Henceforth I am a looker - on.
#GUY.
Father, hand me those plans.
#EPHRAIM.
Plans, Guy?
#GUY.
The new factory, man. Do you think there's time to waste? Hah! That's finished with. I use a stronger weapon. This.
#JOHN GALE.
Come away, Barlow.
#EPHRAIM.
Yes. Yes. I think -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy!
#GUY.
I am busy, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy, they have got my father. The soldiers, Guy. They've got my father.
#GUY.
Yes, I can hear.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
My father!
#GUY.
Why not? Your father joined the rest.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
What will they do to him?
#GUY.
The law has a strong arm, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You mean -
#GUY.
Fools pay for their folly.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy, Guy, you will not let my father - Oh -
#GUY.
Captain Lascelles has charge of all the prisoners till they are handed over to the civil authorities. If you wish to communicate with any of them, you must apply to him.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But - Guy - they say the prisoners will be hanged.
#GUY.
It's more than likely.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And my father -
#GUY.
Arson is a hanging matter, Ruth. If your father chose to be a riotous incendiary, he must pay the penalty.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy, don't you love me?
#GUY.
I have loved you, Ruth. I find you are the kind of woman men do love.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
What do you mean?
#GUY.
There was a man to - night, Ruth, upon the moors.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
That? But you know.
#GUY.
I am waiting to know.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I went to save your life from him. I heard him speak in here, last night, when you and Mr. Heppenstall had gone in there, and he - he threatened and -
#GUY.
Threatened! He! And if he did, do you imagine it a woman's job to guard my life?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He threatened and he meant to do.
#GUY.
And what had you to do with him?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
That is all over now.
#GUY.
It may be, but it has left its mark. Why did you go to him?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I went because of what is past. Before I knew you, Guy, I knew him and -
#GUY.
You went to beg my life. From him, your lover, Martin Kelsall!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. He was my lover once. fine strong lover for you, wife of mine. A brave, grand lover, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, you outfaced him in the quarry there. I saw the fear he had for you.
#GUY.
The starveling rat.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, starveling and a coward when he met you face to face, you with your strength and he an ill and starving man. Maybe it's easy for a strong man to be brave, but, in the end, he won. His starveling brain had made a plan. His -
#GUY.
Damn him. Do you defend him?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
No, Guy, I don't defend. I prove him dangerous. I prove that when I went, I went with reason. I prove that if he fooled me there, he fooled you here. The factory is burnt.
#GUY.
I am not talking of the factory just now. It's you I'm talking of. You say you prove him dangerous. You do. You say he fooled you there, me here. I am not certain that he did not fool us both at once, up there.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy! But I told you.
#GUY.
What?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You came in time.
#GUY.
In time for what? I want to know. It seems to me that you were ready -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. I was ready, ready then and there to save your life.
#GUY.
At the price - ?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
To save your life. You see, I loved you, Guy.
#GUY.
You loved me!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Could I have proved it more?
#GUY.
There is a price which no man pays for life. You got his pistol from him. How?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
By promising. And then you came. Guy, Guy, I loved you and I wanted you to live.
#GUY.
And you?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
The quarry cliff is steep. I should have died.
#GUY.
Come here, Ruth. Look at me. Look into my eyes and tell me that again.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I should have died. Death's easy, Guy.
#GUY.
Yes. I believe you now. By heaven, what a fool you are. loving fool, then, Guy. Guy, A fool in love's the worst of fools. There, there it's over, Ruth. But Kelsall? Yes, I've got Kelsall. Kelsall shall pay for this.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
They'll hang him, Guy?
#GUY.
Oh yes, they'll hang what's left.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
What's left?
#GUY.
When I have done with Martin Kelsall, the gallows will be welcome to the rest.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy, you -
#GUY.
Be careful, Ruth, or you will have me doubting you again.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And there's my father, Guy. Is he to hang as well?
#GUY.
You come of a race of fools.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I believe that you can save him, Guy. For my sake, won't you let that old man live. My father, Guy? Your father's friend when they were young together.
#GUY.
Come here, Ruth. I'll strike a bargain with you. bargain?
#GUY.
Yes, for your father's neck. We mustn't let our father hang, must we, my pretty?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
If what you want is in my power to grant -
#GUY.
It's in your power. We'll have a straightening out of things, my girl. They've got askew, and this night's work of yours is just the last knot that you'll tie. You meddle, girl. You are come of weavers' stock and weavers tend to meddling. You used to ask me questions, you worried me about the factory. I stopped your asking, but I didn't change your ways. You kept them, saved them up for this fine piece of meddling of to - night. Now Ruth, it's this. You're my wife. You're Mrs Barlow, not Ruth Butterworth. Your thoughts should be of my making, not your father's. You will give up attending other people's business and attend your own. Maybe if you had done that earlier we should have seen by now some sign of what I'm looking for from you. You know what that is, lass. I want an heir. Give me obedience, my Ruth, bear me a son, and this night's work shall be forgotten.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And, my father?
#GUY.
Your father shall escape the hangman, Ruth. What do you say to me? will be your slave.
#GUY.
You will be my wife. You won't ask questions. You will know that what I do is good because I do it, and the sooner you bring me an heir the better I shall be pleased with you.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
That is in God's hand, Guy.
#GUY.
Aye, but meddling women make bad mothers, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I will not meddle more. I'll be your - your wife.
#CAPTAIN.
Oh, I - I beg your pardon - I -
#GUY.
Come in, Captain, come in. Captain, a loving cup. I apologize to the British Army and congratulate you on the round - up.
#CAPTAIN.
Why, thank you, Mr. Barlow. Here's your health, sir. To your eyes, madam.
#GUY.
A very gallant piece of work, Captain.
#CAPTAIN.
Gallant? Nay, to my mind, sir, the policing of your valley is no work for a man of Wellington's. It is a sorry soldier who takes pleasure in the harrying of half - starved weavers.
#GUY.
All work well done is good work, Captain.
#CAPTAIN.
I do not share your pleasure in this night. And let me tell you, sir, your father's with me in the view I take.
#GUY.
My father? Aye, old men resent a change, especially a change that is forced on them. But for myself, why, good out of evil, captain. A new factory, up to date in every detail with new machines to cut my wage list down, and -
#CAPTAIN.
Do you think it's safe to build again?
#GUY.
Safe?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes. Will they let you?
#GUY.
The weavers? Man, they'll help.
#CAPTAIN.
Will they now?
#GUY.
They will come and ask to be allowed to help They'll sit round watching stone go on to stone and thank their God for every story raised.
#CAPTAIN.
That's not their mood to - night.
#GUY.
To - night they have a supper in them, They'll be starving then.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Starving!
#CAPTAIN.
You are somewhat drastic, sir.
#GUY.
Well, sir, and are not you? In the army you've the noble institution of flogging to keep your men to heel. We can't flog weavers. It's against the law and so we have to keep them disciplined by other means. And now, captain, about your prisoners.
#CAPTAIN.
Yes?
#GUY.
You would count them carefully? Suppose, I mean, that one were missing. Would you take it very much to heart?
#CAPTAIN.
On the contrary, sir, I should be glad to see the whole lot go.
#GUY.
What, all of them? And go away with nothing to show for your night's work?
#CAPTAIN.
I don't regard this as a creditable night, Mr. Barlow. Your father was saying just now that the simplest way is to let them all escape. They will have had the scare of their lives and are not likely to forget the lesson.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, if you would!
#GUY.
And what did you say? The Northerners
#CAPTAIN.
I agreed with him.
#GUY.
You're a man of heart, Captain. Only you would be cashiered.
#CAPTAIN.
I would risk cashiering. And I may remind you, sir, that it is not you, but your father, who's the magistrate.
#GUY.
I speak here for my father. We settled that between us half an hour ago.
#CAPTAIN.
That's true. He sent me to you.
#GUY.
On your errand of - mercy?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes.
#GUY.
Captain, oblige me by sending two of your prisoners here. Butterworth and Kelsall. One of them may escape. He is my wife's father.
#CAPTAIN.
Your wife's father! I'm sorry, Mrs. Barlow. I had so few men that I had to bind the prisoners, and your father must be pinioned like the rest.
#GUY.
He acted like the rest. I will see to his bindings, Captain.
#CAPTAIN.
And as to the other question?
#GUY.
What other?
#CAPTAIN.
Letting them all escape.
#GUY.
There is no other question.
#CAPTAIN.
Your father, sir -
#GUY.
Your duty, Captain Lascelles, is to hand your prisoners to the authorities to be dealt with as the law provides. Meanwhile, send me the men I want.
#CAPTAIN.
Very well.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy!
#GUY.
Don't go, Ruth. I want you here.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I was not going, but -
#GUY.
Then oblige me by silence. These plans of mine must reach an architect to - morrow. And the new machinery must be ordered to - night.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy, how soon will the new factory be built?
#GUY.
With luck, six months, if frost does not hold up the masons.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Six months. Six wintry months and in the mean time all the weavers -
#GUY.
Those who are not hanged will be starving for their sins. I've told you to keep quiet, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I have kept quiet, Guy, kept quiet while you made me love you like your dog because you warmed my body well and fed me till my eyes were closed with fat and all my will was lulled to sleep. I asked you questions of the factory, and when you gave me poetry books to read, I read them and forgot. You told me not to meddle and I have obeyed. I gave up asking questions till in all the valley there was none more ignorant than me. Than me, who -
#GUY.
Than you who made a bargain with me here. Is this your way of keeping it?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy, let me ask you things. If it is the last time, for just this once, be kind and tell me what you mean to do.
#GUY.
If it is the last time? Ruth, I keep my bargains. There is your father's life at stake.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Still, I must know. For the sake of our future, Guy, I must know what you mean to do. I have been quiet, Guy. I will again. I might have spoken now while Captain Lascelles spoke with you. I kept my silence then, But tell me, Guy. It's you who are the master now? You, not your father?
#GUY.
It is I.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Lord of the Valley. Master of their lives. Guy, Guy, what will you do with them?
#GUY.
Break them.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Your father would be merciful.
#GUY.
Old men grow soft with age.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Have you not broken them enough? Have they not starved for you till desperation made them turn and do the deed they did to - night?
#GUY.
They did the deed. They turned. Therefore they are not broken,
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But, by the Lord, they're going to be. I'll have them meek. I'll crush their spirits till their children's children rue the day their fathers tried to thwart Guy Barlow.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. You can do it. You've the strength.
#GUY.
And the power. The dogs don't know their master yet.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You can do it, Guy. But will you?
#GUY.
Will I?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Hear me. A woman can't do much. A woman's handicapped. But what she can do, Guy, all that I'll do -
#GUY.
Where is your bargain now?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. I made a bargain, didn't I? I bargained for my father's life. My life for his.
#GUY.
Your - life?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I said I'd be your slave. I said that I would give you sons. I said I would not ask you questions.
#GUY.
And you have asked. You have asked and had your answers, For the last time, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. I shall ask no more. I shall - Guy. What?
#SOLDIER.
Captain Lascelles' orders, sir.
#GUY.
Thank you. You may go.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Father, you shall not be bound.
#GUY.
No. Our father must not be in bonds, must he? But we will stop there, Ruth. It is not Kelsall's turn just yet.
#MATTHEW.
I am not wishful to be treated differently from the rest.
#GUY.
No? And yet, do you know, Father - in - law Butterworth, you are going to be. Martyrs are going cheap to - night. I have another use than martyrdom for you. Matthew. Well, seemingly, I'm in your hands.
#GUY.
You are precisely in my hands, Father - in - law. What would you say now if I let you go scot free for this?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Guy!
#MATTHEW.
I'd say the wench had talked to you.
#GUY.
Yes. She has talked. And then, Butterworth? After I had let you go?
#MATTHEW.
You want a promise from me? Well, I'll make you none until you put away from you the abomination of machinery. I'll fight till I can fight no more against your factories and ugliness. I'll fight for honest craftsmanship and joy and pride in work until there's not a factory left in the land, until we've made an end to all the makers and the users of machines that take the weaver's handiwork away, until -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Father! Guy has the power of life or death. You could be hanged for what you've done to - night.
#GUY.
And dead men burn no factories, Butterworth.
#MATTHEW.
Dead men can speak, speak from their graves back to the living, MR. Guy.
#GUY.
I have told you you are not to die. You're going to live, because I will it so.
#MATTHEW.
And ask me to submit?
#GUY.
I don't remember asking. I know you will submit.
#MATTHEW.
Never.
#GUY.
The door is there. Get out of it and go. You'll not be stayed. Go out and show yourself alive. Go out and prove to all the valley that Guy Barlow has the power of life or death.
#MATTHEW.
So that's the use you have for me. To show myself a coward, who -
#GUY.
To show yourself sent back to life by me.
#MATTHEW.
To life! The life you send me to is not worth having.
#GUY.
Perhaps that's why I send you back to it.
#MATTHEW.
No. I will -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You will think of my mother.
#MARTIN.
Go, Butterworth. There is still work for you to do.
#MATTHEW.
To take my life from him!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He will not taunt you with it, father.
#GUY.
Go, man, before I change my mind, and thank your God it's you I choose to take my message out - the message that Guy Barlow has the power to send men to the gallows or the loom. For you, the loom. For him, the gallows. Go.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Go, father.
#GUY.
Ruth, not you.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
No.
#GUY.
Well, Martin Kelsall, do you like your handiwork? A pretty bonfire for a winter's night. Look at it, Kelsall. Drink it in, for it is like to be the last you'll see of earthly fire. They don't waste coal in jail.
#MARTIN.
I have two things will keep me warm.
#GUY.
You will need them both before the hangman fits a noose about your neck.
#MARTIN.
Two things, Guy Barlow. Hatred. Hatred of you and satisfaction for to - night. We've made a clean sweep of your factory.
#GUY.
And I could almost find it in my heart to shake your dirty hand for doing it. You've left the less to clear away before we can commence rebuilding.
#MARTIN.
Rebuilding!
#GUY.
Why, did you think we'd sit down still and mourn? You will not live to see it, Kelsall, but there will be a grand new factory in six months' time. There'll be machines which eat up work as if they liked it. Machines to do the work of many men. They're cunning things, those new machines. They are not rebellious and a little child can guide them by the hand. Kelsall, I think a factory should have a name. I shall call mine the Phoenix Factory, because it's going to rise more glorious upon the ashes you have sown.
#MARTIN.
Oh, you can kill me -
#GUY.
And I shall. I'm not like you. I'm not afraid to kill.
#MARTIN.
But my work will go on.
#GUY.
It will. And shall I tell you what that work of yours will be? Death, Kelsall, Death and -
#MARTIN.
Yes, death for me, but for the others - those for whom I give my life - there will be -
#GUY.
There will be the slower death which you escape by hanging. They will thank you for it, won't they, Kelsall? While they starve, they'll bless your name for burning down the factory that brought them bread.
#MARTIN.
It did not bring them bread enough for life.
#GUY.
Oh, some of them will live the winter through and come to work my new looms in the spring. They'll be the strong men who survive, strong weavers for my factory and, by the Lord, they will be meek. They will have learnt the cost of yonder carnival. They -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Stop, Guy.
#GUY.
What?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I'm telling you to stop your blasphemy.
#GUY.
You asked me questions, Ruth. I thought you liked to listen to my plans.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. I have asked you questions and I have my answer now.
#GUY.
True, but you interrupt me, Ruth. You interrupt my telling Mr. Kelsall of the future which he will not be fortunate enough to see.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You are baiting a helpless man, and -
#GUY.
If you prefer to go, the door is open. I've got a crow to pick with Kelsall here.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I do not prefer to go. I told you what a woman could, I'd do to stop your infamies.
#GUY.
Women can do so much.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Sometimes they can do much. Martin, I am glad that they have bound your hands. Glad of it now, because -
#MARTIN.
No. No. Not that way, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Is there another?
#MARTIN.
Yes. Loose my hands and I -
#GUY.
I think not, Kelsall. So. You are Ruth and Martin to each other, are you? And Ruth met Martin on the moors to - night. Ruth is my wife, and Martin - Martin is -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Martin is the man I should have married if -
#GUY.
If you hadn't seen a better chance in me. better chance!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, Martin, for it was a chance.
#MARTIN.
What have you made of it?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, in the end it comes to this. Could it have come to any other thing?
#MARTIN.
We might have had this time together, Ruth. Some sort of happiness, some little sort.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I've had some happiness with him. The sort of happiness you have when you're asleep. I loved him in my sleep, and in my dreams he seemed a proper man to love. But you - you've had no happiness. You have been lonely, Martin, lonely and cold and hungry. You should have had me working with you all this while. I've been a traitor to you in my sleep. But now - now I am awake and in the death to which they'll make you go, you shall be stainless to the end. And in their hearts you'll live again - the man who planned and did and died upon a gallows for the people's sake. I will keep you pure for that, my Martin. I -
#GUY.
I am being very patient, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You see, I've had my happiness, so it is right that I should pay.
#GUY.
So? You have finished your farewell?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, Guy, it is all over now.
#GUY.
Then come here, Ruth. Come here and scream. Scream loudly, Ruth, or I shall cheat the hangman of his prey before they drag me off.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You shall not touch him, Guy. A fettered man.
#GUY.
Shan't! Shall I not? Come to me, Ruth, I tell you. Come away. I'm master here.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. You are master here where your father was. And if you die, your father would be master still.
#GUY.
You are standing in my way.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Your father's merciful and you - you shall not have your vengeance,
#GUY.
The hard, hard laws will take revenge and men will pay in blood and tears and life for what they've done to - night. You shall not make the women pay in agony. You shall not starve the valley, Guy.
#GUY.
So. That is what you mean. The pistol's loaded, and your aim is true.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I do not shake with hunger, Guy.
#GUY.
Not by my death nor by a hundred deaths of such as me will you delay the spread of factories. They will go on - go on - I may not see it, but -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You will not see it, Guy. And I - I only see the valley here and you who would be master of their lives.
#GUY.
You - you've got me, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
The plans. The plans.
#GUY.
Ruth!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. I have killed the man I loved. Lest he became the beast I'd hate.
#MARTIN.
Ruth! For God's sake, loose my hands. Ruth Good - bye, Martin. They will be coming for me now.
