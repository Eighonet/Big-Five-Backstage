#ANSELM.
And you, who heed the colors of this show, Look to your laughter! - It doth body forth Judgment that may take you unaware, - Sun - struck with mirth, like unto chattering leaves Some wind of wrath shall scourge to nothingness. HANS, AXEL, AND OTHERS. Hurrah, Hurrah!
#JACOBUS.
And now, good townsmen all, Seeing we stand delivered and secure As once yon chosen creatures of the Ark, For a similitude, - our famine gone, Our plague of rats and mice, -
#CROWD.
Hurrah - hurrah!
#JACOBUS.
'Tis meet we render thanks more soberly -
#HANS.
Soberly, soberly, ay! -
#JACOBUS.
For our deliverance. And now, ye wit, it will be full three days Since we beheld - our late departed pest. -
#OLD URSULA.
What does he say?
#REYNARD.
- Oh, how felicitous!
#HANS' WIFE.
He's only saying there be no more rats.
#JACOBUS.
Three days it is; and not one mouse, - one mouse, One mouse, I say! - No - o - o! Quiet. . as a mouse. And now. .
#CROWD.
Long live Jacobus! -
#JACOBUS.
You have seen Noah and the Ark, most aptly happening by With these same play - folk. You have marked the Judgment. You all have seen the lost souls sent to - Hell - And, nothing more to do. - Yes, yes. - And now. .
#HANS.
Hath no man seen the Piper? - Please your worships.
#OTHERS.
Ay, ay, so! - Ay, where is he? - Ho, the Piper!
#JACOBUS.
Piper, my good man?
#HANS.
- He that charmed the rats!
#OTHERS.
Yes, yes, - that charmed the rats!
#JACOBUS.
Why, no man knows. - Which proves him such a random instrument As Heaven doth sometimes send us, to our use; Or, as I do conceive, no man at all, - man of air; or, I would say - delusion. He'll come no more.
#REYNARD.
Eh? - Oh, indeed, Meaow!
#JACOBUS.
'Tis clearest providence. The rats are gone. The man is gone. And there is nought to pay, Save peaceful worship.
#REYNARD.
Oh, indeed, - Meaow!
#KURT.
Silence, - you strollers there! Or I will have you Gaoled, one and all.
#PEOPLE.
No, Kurt the Syndic, no!
#BARBARA.
No; no! Ah, father, bid them stay awhile And play it all again. - Or, if not all, Do let us see that same good youth again, Who swallowed swords - between the Ark Preserved And the Last Judgment!
#REYNARD.
Michael - the - Sword - Eater, Laurels for thee!
#CHILDREN.
Oh, can't we see the animals in the Ark? Again? Oh, can't we see it all again?
#ILSE.
Oh, leave out Noah! And let's have only Bears And Dromedaries, and the other ones! -
#KURT.
Silence!
#JACOBUS.
Good people - you have had your shows; And it is meet, that having held due feast, Both with our market and this Miracle, We bring our holiday to close with prayer And public thanks unto Saint Willibald, - Upon whose day the rats departed thence.
#REYNARD.
Saint Willibald!
#BEAR.
- Saint Willibald!
#CROWD.
Saint Willibald! - And what had he to do With ridding us o' rats?
#HANS.
'T was the Piping Man Who came and stood here in the market - place, And swore to do it for one thousand guilders!
#PETER COBBL.
Ay, and he did it, too! - Saint Willibald!
#KURT.
Drive out those mountebanks! 'T is ever so. Admit them to the town and you must pay Their single show with riotings a week. - Look yonder at your daughter.
#JACOBUS.
Barbara!
#AXEL.
By your leave. Masters! I would like to know, How did Saint Willibald prevail with the rats? - That would I like to know. I, who ha' made Of strong wrought traps, two hundred, thirty - nine, Two hundred, thirty - nine.
#REYNARD.
And so would I!
#HANS.
So please your worships, may it please the Crier, Now we be here, - to cry the Piping Man -
#PETER COBBL.
stranger - man, gay - clad, - in divers colors! Because he, with said piping -
#HANS.
- Drave away The horde of rats!
#PETER COBBL.
To our great benefit; And we be all just men.
#OTHERS.
Ay, ay! - Amen!
#WOMEN.
Amen, Our Lady and the blessed Saints!
#JACOBUS.
Why, faith, good souls, if ye will have him cried, So be it. - But the ways of Heaven are strange! Mark how our angel of deliverance came, - Or it may be. Saint Willibald himself, - Most piedly clothed, even as the vilest player! - And straight ascended from us, to the clouds! But cry him, if you will. - Peace to your lungs! - He will not come.
#CRIER.
Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! Whereas, now three days gone, our Plague of Rats Was wholly driven hence, our City cleansed, Our peace restored after sore threat of famine, By a Strange Man who came not back again, Now, therefore, if this Man have ears to hear, Let him stand forth. - Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!
#ALL.
The Man! the Man!
#KURT AND JACOBUS.
The Devil! - 'T is -
#ALL.
- THE PIPER!
#PIPER.
Three days of rest, your worships, you have had. I see no signs of famine hereabout. The rats are gone, even to the nethermost tail: And I've fulfilled my bargain. Is it granted?
#JACOBUS.
One thou - Come, come! This was no sober bargain. - No man in reason could -
#PIPER.
One thousand guilders.
#KURT.
One thousand rogueries!
#JACOBUS.
You jest too far.
#AXEL.
Lucky, if he get aught! - Two hundred traps, And nine, and thirty! By Saint Willibald, When was I paid?
#AXEL'S WIFE.
Say, now!
#PIPER.
. One thousand guilders.
#PETER COBBL.
Give him an hundred.
#HANS.
Double!
#HANS' WIFE.
You were fools To make agreement with him. - Ask old Claus. He has the guilders; and his house was full 0' rats!
#OLD CLAUS.
You Jade! And I that hoard, and save, And lay by all I have from year to year, To build my monument when I am gone, fine new tomb there, in Saint Boniface! And I to pay for all your city rats!
#OLD URSULA.
Right, neighbor, right well said! - Piper, hark here. Piper, how did ye charm the rats away?
#PIPER.
The rats were led - by Cu - ri - os - ity. 'Tis so with many rats; and all old women; - Saving your health!
#JACOBUS.
No thought for public weal, In this base grasping on -
#PIPER.
One thousand guilders.
#KURT.
For piping!
#PIPER.
Shall I pipe them back again?
#HANS.
No, no; no fear o' that. The rats be drowned. We saw them with our eyes.
#PIPER.
Now who shall say There is no resurrection for a mouse?
#KURT.
- Do you but crop this fellow's ears! -
#VERONIKA.
Ah, Kurt!
#JACOBUS.
Deal patiently, good neighbor. All is well. Why do you name a price so laughable, My man? Call you to mind; you have no claim, - No scrip to show. You cling upon -
#PIPER.
Your word.
#JACOBUS.
I, would say - just -
#PIPER.
Your word.
#JACOBUS.
Upon -
#PIPER.
Your word. Sure, 't was a rotten parchment!
#JACOBUS.
This is a base, Conniving miser!
#PIPER.
Stand forth, Cheat - the - Devil!
#BARBARA.
That goodly sword - eater!
#PIPER.
So, Michael, so. - These be two friends of mine. Pay now an even third to each of us. Or, to content your doubts, to each of these Do you pay here and now, five hundred guilders. Who gets it matters little, for us friends. But you will pay the sum, friend. You will pay! - HANS, AXEL, AND CROWD. Come, there's an honest fellow. Ay, now, pay! - There's a good friend. - And would I had the same. - One thousand guilders? - No, too much. - No, no.
#KURT.
Pay jugglers? - With a rope apiece!
#JACOBUS.
Why - so -
#PIPER.
They are my friends; and they shall share with me. 'T is time that Hamelin reckoned us for men; - Hath ever dealt with us as we were vermin. Now have I rid you of the other sort - Right you that score! -
#KURT.
These outcasts!
#PIPER.
Say you so? Michael, my man! Which of you here will try With glass or fire, with him?
#MICHAEL.
No, no more glass, to - day!
#PIPER.
Then fire and sword! So! - And there's not one man In Hamelin, here, so honest of his word. Stroller! A pretty choice you leave us. - Quit This strolling life, or stroll into a cage! What do you offer him? A man eats fire - Swords, glass, young April frogs -
#CHILDREN.
Do it again! Do it again!
#PIPER.
You say to such a man, - 'Come be a monk! A weaver!' Pretty choice. Here's Cheat - the - Devil, now.
#PETER COBBL.
But what's his name?
#PIPER.
He doesn't know. What would you? Nor do I. But for the something he has seen of life, Making men merry, he 'd know something more! The gentlest devil ever spiked Lost Souls Into Hell - mouth, - for nothing - by - the - day!
#OLD URSULA.
Piper, why do you call him Cheat - the - Devil?
#PIPER.
Because his deviltry is all a cheat: - He is no devil, - but a gentle heart! - Friend Michael here hath played the Devil, betimes, Because he can so bravely breathe out fire. He plied the pitchfork so we yelped for mercy, - He reckoned not the stoutness of his arm! - But Cheat - the - Devil here, - he would not hurt Why - Kurt the Syndic - thrusting him in hell. No, no - I will not hurt him!
#PIPER.
Merry, boy! And, - if ye will have reasons, good, - ye see, - I want - one thousand guilders.
#JACOBUS.
In all surety, Payment you'll have, my man, But -
#HANS.
As to 's friends, - An that yon Devil be as feat wi' his hands As he be slow o' tongue, why, I will take him For prentice. Wife, - now that would smack o' pride!
#PETER COBBL.
I'll take this fellow that can swallow fire, He's somewhat old for me. But he can learn My trade. - A pretty fellow!
#PIPER.
And your trade?
#PETER COBBL.
Peter the cobbler. - What, I? Make shoes? I swallow fire.
#PIPER.
Enough.
#BARBARA.
I'll not believe it.
#PIPER.
Your trade?
#HANS.
I'm Hans the Butcher.
#MICHAEL.
Butcher? Butcher! Oh, no! I couldn't hurt them.
#JACOBUS.
Good people, we have wasted time enow. You see this fellow, that he has no writ -
#PIPER.
Why not, then? 'T was a bargain. If your word Hold only when 't is writ -
#KURT.
We cannot spend Clerkship on them that neither write nor read. What good would parchment do thee?
#JACOBUS.
My good man -
#PIPER.
Who says I cannot read? - Who says I cannot?
#OLD CLAUS.
Piper, don't tell me you can read in books!
#PIPER.
Books! Where's a book? Shew me a book, I say!
#OLD URSULA.
The Holy Book! Bring that - or he'll bewitch you.
#PIPER.
Oh, never fear. I charm but fools and children; Now that the rats are gone. - Bring me a Book: big one! -
#PIPER.
Ho, 't is too heavy! Come, you cherub - head, Here's too much laid upon one guardian angel!
#CROWD.
Read, read!
#KURT.
He cannot read.
#PIPER.
Turn - turn - there's nothing there. . Ah, turn again! The red one! - No, the green! The green one. So.
#PIPER.
What the green one says. -
#JANET.
Oh, I love the Man!
#JACOBUS.
Leave off this argument.
#KURT.
Go in to Mass.
#JACOBUS.
Saint Willibald!
#PIPER.
That Saint! -
#KURT.
Hence, wandering dog!
#PIPER.
Oho! - Well, every Saint may have his day. But there are dog - days coming. - Eh, your worship? You, there! You - Brother - Father - Uncle - You! Speak! Will you let them in, to say their prayers And mock me through their fingers? - Tell these men To settle it, among their mouldy pockets, Whether they keep their oath. Then will I go.
#KURT.
Away with you! -
#ANSELM.
The Piper should be heard; Ye know it well. Render to Caesar, therefore, That which is Caesar's.
#PIPER.
- Give the Devil his due!
#JACOBUS.
We must take counsel over such a sum.
#BARBARA.
Is it for pay you loiter, Master Player? Were you not paid enough?
#MICHAEL.
No. - One more look.
#BARBARA.
Here, then. - Still not enough?
#MICHAEL.
No! One more smile.
#BARBARA.
Why would you have me smile?
#MICHAEL.
Oh, when you smiled, It was - it was like sunlight coming through Some window there, - some vision of Our Lady.
#BARBARA.
Who are you? You are some one in disguise.
#MICHAEL.
man - that passes for a mountebank.
#BARBARA.
I knew!
#MICHAEL.
What then?
#BARBARA.
Thou art of noble birth. 'T is some disguise, this playing with the fire!
#MICHAEL.
Yes. - For to - day, I lord it with the fire. But it hath burned me, here.
#PIPER.
For all our sakes! There is bad weather breeding. - Take to thy heels.
#BARBARA.
Farewell to you, Sword - Swallower! - farewell!
#MICHAEL.
Farewell to you, my Lady, in - the - Moon.
#VERONIKA.
Darling. -
#PIPER.
Is this your Boy?
#VERONIKA.
Ay, he is mine; My only one. He loved thy piping so.
#PIPER.
And I loved his.
#HANS' WIFE.
Poor little boy! He's lame!
#PIPER.
'T is all of us are lame! But he, he flies.
#VERONIKA.
Jan, stay here if you will, and hear the pipe, At Church - time.
#PIPER.
Wilt thou?
#JANET.
Mother lets me stay Here with the Lonely Man.
#PIPER.
The Lonely Man?
#VERONIKA.
He always calls Him so.
#PIPER.
And so would I.
#VERONIKA.
It grieves him that the Head is always bowed, And stricken. But he loves more to be here Than yonder in the church.
#PIPER.
And so do I.
#VERONIKA.
What would you, darling, with the Lonely Man? What do you wait to see?
#JANET.
To see Him smile.
#PIPER.
You are some foreign woman. Are you not? Never from Hamelin!
#VERONIKA.
No.
#AXEL'S WIFE.
Then run along. And ask the Piper if he'll play again The tune that charmed the rats.
#ANOTHER.
They might come back!
#OLD URSULA.
Piper! I want the tune that charmed the rats! If they come back, I'll have my grandson play it.
#PIPER.
I pipe but for the children.
#ILSE.
Oh, do pipe Something for Fridolin!
#HANSEL.
Oh, pipe at me! Now I'm a mouse! I'll eat you up! Rr - rr! -
#CHILDREN.
Oh, pipe! Oh, play! Oh, play and make us dance! Oh, play, and make us run away from school!
#PIPER.
Why, what are these?
#CHILDREN.
We're mice, we're mice, we're mice! . We're mice, we're mice! We'll eat up everything!
#MARTIN'S WIFE.
'T is church - time. La, what will the neighbors say?
#ILSE.
Oh, please do play something for Fridolin!
#AXEL'S WIFE.
Do hear the child. She's quite the little mother! little mother? Ugh! How horrible. That fairy thing, that princess, - no, that Child! little mother? Drop the ugly thing!
#MARTIN'S WIFE.
Now, on my word! and what's amiss with mothers? Are mothers horrible?
#PIPER.
No, no. But - care And want and pain and age. . And penny - wealth, - And penny - counting. - Penny prides and fears - Of what the neighbors say the neighbors say! -
#MARTIN'S WIFE.
And were you born without a mother, then?
#ALL.
Yes, you there! Ah, I told you! He's no man. He's of the devil.
#MARTIN'S WIFE.
Who was your mother, then?
#PIPER.
Mine! - Nay, I do not know. For when I saw her, She was a thing so trodden, lost and sad, I cannot think that she was ever young, Save in the cherishing voice. - She was a stroller; My father was a stroller. - So, you have it! And since she clave to him, and hunger too, The Church's ban was on her. - Either live, Mewed up forever, - she! to be a nun; Or keep her life - long wandering with the wind; The very name of wife stript from her troth. That was my mother. - And she starved and sang; And like the wind, she roved and lurked and shuddered Outside your lighted windows, and fled by, Storm - hunted, trying to outstrip the snow, South, south, and homeless as a broken bird, - Limping and hiding! - And she fled, and laughed, And kept me warm; and died! To you, a Nothing; Nothing, forever, oh, you well - housed mothers! As always, always for the lighted windows Of all the world, the Dark outside is nothing; And all that limps and hides there in the dark; Famishing, - broken, - lost! And I have sworn For her sake and for all, that I will have Some justice, all so late, for wretched men, Out of these same smug towns that drive us forth After the show! - Or scheme to cage us up Out of the sunlight; like a squirrel's heart Torn out and drying in the market - place. My mother! Do you know what mothers are? - Your children! Do you know them? Ah, not you! There's not one here but it would follow me, For all your bleating!
#AXEL'S WIFE.
Kuno, come away!
#PIPER.
Oho, Oho! Look you? - You preach - I pipe!
#JACOBUS.
H'm! My good man, we have faithfully debated Whether your vision of so great a sum Might be fulfilled, - as by some miracle. But no. The moneys we administer Will not allow it; nor the common weal. Therefore, for your late service, here you have Full fifteen guilders, and a pretty sum Indeed, for piping!
#KURT.
Take them!
#JACOBUS.
Either that, Or, to speak truly, nothing! Come, come. Nay, count them, if you will.
#KURT.
Time goes!
#PIPER.
Ay. And your oath?
#KURT.
No more; Enough.
#VERONIKA.
Ah, Kurt!
#KURT.
What do ye, mewling of this fellow's rights? He hath none! - Wit ye well, he is a stroller, wastrel, and the shadow of a man! Ye waste the day and dally with the law. Such have no rights; not in their life nor body! We are in no wise bound. Nothing is his. He may not carry arms; nor have redress For any harm that men should put on him, Saving to strike a shadow on the wall! He is a Nothing, by the statute - book; And, by the book, so let him live or die, Like to a masterless dog!
#VOICES.
One thousand guilders to a 'masterless dog'!
#CHILDREN.
Oh, pipe again! Oh, pipe and make us dance! Oh, pipe and make us run away from school! Oh, pipe and make believe we are the mice!
#OLD URSULA.
The bell, the bell! the church bell! They're bewitched!
#OLD URSULA.
I told ye all, - I told ye! - Devils' bargains!
#KURT.
Peter the Sacristan! Give by the bell. What means this clangor?
#PETER SACR.
They're bewitched! bewitched!
#URSULA.
They're gone!
#KURT.
Thy wits!
#OLD CLAUS.
They're gone - they're gone - they're gone!
#PETER SACR.
The children!
#URSULA.
- With the Piper! They're bewitched! I told ye so.
#OLD CLAUS.
- I saw it with these eyes! He piped away the children.
#VERONIKA.
Jan - my Jan!
#KURT.
Thy boy! But mine, my three, all fair and straight. -
#AXEL'S WIFE.
'T was thy false bargain, thine; who would not pay The Piper. - But we pay!
#PETER SACR.
Bewitched, bewitched! The boys ran out - and I ran after them, And something red did trip me - 't was the Devil. The Devil!
#OLD URSULA.
Ah, ring on, and crack the bell: Ye'll never have them back. - I told ye so! Curtain
#JANET.
Oh! Oh, I thought. . I had a dream!
#PIPER.
Ahe?
#JANET.
I thought. . I dreamed. . somebody wanted me.
#PIPER.
Soho!
#JANET.
I thought. . Somebody Wanted me.
#PIPER.
How then?
#JANET.
I thought I heard Somebody crying.
#PIPER.
Pfui! - What a dream. - Don't make me cry again.
#JANET.
Oh, was it you? - Oh, yes!
#PIPER.
No Michael yet!
#ILSE.
Oh!
#HANSEL.
- Oh!
#PIPER.
Ahe?
#ILSE.
I thought I had a dream.
#PIPER.
Again?
#ILSE.
. It was some lady, calling me.
#HANSEL.
Yes, and a fat man called us to come quick; fat man, he was crying - about me! That same fat man I dreamt of, yesterday.
#PIPER.
Come, did you ever see a fat man cry, About a little Boy?
#HANSEL.
No, - Never.
#ILSE.
Never! Oh, what a funny dream!
#PIPER.
'T is Hans the Butcher. Well, what did he say?
#HANSEL.
'Come home, come home, come home!' But I didn't go. I don't know where. . Oh, what a funny dream!
#ILSE.
Mine was a bad dream! - Mine was a lovely lady And she was by the river, staring in.
#PIPER.
You were the little gold - fish, none could catch. Oh, what a funny dream! . No Michael yet. Come, bread and broth! Here - not all, three at a time; 'T is simpler. Here, you kittens. Eat awhile; Then -
#RUDI.
Oh! I had a dream, - an awful dream!
#PIPER.
Oh! oh! I had a dream!
#CHILDREN.
Oh, tell it to us!
#PIPER.
I dreamed. . a Stork. . had nested in my hat.
#CHILDREN.
Oh!
#PIPER.
And when I woke -
#CHILDREN.
You had -
#PIPER.
One hundred children!
#CHILDREN.
Oh, it came true! Oh, oh; it all came true!
#THE STROLLERS.
Ah, ho, ho, ho!
#PIPER.
Look you. - No Michael yet! - And he is gone Full three days now, - three days. If he be caught, Why then, - the little ravens shall be fed! Enough that Cheat - the - Devil leaked out too; - No foot but mine shall quit this fox - hole now! And you, - think praise for once, you have no tongue, And keep these magpies quiet. Ah, that girl. The Burgomeister's Barbara! But for her, And moon - struck Michael with his 'one more look'! Where is he now? - And where are we? So, so.
#RUDI.
Oh, I remember now! - Before I woke. . Oh, what an awful dream!
#ILSE.
Oh, tell us, Rudi, - Oh, scare us, - Rudi, scare us! -
#RUDI.
. Lump was dead! Lump, Lump! -
#PIPER.
Who's Lump?
#RUDI.
Our Dog!
#PIPER.
The Dog! - No, no. Heaven save us - I forgot about the dogs!
#RUDI.
He Wanted me; - and I always wasn't there! And people tied him up, - and other people Pretended that he bit. - He never bites! He Wanted me, until it broke his heart, And he was dead!
#PIPER.
And then he went to heaven, To chase the happy cats up all the trees; - Little white cats! . He wears a golden collar . And sometimes - I'd forgot about the dogs! Well, dogs must suffer, so that men grow wise. 'T was ever so.
#CHILDREN.
Oh, what a funny dream!
#JANET.
What is it?
#PIPER.
People; passing down below, In the dark valley. Do you want to see them?
#CHILDREN.
Don't let them find us! What an ugly noise. - No, no - don't let them come!
#PIPER.
Hark ye to me. Some day I'll take you out with me to play; High in the sun, - close to the water - fall . . And we will make believe - We'll make believe We're hiding! .
#CHILDREN.
Yes, yes! Oh, let us make believe!
#STROLLERS.
Oho, ho, ho! - A make - believe! - Ho, ho!
#PIPER.
But, if you're good, - yes, very, very soon I'll take you, as I promised, -
#CHILDREN.
- Gypsies, oh!
#PIPER.
Yes, with the gypsies. We shall go at night, With just a torch -
#CHILDREN.
Oh!
#PIPER.
Like fire - flies! Will - o' - the - wisps! And make believe we're hiding, all the way, Till we come out into a sunny land, - All vines and sunlight, yes, and men that sing! Far, far away - forever.
#JANET.
Oh, wasn't that one beautiful? - Now you!
#PIPER.
The rainbow - bridge by day; - And borrow a shepherd - crook! At night we take to the Milky Way; And then we follow the brook! We'll follow the brook, whatever way The brook shall sing, or the sun shall say, Or the mothering wood - dove coos! And what do I care, what else I wear, If I keep my rainbow shoes!
#CHILDREN.
Oh dear! What lovely shoes! Oh, which are mine? Oh! Oh! - What lovely shoes! Oh, which are mine?
#PIPER.
Try, till you see. But these, - these are for Jan.
#ILSE.
Oh, those are best of all! And Jan -
#PIPER.
And Jan Is not to trudge, like you. Jan is to wear Beautiful shoes, and shoes made most of all, To look at!
#CHILDREN.
Oh! Where did you find the wings? Bird's wings!
#PIPER.
There was some hunter in the woods, Who killed more birds than he could carry home. He did not want these, - though the starling did, But could not use them more! And so, - And so, - They trim a little boy.
#CHILDREN.
O Jan! - O Jan! Oh! see my shoes!
#PIPER.
Hey day, what now?
#JANET.
I wish. .
#PIPER.
What do you wish? Wish for it! - It shall come.
#JANET.
I wish - that I could show them - to the Man, The Lonely Man.
#PIPER.
Thou! - 'T would make me a proud man.
#JANET.
Oh! it would make Him smile!
#TRUDE.
I had a dream! dream! I know! - Oh, what a funny dream!
#CHEAT-THE-DEVIL.
He does not wear his red hood. He has a garland round his neck, and a basket on his arm.
#PIPER.
No Michael yet! Michael! - Where's Michael? Look you, - you must wait. We must be cunning. - There's a squirrel, mark you, Hopped after me! He would have found us out. I wanted him; I loved him. But I ran. For once a squirrel falls a - talking. - Ah! Look what I have. - Guess, guess!
#CHILDREN.
Cakes! Shoes! Then - honey!
#PIPER.
Ah, Cheat - the - Devil! They would crop your ears. Where had you this? Why, such a kind old farmer! He'd left his bee - hives; they were all alone; And the bees know me. So I brought this for you; I knew They 'd like it. - Oh, you're happy now!
#PIPER.
But Michael, - have they caught him? Oh, not they! I heard no word of Michael; Michael's safe! Once on the road I met a countryman, Asked me the way. And not a word I spoke! 'Tis far the wisest. Twenty riddles he asked me. I smiled and wagged my head. Anon cries he, This Fool is deaf and dumb!' - That made me angry, But still I spoke not. - And I would not hurt him! He was a bad man. But I liked the mule. - Now am I safe! - Now am I home at last!
#PIPER.
'St. - Met you any people on the way, Singing? No, growling, - growling dreary psalms All on a sunny day! Behind the hedges, I saw them go. They go from Hamelin, now; And I know why! -
#PIPER.
To be a Nun! penance for them all. She weeps; but she must go! All they, you see, Are wroth against him. - He must give his child - nun! Forever! - She, who smiled at Michael. Look you, she weeps! They are bad people all; - Nothing like these.
#PIPER.
To lock her up! A maiden, shut away Out of the light. To cage her there for life, Cut off her hair; pretend that she is dead! - Horrible, horrible! No, I'll not endure it. I'll end this murder. - He shall give up his; But never so! - Not so! - While I do live To let things out of cages! - Tell me, quick! - When shall it happen? Why, it falls to - day. I saw two herds of people going by, To be there well aforetime, for the sight. And she is going last of all, at noon; All sparkling, like a Bride. - I heard them tell.
#PIPER.
No, never, never! - No, it shall not be! Hist! -
#PIPER.
So! - You had like to have hanged us.
#MICHAEL.
- What of that?
#PIPER.
All for a lily maiden.
#MICHAEL.
Ah, - thy pipe! How will it save her? - Save her! Tune thy pipe To compass that! - You do not know -
#PIPER.
I know. Tell me no more. - I say it shall not be! To heel, lad! No, I follow, - none but I! Go, - go! Do you bide here and shepherd these.
#CHILDREN.
Where are you going? - Take us too! - us too! - Oh, take us with you? - Take us!
#PIPER.
No, no, no! You shall be kittens all. And chase your tails, Till I come back! - So here!
#CHILDREN.
Me too! - Me too! Let me make tails, - let me!
#PIPER.
Faith, and you shall. master tailor! - Come, here's food for thought. Think all, - And hold your tongues, there! - If a Cat - If a Cat have - as all men say - Nine Lives, And if Nine Tailors go to make a Man, How long, then, shall it take one Man turned Tailor To keep a Cat in Tails, until she die?
#CHILDREN.
Come home - come home!
#PIPER.
And you shall see my -
#CHILDREN.
Something Beautiful! Oh, oh, what is it? - Oh, and will it play? Will it play music?
#PIPER.
Yes.
#PIPER.
And hear it pipe and call, and dance, and sing. Heja! - And hark you all. You have to mind - The Rainbow!
#MICHAEL.
QUICK! - tell me -
#PIPER.
Patience.
#MICHAEL.
Patience? - Death and hell! Oh, save her - save her! Give the children back.
#PIPER.
Never. Have you betrayed us?
#MICHAEL.
I! - betrayed?
#PIPER.
So, so, lad.
#MICHAEL.
But to save her -
#PIPER.
There's a way, - Trust me! I save her, or we swing together Merrily, in a row. - How did you see her?
#MICHAEL.
By stealth: two days ago, at evening, Hard by the vine - hid wall of her own garden, I made a warbling like a nightingale; And she came out to hear. serenade! Under the halter!
#MICHAEL.
Hush. - A death - black night, Until she came. - Oh, how to tell thee, lad! She came, - she came, not for the nightingale, But even dreaming that it would be I!
#PIPER.
She knew you? - We are trapped, then.
#MICHAEL.
No, not so! She smiled on me. - Dost thou remember how She smiled on me that day? Alas, poor maid, She took me for some noble in disguise! And all these days, - she told me, - she had dreamed That I would come to save her!
#PIPER.
Said she this?
#MICHAEL.
All this - all this, and more! . What could lies do? - I lied to her of thee; I swore I knew not of thy vanishment, Nor the lost children. But I told her true, I was a stroller and an outcast man That hid there, like a famished castaway, For one more word, without a hope, - a hope; Helpless to save her.
#PIPER.
And she told thee then, She goes to be a nun?
#MICHAEL.
Youth to the grave! And I - vile nothing - cannot go to save her, Only to look my last -
#PIPER.
Who knows?
#MICHAEL.
Ah, thou! -
#PIPER.
Poor Nightingale!
#MICHAEL.
Oh, but the scorn of her!
#PIPER.
She smiled on thee.
#MICHAEL.
Until she heard the truth: - juggler, - truly, - and no wandering knight! Oh, and she wept. Let us all hang together.
#PIPER.
Thanks. Kindly spoken. - Not this afternoon!
#MICHAEL.
Thou knowest they are given up for dead?
#PIPER.
Truly.
#MICHAEL.
Bewitched?
#PIPER.
So are they.
#MICHAEL.
Sold to the Devil?
#PIPER.
Pfui! But who else? Of course. This same old Devil! This kind old Devil takes on him all we do! Who else is such a refuge in this world? Who could have burned the abbey in this place, Where holy men did live? Why, 't was the Devil! And who did guard us one secluded spot By burying a wizard at this cross - ways? - So none dare search the haunted, evil place! The Devil for a landlord! - So say I! And all we poor, we strollers, for his tenants; We gypsies and we pipers in the world, And a few hermits and sword - swallowers, And all the cast - aways that Holy Church Must put in cages - cages - to the end! Take heart! I swear, - by all the stars that chime! I'll not have things in Cages!
#MICHAEL.
Barbara! So young, - so young and beautiful!
#PIPER.
And fit To marry with friend Michael!
#MICHAEL.
Do not mock.
#PIPER.
I mock not. -
#MICHAEL.
Ay, she laughed, On that first day. But still she gazed. - I saw Her, all the while! I swallowed -
#PIPER.
Prodigies! thousand swallows, and no summer yet! But now, - 't is late to ask, - why did you not Swallow her father? - That had saved us all.
#MICHAEL.
They will be coming soon. They will cut off All her bright hair, - and wall her in forever.
#PIPER.
Never. They shall not.
#MICHAEL.
Will you give them back, Now?
#PIPER.
I will never give them back. Be sure.
#MICHAEL.
And she is made an offering for the town! I heard it of the gossips. - They have sworn Jacobus shall not keep his one ewe - lamb While all the rest go childless.
#PIPER.
And I swear That he shall give her up, - to none but thee!
#MICHAEL.
You cannot do it!
#PIPER.
Have I lived like Cain, But to make good one hour of Life and Sun? And have I got this Hamelin in my hands, To make it pay its thousand cruelties With such a fool's one - more? . - You know right well, 'T was not the thousand guilders that I wanted For thee, or me, or any! - Ten would serve. But there it ached; there, in the money - bag That serves the town of Hamelin for an heart! That stab was mortal! And I thrust it deep. Life, life, I wanted; safety, - sun and wind! - And but to show them how that daily fear They call their faith, is made of blasphemies That would put out the Sun and Moon and Stars, Early, for some last Judgment! And the Lord, Where will He get His harpers and singing - men And them that laugh for joy? - From Hamelin guilds? - Will you imagine Kurt the Councillor Trying to sing?
#MICHAEL.
His lean throat freeze! - But she - Barbara! Barbara! -
#PIPER.
Patience. She will come, Dressed like a bride.
#MICHAEL.
Ah, do not mock me so.
#PIPER.
I mock not.
#MICHAEL.
She will never look at me.
#PIPER.
Rather than be a nun, I swear she will Look at thee twice, - and with a long, long look.
#VOICES.
Dies irae, dies illa Solvet saeclum in favilla, Teste David cum Sibylla. Quantus tremor est futurus, Quando judex est venturus, Cuncta stricte discussurus!
#PIPER.
Bah, how they whine! Why do they drag it so?
#MICHAEL.
Oh, can it be the last of all? O Saints! - O blessed Francis, Ursula, Catherine! Hubert - and Crispin - Pantaleone - Paul! George o' the Dragon! - Michael the Archangel!
#PIPER.
Michael Sword - eater, canst not swallow a chant? The well, the well! - Take care.
#VOICES.
Inter oves locum praesta, Et ab hoedis me sequestra, Statuens in parte dextra. Confutatis maledictis, Flammis acribus addictis: Voca me cum benedictis.
#MICHAEL.
She is so beautiful, - how dare, I tell her? My heart, how beautiful! The blessed saint! . Fear nothing, fairest Lady. - You are saved.
#BARBARA.
Yes, yes - I must - I must - I must. .
#MICHAEL.
Look, I will guard you like a princess, here; Yes, like Our Lady's rose - vine.
#BARBARA.
Ah, my heart!
#PIPER.
Mine?
#MICHAEL.
Thine? - So was it? All a trap? Cock's blood! Thine, thine! - And thou hast piped her wits away. Thine!
#PIPER.
No, not mine!
#BARBARA.
Why did you steal me hence? When did you love me? - Was it on first sight?
#PIPER.
I, love thee?
#MICHAEL.
- Knave! thief! liar!
#PIPER.
- Give me breath.
#BARBARA.
Where are you taking me? Taking thee?
#MICHAEL.
He shall not steal thee!
#BARBARA.
I must follow him.
#PIPER.
No! 'T is too much. You shall not follow me! I'll not be followed. - Damsel, sit you down. Here is too much! I love you not.
#BARBARA.
You do not? Why did you pipe to me?
#MICHAEL.
- And steal her wits, Stealer of all the children!
#BARBARA.
Are they safe?
#PIPER.
Oh, your good faith! - They're safe.
#BARBARA.
I knew - I knew it!
#PIPER.
And so art thou. But never shall they go To Hamelin more; and never shale thou go To be a nun.
#BARBARA.
To be a nun, - no, no! Ah me, I'm spent. Sir, take me with you.
#MICHAEL.
Rid her of the spell! Is this thy pledge?
#PIPER.
I do but rub my wits - To think - to think. What shall I do with her, Now that she's here! - Suppose her bound to stay! Hearken. - You, Michael, on to Rudersheim -
#MICHAEL.
And leave her here? No, no!
#PIPER.
Then take the girl.
#BARBARA.
To Rudersheim? No, never, never!
#PIPER.
Well . Hearken. - There is the hermit, over the hill. But how - suppose she will not marry him? I will not take her where the children are. And yet - Hark, now; - hark, now, and tell me truly; Can you spin cloth?
#BARBARA.
Spin?
#PIPER.
Can you make shoes?
#BARBARA.
I - I make shoes! - Fellow!
#PIPER.
So.
#MICHAEL.
Art thou mad!
#PIPER.
With me you may not go! But you'll be safe. Hearken: - you, Michael, go to Rudersheim; And tell the nuns -
#BARBARA.
No, no! I dare not have it! Oh, they would send and take me! No, no, no!
#PIPER.
Would you go back to Hamelin?
#BARBARA.
No - no - no! Ah, I am spent.
#MICHAEL.
All this, your work!
#PIPER.
Not mine. This is no charm. It is all youth and grief, And weariness. And she shall follow you. - Tell the good nuns you found her sore bewitched, Here in this haunt of 'devils'; - clean distraught. No Church could so receive a dancing nun! Tell them thou art an honest, piteous man Desires to marry her.
#MICHAEL.
Marry the Moon!
#PIPER.
No, no, the Moon for me! - She shall be yours; And here she sleeps, until her wits be sound. The sun's still high. 'T is barely afternoon. - 'T is - no, the time is going! - On my life, I had forgot Them! - And They will not stay After the Rainbow fades.
#MICHAEL.
Art thou moon - mad?
#PIPER.
No. Stir not! Keep her safe! I come anon. But first I go. - They'll not mind Cheat - the - Devil! They'll creep, to find out where the Rainbow went. I know them! So would I! - They'll all leak out!
#MICHAEL.
Stay - stay!
#PIPER.
No; guard her, you! - Anon, anon!
#MICHAEL.
But you will pipe her up and after you!
#PIPER.
Do you fear this? Then keep it till I come. You bide! - The Other cannot.
#MICHAEL.
Who?
#PIPER.
The Rainbow, The Rainbow! - Curtain
#PIPER.
Out of your cage, Come out of your cage And take your soul on a pilgrimage! Pease in your shoes, an if you must! - But out and away, before you're dust: Scribe and Stay - at - home, Saint and Sage, Out of your cage, Out of your cage! - Ho, help! Good Michael, Michael, loose the charm! Michael, have mercy! I'm bewitched! -
#MICHAEL.
Cock's faith! Still mocking! - Well ye know, it will not play Such games for me.
#PIPER.
Be soothed, - 'twas as I guessed, All of them hungry, - and the Rainbow going; - And Cheat - the - Devil pining in a corner. 'Twas well I went: they were for leaking out, And then, - lopped ears for two!
#MICHAEL.
Oh, that will come.
#PIPER.
Never believe it! We have saved her, look you; We save them all! No prison walls again, For anything so young, in Hamelin there. Wake her, and see.
#MICHAEL.
Ay, wake her. But for me, Her sleep is gentler.
#PIPER.
Nay, but wait. - Good faith, Wait. We have broke the bars of iron now; Still there are golden! - 'Tis her very self Is caged within herself. Once coax her out, Once set her own heart free! -
#MICHAEL.
Wake her, and see!
#PIPER.
Mind your eyes, tune your tongue! Let it never be said, but sung, but sung, 'Out of your cage, out of your cage!' Maiden, maiden, -
#BARBARA.
Oh! - you have come to save me. They are gone. All this, for love of me!
#PIPER.
No, no - I - No!
#BARBARA.
You - you are robbers?
#PIPER.
No! Blood on the Moon! This is the maddest world I ever blinked at. - Fear nothing, maiden. I will tell you all. Come, sit you down; and Michael shall keep watch From yonder hillock, lest that any pass. Fear nothing. None will pass: they are too sure The Devil hath this cross - ways! - Sit you down.
#BARBARA.
Not love? And yet . you do not want my pearls? Then why -
#PIPER.
For why should all be love or money? Money! Oho, - that mouldy thousand guilders You think of! - But it was your Hamelin friends That loved the guilders, and not I.
#BARBARA.
Then why - Why did you steal me hence?
#PIPER.
Why did yourself Long to be stolen?
#BARBARA.
Ah! to be shut up. . Forever, - young - alive!
#PIPER.
Alive and singing; Young, - young; - and four thick walls and no more sun, No music, and no wandering, and no life! Think you, I would not steal ail things alive Out of such doom? - How can I breathe and laugh While there are things in cages? - You are free; And you shall never more go back again.
#BARBARA.
And you, who are you then?
#PIPER.
How do I know? Moths in the Moon! - Ask me a thing in reason.
#BARBARA.
And 't was not . that you loved me.
#PIPER.
Loved thee? No! - Save but along with squirrels, and bright fish, And bubbling water.
#BARBARA.
Then where shall I go?
#PIPER.
Oh, little bird, - is that your only song? Go? Everywhere! Here be no walls, no hedges, No tolls, no taxes, - rats nor aldermen! Go, say you? Round the world, and round again! - Ah, she was Hamelin - born. But there's a man, - Sky - true, sword - strong, and brave to look upon; One that would thrust his hand in dragon's mouth For your bright sake; one that would face the Devil, Would swallow fire -
#BARBARA.
You would?
#PIPER.
I? - No, not I! Michael, - yon goodman Michael.
#BARBARA.
stroller! - oh, nought but a wandering man. PIPER,. Well, would you have a man take root, I ask?
#BARBARA.
That swallows swords. .
#PIPER.
Is he a comely man?
#BARBARA.
That swallows swords! -
#PIPER.
What's manlier to swallow? Did he but swallow pancakes, were that praise? Pancakes and sausage, like your Hamelin yokels? He swallows fire and swords, I say, and more. And yet this man hath for a whole noon - hour Guarded you while you slept; - still as a dove, Distant and kind as shadow; giant - strong For his enchanted princess, - even you.
#BARBARA.
So you bewitched me, then.
#PIPER.
How do I know?
#BARBARA.
Where are the children?
#PIPER.
I'll not tell you that. You are too much of Hamelin.
#BARBARA.
You bewitched them!
#PIPER.
Yes, so it seems. But how? - Upon my life, 'T is more than I know, - yes, a little more. Sometimes it works, and sometimes no. There are Some things upon my soul, I cannot do.
#BARBARA.
Not even with thy pipe?
#PIPER.
Not even so. Some are too hard. - Yet, yet, I love to try: And most, to try with all the hidden charms I have, that I have never counted through.
#BARBARA.
Where are they?
#PIPER.
Here.
#BARBARA.
What are they?
#PIPER.
How do I know? If I knew all, why should I care to live? No, no! The game is What - Will - Happen - Next?
#BARBARA.
And what will happen?
#PIPER.
Ah! how do I know? It keeps me searching. 'T is so glad and sad And strange to find out, What - Will - Happen - Next! And mark you this: the strangest miracle. .
#BARBARA.
Yes! -
#PIPER.
Stranger than the Devil or thy Judgment; Stranger than piping, - even when I pipe! Stranger than charming mice - or even men -
#BARBARA.
What is it? What?
#PIPER.
Why, - what may come to pass Here in the heart. There is one very charm -
#BARBARA.
Oh!
#PIPER.
Are you brave?
#BARBARA.
Oh!
#PIPER.
Will you drink the philter?
#BARBARA.
'Tis. . some enchantment?
#PIPER.
'T is a love philter.
#BARBARA.
Oh, tell me first -
#PIPER.
Why, sooth, the only charm In it, is Love. It is clear well - water.
#BARBARA.
Only well - water?
#PIPER.
Love is only Love. It must be philters, then?
#MICHAEL.
I am glad at least, fair lady, To think how my poor show did give you pleasure That day - that day when -
#BARBARA.
Ah! that day of doom!
#MICHAEL.
What is your will?
#BARBARA.
I know not; and I care not! Oh, it is true. - And he a sword - eater!
#PIPER.
Michael, your cup.
#BARBARA.
I must, - I must.
#PIPER.
Your mother?
#BARBARA.
I have no mother; Nor any father, more. He gave me up.
#PIPER.
That did he! - For a round one thousand guilders! Weep not, I say. First, loose you, heart and shoes, From Hamelin. Put off now, the dust, the mould, The cobble - stones, the little prying windows; The streets that dream o' What the Neighbors Say. Think you were never born there. Think some Breath Wakened you early - early on one morning, Deep in a Garden , Where voices of wild waters bubbling ran, Shaking down music from glad mountain - tops, - Where the still peaks were burning in the dawn, Like fiery snow, - down into greenest valleys, That do off their blue mist only to show Some deeper blue, some haunt of violets. No voice you heard, nothing you felt or saw, Save in your heart, the tumult of young birds, nestful of wet wings and morning - cries, Throbbing for flight! . Then, - for your Soul, new wakened, felt athirst, You turned to where that call of water led, Laughing for truth, - all truth and star - like laughter! Beautiful water, that will never stay, But runs and laughs and sparkles in the heart, And sends live laughter trickling everywhere, And knows the thousand longings of the Earth! And as you drank it then, so now, drink here;
#BARBARA.
Ah! -
#PIPER.
Do you see - a -
#BARBARA.
.Michael!
#PIPER.
So! - And a good one. And you call him?
#BARBARA.
. Michael.
#PIPER.
So. - 'Tis a world of wonders, by my faith! - What is the fairest thing you see but -
#BARBARA.
Michael.
#PIPER.
And is he comely as a man should be? And strong? - And wears good promise in his eyes, And keeps it with his heart and with his hands? And would you fear to go with him? -
#BARBARA.
No, no!
#PIPER.
Then reach to him that little hand of yours.
#BARBARA.
And can he talk? -
#PIPER.
Yes, yes. - The maid's bewildered. Fear nothing. Thou'rt so dumb, man! - Yes, yes, yes. Only he kneels; he cannot yet believe. Speak roundly to him. - Will you go with him? He will be gentler to you than a father: He would be brothers five, and dearest friend, And sweetheart, - ay, and knight and serving - man!
#BARBARA.
Yes, yes, I know he will. And can he talk, too?
#PIPER.
Lady, you have bewitched him.
#MICHAEL.
Oh! dear Lady, With you - with you, I dare not ope my mouth Saving to sing, or pray!
#PIPER.
Let it be singing! Lad, 't is a wildered maiden, with no home Save only thee; and she is more a child Than yesterday.
#MICHAEL.
Oh, lordly, wondrous world! - How is it, Sweet, you smile upon me now?
#BARBARA.
Sure I have ever smiled on thee. How not? Art thou not Michael? - And thou lovest me. And I love thee! - If I unloved thee ever, It was some spell. - But this, - ah, This is I!
#PIPER.
It is all true, - all true. Lad, do not doubt; The golden cage is broken.
#MICHAEL.
Oh! more strange Than morning dreams! I am like one new - born; I am a speechless babe. - And this is she, My Moon I cried for, - here, -
#PIPER.
It is thy bride.
#MICHAEL.
Thou wilt not fear to come with me?
#BARBARA.
With thee? With thee! Ah, look! What have I more than thee? And thou art mine, tall fellow! How comes it now Right happily that I am pranked so fair! And all this came so near to burying; This!
#MICHAEL.
And this dearer gold.
#BARBARA.
All, all for thee! - Look, - I will be thy garden that we lost, Yea, everywhere, - in every wilderness. There shall none fright us with a flaming sword! But I will be thy garden!
#PIPER.
See, - how the sunlight soon shall pour red wine To make your marriage - feast! - And do you hear That faery bell? - No fear! - 'T is some white creature, Seeking her whiter lamb. - Go; find our hermit; And he shall bless you, - as a hermit can! And be your pledge for shelter. There's the path. - Follow each other, close!
#MICHAEL.
Beyond the Sun! golden afternoon, - and all is well!
#PIPER.
If you can only catch them while they're young!
#PIPER.
Hist! Who dared? . Jan! -
#PIPER.
Who dared, I say? woman. - 'T is a woman!
#VERONIKA.
. Ah, - ah, - ah!
#PIPER.
That woman!
#VERONIKA.
He is coming! - He is here!
#PIPER.
Woman . what do you, wandering, with that bell? That herd - bell?
#VERONIKA.
Oh! are you man or cloud? . Where is my Jan? Jan, - Jan, - the little lame one! He is mine. He lives, I know he lives. I know - yes, yes, You've hidden him. I will be patient. - Yes.
#PIPER.
Surely he lives!
#VERONIKA.
- Lives! will you swear it? Ah, - I will believe! But he . is not so strong As all the others.
#PIPER.
Aie, how horrible! Sit you down here. You cannot go away While you are yet so pale. Why are you thus?
#VERONIKA.
You, who have torn the hearts out of our bodies And left the city like a place of graves, - Why am I spent? - Ah, ah! - But he's alive! Yes, yes, he's living.
#PIPER.
Oh, how horrible! Why should he not be living? - What am I?
#VERONIKA.
I do not know.
#PIPER.
Do you take me for the Devil?
#VERONIKA.
I do not know.
#PIPER.
Yet you were not afraid?
#VERONIKA.
What is there now to fear?
#PIPER.
Where are the townsfolk?
#VERONIKA.
They are all gone to Rudersheim. .
#PIPER.
How so?
#VERONIKA.
Where, for a penance, Barbara, Jacob's daughter, Will take the veil. His one, for all of ours! It will be over now.
#PIPER.
Have none returned?
#VERONIKA.
I know not; I am searching, since the dawn.
#PIPER.
To - day?
#VERONIKA.
And every day.
#PIPER.
That herd - bell, there Why do you bring it?
#VERONIKA.
Oh, he loves them so. I knew, if he but heard it, he would follow -
#PIPER.
No more. I know!
#VERONIKA.
An if he could!
#PIPER.
You hurt me Somewhere, - you hurt me!
#VERONIKA.
You! - A man of air?
#PIPER.
What, am I that?
#VERONIKA.
What are you? - Give them back! Give them to me, I say. You have them hidden. Are they all living?
#PIPER.
Yes, yes.
#VERONIKA.
Give them back!
#PIPER.
No.
#VERONIKA.
But they live, they live?
#PIPER.
- Wilt thou believe me?
#VERONIKA.
And are they safe?
#PIPER.
Yes.
#VERONIKA.
And you hide them?
#PIPER.
Yes.
#VERONIKA.
And are they . warm?
#PIPER.
- Yes.
#VERONIKA.
Are they happy? - Oh, That cannot be! - But do they laugh, sometimes?
#PIPER.
Yes.
#VERONIKA.
- Then you'll give them back again!
#PIPER.
No, never.
#VERONIKA.
I must be patient.
#PIPER.
Woman, they all are mine. I hold them in my hands; they bide with me. What's breath and blood, - what are the hearts of children, To Hamelin, - while it heaps its money - bags?
#VERONIKA.
You cared not for the money.
#PIPER.
No? - You seem foreign woman, - come from very far, That you should know.
#VERONIKA.
I know. I was not born There. But you wrong them. There were yet a few Who would have dealt with you more honestly Than this Jacobus, or -
#PIPER.
Or Kurt the Syndic! Believe It not. Those two be tongue and brain For the whole town! I know them. And that town Stands as the will of other towns, a score, That make us wandering poor the things we are! It stands for all, unto the end of time, That turns this bright world black and the Sun cold, With hate, and hoarding; - all - triumphant Greed That spreads above the roots of all despair, And misery, and rotting of the soul! Now shall they learn - if money - bags can learn - What turns the bright world black, and the Sun cold; And what's that creature that they call a child! - And what this winged thing men name a heart Beating queer rhythms that they long to kill. - What is this hunger and this thirst to sing, To laugh, to fight, - to hope, to be believed? And what is truth? And who did make the stars? * * * * * I have to pay for fifty thousand hates, Greeds, cruelties; such barbarous tortured days tiger would disdain; - for all my kind! Not my one mother, not my own of kin, - All, all, who wear the motley in the heart Or on the body: - for all caged glories And trodden wings, and sorrows laughed to scorn. I, - I! - At last.
#VERONIKA.
Ah, me! How can I say: Yet make them happier than they let you be?
#PIPER.
Woman, you could! - They know not how to be Happy! They turn to darkness and to woe All that is made for joy. They deal with men As, far across the mountains, in the south, Men trap a singing thrush, put out his eyes, - And cage him up and bid him then to sing - Sing before God that made him, - yes, to sing! * * * * * I save the children. - Yes, I save them, so, Save them forever, who shall save the world! - Yes, even Hamelin. - But for only you, What do they know of Children? - Pfui, their own! Who knows a treasure, when it is his own? Do they not whine: 'Five mouths around the table; And a poor harvest. And now comes one more! God chastens us!' - Pfui! -
#VERONIKA.
. But I must be patient.
#PIPER.
You know, you know, that not one dared, save you, - Dared all alone, to search this devil's haunt.
#VERONIKA.
They would have died -
#PIPER.
But never risked their souls! That knew I also.
#VERONIKA.
Ah!
#PIPER.
'Young faces,' sooth, The old ones prate of! - Bah, what is't they want? 'Some one to work for me, when I am old; Some one to follow me unto my grave; Some one - for me!' Yes, yes. There is not one Old huddler - by - the - fire would shift his seat To a cold corner, if it might bring back All of the Children in one shower of light!
#VERONIKA.
The old, ah, yes! But not -
#PIPER.
The younger men? Aha! Their pride to keep the name alive; The name, the name, the little Hamelin name, Tied to the trade; - carved plain upon his gravestone! Wonderful! If your name must chain you, live, To your gaol of a house, your trade you love not, - why, Best go without a name, like me! - How now? Woman, - you suffer?
#VERONIKA.
Ah, yet could I laugh, Piper, yet could I laugh, for one true word, - But not of all men.
#PIPER.
Then of whom?
#VERONIKA.
Of Kurt.
#PIPER.
Bah, Kurt the Councillor! a man to curse.
#VERONIKA.
He is my husband.
#PIPER.
Thine? I knew it not. Thine? But it cannot be. He could not father That little Jan, - that little shipwrecked Star.
#VERONIKA.
Oh, then you love him? You will give him back?
#PIPER.
The son of Kurt?
#VERONIKA.
No, not his son! No, no. He is all mine, all mine. Kurt's sons are straight, And ruddy, like Kurt's wife of Hamelin there, Who died before.
#PIPER.
And you were wed. .
#VERONIKA.
So young, It is all like some dream before the sunrise, That left me but that little shipwrecked Star.
#PIPER.
Why did you marry Kurt the Councillor?
#VERONIKA.
He wanted me. Once I was beautiful.
#PIPER.
What, more than now?
#VERONIKA.
Mock if you will.
#PIPER.
I mock you; O Woman, . you are very beautiful.
#VERONIKA.
I meant, with my poor self, to buy him house And warmth, and softness for his little feet. Oh, then I knew not, - when we sell our hearts, We buy us nothing.
#PIPER.
Now you know.
#VERONIKA.
I know. His dearest home it was, to keep my heart Alone and beautiful, and clear and still; And to keep all the gladness in my heart, That bubbled from nowhere! - for him to drink; - And to be houseless of all other things, Even as the Lonely Man. Where is the child?
#PIPER.
No; that I will not tell. Only thus much: I love thy child. Trust me, - I love them, all. They are the brightest miracle I know. Wherever I go, I search the eyes of men To find such clearness; - and it is not there. Lies, greed and cruelty, and dreadful dark! And all that makes Him sad these thousand years, And keeps His forehead bleeding. - Ah, you know!
#VERONIKA.
Whom do you think on?
#PIPER.
Why, the Lonely Man, - But now I have the children safe with me; And men shall never teach them what men know; - Those radiant things that have no wish at all Save for what is all - beautiful! - the Rainbow, The running Water, and the Moon, the Moon! The only things worth having!
#VERONIKA.
- Oh, you will not Give him to me?
#PIPER.
How give you yours again, And not the others? What a life for him! And Kurt the Syndic, left without his sons? Bah, do not dream of it! What would Kurt do? - And hearken here! Should any hunt me down, Take care. Who then could bring the children back?
#VERONIKA.
Jan! Jan!
#PIPER.
He loves me. He is happy.
#VERONIKA.
No! Without me? - No.
#PIPER.
He has not even once Called you.
#VERONIKA.
Ah, ah! how cruel! 'Tis the spell, The spell.
#PIPER.
- You hurt me, here. What makes it, Woman? - Would you not have him happy?
#VERONIKA.
O my God!
#PIPER.
Drink here. Take heart. O Woman, they must stay! 'T is better so. No, no, I mock thee not. Thou foldest all about me like the Dark That holds the stars. I would I were thy child.|
#VERONIKA.
But I will find him. I will find him -
#PIPER.
No, It must not be! Their life is bound with mine. If I be harmed, they perish. Keep that word, Go, go!
#VERONIKA.
My longing will bring back my Own.
#PIPER.
Ah, long not so.
#VERONIKA.
Yes, it will bring him back! He breathes. And I will wish him home to me, Till my heart break!
#PIPER.
Hearts never break in Hamelin. Go, then; and teach those other ones to long; Wake up those dead!
#VERONIKA.
Peace. I shall draw him home.
#PIPER.
Not till he cries for thee.
#VERONIKA.
Oh, that will be Soon, - soon.
#PIPER.
Remember, - if one word of thine Set on the hounds to track me down and slay me, They will be lost forever; they would die, - They, who are in my keeping.
#VERONIKA.
Yea, I hear. But he will come . oh, he will come to me, Soon, - soon.
#PIPER.
I will not, no, I will not, Lonely Man! I have them in my hand. I have them all - All - all! And I have lived unto this day. You understand . You know what men they are. And what have they to do with such as these? Think of those old as death, in body and heart, Hugging their wretched hoardings, in cold fear Of moth and rust! - While these miraculous ones, Like golden creatures made of sunset - cloud, Go out forever, - every day, fade by With music and wild stars! - Ah, but You know. The hermit told me once. You loved them, too. But I know more than he, how You must love them: Their laughter, and their bubbling, skylark words To cool Your heart. Oh, listen, Lonely Man! - Oh, let me keep them! I will bring them to You, Still nights, and breathless mornings; they shall touch Your hands and feet with all their swarming hands, Like showering petals warm on furrowed ground, - All sweetness! They will make Thee whole again, With love. Thou wilt lookup and smile on us! Why not? I know - the half - You will be saying. You will be thinking of Your Mother. - Ah, But she was different. She was not as they. She was more like . this one, the wife of Kurt! Of Kurt! No, no; ask me not this, not this! Here is some dawn of day for Hamelin, - now! - Tis hearts of men You want. Not mumbled prayers; Not greed and carven tombs, not misers' candles; No offerings, more, from men that feed on men; Eternal psalms and endless cruelties! . Even from now, there may be hearts in Hamelin, Once stabbed awake! - I will not give them back! And Jan, - for Jan, that little one, that dearest To Thee and me, hark, - he is wonderful. Ask it not of me. Thou dost know I cannot! Look, Lonely Man! You shall have all of us To wander the world over, where You stand At all the crossways, and on lonely hills, - Outside the churches, where the lost ones And the wayfaring men, and thieves and wolves And lonely creatures, and the ones that sing! We will show all men what we hear and see; And we will make Thee lift Thy head, and smile. No, no, I cannot give them all! No, no. - Why wilt Thou ask it? - Let me keep but one. No, no, I will not. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Have Thy way. - I will!
#OLD URSULA.
No, no. They'll never come. I told ye so. They all are gone. There will be nothing young To follow us to the grave.
#OLD CLAUS.
No, no, - not one!
#HANS.
Well, well -
#AXEL.
God knows!
#HANS.
Neighbor, how fare your knees?
#AXEL.
I'm a changed man.
#HANS.
Peter the Sacristan, Give by the bell! It tolls like - Oh, well, well!
#AXEL.
It does no good, it does no good at all.
#PETER COBBL.
Rather, I do believe it mads the demons; And I have given much thought -
#AXEL.
Over thy shoes!
#PETER COBBL.
To demons.
#AXEL'S WIFE.
Let him chirp philosophy! He had no children.
#PETER COBBL.
I'm an altered man. Now were we not proceeding soberly, Singing a godly hymn, and all in tune, But yesterday, when we passed by -
#HANS' WIFE.
Don't say it! Don't name the curseful place.
#HANS.
- And my poor head, It goes round yet; - around, around, around, As I were new ashore from the high seas; Still dancing - dancing -
#AXEL.
With 'Yes - yes! - Yes - yes!'
#HANS.
Even as ye heard, the farmer's yokel found me Clasping a tree, and praying to stand still!
#AXEL.
Ay, ay, - but that is nought.
#PETER COBBL.
All nought beside.
#HANS' WIFE.
Better we had the rats and mice again, Though they did eat us homeless, - if we might All starve together! - Oh, my Hans, my Hans!
#PETER COBBL.
Hope not, good souls. Rest sure, they will not come.
#AXEL'S WIFE.
Who will say that?
#PETER COBBL.
Not I; but the Inscription,
#AXEL.
Of our own making?
#PETER COBBL.
On the Rathaus wall! At our own bidding it was made and graved: - How, - on that day and down this very street, He led them, - he, the Wonderfully - clothed, The Strange Man, with his piping; And they went, - And never came again.
#HANS' WIFE.
But they may come!
#PETER COBBL.
Marble is final, woman; - nay, poor soul! When once a man be buried, and over him The stone doth say Hic Jacet, or Here Lies, When did that man get up? - There is the stone. They come no more, for piping or for prayer; Until the trump of the Lord Gabriel. And if they came, 'tis not in Hamelin men To alter any stone, so graven. - Marble Is final. Marble has the last word, ever.
#HANS.
O little Ilse! - Oh! and Lump - poor Lump! More than a dog could bear! - More than a dog -
#PETER COBBL.
Bear up, sweet neighbors. - We are all but dust. No mice, no children. - Hem! And now Jacobus, - His child, not even safe with Holy Church, But lost and God knows where!
#AXEL'S WIFE.
Bewitched, - bewitched!
#HANS' WIFE.
Kind saints! Me out and gone to early mass, And all this mortal church - time, there's a candle, candle burning in the casement there; - Thou wasteful man!
#HANS.
Come, come! Do not be chiding. Suppose they came and could not see their way. Suppose - O wife! - I thought they'd love the light! I thought -
#PETER COBBL.
Ay, now! And there's another light In Kurt the Syndic's house.
#AXEL'S WIFE.
His wife, poor thing, The priest is with her. Ay, for once, they say, Kurt's bark is broken.
#OLD URSULA.
There will be nothing young To follow us to the grave.
#AXEL'S WIFE.
They tell, she seems Sore stricken since the day that she was lost, Lost, searching on the mountain. Since that time, She will be saying nought. She stares and smiles.
#HANS' WIFE.
And reaches out her arms, - poor soul!
#ALL.
Poor soul!
#AXEL.
That was no foolish thought of thine, yon candle. I do remember now as I look back, They always loved the lights. My Rudi there Would aye be meddling with my tinder - box. And once I - Oh! -
#AXEL'S WIFE.
Now, now! thou didst not hurt him! 'T was I! Oh, once - I shut him in the dark!
#AXEL.
Come home . and light the candles.
#PETER COBBL.
In the day - time!
#AXEL'S WIFE.
Oh, it is dark enough!
#AXEL.
Lord knows, who made Both night and day, one of 'em needs to shine! But nothing does! - Nothing is daylight now. Come, wife, we'll light the candles.
#PETER COBBL.
He's a changed man.
#PETER SACR.
God help us, what's to do?
#HANS' WIFE.
Neighbors!
#HANS.
Hark! Hark!
#AXEL'S WIFE.
Oh, I hear something! Can it be -
#PETER COBBL.
They're shouting.
#HANS.
My Iambs, - my lambs!
#AXEL.
'Tis naught - but Barbara His - his!
#PETER COBBL.
Jacobus!
#HANS.
Wife, - 't is none of ours.
#AXEL.
Let him snore on! - The only man would rather Sleep late than meet his only child again!
#PETER COBBL.
No man may parley with the gifts of Fortune! Jacobus!
#CROWD.
Barbara! - She that was bewitched! And who's the man? Is it the Piper? No! No, no - some stranger. Barbara! Barbara's home; - He never gave her up! - Who is the man?
#JACOBUS.
My daughter! 'Tis my daughter, - found - restored! Oh, heaven is with us!
#ALL.
Ah!
#JACOBUS.
Child, where have you been?
#ALL.
Ay, where, Jacobus?
#JACOBUS.
Who is this man? - Come hither.
#BARBARA.
Good - morning to you, father! We are wed. Michael, - shall I go hither?
#JACOBUS.
She is mad! She is quite mad, - my treasure.
#PETER COBBL.
Let her speak. Maids sometimes marry, even in Hamelin.
#ALL.
Ay, tell us! Who is he? Barbara? Art thou mad? - How came ye hither?
#JACOBUS.
Who is he?
#BARBARA.
Michael.
#PETER COBBL.
'Tis the Sword - Eater! friend o' the Piper's! - Hearken -
#ALL.
She's bewitched!
#HANS' WIFE.
This is the girl was vowed to Holy Church, For us and for our children that are lost!
#BARBARA.
Ay, and did any have a mind to me, When I was lost? Left dancing, and distraught?
#ALL.
We could not. We were spell - bound. Nay, we could not.
#JACOBUS.
We could not.
#BARBARA.
So! - But there was one who could. There was one man. And this is he. And I, I am no more your Barbara, - I am his. And I will go with him, over the world. I come to say farewell.
#JACOBUS.
He hath bewitched her!
#MICHAEL.
Why did we ever come? Poor darling one, Thy too - much duty hath us in a trap!
#AXEL.
No, no! - Fair play!
#OTHERS.
Don't let them go! We have them.
#PETER COBBL.
Hold what ye have. Be 't children, rats or mice!
#MICHAEL.
Save us! - They have him.
#MARTIN.
Help! Mark ye - I caught him! - Help, - and hold him fast!
#PIPER.
I came here, - frog!
#MARTIN.
Ay, he were coming on; And after him a squirrel, hopping close!
#SECOND MAN.
As no man ever saw a squirrel hop - Near any man from Hamelin! And I looked -
#MARTIN.
And it was he; and all we rush upon him - And take him!
#PIPER.
Loose thy claws, I tell thee I -
#ALL.
'Ware! Mercy! Let him go!
#VOICE FROM CROWD.
I have the squirrel!
#PIPER.
Let the squirrel go! Or you shall rue it. - Loose him! He's not mine.
#BARBARA.
Oh, let him go, - let be. His heart is clear, As water from the well!
#ALL.
She talks in her sleep! The maid's bewitched! Now, will ye hear?
#AXEL'S WIFE.
He piped and made thee dance!
#PETER COBBL.
'T was he bewitched us!
#BARBARA.
Whatever was, - it was for love of me.
#PIPER.
So!
#BARBARA.
He piped; - and all ye danced and fled away! He piped; - and brought me back my wandering wits, And gave me safe unto my Love again, - My Love I had forgotten. .
#PIPER.
So!
#MICHAEL.
Truly said.
#BARBARA.
Michael.
#JACOBUS.
Who is he, pray?
#BARBARA.
My own true love.
#PETER COBBL.
Now, is that all his name?
#BARBARA.
It is enough.
#JACOBUS.
- She's mad. Shall these things be?
#ALL.
The Children! The Children! Where are the Children? Piper! Pi - per! Piper!
#PIPER.
Quiet you. And hear me. I came to bring good tidings. In good faith, Of mine own will, I came. - And like a thief You haled me hither. - . Your children - live.
#ALL.
Thank God! I knew, I knew! We could not think them lost. Bewitched! Oh, but they live! - Piper! - O Piper!
#PETER COBBL.
They're spell - bound, - mark me!
#PIPER.
Ay, they are, - spell - bound: Fast bound by all the hardness of your hearts; Caged, - in the iron of your money - lust -
#ALL.
No, no, not all! Not I! Not mine, not mine! No, no, - it is not true.
#PIPER.
Your blasphemies, - your cunning and your Fear.
#ALL.
No, no! - What can we do? News, Piper, news! Where are your ridings, Piper?
#PIPER.
Now hear me. You did make Jacobus swear To give his child. - What recks it, how he lose her? - Either to Holy Church - against her will! - Or to this man, - so that he give her up! He swore to you. And she hath pledged her faith. She is fast wed. - Jacobus shall not have her. He breaks all bargains; and for such as he, You suffer. - Will you bear it?
#ALL.
No, no, no!
#PIPER.
Then she who was "Proud Barbara" doth wed Michael - the - Sword - Eater. - The pledge shall stand. Shall it?
#ALL.
It stands. Ay, ay!
#PIPER.
Your word!
#ALL.
We swear. We answer for him. So much for Jacobus!
#AXEL.
An' if yon fellow like an honest trade, I'll take him! - I'll make swords!
#ALL.
Quick, quick! - Our children. - Piper! - Tell us all!
#PIPER.
'T is well begun. - Now have I come to say: There is one child I may bring back to you, - The first.
#ALL.
Mine - mine! Let it be mine! Ours' - All of them! Now! Mine - mine - mine! - mine!
#PIPER.
- Oh, Hamelin to the end! Which of you longed the most, and dared the most? Which of you -
#ALL.
I! I! I! We searched the hills! We prayed four days! We fasted twenty hours - Mine! Mine! Mine - mine - mine - mine!
#PIPER.
Not yet. - They all do live Under a spell, - deep in a hollow hill. They sleep, and wake; and lead a charmed life. But first of all, - one child shall come again. Where is the wife - of Kurt, the Councillor?
#ALL.
No, mine, mine, mine!
#MARTIN'S WIFE.
What, that lame boy of hers?
#PIPER.
Where is the wife of Kurt?
#PETER COBBL.
- Veronika? The foreign woman? She is lying ill: Sore - stricken yonder -
#PIPER.
Bid her come, look out! Ho, - ho, within there!
#ANSELM.
Silence here! - Good people What means this?
#PIPER.
I have tidings for - the wife Of Kurt - the Councillor.
#ANSELM.
You are too late.
#PIPER.
Bid her - look out!
#ANSELM.
Her soul is passing, now.
#MARTIN'S WIFE.
'Tis he has done it!
#HANS.
- Nay, it is God's will. Poor soul!
#PETER SACR.
Don't anger him! 'T was Kurt the Syndic With his bad bargain.
#AXEL.
Do not cross the Piper!
#MARTIN.
Nay, but he's spent. He's nought to fear. - Look there. Mark how he breathes! Upon him! Help, help, ho! - Thou piping knave!
#OTHERS.
Tie - chain him! - Kill him! - Kill him!
#PETER COBBL.
Bind him, but do not kill him! - Oh, beware! What is he saying? - Peace.
#PIPER.
The wife of Kurt! Off! what can you do? - Oh! I came, I came Here, full of peace, and with a heart of love; - To give - but now that one live Soul of all Is gone! - No, no! - I say she shall not die! She shall not!
#ANSELM.
Hush! - She is in the hands of God. She is at peace.
#PIPER.
No, never! Let me by!
#ANSELM.
Thou froward fool! - Wouldst rend with tears again That shriven breath? And drag her back to sorrow? It is the will of God.
#PIPER.
- And I say No!
#ANSELM.
Who dare dispute -
#PIPER.
I dare!
#ANSELM.
With death? - With God?
#PIPER.
I know His will, for once! She shall not die. She must come back, and live! - Veronika! Where? - Where?
#PEOPLE.
He's lost the pipe. - He's hiding it! He cannot pipe them back! 'tis gone - 'tis gone. - No, 'tis to save his life. - It is for time.
#PIPER.
- 'T is but a voice. What matter? -
#PIPER.
Hush!
#ANSELM.
Peace, for this parting Soul!
#PIPER.
It shall not go. Veronika! - Ah, listen! - wife of Kurt. He comes . he comes! Open thine eyes a moment! Blow the faint fire within thy heart. He comes! Thy longing brings him; - ay, and mine, - and mine! Heed not these grave - makers, Veronika. Live, live, and laugh once more! - Oh! do you hear? Look, how you have to waken all these dead, That walk about you! - Open their dim eyes; Sing to them with your heart, Veronika, As I am piping, far away, outside! Waken them, - change them! Show them how to long, To reach their arms as you do, for the stars, And fold them in. Stay but one moment; - stay, And thine own Child shall draw thee back again Down here, to mother him, - mother us all! Oh, do you listen? - Do not try to answer, - I hear! - I hear. .
#BARBARA.
Listen!
#MICHAEL.
His very tune,
#MARTIN'S WIFE.
O Lord, have mercy! The Pipe is coming to him, through the air!
#ALL.
'T is coming to the Piper ; - we are lost. - The Pipe is coming, coming through the air!
#ANSELM.
Retro me, Sathanas!
#HANS.
'T is Kurt the Syndic.
#AXEL.
Then she lives! -
#HANS' WIFE.
Look there!
#OTHERS.
Look, look! The casement! .
#JANET.
'Tis Mother!
#PIPER.
And all the others?
#JANET.
They were all asleep.
#PIPER.
I'll waken them!
#AXEL.
Bring lights, - bring lights! Oh, Piper - Oh, my lambs! The children! - The children!
#HANS.
Bring lights, - bring lights! Oh, Piper - Oh, my lambs! The children! - The children!
#HANS.
The treasure for the Piper!
#ALL.
Ay, ay, Piper!
#HANS.
The thousand guilders!
#PIPER.
Give them Michael there, For all us three. I hate to carry things; - Saving out one!
#HANS' WIFE.
Look! Look! - And wings upon it! Mercy, what a shoe. - Don't give it back. - The child will fly away!
#PIPER.
No, no! He only wanted one to show -
#JANET.
To Mother! - See.
#PIPER.
And this, - wilt leave it here? Here - with -
#JANET.
The Lonely Man! Oh, make Him smile!
#CHILDREN.
Where are you going? .
#PIPER.
Ah, the high - road now!
#CHILDREN.
Oh! why?
#PIPER.
I have to find somebody there. Yes, now and every day, and everywhere The wide world over. - So: good - night, good - morning, Good - by! There's so much piping left to do, - I must be off, and pipe.
#CHILDREN.
Oh! why?
#PIPER.
I promised, Look you! .
#CHILDREN.
Who is it?
#PIPER.
Why, - the Lonely Man.
