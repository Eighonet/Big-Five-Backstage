#JULIAN.
What a meeting! The dead Emperor and the living.—Alas that he should have drawn his last breath in such distant regions! Alas that, in spite of all my haste, I should not have had the sweet consolation of embracing my kinsman for the last time! A bitter lot for both of us!— Where is the ship with the body?
#NEVITA.
There it comes.
#JULIAN.
That long boat?
#NEVITA.
Yes, most gracious Emperor.
#JULIAN.
My poor kinsman! So great in life; and now to have to content you with so low a roof! Now you will not strike your forehead against the coffin - lid, you who bowed your head in riding through the Arch of Constantine.
#CITIZEN.
How young he looks, our new Emperor!
#POTAMON.
But he has grown more stalwart. When I last saw him he was a lean stripling; that is now nine or ten years ago.
#ANOTHER CITIZEN.
Ay, he has done great things in those years.
#MOTHER.
And all the dangers he has passed through, ever since his childhood!
#PRIEST.
Marvellously has he been shielded from them all; the hand of heaven is over him.
#POTAMON.
Rumour says that in Gaul he placed himself in very different hands.
#THE PRIEST.
Lies, lies; you may depend upon it.
#JULIAN.
Now he comes. The Sun, whom I invoke, and the great thunder - wielding God, know that I never desired Constantius’s death. That was far indeed from being my wish. I have offered up prayers for his life.—Tell me, Caesarius,—you must know best,—have they shown all due honour, on the journey, to the imperial corpse?
#CAESARIUS.
The funeral procession was like a conqueror’s triumph through the whole of Asia Minor. In every town we traversed, believers thronged the streets; through whole nights the churches echoed with prayers and hymns; thousands of burning tapers transformed the darkness into high noon——
#JULIAN.
Good, good, good!—I am seized with an unspeakable misgiving at the thought of taking the helm of state after so great and virtuous and well - beloved an Emperor. Why was it not my lot to live in peaceful retirement?
#MAMERTINUS.
And who could have sufficed to this high and difficult calling so completely as you, incomparable lord? I call fearlessly to all those others who have aspired to the empire: Come, then, and take the helm of government; but take it as Julian takes it. Be on the alert night and day for the common welfare. Be masters in name, and yet servants to civic freedom. Choose the foremost places in battle, and not at the feasts. Take nothing for yourselves, but lavish gifts upon all. Let your justice be equally remote from laxity and from inhumanity. Live so that no virgin on earth shall wring her hands because of you. Bid defiance—both to impenetrable Gaul, and inhospitable Germany. What would they answer? Appalled by such stern conditions, they would stop their effeminate ears, and cry: “Only a Julian is equal to such a task!”
#JULIAN.
The Omnipotent grant that such high hopes may not be disappointed. But how great are my shortcomings! A shudder comes over me. To affront comparison with Alexander, Marcus Aurelius, and so many other illustrious princes! Has not Plato said that only a god can rule over men? Oh pray with me that I may escape the snares of ambition, and the temptations of power. Athens, Athens! Thither my longings turn! I was as a man taking reasonable exercise for the sake of his health;—and now, they come and say to me, “Go forth into the arena, and conquer in the Olympian games. The eyes of all Greece are upon you!” May I not well be panic - stricken even before the contest begins?
#THEMISTIUS.
Panic - stricken, oh Emperor? Have you not already the applause of Greece? Are you not come to reinstate all exiled virtues in their ancient rights? Do we not find concentred in you all the victorious genius of Herakles, of Dionysus, of Solon, of——
#JULIAN.
Hush! Only the praise of the dead shall be heard to - day. The boat has reached the wharf. Take my crown and my chains; I will not wear the insignia of empire at such a time as this.
#JULIAN.
Ah!
#SPECTATOR.
Did he cross himself?
#ANOTHER IN THE CROWD.
No.
#THE FIRST.
You see; you see!
#THIRD SPECTATOR.
And he did not bow before the sacred image.
#THE FIRST.
You see! What did I tell you?
#JULIAN.
Pass onward to thy home, amid pomp and honour, soulless body of my kinsman! I make not this dust answerable for the wrongs thy spirit did me. What do I say? Was it thy spirit that dealt so hardly with my house, that I alone am left? Was it thy spirit that caused my childhood to be darkened with a thousand terrors? Was it thy spirit that bade fall that noble Caesar’s head? Was it thou who didst allot to me, an untried stripling, so difficult a post in inhospitable Gaul, and afterwards, when disaffection and mischance had failed to crush me, didst seek to rob me of the honour of my victories? Oh Constantius, my kinsman,—not from thy great heart did all this spring. Wherefore didst thou writhe in remorse and anguish; why didst thou see gory shades around thee, on thy last bed of pain? Evil councillors embittered thy life and thy death. I know them, these councillors; they were men who took hurt from living in the ceaseless sunshine of thy favour. I know them, these men, who so obsequiously clothed themselves in that garb of faith, which was most in favour at court.
#HEATHEN CITIZENS.
Long live the Emperor Julian!
#CAESARIUS.
Most gracious lord, the procession waits——
#JULIAN.
Stay not your pious hymns on my account. Forward, my friends! Follow whoso will, and remain whoso will. But this you shall all know to - day, that my place is here. What am I? The Emperor. But in saying that, have I said all? Is there not one imperial office, which seems to have been shamefully wiped out of remembrance in these later years? What was that crowned philosopher, Marcus Aurelius? Emperor? Only Emperor? I could almost ask: was he not something more than Emperor? Was he not also the Supreme Pontiff?
#VOICES IN THE CROWD.
What says the Emperor? What was that? What did he say?
#THEMISTIUS.
Oh sire, is it indeed your purpose——?
#JULIAN.
Not even my uncle Constantine the Great dared to renounce this dignity. Even after he had conceded to a certain new doctrine such very extraordinary privileges, he was still called the Chief Priest by all who held fast to the ancient divinities of the Grecian race. I will not here enlarge upon the melancholy disuse into which this office has fallen of late years, but will merely remark that none of my exalted predecessors, not even he to whom, with tear - stained faces, we to - day bid our last farewell, has dared to reject it. Should I presume to take any step which so wise and just emperors did not deem right or expedient? Far be it from me!
#THEMISTIUS.
Oh great Emperor, mean you by this——?
#JULIAN.
I mean by this, that there shall be perfect freedom for all citizens. Cling to the Christians’ God, you who find it conduce to your souls’ repose. As for me, I dare not build my hopes on a god who has hitherto been my foe in all my undertakings. I know by infallible signs and tokens that the victories I won on the Gallic frontier I owe to those other divinities who favoured Alexander in a somewhat similar way. Under watch and ward of these divinities, I passed unscathed through all dangers; and, in especial, it was they who furthered my journey hither with such marvellous speed and success that, as I gathered from cries in the streets, some people have come to look upon me as a divine being,—which is a great exaggeration, my friends! But certain it is, that I dare not show myself ungrateful for such untiring proofs of favour.
#VOICES IN THE CROWD.
What is he going to do?
#JULIAN.
Therefore, I restore to their pristine rights the venerable Gods of our forefathers. But no injury shall be done to the God of the Galileans, nor to the God of the Jews. The temples, which pious rulers of old erected with such admirable art, shall rise again in rejuvenated splendour, with altars and statues, each for its especial God, so that seemly worship may once more be offered them. But I will by no means tolerate any vengeful assaults upon the churches of the Christians; neither shall their graveyards be molested, nor any other places which a strange delusion leads them to regard as sacred. We will bear with the errors of others; I myself have laboured under illusions;—but over that I cast a veil. What I have thought upon things divine since my one - and - twentieth year, I will not now dwell upon; I will only say that I congratulate those who follow my example,—that I smile at those who will not tread in my footsteps,—that I will doubtless try to persuade, but will not coerce any one. I had reckoned, not unreasonably, on grateful acclamations, where I find only wondering curiosity. Yet I ought to have known it;—there reigns a deplorable indifference among those who profess to hold fast to our ancient faith. Oppression and mockery have caused us to forget the venerable rites of our forefathers. I have inquired high and low, but scarcely a single person have I found who could speak with authority as to the ceremonies to be observed in sacrificing to Apollo or Fortuna. I must take the lead in this, as in other matters. It has cost me many sleepless nights to search out in the ancient records what tradition prescribes in such cases; but I do not complain when I remember how much we owe to these very divinities; nor am I ashamed to do everything with my own hands—— Whither away, Caesarius?
#CAESARIUS.
To the church, most gracious Emperor; I would pray for the soul of my departed master.
#JULIAN.
Go, go! In these matters every one is free. But the freedom I concede to the meanest citizen, I claim for myself as well.——Be it known, therefore, to you all, Greeks and Romans, that I return with my whole heart to the beliefs and rites which our forefathers held sacred,—that they may be freely propagated and exercised, no less than all new and foreign opinions;—and as I am a son of this city, and therefore hold it pre - eminently dear, this I proclaim in the name of its guardian deities.
#THEMISTIUS.
Oh well may I, as a Greek, melt into tears at the sight of so much humility and pious zeal!
#CITIZEN.
See, he breaks the fuel himself!
#ANOTHER.
Over his left thigh. Is that how it ought to be broken?
#THE FIRST CITIZEN.
Doubtless, doubtless.
#MAMERTINUS.
In the light of the fire you there kindle, oh, great Emperor, shall research and learning shine forth, ay, and rise rejuvenated, like that miraculous bird——
#NEVITA.
That fire will temper the weapons of Greece. I know little of the Galilean figments; but this I have noted, that all who believe in them are spiritless and unfit for greater things.
#THEMISTIUS.
In this fire, oh incomparable one, I see wisdom purged of all scandal and reproach. The wine of your libation is like purple, wherewith you deck the truth, and set her on a royal throne. Now, as you lift up your hands——
#MAMERTINUS.
Now, as you lift up your hands, it is as though you glorified the brow of knowledge with a golden wreath; and the tears you shed——
#THEMISTIUS.
Yes, yes, the tears I see you shed are like costly pearls, wherewith eloquence shall once more be rewarded in kingly wise. Once again, then, the Greeks are suffered to raise their eyes to heaven, and follow the eternal stars in their courses! How long it is since that was vouchsafed us! Have we not been forced, for fear of spies, to tremble and bow our faces to the earth, like the brutes? Which of us dared so much as to watch the rising or the setting of the sun? Even you husbandmen, who have to - day flocked hither in such numbers, even you did not venture to note the position of the heavenly bodies, although by them you should have regulated your labours——
#MAMERTINUS.
And you seamen,—have either you or your fathers dared to utter the names of the constellations by which you steered? Now you may do so; now all are free to——
#THEMISTIUS.
Now no Greek need live on land or sea without consulting the immutable laws of the heavens; he need no longer let himself be tossed about like a plaything, by chance and circumstance; he——
#MAMERTINUS.
Oh, how great is this Emperor, to whom we owe such blessings!
#JULIAN.
Thus have I openly and in all humility made libations of oil and wine to you, ye beneficent deities, who have so long been denied these seemly observances. I have sent up my thanksgiving to thee, oh Apollo, whom some of the sages—especially those of the East—call by the name of the Sun - King, because thou bringest and renewest that light, wherein life has its source and its fountain - head.—To thee, too, I have made offering, oh Dionysus, god of ecstasy, who dost lift up the souls of mortals out of abasement, and exaltest them to an ennobling communion with higher spirits.—And, although I name thee last, I have not been least mindful of thee, oh Fortuna! Without thine aid, should I have stood here? I know indeed that thou dost no longer visibly manifest thyself, as in the golden age, of which the peerless blind singer has told us. But this I know, too,—and herein all other philosophers are at one with me—that it is thou who hast the decisive share in the choice of the guardian spirit, good or evil, that is to accompany every man on his path through life. I have no cause to chide thee, oh Fortuna! Rather have I the strongest reason to yield thee all thanks and praise. This duty, precious to my heart, have I this day fulfilled. I have not shrunk from even the humblest office. Here I stand in open day; the eyes of all Greece are upon me; I expect the voice of all Greece to unite with mine in acclaiming you, oh ye immortal gods!
#JULIAN.
What is this? What has become of them all? Are they slinking away?
#THEMISTIUS.
Yes, red with shame at the ingratitude of so many years.
#MAMERTINUS.
Nay, ’twas the flush of joy. They have gone to spread the great tidings throughout the city.
#JULIAN.
The ignorant multitude is ever perplexed by what is unaccustomed. My task will be arduous; but no labour shall daunt me. What better befits a philosopher than to root out error? In this mission I count on your aid, enlightened friends! But our thoughts must turn elsewhere, for a little time. Follow me; I go to other duties.
#JULIAN.
So far have the gods aided us. Now the work will roll onwards, like the waves of a spring flood. The sullen ill - will which I can trace in certain quarters where I least expected it, shall not disturb my equanimity. Is it not precisely the distinguishing mark of true wisdom, that it begets patience! We all know that by suitable remedies bodily ills may be allayed;—but can fire and sword annihilate delusions as to things divine? And what avails it though your hands make offerings, if your souls condemn the action of your hands? Thus will we live in concord with each other. My court shall be open to all men of mark, whatever their opinions. Let us show the world the rare and august spectacle of a court without hypocrisy—assuredly the only one of its kind—a court in which flatterers are counted the most dangerous of enemies. We will censure and expostulate with one another, when it is needful, yet without loving one another the less. Your face is radiant, Nevita;—what good tidings do you bring?
#NEVITA.
The best and happiest indeed. A great company of envoys from princes in furthest India have come to bring you gifts, and to entreat your friendship.
#JULIAN.
Ah, tell me,—to what peoples do they belong?
#NEVITA.
To the Armenians, and other races beyond the Tigris. Indeed, some of the strangers aver they come from the islands of Diu and Serandib.
#JULIAN.
From the uttermost verge of the earth my friends!
#THEMISTIUS.
Even so far has rumour carried your name and your glory!
#MAMERTINUS.
Even in those unknown regions is your sword a terror to princes and peoples!
#THEMISTIUS.
Diu and Serandib! Far east in the Indian sea——
#MAMERTINUS.
I do not hesitate to say: beyond the orb of the world——
#JULIAN.
Bid the barber come! I will receive the envoys in seemly guise,—yet without display or adornment. So would the august Marcus Aurelius have received them; and him I make my pattern, rather than the Emperor whose death we have lately had to mourn. No more parade of transitory mundane things! Even the barbarians shall see that wisdom—in the person, truly, of her meanest servant—has resumed her place upon the throne.
#JULIAN.
What seek you here, my lord?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Gracious Emperor, you have commanded my attendance——
#JULIAN.
You mistake, friend; I have not sent for any of my councillors.
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Most gracious Emperor——
#URSULUS.
Pardon me, sire; this man is the imperial barber.
#JULIAN.
What do I hear? Can it be? This man—oh, you jest—this man, in silken raiment, with gold - embroidered shoes, is——? Ah, indeed! So you are the barber! Never shall I presume to let myself be served by such delicate hands.
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Most gracious Emperor,—I pray you, for God and my Saviour’s sake——
#JULIAN.
Ho - ho! A Galilean! Did I not think so! Is this the self - denial you boast of? But I know you well! What temple of what godhead have you plundered, or how many dips have you made into the Emperor’s coffers, to attain such magnificence as this?—You may go; I have no occasion for you. Tell me, Ursulus, what is that man’s wage?
#URSULUS.
Gracious Emperor, by your august predecessor’s command, the daily maintenance of twenty men is assigned him——
#JULIAN.
Aha! No more than that?
#URSULUS.
Yes, sire; latterly he has had free stabling in the imperial stables, together with a certain yearly allowance of money, and a gold piece for every time he——
#JULIAN.
And all this for a barber! What, then, must the others——? This shall not last a day longer.——Admit the foreign envoys! I will receive them with uncut hair. Better so; for although I know well that it is not the unkempt hair, nor the tattered cloak, that makes the true philosopher, yet surely the example given by both Antisthenes and Diogenes may well be respected by one who—even on the throne—desires to follow in such great teachers’ footsteps.
#NEVITA.
Most gracious Lord and Emperor! Not being possessed of the noble idiom which so many eloquent men, and you yourself not the least, have perfected beyond all other tongues,—and therewith fearful of letting barbarous sounds offend your ear,—these envoys from the princes of the East have deputed me to be their spokesman.
#JULIAN.
I am ready to hear you.
#NEVITA.
First, the King of Armenia lays at your feet this suit of mail, begging you to wear it in battle against the foes of the empire, although he knows that you, invincible hero, stand under the protecting eye of the gods, who will suffer no weapon of mortal man to wound you.—Here are priceless carpets, tents, and saddle - housings from the princes beyond the Tigris. They thereby acknowledge that, if the gods have granted those lands exceeding riches, it was with the design that these riches should be at the service of their favourite.—The King of Serandib, and likewise the King of Diu, send you these weapons, sword, spear, and shield, with bows and arrows; for, they say, “We esteem it wisest to stand unarmed before the victorious lord who, like a divinity, has shown himself so mighty as to overwhelm all opposition.”—In return, all pray for the supreme favour of your friendship, and especially beg that if, as report says, you propose next spring to annihilate the audacious Persian king, you will spare their territories from hostile invasion.
#JULIAN.
Such an embassy cannot come quite as a surprise to me. The gifts shall be deposited in my treasury, and through you I apprise your masters that it is my will to maintain friendship with all nations who do not—whether by force or guile—thwart my designs.—As to your being led, in your distant lands, to regard me as a divinity on account of my fortunate victories, I will not enter further into the matter. I reverence the gods too highly to arrogate to myself an unmerited place in their midst, although I know that frequently, and chiefly in the days of old, there have lived heroes and rulers who have been so greatly distinguished by the favour and grace of the gods, that it has been difficult to determine whether they should rightly be reckoned among mortals or immortals. Of such things, however, it is rash to judge, even for us Greeks. How much more, then, for you? Therefore, enough of that.—Eutherius conduct the strangers to repose, and see that they lack nothing.
#THEMISTIUS.
So young,—and already so highly honoured above all other Emperors!
#MAMERTINUS.
I ask: will not Fame lack lungs to proclaim your renown, if the gods, as I confidently hope, grant you a long life?
#THEMISTIUS.
The yell of fear, uttered by the flying Alemanni on the furthest shores of the Rhine, has swept eastward until it dashed against Taurus and Caucasus——
#MAMERTINUS.
——and now rolls, like the echoes of thunder, over the whole of Asia.
#NEVITA.
What has so overawed the Indians is the likeness between our Greek Julian and the Macedonian Alexander——
#MAMERTINUS.
Oh where is the likeness? Had King Alexander secret enemies in his own camp? Had he to struggle against an envious and backbiting imperial court?
#NEVITA.
True, true; and there were no incapable generals to clog Alexander’s progress.
#JULIAN.
Ursulus, it is my will that the coming of these envoys shall be made known both in the city and through all regions of the empire. Everything shall be exactly set forth,—the places whence they came, and the gifts they brought with them. I will withhold from my citizens nothing that concerns my government. You may also allude in passing to the strange belief among the Indians, that Alexander has returned to earth.
#URSULUS.
Pardon me, most gracious Emperor, but——
#JULIAN.
Well?
#URSULUS.
You have yourself said that in this court no flattery is to be tolerated——
#JULIAN.
True, my friend!
#URSULUS.
Then let me honestly tell you that these envoys came to seek your predecessor, not you.
#JULIAN.
What do you dare to tell me?
#THEMISTIUS.
Pooh, what preposterous nonsense!
#MAMERTINUS.
What a fable!
#URSULUS.
It is the truth. I have long known that these men were on their way,—long before the Emperor Constantius closed his eyes. Oh, my most gracious lord, let not a false vanity find its way into your young mind——
#JULIAN.
Enough, enough! Then you mean to say that——
#URSULUS.
Think for yourself. How could your victories in Gaul, glorious as they have been, reach the ears of such distant nations with such rapidity? When the envoys spoke of the Emperor’s heroic deeds, they had in mind the war against the King of Persia——
#NEVITA.
I did not know that the war against King Sapor had been so conducted as to spread terror to the ends of the earth.
#URSULUS.
True; fortune has been against our arms in those regions. But ’twas the rumour of the great armament which the Emperor Constantius was preparing for the spring that alarmed the Armenians and the other nations.—Oh, reckon out the time, sire, count the days if you will, and say if it can possibly be otherwise. Your march hither from Gaul was marvellously rapid; but the journey of these men from the Indian isles——; it would be tenfold more marvellous if——; ask them, and you will hear——
#JULIAN.
Why do you say all this to me?
#URSULUS.
Because it is the truth, and because I cannot bear to see your fresh and fair renown darkened by borrowed trappings.
#THEMISTIUS.
What audacity!
#MAMERTINUS.
What brazen audacity!
#JULIAN.
You cannot bear, forsooth! You cannot bear! Oh, I know you better. I know all you old courtiers. It is the gods whose glory you would disparage. For is it not to the glory of the gods that through a man they can compass such great things! But you hate them, these gods, whose temples you have thrown down, whose statues you have broken to pieces, and whose treasures you have rifled. You have scarcely even tolerated these our most beneficent deities. You have scarcely suffered the pious to cherish them secretly in their hearts. And now you would also break down the temple of gratitude which I have dedicated to them in my heart; you would rob me of the grateful belief that I am indebted to the immortals for a new and much - to - be - coveted benefaction;—for may not renown be so termed?
#URSULUS.
The one God of heaven is my witness that——
#JULIAN.
The one God! There we have it again! So are you always. What intolerance! Contrast yourselves with us. Do we say that our gods are the only ones? Do we not esteem both the gods of the Egyptians and that Jewish Jehovah, who has certainly done great things among his people? But you, on the contrary,—and a man like you, too, Ursulus—! Are you a Roman born of Grecian race? The one God! What barbarous effrontery!
#URSULUS.
You have promised to hate no man for his convictions’ sake.
#JULIAN.
That I have promised; but neither will I suffer you to treat us too insolently. These envoys have not come to——? That is to say, in other words, that the great and divine Dionysus, whose especial gift it is to reveal what is hidden,—that he is not as powerful now as in bygone ages. Ought I to suffer this? Is it not overweening audacity? Am I not forced to call you to account?
#URSULUS.
Then all Christians will say that it is their faith you are persecuting.
#JULIAN.
No one shall be persecuted by reason of his faith. But have I the right to overlook whatever faults you may commit, simply because you are Christians? Shall your delusions shield your misdeeds? What have not your audacious crew for long been doing, both here at court and elsewhere? Have you not flattered all vices, and bowed before all caprices? Ay, what have not you yourself, Ursulus, connived at? I am thinking of that shameless, bedizened barber, that salve - stinking fool, who just now filled me with loathing. Are not you treasurer? How could you give way to his impudent demands?
#URSULUS.
Is it a crime to have done my master’s bidding?
#JULIAN.
I will have nothing to do with such luxurious servants. All those insolent eunuchs shall be hunted out of the palace; and all cooks, and jugglers, and dancers after them. A becoming frugality shall once more be enforced. You, my friends, shall aid me in this.—And you, Nevita, on whom, as a mark of special distinction, I bestow the title of general - in - chief,—you I depute to investigate how the offices of state have been administered under my predecessor, especially of late years. You may call in the aid of competent men, at your own choice, to decide with you in these affairs. Of you I have no need. When my lamented kinsman, on his death - bed, appointed me his successor, he also bequeathed to me that justice which his long illness had prevented him from administering. Go home; and when you have given an account of yourselves, you may go whither you please.
#URSULUS.
The Lord God uphold and shield you, my Emperor!
#NEVITA.
My august master, how can I sufficiently thank you for the mark of favour which you——
#JULIAN.
No thanks. In these few days I have learnt to value your fidelity and judgment. I also commission you to draw up the despatch concerning the eastern envoys. Word it so that the beneficent gods may find in it no reason for resentment against any of us.
#NEVITA.
In both matters I will carry out my Emperor’s will.
#JULIAN.
And now, my faithful friends, now let us praise the immortal powers, who have shown us the right way.
#THEMISTIUS.
The immortals, and their more than mortal favourite! What joy there will be throughout the empire, when it is known that you have dismissed those violent and rapacious men!
#MAMERTINUS.
With what anxiety and impatient hope will the choice of their successors be awaited!
#THEMISTIUS.
All the Greeks will exclaim with one voice: “Plato himself has taken the helm of state!”
#MAMERTINUS.
No, no, worthy friend; all the Greeks will exclaim: “Plato’s ideal is realised—‘Only a god can rule over men!’”
#THEMISTIUS.
I can but trust that the goodwill of the beneficent powers may follow Nevita. He has received a great and difficult charge; I know little of him; but we must all hope that he may prove himself to be the right——
#MAMERTINUS.
Undoubtedly; although there might perhaps be other men who——
#THEMISTIUS.
Not that I would for a moment imply that your choice, oh peerless Emperor——
#MAMERTINUS.
No, no; far from it!
#THEMISTIUS.
But if it be an error to burn with zeal to serve a beloved master——
#MAMERTINUS.
——then, in truth, you have more than one erring friend——
#THEMISTIUS.
——even if you do not honour them, as you have honoured the thrice - fortunate Nevita——
#MAMERTINUS.
——even if they have to be content without any visible token of your favour——
#JULIAN.
We will leave no capable men unemployed or unrewarded. As regards you, Themistius, I appoint you chief magistrate of this city of Constantinople; and you, Mamertinus, prepare to betake yourself to Rome during the coming year, to enter upon one of the vacant consulships.
#THEMISTIUS.
My Emperor! I am dizzy with so much honour——
#MAMERTINUS.
So high a distinction! Consul! Was ever consul so honoured as I? Was Lucius? Was Brutus? Was Publius Valerius? What were their honours to mine? They were chosen by the people, I by Julian!
#COURTIER.
Praise be to the Emperor, who makes justice his guide!
#ANOTHER COURTIER.
Praise be to him, whose very name strikes terror to the barbarians!
#THEMISTIUS.
Praise be to all the exalted gods, who have united in casting their enamoured eyes on one single man, so that when the day comes—distant may it be!—when he shall for the first time inflict pain on us by departing hence, this one man may be said to have cast Socrates, Marcus Aurelius, and Alexander into the shade!
#JULIAN.
There you touch the kernel of the matter, my Themistius! ’Tis to the gods that we must uplift our hands and hearts. I say this, not as instructing you, but merely to remind you of what has so long been forgotten at this court. By no means would I seek to coerce any one. But can I be blamed because I would fain have others share in the sweet rapture which possesses me when I feel myself uplifted into communion with the immortals? Praise, praise to thee, vine - clad Dionysus! For it is chiefly thou who dost bring about such great and mysterious things. Depart now each to his task. I, for my part, have ordered a festal procession through the streets of the city. It shall be no mere revel for my courtiers, nor a banquet within four walls. The citizens shall be free to join me or to hold aloof; I will discern the pure from the impure, the pious from the misguided. Oh Sun - King, shed light and beauty over the day! Oh Dionysus, let thy glory descend in floods upon our minds; fill our souls with thy sacred storm - wind; fill them till all trammels are burst asunder, and ecstasy enfranchised draws breath in dance and song!—Life, life, life in beauty!
#SHOEMAKER.
What a foot, dear neighbour?
#SHOPKEEPER.
They say ’tis some Syrian jugglers that have come to town.
#FRUIT-SELLER.
No, no, ’tis a band of Egyptians going around with apes and dromedaries.
#EUNAPIUS.
Make room, you fools! How the devil can any one chatter and play the fool on such a day of misfortune?
#MOTHER.
Hist, hist, Eunapius! My comely master!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
How dare you speak to me in the open street, you procuress?
#THE WOMAN.
Slip in by the back way, sweet friend!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Fie upon you! Am I in the humour for folly——
#THE WOMAN.
You shall soon be in the humour. Come, fair Eunapius; I had a consignment of fresh doves the day before yesterday——
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Oh sinful world! Make room, there, in Satan’s name; let me pass! Hekebolius. Has the town turned into a madhouse? Everyone seeks to out - bellow his neighbour, and no one can tell me what is astir. Aha,—Eunapius, my pious brother!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
All hail to you, reverend sir! So you have come back to town?
#HEKEBOLIUS.
This very moment;—I have consecrated the warm autumn months to quiet devotion, on my estate in Crete. And now pray tell me what is afoot here?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Confusion and disaster. The new Emperor——
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Yes, yes, I have heard strange rumours——
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
The truth is ten times worse. All faithful servants are hunted out of the palace.
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Is it possible?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Alackaday; I myself was the first——
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Terrible! Then, perhaps, I too——?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Most certainly. All accounts are to be examined, all gifts resumed, all irregular perquisites——
#HEKEBOLIUS.
God have mercy on us!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
The Lord be praised, I have a good conscience!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
I too, I too; but nevertheless——! Then no doubt it is true that the Emperor has sacrificed to Apollo and Fortuna?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Certainly; but who cares for such trifles?
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Trifles? See you not, my short - sighted friend, that it is our faith, as good Christians, that he is persecuting?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
What do you say? God’s cross, is it possible?
#WOMEN.
There they come!
#FATHER.
I can see him!
#OTHER VOICES.
Who comes? Who, who?
#THE MAN ON THE HOUSETOP.
The Emperor Julian. He has vine - leaves in his hair.
#PEOPLE IN THE STREET.
The Emperor!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
The Emperor!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Come, come, my godly brother!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Let me go, sir. I am in no wise godly.
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Not godly——?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Who dares accuse me of——? Do you want to ruin me? Godly? When was I godly? I once belonged to the sect of the Donatists; that was years and years ago. Devil take the Donatists! Hi, Barbara, Barbara; open the door, old she - cat!
#THE MULTITUDE.
There he is! There he comes!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
All irregular perquisites——! Accounts examined! Oh thunderbolt of disaster!
#THE DANCERS.
Potions of fire drain from goblets o’erflowing! Potions of fire! Lips deeply sipping, Locks unguent - dripping, Goat - haunches tripping, Wine - God, we hail thee in rapturous quire!
#THE WOMEN.
Come, Bacchanalians, while noontide is glowing— Come, do not flee us— Plunge we in love - sports night blushes at knowing! There rides Lyaeus, Pard - borne, delivering! Come, do not flee us; Know, we are passionate; feel, we are quivering! Leaping all, playing all, Staggering and swaying all— Come, do not flee us!
#JULIAN.
Make room! Stand aside, citizens! Reverently make way; not for us, but for him to whom we do honour!
#VOICE IN THE CROWD.
The Emperor in the company of mummers and harlots!
#JULIAN.
The shame is yours, that I must content myself with such as these. Do you not blush to find more piety and zeal among these than among yourselves?
#AN OLD MAN.
Christ enlighten you, sire!
#JULIAN.
Aha, you are a Galilean! And you must put in your word? Did not your great Master sit at meat with sinners? Did he not frequent houses that were held less than reputable? Answer me that.
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Yes, answer, answer if you can, you fool!
#JULIAN.
What,—are not you that barber whom——? new - made freeman, gracious Emperor! Make way, Bacchanalians; room for a brother!
#JULIAN.
I like this well. Take example by this Greek, if you have a spark of your fathers’ spirit left in you. And this is sorely needed, you citizens; for no divinity has been so much misunderstood—ay, even rendered ridiculous—as this ecstatic Dionysus, whom the Romans also call Bacchus. Think you he is the god of sots? Oh ignorant creatures, I pity you, if that is your thought. Who but he inspires poets and prophets with their miraculous gifts? I know that some attribute this function to Apollo, and certainly not without a show of reason; but in that case the whole matter must be regarded in quite another aspect,—as I could prove by many authorities. But this I will not debate with you in the open streets. This is neither the place nor the time. Ay, mock away! Make the sign of the cross! I see it! You would fain whistle with your fingers; you would stone me, if you dared.—Oh, how I blush for this city, so sunk in barbarism that it knows no better than to cling to an ignorant Jew’s deluded fantasies!—Forward! Stand aside,—do not block the way!
#THE DANCERS.
There rides Lyaeus, Pard - borne, delivering!
#THE WOMEN.
Know, we are passionate; feel, we are quivering; Come, do not flee us!
#EUTHERIUS.
Agilo, Agilo, warm rose - water! A bath for the Emperor.
#JULIAN.
Was there beauty in this——? Where were the white - bearded elders? Where the pure maidens, with the fillets on their brows, modest, and of seemly bearing, even in the rapture of the dance? Out upon you, harlots! Whither has beauty fled? When the Emperor bids her come forth again, will she not obey? Out upon this stinking ribaldry!—— What faces! All the vices crying aloud in their distorted features. Ulcers on soul and body—— Faugh, faugh! A bath, Agilo! The stench chokes me.
#THE BATH-SERVANT AGILO.
The bath is prepared, gracious sire!
#JULIAN.
The bath? Nay, let that be. What is the filth of the body compared with all the rest? Go! The seer of Nazareth sat at meat among publicans and sinners.— Where lies the gulf between that and this?——
#JULIAN.
What would you, man?
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Sire!
#JULIAN.
Ah, what do I see? Hekebolius;—is it indeed you?
#HEKEBOLIUS.
The same, and yet another.
#JULIAN.
My old teacher. What would you have? Stand up!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
No, no, let me lie. And take it not ill that I presume on my former right of entrance to your presence.
#JULIAN.
I asked you what you would have?
#HEKEBOLIUS.
“My old teacher,” you said. Oh that I could cast the veil of oblivion over those times!
#JULIAN.
I understand. You mean that——
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Oh that I could sink into the earth, and hide the shame I feel! See, see,—here I lie at your feet, a man whose hair is growing grey—a man who has pored and pondered all his days, and has to confess at last that he has gone astray, and led his beloved pupil into error!
#JULIAN.
What would you have me understand by that?
#HEKEBOLIUS.
You called me your old teacher. See, here I lie in the dust before you, looking up to you with wonder, and calling you my new teacher.
#JULIAN.
Rise, Hekebolius!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
You shall hear everything, sire, and judge me according to your righteousness.—When you were gone, life at your august predecessor’s court became almost intolerable to me. I know not whether you have heard that I was promoted to be the Empress’s reader and almoner. But ah, could posts of honour console me for the loss of my Julian! I could scarce endure to see how men who made great show of outward virtue accepted gifts and bribes of every kind. I grew to hate this daily intercourse with greedy sycophants, whose advocacy was at the beck of any one who could pay down sounding gold for sounding words. Oh my Emperor, you do not know what went on here——!
#JULIAN.
I know, I know. frugal life in retirement allured me. As often as I might, I withdrew to Crete, to my modest Tusculum—my little country house,—where virtue did not seem to have utterly forsaken the world. There I have been living this summer as well; meditating upon human life and heavenly truths.
#JULIAN.
Happy Hekebolius!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Then the rumour of all your marvellous exploits reached Crete——
#JULIAN.
Ah!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
I asked myself: Is he more than mortal, this peerless youth? Under whose protection does he stand? Is it thus that the God of the Christians is wont to manifest his power——?
#JULIAN.
Well; well!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
I set myself to search once more the writings of the ancients. Light after light dawned upon me——; oh, to have to confess this!
#JULIAN.
Speak out—I beseech you!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Punish me according to your righteousness, sire; but renounce your youthful errors on things divine! Yes, most gracious Emperor, you are entangled in error, and I—oh, I marvel that the shame does not kill me—I, I have helped to lead you astray——
#JULIAN.
Come to my closest embrace!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Oh, I entreat you, show gratitude to the immortal gods, whose darling you are! And if you cannot, then punish me because I do it in your stead——
#JULIAN.
Come, come to my open arms, I tell you! My Hekebolius! What a great and unlooked - for joy! Sire, how am I to understand this?
#JULIAN.
Oh, then you do not know——? When came you to the city?
#HEKEBOLIUS.
I landed an hour ago.
#JULIAN.
And hurried hither at once?
#HEKEBOLIUS.
On the wings of anxiety and remorse, sire!
#JULIAN.
And you have spoken to no one?
#HEKEBOLIUS.
No, no, I have spoken to no one; but——?
#JULIAN.
Oh, then you cannot have heard—— My Hekebolius, listen and know! I too, like you, have cast off the yoke of error. The immortal Sun - King, to whom we mortals owe so much, I have restored to his ancient state; Fortuna has received her offering from my humble hands; and if, at this moment, you find me weary and somewhat unstrung, it is because I have but now been celebrating a festival in honour of the divine Dionysus.
#HEKEBOLIUS.
I hear, and am amazed!
#JULIAN.
See,—the garland is still in my hair. Amid the joyous acclaim of the multitude—yes, I may call it a multitude——
#HEKEBOLIUS.
And I did not even dream of such great things!
#JULIAN.
Now we will gather around us all friends of truth, and lovers of wisdom, all seemly and reverent worshippers of the gods;—there are already some—not very many——
#JULIAN.
Ah, here we have the good Caesarius,—numerously accompanied, and with a face that betokens urgent business.
#CAESARIUS.
Most gracious Emperor, will you permit your servant to ask a question, in his own name, and that of these much disquieted men?
#JULIAN.
Ask, my dearest Caesarius! Are you not my beloved Gregory’s brother? Ask, ask!
#CAESARIUS.
Tell me, then, sire—— What do I see! Hekebolius here?
#JULIAN.
Newly returned——
#CAESARIUS.
Then I beg leave to defer——
#JULIAN.
No, no, my Caesarius; this friend may hear everything.
#CAESARIUS.
Friend, say you? Oh my Emperor, then you have not ordered these imprisonments?
#JULIAN.
What mean you?
#CAESARIUS.
Do you not know? Nevita—the general - in - chief, as he now calls himself—is instituting prosecutions under pretext of your authority, against all the trusted servants of your predecessor.
#JULIAN.
Investigations, highly necessary investigations, my Caesarius!
#CAESARIUS.
Oh sire, forbid him to go about it so harshly. The book - keeper Pentadius is being hunted down by soldiers; and likewise a certain captain of Praetorians, whose name you have forbidden us to mention; you know whom I mean, sire—that unhappy man who is already, with his whole household, in hiding for fear of you.
#JULIAN.
You do not know this man. In Gaul, he cherished the most audacious designs.
#CAESARIUS.
That may be; but now he is harmless. And not he alone is threatened with destruction; the treasurer, Ursulus, is imprisoned——
#JULIAN.
Ah, Ursulus? So that has been found needful.
#CAESARIUS.
Needful? Could that be needful, sire. Think of Ursulus, that stainless old man—that man before whose word high and low bend in reverence—— man utterly devoid of judgment, I tell you! Ursulus is a prodigal, who, without any demur, has gorged the rapacity of the court servants. And besides, he is useless in affairs of state. I have found that to my cost. I could never trust him to receive the emissaries of foreign princes.
#CAESARIUS.
And yet we beg you, sire—all who are here present—to be magnanimous, both to Ursulus and to the others.
#JULIAN.
Who are the others?
#CAESARIUS.
Too many, I fear. I will only name the under - treasurer, Evagrius, the late chamberlain, Saturninus, the supreme judge, Cyrenus, and——
#JULIAN.
Why do you stop?
#CAESARIUS.
Sire—the late Empress’s reader, Hekebolius, is also among the accused.
#JULIAN.
What! Impossible!
#CAESARIUS.
Accused of having accepted bribes from unworthy office - seekers——
#JULIAN.
Hekebolius accused of that——? A man like Hekebolius——?
#HEKEBOLIUS.
What shameful slander! Oh Christ—I mean to say—oh heavenly divinities!
#CAESARIUS.
Ah!
#JULIAN.
What mean you?
#CAESARIUS.
Nothing, most gracious Emperor!
#JULIAN.
Caesarius!
#CAESARIUS.
Yes, my august master!
#JULIAN.
Not master; call me your friend.
#CAESARIUS.
Dare a Christian call you so!
#JULIAN.
I pray you banish such thoughts, Caesarius! You must not believe that of me. How can I help all these accused men being Christians? Does it not merely show that the Christians have contrived to seize all the lucrative posts? And can the Emperor suffer the most important offices of the state to be badly administered? You surely do not think that it is your creed which has kindled my wrath against dishonest officials? I call all the gods to witness that I will permit no proceedings against you Christians that are not consonant with law and justice, nor will I suffer any one to do you wrong. You, or at any rate many of you, are pious in your way, since you too adore that Lord who is all - powerful, and who rules over the whole visible world.—Oh, my Caesarius, is it not he whom I also adore, though under other names?
#CAESARIUS.
Suffer me, gracious Emperor——
#JULIAN.
Moreover, it is my intention to show clemency wherever it is fit that I should do so. As to Hekebolius, his secret enemies must not imagine that they will be suffered to injure him by tale - bearing or any other sort of paltry intrigue.
#HEKEBOLIUS.
My Emperor! My shield and my defence!
#JULIAN.
Nor is it my will that all the minor court servants should be unmercifully deprived of their subsistence. I have specially in mind that barber whom I dismissed. I am sorry for it. The man may remain. He seemed to me one who understood his business thoroughly. All honour to such people! So far I can go, my Caesarius, but no further. I cannot interfere on behalf of Ursulus. I must act so that the blind, and yet so keen - eyed, Goddess of Justice may have no reason to knit her brows over a mortal to whom she has confided so great a responsibility.
#CAESARIUS.
After this, I have not a word more to say for those unfortunates. I only crave permission to leave the court and city.
#JULIAN.
Would you leave me?
#CAESARIUS.
Yes, most gracious Emperor!
#JULIAN.
You are stiff - necked, like your brother.
#CAESARIUS.
The new order of things gives me much to reflect upon.
#JULIAN.
I had great designs for you Caesarius! It would be a great joy to me, if you could renounce your errors. Can you not?
#CAESARIUS.
God knows what I might have done a month ago;—now I cannot. Julian. marriage into one of the most powerful families should stand open to you. Will you not bethink you?
#CAESARIUS.
No, most gracious lord. man like you could quickly mount from step to step. Caesarius, is it not possible that you can give me your aid in furthering the new order of things?
#CAESARIUS.
No, most gracious lord!
#JULIAN.
I do not mean here, but in other places. It is my intention to depart from here. Constantinople is very unpleasing to me; you Galileans have spoiled it for me in every way. I shall go to Antioch; there I shall find better soil to work upon. I thought you would accompany me. Will you not, Caesarius?
#CAESARIUS.
Most gracious lord, I too am bound for the east; but I will go alone.
#JULIAN.
And what will you do there?
#CAESARIUS.
Visit my old father; help Gregory to strengthen him for the coming struggle.
#JULIAN.
Go!
#CAESARIUS.
Farewell, my Emperor!
#JULIAN.
Happy father, with such unhappy sons!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
What reckless and most unseemly defiance!
#JULIAN.
My heart is wounded to the quick by this and many other things. You, my Hekebolius, shall accompany me. The ground burns beneath my feet in this poisoned Galilean city! I will write to those philosophers, Kytron and Priscus, who have won so great fame of late years. Maximus I expect every day; he shall go with us.—I tell you there are joyful days of victory awaiting us, Hekebolius! In Antioch, my friend,—there we shall meet the incomparable Libanius,—and there we are nearer Helios at his rising. Oh, this irresistible yearning towards the Sun - King——!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Yes, yes, yes——!
#JULIAN.
My Hekebolius!—Wisdom; light; beauty!
#JULIAN.
So great success have the gods vouchsafed me. Hardly a single city have I approached on my journey, whence whole troops of Galileans have not streamed forth to meet me on the road, lamenting their errors, and placing themselves under the protection of the divine powers. Compared with this, what signifies the senseless behaviour of the scoffers? May not the scoffers be likened to dogs, who in their ignorance yelp at the moon? Yet I will not deny that I have learned with indignation that some inhabitants of this city have spoken scornfully of the rule of life which I have enjoined on the priests of Cybele, the good goddess. Ought not reverence for so exalted a divinity to protect her servants from mockery? I say to those foolhardy men: Are ye barbarians, since ye know not who Cybele is? Must I solemnly remind you how, when the power of Rome was so gravely threatened by that Punic commander, whose grave I saw not long since in Libyssa, the Cumaean Sybil counselled that the statue of Cybele should be taken from the temple in Pessinus, and brought to Rome? As to the priests’ way of life, some have wondered that they should be forbidden to eat roots, and everything that grows along the earth, while they are allowed to partake of upward - growing herbs and fruits. Oh, how dense is your ignorance—I pity you if you cannot understand this! Can the spirit of man find nourishment in that which creeps along the ground? Does not the soul live by all that yearns upward, towards heaven and the sun? I will not enter more largely into these matters to - day. What remains to be said you shall learn from a treatise I am composing during my sleepless nights, which I hope will shortly be recited both in the lecture - halls and on the market - places. And with this, my friends, if no one has anything further to bring forward——
#CITIZEN.
Oh most gracious Emperor, let me not go unheard!
#JULIAN.
Surely not, my friend. Who are you?
#THE CITIZEN.
I am Medon, the corn - merchant. Oh, if my love for you, exalted and divine Emperor——
#JULIAN.
Come to your case, man!
#MEDON.
I have a neighbour, Alites, who for many years has done me every imaginable injury; for he, too, is a dealer in corn, and takes the bread out of my mouth in the most shameful way——
#JULIAN.
Aha, my good Medon; yet you look not ill - fed.
#MEDON.
Nor is that the matter, most gracious Emperor! Oh, by the august gods, whom every day I learn to love and praise more highly—his affronts to me I could overlook; but what I cannot suffer——
#JULIAN.
He surely does not insult the gods?
#MEDON.
He does what is worse,—or at least equally shameless; he—oh, I scarce know whether my indignation will permit me to utter it,—he insults you yourself, most gracious Emperor!
#JULIAN.
Indeed? In what words?
#MEDON.
Not in words, but worse—in act.
#JULIAN.
Then in what act?
#MEDON.
He wears a purple robe—— purple robe? Oho, that is bold.
#MEDON.
Oh, great wing - footed Mercury, when I think how he would have paid for that robe in your predecessor’s time! And this garment of vainglory I have daily before my eyes——
#JULIAN.
This garment, bought with money that might have been yours——
#MEDON.
Oh most gracious Emperor,—punish his audacity; let him be expelled the city; my love for our great and august ruler will not suffer me to remain a witness of such shameless arrogance.
#JULIAN.
Tell me, good Medon, what manner of clothes does Alites wear, besides the purple cloak?
#MEDON.
Truly I cannot call to mind, sire; ordinary clothes, I think; I have only remarked the purple cloak. purple cloak, then, and untanned sandals——?
#MEDON.
Yes, sire; it looks as ludicrous as it is audacious.
#JULIAN.
We must remedy this, Medon!
#MEDON.
Ah, most gracious Emperor——?
#JULIAN.
Come early to morrow to the palace——
#MEDON.
I will come very early, most gracious Emperor!
#JULIAN.
Give your name to my Chamberlain——
#MEDON.
Yes, yes, my most gracious Emperor!
#JULIAN.
You will receive from him a pair of purple shoes, embroidered with gold——
#MEDON.
Ah, my most generous lord and Emperor!
#JULIAN.
These shoes you will take to Alites, place them on his feet, and say that henceforth he must not fail to put them on, whenever he would walk abroad by daylight in his purple cloak——
#MEDON.
Oh!
#JULIAN.
——and, that done, you may tell him from me, that he is a fool if he thinks himself honoured by a purple robe, having not the power of the purple.—Go; and come for the shoes to - morrow!
#ANOTHER CITIZEN.
Praised be the Emperor’s justice! Oh how richly this envious corn - miser deserves his punishment! Oh hear me, and let your favour——
#JULIAN.
Aha; methinks I know that face. Were not you one of those who shouted before my chariot as I drove into the city?
#THE CITIZEN.
None shouted louder than I, incomparable Emperor! I am Malchus, the tax - gatherer. Ah, grant me your aid! I am engaged in a law - suit with an evil and grasping man——
#JULIAN.
And therefore you come to me? Are there not judges——?
#MALCHUS.
The affair is somewhat involved, noble Emperor. It concerns a field, which I leased to this bad man, having bought it seven years since, when part of the domain belonging to the Apostles’ Church was sold.
#JULIAN.
So, so; church property, then?
#MALCHUS.
Honestly purchased; but now this man denies either to pay me rent, or to give up the property, under pretext that this field once belonged to the temple of Apollo, and, as he declares, was unlawfully confiscated many years ago.
#JULIAN.
Tell me, Malchus,—you seem to be a follower of the Galilean?
#MALCHUS.
Most gracious Emperor, ’tis an old tradition in our family to acknowledge Christ.
#JULIAN.
And this you say openly, without fear?
#MALCHUS.
My adversary is bolder than I, sire! He goes in and out, as before; he fled not the city when he heard of your approach.
#JULIAN.
Fled not? And why should he flee, this man who stands out for the rights of the gods?
#MALCHUS.
Most gracious Emperor, you have doubtless heard of the book - keeper, Thalassius?
#JULIAN.
What! That Thalassius who, to ingratiate himself with my predecessor, whilst I was being slandered and menaced in Gaul, proposed, here in Antioch, in the open market - place, that the citizens should petition the Emperor to send them Julian Caesar’s head!
#MALCHUS.
Sire, it is this, your deadly foe, who is wronging me.
#JULIAN.
Truly, Malchus, I have as great ground of complaint against this man as you have.
#MALCHUS.
Tenfold greater, my gracious Emperor?
#JULIAN.
What think you? Shall we two combine our quarrels, and prosecute him together?
#MALCHUS.
Oh, what exceeding grace! Oh tenfold happiness!
#JULIAN.
Oh tenfold foolishness! Thalassius goes in and out as before, you say? He has not fled the city at my approach. Thalassius knows me better than you. Away with you, man! When I indict Thalassius for my head, you may indict him for your field.
#MALCHUS.
Oh tenfold misery!
#JULIAN.
That is well, my friends; rejoice that I have succeeded in making a not altogether unworthy beginning to this day, which is specially dedicate to the feast of the radiant Apollo. For is it not worthy of a philosopher to overlook affronts against himself, whilst he sternly chastises wrongs done to the immortal gods? I do not recall whether that crowned cultivator of learning, Marcus Aurelius, was ever in like case; but if he was, we must hope that he did not act quite unlike me, who hold it an honour to follow humbly in his footsteps. Let this serve as a clue for your future guidance. In the palace, in the market - place, even in the theatre—did I not loathe to enter such a place of folly—it is fit that you should greet me with acclamation and joyful applause. Such homage, I know, was well received both by the Macedonian Alexander and by Julius Caesar, men who were also permitted by the Goddess of Fortune to outshine other mortals in glory. But when you see me entering a temple, that is another affair. Then I desire you to be silent, or direct your plaudits to the gods, and not to me, as I advance with bent head and downcast eyes. And above all, I trust you will be heedful of this to - day, when I am to sacrifice to so transcendent and mighty a divinity as he whom we know by the name of the Sun - King, and who seems even greater in our eyes when we reflect that he is the same whom certain oriental peoples call Mithra. And with this—if no one has more to say——
#THE PRIEST AT THE DOOR.
In the name of the Lord God!
#JULIAN.
Who speaks? servant of God and of the Emperor.
#JULIAN.
Approach. What would you?
#THE PRIEST.
I would speak to your heart and to your conscience.
#JULIAN.
What voice was that! What do I see! In spite of beard and habit——! Gregory!
#THE PRIEST.
Yes, my august master!
#JULIAN.
Gregory! Gregory of Nazianzus!
#GREGORY.
Yes, gracious Emperor!
#JULIAN.
A little older; browner; broader. No; ’twas only at the first glance; now you are the same as ever.
#GREGORY.
Oh that it were so with you, sire!
#JULIAN.
Athens. That night in the portico. No man has lain so near my heart as you.
#GREGORY.
Your heart? Ah, Emperor, you have torn out of your heart a better friend than I.
#JULIAN.
You mean Basil?
#GREGORY.
I mean a greater than Basil.
#JULIAN.
Ah! So that is what you come to tell me? And in that habit——
#GREGORY.
I did not choose this habit, sire!
#JULIAN.
Not you? Who then?
#GREGORY.
He who is greater than the Emperor.
#JULIAN.
I know your Galilean phrases. For the sake of our friendship, spare me them.
#GREGORY.
Let me, then, begin by telling you how it is that you see me here, ordained a priest of the church you are persecuting.
#JULIAN.
Persecuting! Now speak on.
#GREGORY.
You know what were my thoughts of things divine, during our happy comradeship in Athens. But then it was far from my purpose to renounce the joys of life. Neither ambition nor the thirst for riches, I can truly say, has ever tempted me; yet I should scarce tell the truth if I denied that my eye and my mind dwelt wonderingly on all the glories which the old learning and art of Greece revealed to me. The wranglings and petty schisms in our church afflicted me deeply; but I took no part in them; I served my countrymen in temporal things; nothing more—— Then came tidings from Constantinople. It was said that Constantius had died of terror at your proceedings, and had declared you his heir. Heralded by the renown of your victories, and received as a superhuman being, you, the hero of Gaul and Germany, had ascended the throne of Constantine without striking a blow. The earth lay at your feet. Then came further tidings. The lord of earth was girding himself up to war against the Lord of heaven——
#JULIAN.
Gregory, what do you presume——!
#GREGORY.
The lord of the body was girding himself up to war against the Lord of the soul. I stand here before you in bodily fear and trembling; but I dare not lie. Will you hear the truth, or shall I be silent?
#JULIAN.
Say on, Gregory!
#GREGORY.
What have not my fellow Christians already suffered during these few months? How many sentences of death have been passed, and executed in the cruellest fashion? Gaudentius, the state secretary; Artemius, the former governor of Egypt; the two tribunes, Romanus and Vincentius——
#JULIAN.
You know not what you speak of. I tell you, the Goddess of Justice would have wept had those traitors escaped with their lives.
#GREGORY.
That may be, my Emperor; but I tell you that one sentence of death has been passed which the God of Justice can never forgive you. Ursulus! The man who stood your friend in times of need! Ursulus who, at the risk of his own life, supplied you with money in Gaul! Ursulus, whose sole crime was his Christian faith and his sincerity——
#JULIAN.
Ah, this you have from your brother, Caesarius!
#GREGORY.
Punish me, sire; but spare my brother.
#JULIAN.
You well know that you risk nothing, Gregory! Besides, I will grant you that Nevita acted too harshly.
#GREGORY.
Ay, that barbarian, who tries in vain to hide his origin under a Greek veneer——!
#JULIAN.
Nevita is zealous in his duty, and I cannot myself be everywhere. For Ursulus I have mourned sincerely, and I deeply deplore that neither time nor circumstances allowed me to examine into his case myself. I should certainly have spared him, Gregory! I have thought, too, of restoring to his heirs any property he has left behind.
#GREGORY.
Great Emperor, you owe me no reckoning for your acts. I only wished to tell you that all these tidings fell like thunderbolts in Caesarea and Nazianzus, and the other Cappadocian cities. How shall I describe their effect! Our internal wranglings were silenced by the common danger. Many rotten branches of the Church fell away; but in many indifferent hearts the light of the Lord was kindled with a fervour before undreamt - of. Meanwhile oppression overtook God’s people. The heathen—I mean, my Emperor, those whom I call heathen—began to threaten, to injure, to persecute us——
#JULIAN.
Retaliation,—retaliation, Gregory!
#GREGORY.
Far be it from me to justify all that my fellow Christians may have done in their excessive zeal for the cause of the Church. But you, who are so enlightened, and have power over all alike, cannot permit the living to suffer for the faults of the dead. Yet so it has been in Cappadocia. The enemies of the Christians, few in number, but thirsting after gain, and burning with eagerness to ingratiate themselves with the new officials, have awakened fear and perturbation among the people both in town and country. I am not thinking chiefly of the insults we have had to suffer, nor of the infringements of our just rights of property, to which we have been constantly exposed of late. What most grieves me and all my earnest brethren, is the peril to souls. Many are not firm - rooted in the faith, and cannot quite shake off the care for earthly goods. The harsh treatment which has now to be endured by all who bear the name of Christian has already led to more than one apostasy. Sire, this is soul - robbery from God’s kingdom.
#JULIAN.
Oh, my wise Gregory,—how can you talk so? I wonder at you? Should you not rather, as a good Galilean, rejoice that your community is rid of such men?
#GREGORY.
Gracious Emperor, I am not of that opinion. I have myself been indifferent in the faith, and I look upon all such as sick men, who are not past cure, so long as they remain in the bosom of the Church. So, too, thought our little congregation at Nazianzus. Brethren and sisters, in deep distress, assembled to take counsel against the perils of the time. They were joined by delegates from Caesarea and other cities. My father is infirm, and—as he owns with sorrow—does not possess the steadfast, immovable will which, in these troublous times, is needful for him who sits in the bishop’s chair. The assembly determined that a younger man should be chosen as his helper, to hold the Lord’s flock together. The choice fell on me.
#JULIAN.
Ah!
#GREGORY.
I was then away on a journey. But in my absence, and without consulting me, my father ordained me a priest and sent me the priestly habit. These tidings reached me in Tiberina, at my country house, where I was passing some days with my brother and with the friend of my youth, Basil of Caesarea. Sire—had my sentence of death been read to me, it could not have appalled me more than this. I a priest! I wished it, and I wished it not. I felt it must be—and yet my courage failed. I wrestled with God the Lord, as the patriarch wrestled with him in the days of the old covenant. What passed in my soul during the night which followed, I cannot tell. But this I know that, ere the cock crew, I talked face to face with the Crucified One.—Then I was his.
#JULIAN.
Folly, folly; I know those dreams.
#GREGORY.
On my homeward journey I passed through Caesarea. Oh, what misery met me there! I found the town full of fugitive country people, who had forsaken house and home because the drought had burnt up their crops, and laid all the vineyards and olive - gardens desolate. To escape starvation they had fled to the starving. There they lay—men, women, and children—in heaps along the walls of the houses; fever shook them, famine gnawed their entrails. What had Caesarea to offer them—that impoverished, unhappy town, as yet but half rebuilt after the great earthquake of two years ago? And in the midst of this, amid scorching heat and frequent earthquake - shocks, we had to see ungodly festivals going on day and night. The ruined altars were hastily rebuilt; the blood of sacrifices ran in streams; mummers and harlots paraded the streets with dance and song. Sire—can you wonder that my much - tried brethren thought they saw in the visitation that had come upon them a judgment of heaven because they had so long tolerated heathenism and its scandalous symbols in their midst?
#JULIAN.
What symbols do you mean?
#GREGORY.
The cry of the terror - stricken and fevered multitude rose ever higher; they demanded that the rulers of the city should give a palpable witness for Christ by ordering the destruction of what still remains of the former glory of heathendom in Caesarea.
#JULIAN.
You cannot mean to say that——?
#GREGORY.
The magistrates of the city called a meeting, where I too was present. You know, most gracious Emperor, that all temples are the property of the city; so that the citizens have the right to dispose of them at their own free will.
#JULIAN.
Well, well; what if it were so?
#GREGORY.
In that terrible earthquake that ravaged Caesarea two years ago, all the temples but one were destroyed.
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes; the temple of Fortuna.
#GREGORY.
At the meeting whereof I speak, the congregation determined to complete God’s work of judgment, in testimony that they would trust wholly and solely to him, and no longer tolerate the abomination in their midst.
#JULIAN.
Gregory,—once my friend—do you hold your life dear?
#GREGORY.
This resolution I did not myself approve, but almost all voices were in favour of it. But as we feared that the matter might be represented to you falsely, and might, perhaps, incense you against the city, it was determined to send a man hither to announce to you what we have resolved, and what will presently happen. Great ruler,—no one else was found willing to undertake the task. It fell perforce to me. Therefore it is, sire, that I stand here before you in all humility, to announce that we Christians in Caesarea have resolved that the temple where the heathen in bygone days worshipped a false deity, under the name of Fortuna, shall be pulled down and levelled with the ground.
#JULIAN.
And I must listen to this with my own ears: One single man dares to tell me such unheard - of things! COURTIERS, ORATORS, AND POETS. O pious Emperor, do not suffer it! Punish this audacious man!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
He is distraught, sire! Let him go. See,—the frenzy glitters in his eyes.
#JULIAN.
Ay, it may well be called madness. But ’tis more than madness. To dream of pulling down that excellent temple, dedicated to a no less excellent divinity! Is it not to the favour of this very goddess that I ascribe my achievements, the fame of which has reached the remotest nations? Were I to suffer this, how could I ever again hope for victory or prosperity?—Gregory, I command you to return to Caesarea and give the citizens to understand that I forbid this outrage.
#GREGORY.
Impossible, sire! The matter has come to such a pass that we have to choose between the fear of man and obedience to God. We cannot draw back.
#JULIAN.
Then you shall feel how far the Emperor’s arm can stretch!
#GREGORY.
The Emperor’s arm is mighty in earthly things; and I, like others, tremble under it.
#JULIAN.
Show it, then, in deeds! Ah, you Galileans, you reckon upon my long - suffering. Do not trust to it; for truly——
#JULIAN.
What is this? Eunapius, what has befallen you?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Oh that my eyes should see such a sight!
#JULIAN.
What sight have you seen?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Behold, most gracious Emperor, I come bleeding and bruised, yet happy to be the first to call down your wrath——
#JULIAN.
Speak, man;—who has beaten you?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Permit me, sire, to lay my complaint before you. I went forth from the town this morning to visit the little temple of Venus which you have lately restored. When I came thither, the music of flutes and singing greeted my ears. Women were dancing gracefully in the outer court, and within I found the whole space filled with a rapturous crowd, while at the altar priests were offering up the sacrifices you have ordained.
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes; and then——?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Scarcely had I had time to turn my thoughts in devotion toward that enchanting goddess, whom I especially revere and worship,—when a great crowd of young men forced their way into the temple——
#JULIAN.
Not Galileans?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Yes, sire,—Galileans.
#JULIAN.
Ah!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
What a scene followed! Weeping under the assailants’ insults and blows, the dancing - girls fled from the outer court to us within. The Galileans fell upon us all, belaboured us and affronted us in the most shameful manner.
#JULIAN.
Wait, wait!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Alas, would that their violence had fallen on us alone! But the madmen went further. Yes, gracious Emperor—in one word, the altar is overthrown, the statue of the goddess dashed to pieces, the entrails of the sacrifices cast out to the dogs——
#JULIAN.
Wait, wait, wait!
#GREGORY.
Sire, this one man’s word is not enough——
#JULIAN.
Be silent! Did you know any of the sacrilegious crew?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Not I, sire; but these citizens knew many of them.
#JULIAN.
Take a guard with you. Seize as many of the wretches as you can. Cast them into prison. The prisoners shall give up the names of the rest; and when I have them all in my power——
#GREGORY.
What then, sire?
#JULIAN.
Ask the executioner. Both you and the citizens of Caesarea shall be taught what you have to expect if, in your Galilean obstinacy, you should abide by your resolve.
#CITIZEN.
Good God of heaven, when did this misfortune happen?
#ANOTHER CITIZEN.
This morning, I tell you; quite early this morning.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
My good man, do you think it is fitting to call this a misfortune? I call it a crime, and a most audacious crime to boot.
#THE SECOND CITIZEN.
Yes, yes; that is quite true; it was a most audacious thing to do.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Only think—of course it is the outrage on the temple of Venus you are talking of? Only think of their choosing a time when the Emperor was in the city——! And this day, too, of all others—a day——
#THIRD CITIZEN.
Tell me, good friend, what is the matter——?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
This day of all others, I say, when our august ruler is himself to officiate at the feast of Apollo.
#THE THIRD CITIZEN.
Yes, I know that; but why are they taking these Christians to prison?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
What? Are they taking them to prison? Have they really caught them? Hush; what is that? Yes, by the gods, I believe they have them!
#PUBLIA.
I will not be held back! He is my only son, the child of my old age! Let me go; let me go! Can no one tell me where I can find the Emperor?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
What would you with the Emperor, old mother?
#PUBLIA.
I would have my son again. Help me! My son! Hilarion! Oh, they have taken him from me! They burst into our house—and then they took him away!
#ONE OF THE CITIZENS.
Who is this woman?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
What? Know you not the widow Publia,—the psalm - singer?
#CITIZEN.
Ah, yes, yes, yes!
#PUBLIA.
Hilarion! my child! What will they do to him? Ah, Phocion,—are you there? God be praised for sending me a Christian brother——!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Hush, hush, be quiet; do not scream so loud; the Emperor is coming.
#PUBLIA.
Oh, this ungodly Emperor! The Lord of Wrath is visiting his sins upon us; famine ravages the land; the earth trembles beneath our feet!
#THE COMMANDER OF THE DETACHMENT.
Stand aside; make room here!
#PUBLIA.
Oh come, good Phocion;—help me, for our friendship’s and our fellowship’s sake——
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Are you mad, woman? I do not know you.
#PUBLIA.
What? You do not know me? Are you not Phocion the dyer? Are you not the son of——?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
I am not the son of anybody. Get you gone, woman! You are mad! I do not know you; I have never seen you.
#SUBALTERN.
Clear the way here!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Yes, by the Sun - God, there he comes, the blessed Emperor!
#SOLDIER.
Do not push so, behind there!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Can you see him? The man with the white fillet round his brow, that is the Emperor.
#CITIZEN.
The man all in white?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Yes, yes, that is he.
#THE CITIZEN.
Why is he dressed in white?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Doubtless because of the heat; or,—no, stop,—I think it is as the sacrificing priest that he——
#SECOND CITIZEN.
Will the Emperor himself offer the sacrifice?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Yes, the Emperor Julian does everything himself.
#THIRD CITIZEN.
He does not look so powerful as the Emperor Constantius.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
I think he does. He is not so tall as the late Emperor; but his arms are longer. And then his glance——oh my friends——! You cannot see it just now; his eyes are modestly lowered as he walks. Yes, modest he is, I can tell you. He has no eye for women. I dare swear that since his wife’s death he has but seldom——; you see, he writes the whole night. That is why his fingers are often as black as a dyer’s; just like mine; for I am a dyer. I can tell you I know the Emperor better than most people. I was born here in Antioch; but I have lived fifteen years in Constantinople, until very lately——
#CITIZEN.
Is there aught, think you, in the rumour that the Emperor is minded to settle here for good?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
I know the Emperor’s barber, and he reports it so. Let us trust these shameful disturbances may not incense him too much.
#CITIZEN.
Alas, alas, that were a pity indeed!
#SECOND CITIZEN.
If the Emperor lived here, ’twould bring something in to all of us.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
’Twas on that reckoning that I returned here. So now we must do our best, friends; when the Emperor comes past, we must shout lustily both for him and for Apollo.
#CITIZEN.
Who is this Apollo, that people begin to talk so much about?
#THE OTHER CITIZEN.
Why, ’tis the priest of Corinth,—he who watered what the holy Paul had planted.
#THE FIRST CITIZEN.
Ay, ay; to be sure; I think I remember now.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
No, no, no, ’tis not that Apollo; ’tis another one entirely;—this is the Sun - King—the great lyre - playing Apollo.
#THE OTHER CITIZEN.
Ah indeed; that Apollo! Is he better?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
I should think so, indeed.—Look, look, there he comes. Oh, our most blessed Emperor!
#THE MULTITUDE.
Praise to the Emperor! Praise to Julian, hero and benefactor!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
All hail to Julian and to the Sun - King! Long live Apollo!
#THE CITIZENS.
Emperor, Emperor, stay long among us!
#JULIAN.
Citizens of Antioch! It were hard for me to name anything that could more rejoice my heart than these inspiriting acclamations. And my heart stands sorely in need of this refreshment. It was with a downcast spirit that I set forth on this procession, which should be one of joy and exaltation. Nay, more; I will not hide from you that I was this morning on the verge of losing that equanimity which it behoves a lover of wisdom to preserve under all trials. But can any one chide me for it? I would have you all remember what outrages are threatened elsewhere, and have already been committed here.
#PUBLIA.
My lord, my lord!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Oh pious and righteous Emperor, punish these desperate men!
#PUBLIA.
My lord, give me back my Hilarion!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
All good citizens implore your favour towards this city.
#JULIAN.
Seek to win the favour of the gods, and of mine you need have no doubt. And surely it is fitting that Antioch should lead the way. Does it not seem as though the Sun - God’s eye had dwelt with especial complacency on this city? Ask of travellers, and you shall hear to what melancholy extremes fanaticism has elsewhere proceeded in laying waste our holy places. What is left? A remnant here and there; and nothing of the best. But with you, citizens of Antioch! Oh, my eyes filled with tears of joy when first I saw that incomparable sanctuary, the very house of Apollo, which seems scarcely to be the work of human hands. Does not the image of the Glorious One stand within it, in unviolated beauty? Not a corner of his altar has broken or crumbled away, not a crack is to be seen in the stately columns. Oh, when I think of this,—when I feel the fillet round my brow—when I look down upon these garments, dearer to me than the purple robe of empire, then I feel, with a sacred tremor, the presence of the god. See, see, the sunlight quivers around us in its glory! Feel, feel, the air is teeming with the perfume of fresh - woven garlands! Beautiful earth! The home of light and life, the home of joy, the home of happiness and beauty;—what thou wast shalt thou again become!—In the embrace of the Sun - King! Mithra, Mithra! Forward on our victorious way!
#JULIAN.
What hinders us?
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Gracious lord, there is something amiss in the other street.
#SONG.
Blissful our pangs, be they never so cruel; Blissful our rising, the death - struggle o’er.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
The Galileans, sire! They have them!
#PUBLIA.
Hilarion!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
They have them! I hear the fetters——
#JULIAN.
Pass them by——!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
We have succeeded marvellously, sire.
#JULIAN.
Who are they, these ruffians?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Some of them belong to this city; but most, it seems, are peasants fleeing from Cappadocia.
#JULIAN.
I will not see them. Forward, as I commanded!
#THE PRISONERS’ SONG.
Blissful our crowning with martyrdom’s jewel; Blissful our meeting with saints gone before.
#JULIAN.
The madmen. Not so near to me! My guard, my guard!
#PUBLIA.
My child! Hilarion!
#HILARION.
Rejoice, my mother!
#JULIAN.
Poor deluded creatures! When I hear madness thus speaking in you, I almost doubt whether I have the right to punish you.
#ANOTHER VOICE.
Stand aside; take not from us our crown of thorns.
#JULIAN.
Night and horror,—what voice is that?
#THE LEADER OF THE GUARD.
’Twas this one, sire, who spoke.
#JULIAN.
Agathon! Agathon, Agathon! Answer me; are you not Agathon?
#THE PRISONER.
I am.
#JULIAN.
You among these? Speak to me?
#AGATHON.
I know you not!
#JULIAN.
You do not know me? You know not who I am?
#AGATHON.
I know you are the lord of the earth; therefore you are not my lord.
#JULIAN.
And the boy——? Is he your young brother? This man must be innocent.
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
My lord, this man is the very ringleader. He has confessed it; he even glories in his deed.
#JULIAN.
So strangely can hunger, and sickness, and misfortune disorder a man’s mind. If you will but say, in one word, that you repent, none of you shall suffer.
#PUBLIA.
Say it not, Hilarion!
#AGATHON.
Be strong, dear brother!
#PUBLIA.
Go, go to what awaits you, my only one!
#JULIAN.
Hear and bethink you, you others——
#AGATHON.
Choose between Christ and the Emperor!
#THE PRISONERS.
Glory to God in the highest!
#JULIAN.
Terrible is the Galilean’s power of delusion. It must be broken. Pass them by, the abominable crew! They cloud our gladness; they darken the day with their brooding death - hunger!—Flute - players—men, women—why are you silent? A song—a song in praise of life, and light, and happiness.
#THE PROCESSION OF APOLLO.
Gladsome with roses our locks to entwine; Gladsome to bathe in the sunlight divine!
#THE PROCESSION OF PRISONERS.
Blissful to sleep ’neath the blood - reeking sod; Blissful to wake in the gardens of God.
#THE PROCESSION OF APOLLO.
Gladsome ’mid incense - clouds still to draw breath.
#THE PROCESSION OF PRISONERS.
Blissful in blood - streams to strangle to death.
#THE PROCESSION OF APOLLO.
Ever for him who his godhead adoreth Deep draughts of rapture Apollo outpoureth.
#THE PROCESSION OF PRISONERS.
Bones racked and riven, flesh seared to a coal, He shall make whole!
#THE PROCESSION OF APOLLO.
Gladsome to bask in the light - sea that laves us!
#THE PROCESSION OF PRISONERS.
Blissful to writhe in the blood - death that saves us!
#WOMEN.
Mercy! The earth is quaking again!
#MAN IN FLIGHT.
Oh horror! Thunder beneath our feet——!
#ANOTHER MAN.
Was it indeed so? Was it the earth that shook?
#MOTHER.
Did you not feel it? That tree there swayed so that the branches whistled through the air.
#MANY VOICES.
Hark, hark, hark!
#SOME.
’Tis the roll of chariots on the pavements.
#OTHERS.
’Tis the sound of drums. Hark to the music——, the Emperor is coming!
#JULIAN.
I accept the omen!—— Never have I felt myself in such close communion with the immortal gods. The Bow - Wielder is among us. The earth thunders beneath his tread, as when of old he stamped in wrath upon the Trojan shore. But ’tis not on us he frowns. ’Tis on those unhappy wretches who hate him and his sunlit realm. Yes,—as surely as good or evil fortune affords the true measure of the gods’ favour towards mortals,—so surely is the difference here made manifest between them and us. Where are the Galileans now? Some under the executioner’s hands, others flying through the narrow streets, ashy pale with terror, their eyes starting from their heads—a shriek between their half - clenched teeth—their hair stiffening with dread, or torn out in despair. And where are we? Here in Daphne’s pleasant grove, where the dryads’ balmy breath cools our brows,—here, before the glorious temple of the glorious god, lapped in the melodies of flute and lyre,—here, in light, in happiness, in safety, the god himself made manifest among us. Where is the God of the Galileans? Where is the Jew, the carpenter’s crucified son? Let him manifest himself. Nay, not he! ’Tis fitting, then, that we should throng the sanctuary. There, with my own hands, I will perform the services which are so far from appearing to me mean and unbecoming, that I, on the contrary, esteem them above all others.
#HANK.
Stay, ungodly one! Galilean among us?
#THE SAME VOICE.
No further, blasphemer!
#JULIAN.
Who is he that speaks? Galilean priest. A blind old man. Here he stands.
#OTHERS AGAIN.
Away, away, with the shameless wretch!
#JULIAN.
Ah, what do I see? Tell me, old man, are not you Bishop Maris, of Chalcedon?
#THE OLD MAN.
Yes, I am that unworthiest servant of the Church.
#JULIAN.
“Unworthiest,” you call yourself; and I think you are not far wrong. If I mistake not, you have been one of the foremost in stirring up internal strife among the Galileans.
#BISHOP MARIS.
I have done that which weighs me still deeper down in penitence. When you seized the empire, and rumour told of your bent of mind, my heart was beleagured with unspeakable dread. Blind and enfeebled by age, I could not conceive the thought of setting myself up against the mighty monarch of the world. Yes,—God have mercy on me—I forsook the flock I was appointed to guard, shrank timidly from all the perils that gathered frowning around the Lord’s people, and sought shelter here, in my Syrian villa——
#JULIAN.
In truth a strange story! And you, timid as you say you are, you, who formerly prized the Emperor’s favour so highly, now step forth before me and fling insults in my very face!
#BISHOP MARIS.
Now I fear you no longer; for now has Christ fully possessed my heart. In the Church’s hour of need, her light and glory burst upon me. All the blood you shed,—all the violence and wrong you do—cry out to heaven, and, re - echoing mightily, ring in my deaf ears, and show me, in my night of blindness, the way I have to go.
#JULIAN.
Get you home, old man!
#BISHOP MARIS.
Not till you have sworn to renounce your devilish courses. What would you do? Would dust rise up against the spirit? Would the lord of earth cast down the Lord of heaven? See you not that the day of wrath is upon us by reason of your sins? The fountains are parched like eyes that have wept themselves dry. The clouds, which ought to pour the manna of fruitfulness upon us, sweep over our heads, and shed no moisture. This earth, which has been cursed since the morning of time, quakes and trembles under the Emperor’s blood - guiltiness.
#JULIAN.
What favour do you expect of your God for such excess of zeal, foolish old man? Do you hope that, as of old, your Galilean master will work a miracle, and give you back your sight?
#BISHOP MARIS.
I have all the sight I desire; and I thank the Lord that he quenched my bodily vision, so that I am spared from seeing the man who walks in a darkness more terrible than mine.
#JULIAN.
Let me pass!
#BISHOP MARIS.
Whither?
#JULIAN.
Into the Sun - King’s house.
#BISHOP MARIS.
You shall not pass. I forbid you in the name of the only God!
#JULIAN.
Frantic old man!—Away with him!
#BISHOP MARIS.
Ay, lay hands upon me! But he who dares to do so, his hand shall wither. The God of Wrath shall manifest himself in his might——
#JULIAN.
Your God is no mighty God. I will show you that the Emperor is stronger than he——
#BISHOP MARIS.
Lost creature!—Then must I call down the ban upon thee, thou recreant son of the church!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
My lord and Emperor, let not this thing be!
#BISHOP MARIS.
Cursed be thou, Julianus Apostata! Cursed be thou, Emperor Julian! God the Lord hath spat thee forth out of his mouth! Cursed be thine eyes and thy hands! Cursed be thy head and all thy doings! Woe, woe, woe to the apostate! Woe, woe, woe——
#BISHOP MARIS.
God has spoken.
#JULIAN.
Apollo has spoken. His temple was polluted: therefore he crushed it.
#BISHOP MARIS.
And I tell you it was that Lord who laid the temple of Jerusalem in ruins.
#JULIAN.
If it be so, then the churches of the Galilean shall be closed, and his priests shall be driven with scourges to raise up that temple anew.
#BISHOP MARIS.
Try, impotent man! Who has had power to restore the temple of Jerusalem since the Prince of Golgotha called down destruction upon it?
#JULIAN.
I have the power! The Emperor has the power! Your God shall be made a liar. Stone by stone will I rebuild the temple of Jerusalem in all its glory, as it was in the days of Solomon.
#BISHOP MARIS.
Not one stone shall you add to another; for it is accursed of the Lord.
#JULIAN.
Wait, wait; you shall see—if you could see—you who stand there forsaken and helpless, groping in the darkness, not knowing where you next may place your foot.
#BISHOP MARIS.
Yet I see the glare of the lightning that shall one day fall upon you and yours.
#HERACLIUS.
I can endure this life no longer. To rise with the sun, plunge into a cold bath, run or fence oneself weary——
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
’Tis all very wholesome.
#HERACLIUS.
Is it wholesome to eat seaweed and raw fish?
#COURTIER.
Is it wholesome to have to devour meat in great lumps, all bloody, as it comes from the butcher?
#HERACLIUS.
’Tis little enough meat I have seen for the past week. Most of it goes to the altars. Ere long, methinks, we shall be able to say that the ever - venerable gods are the only meat - eaters in Antioch.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Still the same old mocker, Heraclius.
#HERACLIUS.
Why, of what are you thinking, friend? Far be it from me to mock at the Emperor’s wise decrees. Blessed be the Emperor Julian! Does he not follow in the footsteps of the immortals? For, tell me, does not a certain frugality seem nowadays to reign, even in the heavenly housekeeping?
#COURTIER.
Ha - ha - ha! There you are not far wrong.
#HERACLIUS.
Look at Cybele, formerly so bounteous a goddess, whose statue the Emperor lately found in an ash - pit——
#ANOTHER COURTIER.
It was in a dunghill——
#HERACLIUS.
Like enough; fertilising is Cybele’s business. But look at this goddess, I say;—in spite of her hundred breasts, she flows neither with milk nor honey.
#HERACLIUS.
It seems as though this wet - nurse of the world had become barren. We might almost think that she had passed the age when women——
#COURTIER.
Fie, fie, Heraclius,—shame on you!
#HERACLIUS.
Well, enough of her. But is Ceres in the same case? Does she not display a most melancholy—I had almost said an imperial—parsimony? Yes, believe me, if we had a little more intercourse with high Olympus nowadays, we should hear much to the same tune. I dare swear that nectar and ambrosia are measured out as sparingly as possible. Oh Zeus, how gaunt must thou have grown! Oh roguish Dionysus, how much is there left of the fulness of thy loins? Oh wanton, quick - flushing Venus,—oh Mars, inauspicious to married men——
#JULIAN.
Oh most shameless Heraclius! Oh scurvy, gall - spitting, venom - mouth——
#HERACLIUS.
Ah, my gracious Emperor!
#JULIAN.
Oh ribald scoffer at all sacred things! And this must I endure—to hear your croaking tongue the instant I leave my library to breathe the fresh morning air! Know you what I hold under my left arm? No, you do not know. ’Tis a polemic against you, blasphemous and foolish Heraclius!
#HERACLIUS.
What, my Emperor,—against me?
#JULIAN.
Yes, a treatise against you. A treatise with which my indignation has this very night inspired me. Think you I could be other than wroth at your most unseemly behaviour yesterday? How strange was the licence you allowed yourself in the lecture - hall, in my hearing, and that of many other earnest men? Had we not to listen for hours together to the shameful fables about the gods which you must needs retail? How dared you repeat such fictions? Were they not lies, from first to last?
#HERACLIUS.
Ah, my Emperor, if you call that lying, then both Ovid and Lucian were liars.
#JULIAN.
What else? Oh, I cannot express the indignation that seized me when I understood whither your impudent address was tending. “Man, let nothing surprise you,” I was tempted to say with the comic poet, when I heard you, like an ill - conditioned cur, barking forth, not expressions of gratitude, but a string of irrational nursery - tales, and ill - written to boot. For your verses were bad, Heraclius;—that I have proved in my treatise. How I longed to arise and leave the hall when I saw you, as in a theatre, making a spectacle both of Dionysus and of the great immortal after whom you are named! If I constrained myself to keep my seat, I can assure you ’twas more out of respect to the players—if I dare call them so—than to the poet. But ’twas most of all for my own sake. I feared it might seem as though I were fleeing like a frightened dove. Therefore I made no sign, but quietly repeated to myself that verse of Homer: “Bear it, my heart, for a time; heavier things hast thou suffered.” Endure, as before, to hear a mad dog yelp at the eternal gods. Yes, I see we must stomach this and more. We are fallen on evil days. Show me the happy man who has been suffered to keep his eyes and ears uncontaminated in this iron age!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
I pray you, my noble master, be not so deeply moved. Let it comfort you that we all listened with displeasure to this man’s folly.
#JULIAN.
That is in nowise the truth! I read in the countenances of most of you something far different from displeasure while this shameless mountebank was babbling forth his ribaldries, and then looking round the circle with a greasy smile, just as though he had done something to be proud of.
#HERACLIUS.
Alas, my Emperor, I am most unhappy——
#JULIAN.
That you may well be; for this is, in truth, no trifling matter. Think you the legends of the gods have not a serious and weighty purpose? Are they not destined to lead the human spirit, by an easy and pleasant path, up to the mystic abodes where reigns the highest god,—and thereby to make our souls capable of union with him? How can it be otherwise? Was it not with that view that the old poets invented such legends, and that Plato and others repeated them, and even added to their number? Apart from this purpose, I tell you, these stories would be fit only for children or barbarians,—and scarcely for them. But was it children and barbarians, pray, that you had before you yesterday? Where do you find the audacity to address me as if I were a child? Do you think yourself a sage, and entitled to a sage’s freedom of speech, because you wear a ragged cloak, and carry a beggar’s staff in your hand?
#COURTIER.
How true, my Emperor! No, no, it needs more than that.
#JULIAN.
Ay? Does it indeed? And what? To let your hair grow, perhaps, and never clean your nails? Oh hypocritical Cleon! I know you, one and all. Here, in this treatise, I have given you a name which——; you shall hear——
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Ah, you come in the nick of time, most honoured Libanius!
#JULIAN.
Where can it be——
#LIBANIUS.
What mean you, friend?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
The Emperor is much enraged; your coming will pacify him.
#JULIAN.
Ah, here I have it—— What does that man want?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Sire, this is——
#JULIAN.
No matter, no matter! Now you shall hear whether I know you or not. There are among the wretched Galileans a number of madmen who call themselves penitents. These renounce all earthly possessions, and yet demand great gifts of the fools who treat them as holy men and almost as objects of worship. Behold, you are like these penitents, except that I shall give you nothing. For I am not so foolish as those others. Yes, yes, were I not firm on that point, you would soon overrun the whole court with your shamelessness. Nay, do you not already do so? Are there not many among you who would come again, even if I drove them away? Oh my dear friends, what can this lead to? Are you lovers of wisdom? Are you followers of Diogenes, whose garb and habits you ape? In truth, you do not haunt the schools nearly so much as you besiege my treasurer. What a pitiful and despicable thing has not wisdom become because of you! Oh, hypocrites and babblers without understanding! Oh you—— But what is yonder fat man seeking?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Sire, it is the chief magistrate of the city——
#JULIAN.
The chief magistrate must wait. The matters we have in hand must take precedence of all meaner affairs. How now? Why this air of impatience? Is your business so weighty——
#LIBANIUS.
By no means, sire; I can come another day.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Sire, do you not recognise this distinguished man? This is the rhetorician Libanius.
#JULIAN.
What? Libanius? Impossible. Libanius here—the incomparable Libanius! I cannot believe it.
#LIBANIUS.
I thought the Emperor knew that the citizens of Antioch had chosen me as their chief magistrate.
#JULIAN.
Assuredly I knew it. But when I made my entrance into the city, and the magistrates came forth to greet me with an oration, I looked in vain for Libanius. Libanius was not among them.
#LIBANIUS.
The Emperor had uttered no wish to hear Libanius speak on that occasion.
#JULIAN.
The orator Libanius ought to have known what were the Emperor’s wishes in that respect.
#LIBANIUS.
Libanius knew not what changes time and absence might have wrought. Libanius therefore judged it more becoming to take his place among the multitude. He chose, indeed, a sufficiently conspicuous position; but the Emperor deigned not to let his eyes fall on him.
#JULIAN.
I thought you received my letter the day after——
#LIBANIUS.
Your new friend Priscus brought it to me.
#JULIAN.
And none the less—perhaps all the more—you held aloof——?
#LIBANIUS.
Headache and weighty business——
#JULIAN.
Ah, Libanius, in bygone days you were not so chary of your presence.
#LIBANIUS.
I come where I am bidden. Ought I to be intrusive? Would you have me stand in the way of the Emperor’s much - honoured Maximus?
#JULIAN.
Maximus never appears at court.
#LIBANIUS.
And for good reason. Maximus holds a court of his own. The Emperor has conceded him a whole palace.
#JULIAN.
Oh my Libanius, have I not conceded you my heart? How can you envy Maximus his palace?
#LIBANIUS.
I envy no man. I do not even envy my colleagues Themistius and Mamertinus, although you have conferred on them such signal proofs of your favour. Nor do I envy Hekebolius, whose wealth you have increased by such princely presents. I even rejoice to be the only man to whom you have given nothing. For I well know the reason of the exception. You wish the cities of your empire to abound in everything, and most of all in oratory, knowing that it is that distinction which marks us off from the barbarians. Now you feared that I, like certain others, might, if you gave me riches, become lukewarm in my art. The Emperor has therefore preferred to let the teacher of his youth remain poor, in order to hold him the closer to his craft. Thus do I interpret a course of action which has astonished some whom I forbear to name. ’Tis for the honour and well - being of the state that you have given me nothing. I am to lack riches that I may abound in eloquence.
#JULIAN.
And I, my Libanius, have also understood the reason why the teacher of my youth has let me pass many months here in Antioch without presenting himself. Libanius doubtless deemed that any services his former pupil may have rendered to the gods, to the state, or to learning, were not great enough to deserve celebration by the man who is called the king of eloquence. Libanius no doubt thought that meaner orators were better fitted to deal with such trivial things. Moreover, Libanius has remained silent out of care for the balance of my mind. You feared, doubtless, to see the Emperor intoxicated with arrogance, reeling like one who in his thirst has drunk too deeply of the leaf - crowned wine - bowl, had you lavished on him any of that art which is the marvel of Greece, and raised him, so to speak, to the level of the gods, by pouring out before him so precious a libation.
#LIBANIUS.
Ah, my Emperor, if I could believe that my oratory possessed such power——
#JULIAN.
And why should you not believe it, incomparable friend? Oh, leave me. I am wroth with you, Libanius. But it is the lover’s anger against the one he loves.
#LIBANIUS.
Is it indeed so? Oh my crowned brother, let me then tell you that not a day has passed since your coming hither on which I have not cursed the steadfastness that would not let me make the first advance. My friends assured me—not without some show of reason—that you had undertaken this long journey chiefly in order to see me and hear me speak. But Julian himself gave no sign. What was I to do? Should I flatter as Emperor him whom I loved as a man?
#JULIAN.
My Libanius!
#LIBANIUS.
My friend and brother!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
How honourable to both!
#COURTIERS AND TEACHERS.
How beautiful! How sublime!
#JULIAN.
Libanius, cruel friend,—how could you find it in your heart to balk me so long of this happy moment? During the weeks and months I have waited for you, my countenance has been veiled in Scythian darkness.
#LIBANIUS.
Alas, you were in better case than I; for you had those to whom you could speak about your absent friend.
#JULIAN.
Say not so. I had only the hapless lover’s comfort: that of sorrowfully repeating your name, and crying out: “Libanius, Libanius!”
#LIBANIUS.
Ah, whilst you spoke thus to empty air, I spoke to the four walls of my chamber. Most of the day I passed in bed, picturing to myself who was then with you—now this one, now that. “Once it was otherwise,” I said to myself,—“then it was I who possessed Julian’s ear.”
#JULIAN.
And meanwhile you let me pine away with longing. Look at me. Have I not grown a century older?
#LIBANIUS.
Oh, have I not suffered as great a change? You did not recognise me.
#JULIAN.
This meeting has been to both of us as a bath, from which we go forth healed. And now, beloved friend, now tell me what has brought you hither to - day; for I cannot doubt that you have some special errand.
#LIBANIUS.
To say nothing of my longing—so it is. Would that another had been sent in my stead! But the post of honour to which the confidence of the citizens has summoned me makes it my duty to perform all missions alike.
#JULIAN.
Speak, my Libanius, and tell me how I can serve you.
#LIBANIUS.
Let me begin by saying that the inhabitants of this city are sunk in sorrow because you have withdrawn your favour from them.
#JULIAN.
H’m——!
#LIBANIUS.
And this sorrow has been coupled with anxiety and disquiet since Alexander, the new governor, assumed office.
#JULIAN.
Aha; indeed!
#LIBANIUS.
The exaltation of such a man could not but take us by surprise. Alexander has hitherto filled only trifling offices, and that in a manner little calculated to earn him either the respect or the affection of the citizens.
#JULIAN.
I know that well, Libanius!
#LIBANIUS.
Alexander is violent in all his dealings, and justice is of little moment in his eyes——
#JULIAN.
I know it; I know all you tell me. Alexander is a rough man, without morals and without eloquence. Alexander has in no way deserved so great advancement. But you may tell the citizens of Antioch that they have deserved Alexander. Ay, they have, if possible, deserved a still worse ruler, covetous and intractable as they are——
#LIBANIUS.
It is, then, as we feared; this is a punishment——
#JULIAN.
Hear me, Libanius! How did I come hither? With full confidence in the people of this city. Antioch, chosen by the Sun - King for his especial seat, was to help me to repair all the wrong and ingratitude which had so long been shown to the immortals. But how have you met me? Some with defiance, others with lukewarmness. What have I not to endure here? Does not that Cappadocian, Gregory of Nazianzus, still wander about the city, stirring up the ignorant Galileans by his audacious speeches? Has not a poet arisen among them—a certain Apollinaris—who, with his wild songs, inflames their fanaticism to the point of madness? And what do I not learn from other places? In Caesarea, have they not carried out their threat, and wrecked the temple of Fortuna! Oh shame and infamy! Where were the goddess’s worshippers the while? Did they prevent it? No, they did not lift a finger, Libanius, though they should have laid down life itself to preserve the sanctuary. But wait, wait! The Galileans of Caesarea shall atone with their blood, and the whole city shall go up in flames as soon as I have time at my disposal.
#LIBANIUS.
My lord and friend,—if you would permit me——
#JULIAN.
Permit me, first. Say yourself whether I ought to tolerate such things? Say whether my zeal can bear with such insults to the divinities who hover over and shield me? But what can I do? Have I not laboured through many a long night to disprove these unhappy delusions,—writing, Libanius, till my eyes were red, and my fingers black with ink? And what good, think you, has it done? I have reaped scorn instead of thanks, not only from the fanatics themselves, but even from men who pretend to share my opinions. And now, to crown all these mortifications, I find you acting as spokesman for the complaints of a handful of citizens against Alexander, who at least does his best to keep the Galileans in check.
#LIBANIUS.
Oh, my august friend,—that is precisely our ground of complaint.
#JULIAN.
Do you tell me this?
#LIBANIUS.
’Tis not with my own good will that I do the city’s errands. I urged upon the council that they ought to choose for this task the most distinguished man in the town, thereby implying that I did not wish to be chosen. Despite this hint, the choice fell on me, who am certainly not——
#JULIAN.
Well, well, well! But oh, Libanius, that I must hear from your mouth——!
#LIBANIUS.
I beg my crowned brother to remember that I speak in the name of the city! For myself, I prize the immortal gods as highly as any one. Where would the art of oratory be without the legends which the poets of bygone days have left to us? May not these legends be likened to a rich vein of ore, whence an accomplished orator can forge himself both weapons and ornaments, if only he understands how to work the metal skilfully? How flat and insipid would not the maxims of wisdom seem, expressed without images or comparisons borrowed from the supernatural? But think, oh my friend—can you expect the multitude to take this view, especially in such an age as ours? I assure you that in Antioch, at any rate, ’tis not to be hoped for. The citizens—both Galileans and the more enlightened—have of late years lived at peace without greatly concerning themselves as to these matters. There is scarce a household in the city wherein people are of one mind upon things divine. But, until lately, domestic peace has nevertheless prevailed. Now the case is altered. People have begun to weigh creed against creed. Discord has broken out between the nearest kinsmen. For example, a citizen, whose name I forbear to mention, has lately disinherited his son because the young man separated himself from the Galilean community. Commerce and social life suffer from all this, especially now, when scarcity reigns and famine stands at the door.
#JULIAN.
Enough, enough,—more than enough, Libanius! You complain of scarcity. But tell me, has luxury ever been more rampant than now? Is the amphitheatre ever empty when it is reported that a new lion has arrived from Africa? Last week, when there was a talk of turning all idlers and vagabonds out of the city because of the dearth, did not the citizens loudly demand that the gladiators and dancing - girls should be exempted; for they felt they could not exist without them! Ah, well may the gods desert you in wrath over, your folly! There are plenty of teachers of wisdom in this city, but where is wisdom? Why do so few tread in my footsteps? Why stop at Socrates? Why not go a few steps further, and follow Diogenes, or—if I dare say so—me, since we lead you to happiness? For is not happiness the goal of all philosophy? And what is happiness but harmony with oneself? Does the eagle want golden feathers? Or the lion claws of silver? Or does the pomegranate - tree long to bear fruits of sparkling stone? I tell you no man has a right to enjoy until he has steeled himself to forbear. Ay, he ought not to touch enjoyment with his finger - tips until he has learnt to trample it under foot. Ah truly, we are far from that! But for that end will I work with all my might. For the sake of these things I will give up others which are also important. The Persian king—alarmed at my approach—has offered me terms of peace. I think of accepting them, that I may have my hands free to enlighten and improve you, intractable generation! As to the other matter, it must remain as it is. You shall keep Alexander. Make the best you can of him. Yet, my Libanius, it shall not be said that I have sent you from me in disfavour——
#LIBANIUS.
Ah, my Emperor——
#JULIAN.
You mentioned with a certain bitterness that I had given much to Themistius and Mamertinus. But did I not also take something from them? Did I not take from them my daily companionship? ’Tis my intent to give you more than I gave them.
#LIBANIUS.
Ah, what do you tell me, my august brother?
#JULIAN.
’Tis not my intent to give you gold or silver. That folly prevailed with me only at first, until I saw how people flocked round me, like thirsty harvesters round a fountain, elbowing and jostling one another, and each stretching out a hollow hand to have it filled first, and filled to the brim. I have grown wiser since. I think it may be said in particular that the Goddess of Wisdom has not withdrawn her countenance from me in the measures I have taken for the good of this city.
#LIBANIUS.
Doubtless, doubtless!
#JULIAN.
Therefore I commission you, oh my Libanius, to compose a panegyric on me.
#LIBANIUS.
Ah, what an honour——!
#JULIAN.
You must lay special stress on the benefits for which the citizens of Antioch owe me gratitude. I hope you will produce an oration that shall do honour both to the orator and to his subject. This task, my Libanius, shall be my gift to you. I know of nothing more fitting to offer to a man like you.
#LIBANIUS.
Oh, my crowned friend, what a transcendent favour!
#JULIAN.
And now to the fencing - hall. Then, my friends, we will walk through the streets, to give these insolent townsfolk a profitable example of sobriety in dress and simplicity in manners.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Through the streets, sire? In this midday heat——
#COURTIER.
Pray, sire, let me be excused; I feel extremely unwell——
#HERACLIUS.
I too, most gracious lord! All this morning I have been struggling against a feeling of nausea——
#JULIAN.
Then take an emetic, and see if you cannot throw up your folly at the same time. Oh Diogenes,—how degenerate are your successors! They are ashamed to wear your cloak in the open street.
#THE WOMEN.
Ah, Gregory, Gregory—speak to us! Comfort us in this anguish!
#GREGORY.
Only One can give comfort here. Hold fast by Him. Cling to the Lord our Shepherd.
#MOTHER.
Know you this, oh man of God,—the Emperor has commanded that all our sacred scriptures shall be burnt!
#GREGORY.
I have heard it; but I cannot believe that his folly is so great.
#APOLLINARIS.
It is true. Alexander, the new governor, has sent out soldiers to search the houses of the brethren. Even women and children are whipped till they bleed, if they are suspected of hiding books.
#CYRILLUS.
The Emperor’s decree applies not to Antioch only, nor even to Syria; it applies to the empire and the whole world. Every smallest word that is written concerning Christ is to be wiped out of existence, and out of the memory of believers.
#APOLLINARIS.
Oh ye mothers, weep for yourselves and for your children! The day will come when ye shall dispute with those ye now carry in your arms, as to what was in truth written in the lost Word of God. The day will come when your children’s children shall mock at you, and shall not know who or what Christ was. The day will come when no heart shall remember that once on a time the Saviour of the world suffered and died. The last believer shall go in darkness to his grave, and from that hour shall Golgotha vanish away from the earth, like the place where the Garden of Eden lay. Woe, woe, to the new Pilate! He is not content, like the first, to slay the Saviour’s body. He murders the word and the faith!
#THE WOMEN.
Woe, woe, woe!
#GREGORY.
And I say unto you, be of good cheer! God does not die. ’Tis not from Julian that the danger comes. The danger was there long ere he arose, in the weakness and contentiousness of our hearts.
#CYRILLUS.
Oh, Gregory, how can you ask us to remain steadfast amid these horrors?—Brethren and sisters—know you what has happened in Arethusa? The unbelievers have maltreated the old bishop Marcus, dragged him by the hair through the streets, cast him into the sewers, dragged him up again, bleeding and befouled, smeared him over with honey and set him in a tree, a prey to wasps and poisonous flies.
#GREGORY.
And has not God’s power been gloriously manifested in this very Marcus? What was Marcus before? A man of doubtful faith. When the troubles broke out in Arethusa, he even fled from the city. But behold— - no sooner had he heard in his hiding - place that the raging crew were avenging the bishop’s flight on innocent brethren, than he returned of his own free will. And how did he bear the torments which so appalled even his executioners, that in order to withdraw with some show of credit, they offered to release him if he would pay a very trifling fine? Was not his answer: No—and no, and again no? The Lord God was with him. He neither died nor yielded. His countenance showed neither terror nor impatience. In the tree wherein he hung, he thanked God for being lifted a few steps nearer heaven, while the others, as he said, crawled about on the flat earth. miracle must have happened to the resolute old man. If you had heard, as I did, the shrieks from the prison, that day in the summer when Hilarion and the others were tortured——! They were like no other shrieks—agonised, rasping, mixed with hissing sounds every time the white - hot iron buried itself in the raw flesh.
#APOLLINARIS.
Oh, Cyrillus, have you forgotten how the shrieks passed over into song? Did not Hilarion sing even in death? Did not that heroic Cappadocian boy sing until he gave up the ghost under the hands of the torturers? Did not Agathon, that boy’s brother, sing until he swooned away, and then woke up in madness? Verily I say unto you, so long as song rings out above our sorrows, Satan shall never conquer!
#GREGORY.
Be of good cheer. Love one another and suffer one for another, as Serapion in Doristora lately suffered for his brothers, for love of whom he let himself be scourged, and cast alive into the furnace! See, see,—has not the Lord’s avenging hand already been raised against the ungodly? Have you not heard the tidings from Heliopolis under Lebanon?
#APOLLINARIS.
I know it. In the midst of the ribald feast of Aphrodite, the heathen broke into the house of our holy sisters, violated them, murdered them amid tortures unspeakable——
#THE WOMEN.
Woe, woe!
#APOLLINARIS.
——ay, some of the wretches even tore open the bodies of the martyrs, dragged forth the entrails and ate the liver raw!
#THE WOMEN.
Woe, woe, woe!
#GREGORY.
The God of Wrath seasoned the meal. How have they thriven on it? Go to Heliopolis, and you shall see those men with a putrefying poison in all their veins, their eyes and teeth dropping out, bereft of speech and understanding. Horror has fallen on the city. Many heathens have been converted since that night. Therefore I fear not this pestilent monster who has risen up against the church; I fear not this crowned hireling of hell, who is bent upon finishing the work of the enemy of mankind. Let him fall upon us with fire, with sword, with the wild beasts of the amphitheatre! Should his madness even drive him further than he has yet gone—what does it matter? For all this there is a remedy, and the path lies open to victory.
#THE WOMEN.
Christ, Christ!
#OTHER VOICES.
There he is! There he comes!
#SOME.
Who?
#OTHERS.
The Emperor! The murderer! The enemy of God!
#GREGORY.
Be still! Let him pass by in silence.
#MOTHER.
See, see, he has wrapped himself in rags, like a beggar.
#ANOTHER WOMAN.
He must be out of his senses.
#THIRD WOMAN.
God has already stricken him.
#FOURTH WOMAN.
Hide your little ones against your breasts. Let not their eyes behold the monster.
#JULIAN.
Aha, are not these all Galileans? What do you here in the sunshine, in the open street, you spawn of darkness?
#GREGORY.
You have closed our churches; therefore we stand without and praise the Lord our God.
#JULIAN.
Ah, is that you, Gregory? So you still linger here. But beware; my patience will not last for ever.
#GREGORY.
I seek not a martyr’s death; I do not even desire it; but if it be allotted me, I shall glory in dying for Christ.
#JULIAN.
Your phrases weary me. I will not have you here. Why cannot you keep to your stinking dens? Go home, I tell you!
#MOTHER.
Oh, Emperor, where is our home?
#ANOTHER WOMAN.
Where are our houses? The heathen have plundered them and driven us out.
#VOICE IN THE THRONG.
Your soldiers have taken from us all our goods.
#OTHER VOICES.
Oh Emperor, Emperor, why have you seized upon our possessions?
#JULIAN.
You ask that? I will tell you, ignorant creatures! If your riches are taken from you, ’tis out of care for your souls’ weal. Has not the Galilean said that you shall possess neither silver nor gold? Has not your Master promised that you shall one day ascend to heaven? Ought you not, then, to thank me for making your rising as easy as possible?
#THE PHILOSOPHERS.
Oh, incomparably answered!
#APOLLINARIS.
Sire, you have robbed us of what is more precious than gold and silver. You have robbed us of God’s own word. You have robbed us of our sacred scriptures.
#JULIAN.
I know you, hollow - eyed psalm - singer! Are not you Apollinaris? I believe if I take away your senseless books, you are capable of making up others, just as senseless, in their stead. But you are a pitiful bungler, let me tell you, both in prose and verse! By Apollo! no true Greek would suffer a line of yours to pass his lips. The pamphlet you sent me the other day, which you had the effrontery to entitle “The Truth,” I have read, understood, and condemned.
#APOLLINARIS.
’Tis possible you may have read it; but understood it you have not; for if you had, you would not have condemned it.
#JULIAN.
Ha - ha! the rejoinder I am preparing will prove that I understood it.—But as to those books whose loss you lament and howl over, I may tell you that you will presently hold them cheaper when it is proved that Jesus of Nazareth was a liar and deceiver.
#THE WOMEN.
Woe to us; woe to us!
#CYRILLUS.
Emperor—what mean you by that?
#JULIAN.
Did not the crucified Jew prophesy that the Temple of Jerusalem should lie in ruins till the end of time?
#CYRILLUS.
So shall it be!
#JULIAN.
Oh fools! At this moment my general, Jovian, with two thousand workmen, is at Jerusalem, rebuilding the temple in all its glory. Wait, wait, you stiff - necked doubters—you shall learn who is the mightier, the Emperor or the Galilean.
#CYRILLUS.
Sire, that you yourself shall learn to your dismay. I held my peace till you blasphemed the Highest, and called him a liar; but now I tell you that you have not a feather - weight of power against the Crucified One!
#JULIAN.
Who are you, and what do you call yourself?
#CYRILLUS.
I will tell you. First and foremost I call myself a Christian, and that is a most honourable name; for it shall never be wiped away from the earth. Furthermore, I bear the name of Cyrillus, and am known by that name among my brethren and sisters. But if I keep the former name unspotted, I shall reap eternal life as a reward.
#JULIAN.
You are mistaken, Cyrillus! You know I am not unversed in the mysteries of your creed. Believe me—he in whom you put your trust is not the being you imagine. He died, in very truth, at the time when the Roman, Pontius Pilate, was governor in Judea.
#CYRILLUS.
I am not mistaken. ’Tis you, oh Emperor, who err in this. ’Tis you, who repudiated Christ at the moment when he gave you dominion over the world. Therefore I tell you, in his name, that he will quickly take from you both your dominion and your life; and then shall you recognise, too late, how mighty is he whom in your blindness you despise. Yea, as you have forgotten his benefits, he will not remember his lovingkindness, when he shall rise up to punish you. You have cast down his altars; he shall cast you down from your throne. You have taken delight in trampling his law under foot, that very law which you yourself once proclaimed to believers. In like manner shall the Lord trample you under his heel. Your body shall be scattered to the wild winds, and your soul shall descend to a place of greater torments than you can devise for me and mine!
#JULIAN.
I would fain have spared you, Cyrillus! The gods are my witnesses that I hate you not for your faith’s sake. But you have mocked at my imperial power and authority, and that I must punish. Fromentinus, lead this man to prison, and let the executioner Typhon give him as many lashes with the scourge as are needful to make him confess that the Emperor, and not the Galilean, has all power upon earth.
#GREGORY.
Be strong, Cyrillus, my brother!
#CYRILLUS.
How blessed am I, to suffer for the glory of God!
#THE WOMEN.
Woe to us! Woe, woe, to the apostate!
#JULIAN.
Disperse these maniacs! Let them be driven out of the city as rebels. I will no longer endure this defiance and scandal.
#SOLDIER.
Up, up; be off!
#THE MAN.
Tread under foot this salt without savour, rejected of the Lord!
#JULIAN.
Oh everlasting gods!—Hekebolius——!
#THE COURTIERS.
Ah, so it is,—Hekebolius!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
That is no longer my name! I am nameless. I have denied the baptism that gave me my name!
#JULIAN.
Arise, friend! Your mind is distempered——
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Judas’s brother is pestiferous. Away from me——
#JULIAN.
Oh feeble - hearted man——
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Avaunt, tempter! Take back your thirty pieces of silver! Is it not written, “Thou shalt forsake wife and children for the Lord’s sake”? And For the sake of wife and children have I betrayed the Lord my God! Woe, woe, woe!
#JULIAN.
Such flames of madness do these writings kindle over the earth! And do I not well to burn them? Wait! Ere a year has passed the Temple of the Jews shall stand again on Zion hill,—the splendour of its golden dome shining over the world, and testifying: Liar, liar, liar!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Aha!—my friend Eunapius in full court dress!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Shame on you for mocking a poor man.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Call you that mockery? I thought it was the highest distinction.
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
You may say so indeed. ’Tis now the height of distinction to go in rags, especially if they have lain long enough in the gutter.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
How will all this end, think you?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
What should I care? I know how it has ended with me, and that is enough.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Are you no longer in the Emperor’s service?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
What should the Emperor Julian want with a barber? Think you he has his hair cut, or his beard trimmed? He does not even comb them. But how goes it with you? You do not look much better off.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Alas, Eunapius, purple - dyeing has had its day.
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Right, right; now we dye only the backs of the Christians. But what is that you are toiling with? bundle of willow bark. I am to dye fools’ cloaks for the philosophers.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
What does this mean?
#THE MAN.
The statue is to be fed once more.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Will the Emperor sacrifice here this evening?
#ANOTHER MAN.
Does he not sacrifice both morning and evening—sometimes here, sometimes there?
#MOTHER.
Tis hard on us poor folk that the new Emperor is so much in love with the gods.
#ANOTHER WOMAN.
Nay, Dione, say not so. Ought we not all to love the gods?
#THE FIRST WOMAN.
Maybe, maybe; but ’tis hard on us none the less——
#ONE OF THE MEN.
Look—there he comes.
#ONE OF THE NEWCOMERS.
There stands the goddess. Now you shall see sport.
#AN OLDER MAN.
Do you call that sport? How many hungry mouths could be fed with what is wasted here?
#JULIAN.
Oh, this sight! It fills my heart with rapture and my eyes with tears of sorrow. Yes, I must indeed weep, when I remember that this awe - inspiring goddess’s statue, overthrown by impious and audacious hands, has lain so long as if in a sleep of oblivion—and that, moreover, in a place I loathe to mention. But I feel no less rapture when I remember that to me it was vouchsafed to rescue the Divine Mother from so unworthy a situation. May I not well be enraptured by this thought?—Men say of me, that I have won a few victories over the barbarians, and praise me for them. For my part, I set more value on what I am doing for the gods; for to them we owe all our strength and all our care. It pleases me, however, to find that there are some in this stiff - necked city who are not deaf to my exhortations, but have come forth with seemly piety—and, I doubt not, have brought with them suitable offerings. What do I see? One solitary old man! Where are your brethren of the temple?
#THE OLD PRIEST.
Sire, they are all dead but I.
#JULIAN.
All dead! The road laid irreverently close to the sanctuary. The venerable grove hewn down—— Old man—where are the sacrificial offerings?
#THE OLD PRIEST.
Here, sire!
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes; but the rest?
#THE OLD PRIEST.
This is all. goose! And this goose is all?
#THE OLD PRIEST.
Yes, sire!
#JULIAN.
And what pious man have we to thank for so generous an offering?
#THE OLD PRIEST.
I brought it with me myself. Oh, sire, be not wroth; this one was all I had.
#SUPPRESSED VOICES.
’Tis enough. A goose is more than enough.
#JULIAN.
Oh Antioch—you put my patience to a hard test!
#MAN IN THE CROWD.
Bread first, offerings afterwards!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Well said; well said!
#ANOTHER MAN.
Give the citizens food; the gods may do as best they can.
#THIRD MAN.
We were better off under Chi and Kappa!
#JULIAN.
Oh you shameless brawlers, with your Chi and Kappa! Think you I do not know whom you mean by Chi and Kappa? Ho - ho, I know very well. ’Tis a by - word among you. You mean Christ and Constantius. But their dominion is past, and I shall soon find means of subduing the frowardness and ingratitude you display both towards the gods and towards me. You are offended because I allot the gods their due offerings. You mock at my modest attire and my untrimmed beard. This beard is a very thorn in your eyes! You call it, irreverently, a goat’s beard. But I tell you, oh fools, it is a wise man’s beard. I am not ashamed to let you know that this beard harbours vermin, as willow copses harbour game—and yet this despised beard is more honourable to me than your smooth - shaven chins to you!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
What foolishness; most unreasonable!
#JULIAN.
But think you I will leave your mockeries unanswered? No, no, you will find yourselves mistaken. Only wait; you shall hear from me sooner than you think. I am at this moment preparing a treatise, entitled “The Beard - Hater.” And would you know against whom it is directed? It is directed against you, citizens of Antioch—against you, whom I describe in it as “those ignorant hounds.” You will find in it my reasons for many things that now seem strange to you in my behaviour.
#FROMENTINUS.
Great Emperor, I bring you good news. Cyrillus has already given way——
#JULIAN.
Ah, I thought so.
#FROMENTINUS.
Typhon did his work bravely. The prisoner was stripped, tied by the wrists, and slung to the rafters, so that the tips of his toes barely touched the floor; then Typhon scourged him from behind with a lash of ox sinews that circled his body round to the breast.
#JULIAN.
Oh how wicked to force us to use such means!
#FROMENTINUS.
Lest he should die under our hands, we had at last to release the obstinate wretch. He remained for a time quite still, and seemed to reflect; then suddenly he demanded to be brought before the Emperor.
#JULIAN.
This pleases me. And you are having him brought hither?
#FROMENTINUS.
Yes, sire—here they come with him.
#JULIAN.
Ah, my good Cyrillus,—you are not quite so overweening as you were, I see.
#CYRILLUS.
Have you read in the entrails of some beast or bird what I have to say to you?
#JULIAN.
Methinks there needs no divination to foresee that you have come to your senses, that you renounce your delusions concerning the Galilean’s power, and that you acknowledge both the Emperor and our gods to be greater than he.
#CYRILLUS.
Imagine no such thing. Your gods are powerless; and if you cling to these graven images, that can neither hear nor see, you yourself will soon be as powerless as they.
#JULIAN.
Cyrillus—is this what you have to say?
#CYRILLUS.
No; I come to thank you. Hitherto I have dreaded you and your tortures. But in the hour of agony I won the victory of the spirit over all that is corruptible. Yes, Emperor, while your hirelings thought I was hanging in torment from the prison roof,—I lay, happy as a child, in my Saviour’s arms; and when your executioners seemed to be flaying my body with stripes, the Lord passed his healing hand over the wounds, took away the crown of thorns, and placed on my brow the crown of life. Therefore I thank you; no mortal has ever done me so great a service as you. And lest you should think I fear you for the future, see—— —see—see—gorge yourself with the blood you thirst after! But as for me, know that I thirst after Jesus Christ alone.
#MANY VOICES.
This will bring disaster on us all!
#JULIAN.
Hold the madman, lest he lay hands on us!
#JULIAN.
Look there, Fromentinus—what strange company is that——?
#FROMENTINUS.
My gracious Emperor, ’tis the psalm - singers——
#JULIAN.
Ah, that band of raving women——
#FROMENTINUS.
The governor Alexander has taken from them some writings which they hold sacred. They are going out of the city to weep at the graves of the Christians.
#JULIAN.
Defiance; defiance—from men and women alike!
#PUBLIA.
Their gods are of marble, and silver and gold. They shall crumble to mould.
#CHORUS OF WOMEN.
To mould; to mould!
#PUBLIA.
They murder our brothers; our children they smite. Soar up, doves of song, and pray God to requite!
#CHORUS OF WOMEN.
Pray God to requite!
#PUBLIA.
There he stands! Woe to the miscreant who has burnt the word of the Lord! Think you you can burn the word of the Lord with fire? I will tell you where it burns. Here the word burns. You may burn our books; but the word shall burn in the hearts of men until the uttermost end of time!
#THE WOMEN.
Let writings be burnt, and let bodies be slain; The word shall remain— The word shall remain!
#THE PEOPLE BY THE FOUNTAIN.
Woe to us; the Galileans’ God is the strongest!
#OTHER VOICES.
What avail all our gods against this one?
#OTHERS AGAIN.
No offering! No worship! ’Twill incense the terrible one against us.
#JULIAN.
Oh fools! You fear to incense a man long dead,—a false prophet—you shall have proof of it. He is a liar, I say! Wait but a little longer. Every day, every hour, may bring tidings from Jerusalem——
#JOVIAN.
Most gracious Emperor, pardon your servant for seeking you here.
#JULIAN.
Jovian! Oh welcome news - bearer!
#JOVIAN.
I come direct from Judea. I learned at the palace that you were here——
#JULIAN.
Oh, ever - praiseworthy gods,—yon setting sun shall not go down upon the lie. How far have you progressed? Speak, my Jovian!
#JOVIAN.
Sire, shall I tell all?
#JULIAN.
All, all—from first to last!
#JOVIAN.
I arrived at Jerusalem with the architects and soldiers, and the two thousand workmen. We went to work at once to clear the ground. Mighty remnants of the walls remained. They fell before our pickaxes and crowbars so easily that it seemed as though some unseen power were helping us to efface them——
#JULIAN.
You see! What did I tell you!
#JOVIAN.
In the meantime immense heaps of mortar were being brought together for the new building. Then, without any warning, there arose a whirlwind, which spread the lime like a cloud over the whole region.
#JULIAN.
Go on; go on!
#JOVIAN.
The same night the earth shook repeatedly.
#VOICES IN THE CROWD.
Hear that! The earth shook.
#JULIAN.
Go on, I say!
#JOVIAN.
We were nothing daunted by this strange event. But when we had dug so deep into the ground as to open the subterranean vaults, and the stone - hewers went down to work by torchlight——
#JULIAN.
Jovian,—what then?
#JOVIAN.
Sire, a terrible, a monstrous stream of fire burst out of the caverns. A thundering noise shook the whole city. The vaults burst asunder; hundreds of workmen were killed in them, and the few who escaped fled with lacerated limbs.
#WHISPERING VOICES.
The Galileans’ God!
#JULIAN.
Can I believe all this? Did you see it?
#JOVIAN.
With my own eyes. We began anew. Sire, in the presence of many thousands—awestruck, kneeling, exulting, praying—the same wonder was twice repeated.
#JULIAN.
And then——? In one word,—what has the Emperor achieved in Jerusalem?
#JOVIAN.
The Emperor has fulfilled the Galilean’s prophecy.
#JULIAN.
Fulfilled——?
#JOVIAN.
Through you is the saying accomplished: “Not one stone shall remain upon another.”
#MEN AND WOMEN.
The Galilean has overcome the Emperor! The Galilean is greater than Julian!
#JULIAN.
You may go home, old man! And take your goose with you. We will have no sacrifice this evening. I heard some say the Galilean had conquered. It may appear so; but I tell you it is a delusion. Oh senseless clods; oh contemptible dolts,—believe me, it will not be long before the tables are turned! I will——; I will——! Ah, only wait! I am already collecting material for a treatise against the Galilean. It is to be in seven chapters; and when his followers have read that,—and when “The Beard - Hater,” too—— Give me your arm, Fromentinus! This defiance has wearied me. Set Cyrillus free!
#THE CROWD AT THE FOUNTAIN.
There goes the altar - butcher?—There goes the ragged bear!—There goes the ape with the long arms!
#MAXIMUS.
Whither, my brother?
#JULIAN.
Where it is loneliest.
#MAXIMUS.
But here—in this desolation? Among these rubbish - heaps——?
#JULIAN.
Is not the whole earth a rubbish - heap?
#MAXIMUS.
Yet you have shown that what has fallen can be restored.
#JULIAN.
Mocker! In Athens I saw how a cobbler had made himself a little workshop in the temple of Theseus. In Rome, I hear, a corner of the Basilica Julia is used for a bullock - stable. Call you that restoration?
#MAXIMUS.
Why not? Does not everything happen little by little? What is a whole but the sum of all the parts?
#JULIAN.
Foolish wisdom! See this noseless face. See this splintered elbow,—these shattered loins. Does the sum of all these deformities restore to us the divine perfection of bygone beauty?
#MAXIMUS.
How know you that that bygone beauty was beautiful—in itself—apart from the spectator’s idea?
#JULIAN.
Ah, Maximus, that is just the question. What exists in itself? After to - day I know of nothing. Have you ever been mightier, in yourself? Strange, Maximus, that there should dwell such strength in delusion. Look at those Galileans. And look at me in the old days, when I thought it possible to build up again the fallen world of beauty.
#MAXIMUS.
Friend—if delusion be a necessity to you, return to the Galileans. They will receive you with open arms.
#JULIAN.
You know well that that is impossible. Emperor and Galilean! How reconcile that contradiction? Yes, this Jesus Christ is the greatest rebel that ever lived. What was Brutus—what was Cassius, compared with him? They murdered only the man Julius Caesar; but he murders all that is called Caesar or Augustus. Is peace conceivable between the Galilean and the Emperor? Is there room for the two of them together upon the earth? For he lives on the earth, Maximus,—the Galilean lives, I say, however thoroughly both Jews and Romans imagined that they had killed him; he lives in the rebellious minds of men; he lives in their scorn and defiance of all visible authority. “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s,—and to God the things that are God’s!” Never has mouth of man uttered a craftier saying than that. What lies behind it? What, and how much, belongs to the Emperor? That saying is nothing but a bludgeon wherewith to strike the crown from off the Emperor’s head.
#MAXIMUS.
Yet the great Constantine knew how to compound matters with the Galilean—and your predecessor too.
#JULIAN.
Yes, could one only be as easily satisfied as they! But call you that ruling the empire of the world? Constantine widened the boundaries of his dominion, but did he not fix narrow boundaries to his spirit and his will? You rate that man too high when you call him “the great.” Of my predecessor I will not speak; he was more slave than Emperor, and I cannot be contented with the name alone. No, no, a truce is not to be thought of in this contest. And yet—to have to give way! Oh, Maximus, after these defeats I cannot retain the crown—yet neither can I renounce it. You, Maximus, who can interpret omens whose mystic meaning is hidden from all others—you who can read the volume of the eternal stars,—can you foretell the issue of this struggle?
#MAXIMUS.
Yes, my brother, I can foretell the issue.
#JULIAN.
Can you? Then tell me—! Who shall conquer? The Emperor or the Galilean?
#MAXIMUS.
Both the Emperor and the Galilean shall succumb.
#JULIAN.
Succumb——? Both——?
#MAXIMUS.
Both. Whether in our times or in hundreds of years, I know not; but so it shall be when the right man comes.
#JULIAN.
And who is the right man?
#MAXIMUS.
He who shall swallow up both Emperor and Galilean.
#JULIAN.
You solve the riddle by a still darker riddle.
#MAXIMUS.
Hear me, brother and friend of truth! I say you shall both succumb—but not that you shall perish. Does not the child succumb in the youth, and the youth in the man? Yet neither child nor youth perishes. Oh, my best - loved pupil—have you forgotten all our discourse in Ephesus about the three empires?
#JULIAN.
Ah Maximus, years have passed since then. Speak!
#MAXIMUS.
You know I have never approved the course you have taken as Emperor. You have striven to make the youth a child again. The empire of the flesh is swallowed up in the empire of the spirit. But the empire of the spirit is not final, any more than the youth is. You have striven to hinder the growth of the youth,—to hinder him from becoming a man. Oh fool, who have drawn your sword against that which is to be—against the third empire, in which the twin - natured shall reign!
#JULIAN.
And he——?
#MAXIMUS.
The Jews have a name for him. They call him Messiah, and they await him.
#JULIAN.
Messiah?—Neither Emperor nor Redeemer?
#MAXIMUS.
Both in one, and one in both.
#JULIAN.
Emperor - God—God - Emperor. Emperor in the kingdom of the spirit,—and God in that of the flesh.
#MAXIMUS.
That is the third empire, Julian!
#JULIAN.
Yes, Maximus, that is the third empire.
#MAXIMUS.
In that empire shall the present watchword of revolt be realised.
#JULIAN.
“Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s,—and to God the things that are God’s.” Yes, yes, then the Emperor is in God, and God in the Emperor.—Ah, dreams, dreams,—who shall break the Galilean’s power?
#MAXIMUS.
Wherein lies the Galilean’s power?
#JULIAN.
I have brooded over that question in vain.
#MAXIMUS.
Is it not somewhere written: “Thou shalt have none other gods but me”?
#JULIAN.
Yes—yes—yes!
#MAXIMUS.
The Seer of Nazareth did not preach this god or that; he said: “God is am God.”
#JULIAN.
Ay, this thing without me——! ’Tis that which makes the Emperor powerless. The third empire? The Messiah? Not the Jews’ Messiah, but the Messiah of the two empires, the spirit and the world——?
#MAXIMUS.
The God - Emperor.
#JULIAN.
The Emperor - God.
#MAXIMUS.
Logos in Pan—Pan in Logos.
#JULIAN.
Maximus,—how comes he into being?
#MAXIMUS.
He comes into being in the man who wills himself.
#JULIAN.
My beloved teacher,—I must leave you
#MAXIMUS.
Whither are you going?
#JULIAN.
To the city. The Persian king has made overtures of peace, which I too hastily accepted. My envoys are already on the way. They must be overtaken and recalled.
#MAXIMUS.
You will reopen the war against King Sapor?
#JULIAN.
I will do what Cyrus dreamed of, and Alexander attempted——
#MAXIMUS.
Julian!
#JULIAN.
I will possess the world.—Good - night, my Maximus!
#THE CHORUS OF THE PSALM-SINGERS.
Ye gods of the nations, of silver and gold, Ye shall crumble to mould!
#JULIAN.
See, see—the legions wind like a scaly serpent through the ravine.
#NEVITA.
Those just below us, in sheepskin doublets, are the Scythians.
#JULIAN.
What piercing howls——!
#NEVITA.
That is the Scythians’ customary song, sire!
#JULIAN.
More howl than song.
#NEVITA.
Now come the Armenians. Arsaces himself is leading them.
#JULIAN.
The Roman legions must already be out on the plains. All the neighbouring tribes are hastening to make their submission. The twelve hundred ships, containing all our stores and munitions, lie assembled on the Euphrates. I am now fully assured that the fleet can cross over to the Tigris by the ancient canal. The whole army will pass the river by means of the ships. Then we will advance along by the eastern bank as rapidly as the current will suffer the ships to follow us. Tell me, Hormisdas, what think you of this plan?
#HORMISDAS.
Invincible general, I know that under your victorious protection it will be vouchsafed me to tread once more the soil of my fatherland.
#JULIAN.
What a relief to be rid of those narrow - breasted citizens! What terror was in their eyes when they pressed round my chariot as I left the city! “Come again quickly,” they cried, “and be more gracious to us than now.” I will never revisit Antioch. I will never again set eyes on that ungrateful city! When I have conquered I will return by way of Tarsus. Numa,—what omens for our campaign do you find this morning?
#NUMA.
The omens warn you not to pass the frontier of your empire this year.
#JULIAN.
H’m! How read you this omen, Maximus?
#MAXIMUS.
I read it thus: the omen counsels you to subdue all the regions you traverse; thus you will never pass the frontier of your empire.
#JULIAN.
So is it. We must look closely into such supernatural signs; for there is wont to be a double meaning in them. It even seems at times as if mysterious powers took a delight in leading men astray, especially in great undertakings. Were there not some who held it an evil omen that the colonnade in Hierapolis fell in and buried half a hundred soldiers, just as we marched through the city? But I say that that is a presage of a twofold good. In the first place it foreshows the downfall of Persia, and in the second place the doom of the unhappy Galileans. For what soldiers were they who were killed? Why, Galilean convict - soldiers, who went most unwillingly to the war; and therefore fate decreed them that sudden and inglorious end.
#JOVIAN.
Most gracious Emperor, here comes a captain from the vanguard.
#AMMIAN.
Sire, you commanded me to inform you should anything strange befall during our advance.
#JULIAN.
Well? Has anything happened this morning?
#AMMIAN.
Yes, sire, two portents.
#JULIAN.
Quick, Ammian,—speak on!
#AMMIAN.
First, sire, it happened that when we had gone a little way beyond the village of Zaita, a lion of monstrous size burst from a thicket and rushed straight at our soldiers, who killed it with many arrows.
#JULIAN.
Ah!
#THE PHILOSOPHERS.
What a fortunate omen!
#HORMISDAS.
King Sapor calls himself the lion of the nations.
#NUMA.
Turn back; turn back, Emperor Julian!
#MAXIMUS.
Go fearlessly forward, chosen son of victory!
#JULIAN.
Turn back after this? As the lion fell at Zaita, so shall the lion of the nations fall before our arrows. Does not history warrant me in interpreting this omen to our advantage? Need I remind such learned men that when the Emperor Maximian conquered the Persian king, Narses, a lion, and a huge wild boar besides, were, in like manner, slain in front of the Roman ranks? But now the other——? You spoke of two signs.
#AMMIAN.
The other is more doubtful, sire! Your charger, Babylonius, was led forth, as you commanded, fully equipped, to await your descent on the other side of the mountain. But just at that time a detachment of Galilean convict - soldiers happened to pass. Heavily laden as they were, and by no means over willing, they had to be driven with scourges. Nevertheless they lifted up their arms as in rejoicing, and burst forth into a loud hymn in praise of their deity. Babylonius was startled by the sudden noise, reared in his fright, and fell backwards; and as he sprawled upon the ground, all his golden trappings were soiled and bespattered with mud.
#NUMA.
Emperor Julian,—turn back, turn back!
#JULIAN.
The Galileans must have done this out of malice,—and yet, in spite of themselves, they have brought to pass a portent which I hail with delight. Yes, as Babylonius fell, so shall Babylon fall, stripped of all the splendour of its adornments.
#PRISCUS.
What wisdom in interpretation!
#KYTRON.
By the gods, it must be so!
#THE OTHER PHILOSOPHERS.
So, and not otherwise!
#JULIAN.
The army shall continue to advance. Nevertheless, for still greater security, I will sacrifice this evening and see what the omens indicate. As for you Etruscan jugglers, whom I have brought hither at so great a cost, I will no longer suffer you in the camp, where you serve only to damp the soldiers’ spirits. You know nothing of the difficult calling you profess. What effrontery! What measureless presumption! Away with them! I will not set eyes on them again. Babylonius fell. The lion succumbed before my soldiers. Yet these things do not tell us what invisible help we have to depend upon. The gods, whose essence is as yet by no means duly ascertained, seem sometimes—if I may say so—to slumber, or, on the whole, to concern themselves very little with human affairs. We, my dear friends, are so unfortunate as to live in such an age. We have even seen how certain divinities have neglected to support well - meant endeavours, tending to their own honour and glory. Yet must we not judge rashly in this matter. It is conceivable that the immortals, who guide and uphold the universe, may sometimes depute their power to mortal hands,—not thereby, assuredly, lessening their own glory; for is it not thanks to them that so highly - favoured a mortal—if he exist—has been born into this world?
#PRISCUS.
Oh matchless Emperor, do not your own achievements afford proof of this?
#JULIAN.
I know not, Priscus, whether I dare rate my own achievements so highly. I say nothing of the fact that the Galileans believe the Jew, Jesus of Nazareth, to have been thus elected; for these men err—as I shall conclusively establish in my treatise against them. But I will remind you of Prometheus in ancient days. Did not that pre - eminent hero procure for mankind still greater blessings than the gods seemed to vouchsafe—wherefore he had to suffer much, both pain and despiteful usage, till he was at last exalted to the communion of the gods—to which, in truth, he had all the while belonged? And may not the same be said both of Herakles and of Achilles, and, finally, of the Macedonian Alexander, with whom some have compared me, partly on account of what I achieved in Gaul, partly, and especially, on account of my designs in the present campaign?
#NEVITA.
My Emperor—the rear - guard is now beneath us—it is perhaps time——
#JULIAN.
Presently, Nevita! First I must tell you of a strange dream I had last night. I dreamed that I saw a child pursued by a rich man who owned countless flocks, but despised the worship of the gods. This wicked man exterminated all the child’s kindred. But Zeus took pity on the child itself, and held his hand over it. Then I saw this child grow up into a youth, under the care of Minerva and Apollo. Further, I dreamed that the youth fell asleep upon a stone beneath the open sky. Then Hermes descended to him, in the likeness of a young man, and said: “Come; I will show thee the way to the abode of the highest god!” So he led the youth to the foot of a very steep mountain. There he left him. Then the youth burst out into tears and lamentations, and called with a loud voice upon Zeus. Lo, then, Minerva and the Sun - King who rules the earth descended to his side, bore him aloft to the peak of the mountain, and showed him the whole inheritance of his race. But this inheritance was the orb of the earth from ocean to ocean, and beyond the ocean. Then they told the youth that all this should belong to him. And therewith they gave him three warnings: he should not sleep, as his race had done; he should not hearken to the counsel of hypocrites; and, lastly, he should honour as gods those who resemble the gods. “Forget not,” they said, on leaving him, “that thou hast an immortal soul, and that this thy soul is of divine origin. And if thou follow our counsel thou shalt see our father and become a god, even as we.”
#PRISCUS.
What are signs and omens to this!
#KYTRON.
It can scarcely be rash to anticipate that the Fates will think twice ere they suffer their counsels to clash with yours.
#JULIAN.
We dare not build with certainty on such an exception. But assuredly I cannot but find this dream significant, although my brother Maximus, by his silence—against all reasonable expectation—seems to approve neither of the dream itself, nor of my relation of it.—But that we must bear with! See, Jovian; before I arose this morning, I noted down what I had dreamt. Take this paper, let numerous copies of it be made, and read to the various divisions of the army. I hold it of the utmost moment, on so hazardous an expedition, that, amid all dangers and difficulties, the soldiers may leave their fate securely in their leader’s hands, considering him infallible in all that concerns the issue of the war.
#JOVIAN.
I pray you, my Emperor, let me be excused from this.
#JULIAN.
What do you mean?
#JOVIAN.
That I cannot lend my aid to anything that is against the truth.—Oh, hear me, my august Emperor and master! Is there a single one of your soldiers who doubts that he is safe in your hands? Have you not, on the Gallic frontier, in spite of overwhelming numbers and difficulties of all kinds, gained greater victories than any other living commander can boast of?
#JULIAN.
Well, well! What startling news!
#JOVIAN.
All know how marvellously fortune has hitherto followed you. In learning you excel all other mortals, and in the glorious art of eloquence you bear the palm among the greatest.
#JULIAN.
And yet——? In spite of all this——?
#JOVIAN.
In spite of all this, my Emperor, you are but mortal. By publishing this dream through the army you would seek to make men deem you a god,—and in that I dare not assist you.
#JULIAN.
What say you, my friends, to this speech?
#KYTRON.
It assuredly shows no less effrontery than ignorance.
#JULIAN.
You seem to forget, oh truth - loving Jovian, that the Emperor Antoninus, surnamed the Pious, has been worshipped in a special temple on the Roman forum as an immortal god. And not he alone, but also his wife, Faustina, and other Emperors before and after him.
#JOVIAN.
I know it, sire,—but it was not given to our forefathers to live in the light of truth.
#JULIAN.
Ah, Jovian!—— Tell me,—last evening, when I was taking the omens for the coming night, you brought me a message just as I was laving the blood from my hands in the water of purification——
#JOVIAN.
Yes, my Emperor!
#JULIAN.
In my haste, I chanced to sprinkle a few drops of the water on your cloak. You shrank sharply backward and shook the water off, as if your cloak had been defiled.
#JOVIAN.
My Emperor,—so that did not escape you?
#JULIAN.
Did you think it would have escaped me?
#JOVIAN.
Yes, sire; for it was a matter between me and the one true God.
#JULIAN.
Galilean!
#JOVIAN.
Sire, you yourself sent me to Jerusalem, and I was witness to all that happened there. I have pondered much since then; I have read the scriptures of the Christians, have spoken with many of them,—and now I am convinced that in their teaching lies the truth of God.
#JULIAN.
Is this possible? Can it be possible? Thus does this infectious frenzy spread! Even those nearest me—my own generals desert me——
#JOVIAN.
Place me in the van against your foes, sire,—and you shall see how gladly I render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s.
#JULIAN.
How much——?
#JOVIAN.
My blood, my life.
#JULIAN.
Blood and life are not enough. He who is to rule must rule over the minds, over the wills of men. It is in this that your Jesus of Nazareth bars my way and contests my power. Think not that I will punish you, Jovian! You Galileans covet punishment as a benefaction. And after it you are called martyrs. Have they not thus exalted those whom I have been obliged to chastise for their obduracy? Go to the vanguard! I will not willingly see your face again.—Oh, this treachery to me, which you veil in phrases about double duty and a double empire! This shall be altered. Other kings besides the Persian shall feel my foot on their necks. To the vanguard, Jovian!
#JOVIAN.
I shall do my duty, sire!
#JULIAN.
We will not have this morning darkened, which rose amid so many happy omens. This, and more, will we bear with an even mind. But my dream shall none the less be published through the army. You, Kytron, and you, my Priscus, and my other friends, will see that this is done in a becoming manner.
#THE PHILOSOPHERS.
With joy, with unspeakable joy, sire!
#JULIAN.
I beg you, Hormisdas, not to doubt my power, although it may seem as though stubbornness met me on every hand. Go; and you too, Nevita, and all the rest, each to his post;—I will follow when the troops are all gathered out on the plains.
#MAXIMUS.
My sick brother!
#JULIAN.
Rather wounded than sick. The deer that is pierced by the hunter’s shaft seeks the thicket where its fellows cannot see it. I could no longer endure to be seen in the streets of Antioch;—and now I shrink from showing myself to the army.
#MAXIMUS.
No one sees you, friend; for they grope in blindness. But you shall be as a physician to restore their sight, and then they shall behold you in your glory.
#JULIAN.
How far beneath us! How tiny they seem, as they wind their way forward, amid thicket and brushwood, along the rocky river - bed! When we stood at the mouth of this defile, all the leaders, as one man, made for the pass. It meant an hour’s way shortened, a little trouble spared,—on the road to death. And the legions were so eager to follow. No thought of taking the upward path, no longing for the free air up here, where the bosom expands with each deep draught of breath. There they march, and march, and march, and see not that the heaven is straitened above them,—and know not there are heights where it is wider.—Seems it not, Maximus, as though men lived but to die? The spirit of the Galilean is in this. If it be true, as they say, that his father made the world, then the son contemns his father’s work. And it is just for this presumptuous frenzy that he is so highly revered! How great was Socrates compared with him! Did not Socrates love pleasure, and happiness, and beauty? And yet he renounced them.—Is there not a bottomless abyss between not desiring, on the one hand, and, on the other, desiring, yet renouncing? Oh, this treasure of lost wisdom I would fain have restored to men. Like Dionysus of old, I went forth to meet them, young and joyous, a garland on my brow, and the fulness of the vine in my arms. But they reject my gifts, and I am scorned, and hated, and derided, by friends and foes alike.
#MAXIMUS.
Why? I will tell you why. Hard by a certain town where once I lived, there was a vineyard, renowned far and wide for its grapes; and when the citizens wished to have the finest fruits on their tables, they sent their servants out to bring clusters from this vineyard. Many years after I came again to that city; but no one now knew aught of the grapes that were once so renowned. Then I sought the owner of the vineyard and said to him, “Tell me, friend, are your vines dead, since no one now knows aught of your grapes?” “No,” he answered, “but let me tell you, young vines yield good grapes but poor wine; old vines, on the contrary, bad grapes but good wine. Therefore, stranger,” he added, “I still gladden the hearts of my fellow citizens with the abundance of my vineyard, only in another form—as wine, not as grapes.”
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes, yes!
#MAXIMUS.
You have not given heed to this. The vine of the world has grown old, and yet you think that you can still offer the raw grapes to those who thirst for the new wine.
#JULIAN.
Alas, my Maximus, who thirsts? Name me a single man, outside our brotherhood, who is moved by a spiritual craving.—Unhappy I, to be born into this iron age!
#MAXIMUS.
Do not reproach the age. Had the age been greater, you would have been less. The world - soul is like a rich man with innumerable sons. If he share his riches equally, all are well to do, but none rich. But if he disinherit all but one, and give everything to him, then that one stands as a rich man amid a circle of paupers.
#JULIAN.
No similitude could be less apt than this.—Am I like your single heir? Is not that very thing divided among many which the ruler of the world should possess in fuller measure than all besides—nay, which he alone should possess? Oh how is not power divided? Has not Libanius the power of eloquence in such fulness that men call him the king of orators? Have not you, my Maximus, the power of mystic wisdom? Has not that madman Apollinaris of Antioch the power of ecstatic song in a measure I needs must envy him? And then Gregory the Cappadocian! Has he not the power of indomitable will in such excess, that many have applied to him the epithet, unbecoming for a subject, of “the Great”? And—what is stranger still—the same epithet has been applied to Gregory’s friend, Basil, the soft - natured man with girlish eyes. And yet he plays no active part in the world; he lives here, this Basil—here in this remote region, wearing the habit of an anchorite, and holding converse with none but his disciples, his sister Makrina, and other women, who are called pious and holy. What influence do they not exert, both he and his sister, through the epistles they send forth from time to time. Everything, even renunciation and seclusion, becomes a power to oppose my power. But the crucified Jew is still the worst of all.
#MAXIMUS.
Then make an end of all these scattered powers! But dream not that you can crush the rebels, by attacking them in the name of a monarch whom they do not know. In your own name you must act, Julian! Did Jesus of Nazareth come as the emissary of another? Did he not proclaim himself to be one with him that sent him? Truly in you is the time fulfilled, and you see it not. Do not all signs and omens point, with unerring finger, to you? Must I remind you of your mother’s dream——?
#JULIAN.
She dreamed that she brought forth Achilles.
#MAXIMUS.
Must I remind you how fortune has borne you, as on mighty pinions, through an agitated and perilous life? Who are you, sire? Are you Alexander born again, not, as before, in immaturity, but perfectly equipped for the fufilment of the task?
#JULIAN.
Maximus!
#MAXIMUS.
There is One who ever reappears, at certain intervals, in the course of human history. He is like a rider taming a wild horse in the arena. Again and yet again it throws him. A moment, and he is in the saddle again, each time more secure and more expert; but off he has had to go, in all his varying incarnations, until this day. Off he had to go as the god - created man in Eden’s grove; off he had to go as the founder of the world - empire;—off he must go as the prince of the empire of God. Who knows how often he has wandered among us when none have recognised him? How know you, Julian, that you were not in him whom you now persecute?
#JULIAN.
Oh unfathomable riddle——!
#MAXIMUS.
Must I remind you of the old prophecy now set afloat again? It has been foretold that so many years as the year has days should the empire of the Galilean endure. Two years more, and ’twill be three hundred and sixty - five years since that man was born in Bethlehem.
#JULIAN.
Do you believe this prophecy?
#MAXIMUS.
I believe in him who is to come.
#JULIAN.
Always riddles!
#MAXIMUS.
I believe in the free necessity.
#JULIAN.
Still darker riddles.
#MAXIMUS.
Behold, Julian,—when Chaos seethed in the fearful void abyss, and Jehovah was alone,—that day when he, according to the old Jewish scriptures, stretched forth his hand and divided light from darkness, sea from land,—that day the great creating God stood on the summit of his power. But with man arose will upon the earth. And men, and beasts, and trees, and herbs re - created themselves, each in its own image, according to eternal laws; and by eternal laws the stars roll through the heavenly spaces. Did Jehovah repent? The ancient traditions of all races tell of a repentant Creator. He had established the law of perpetuation in the universe. Too late to repent! The created will perpetuate itself—and is perpetuated. But the two onesided empires war one against the other. Where, where is he, the king of peace, the twin - sided one, who shall reconcile them?
#JULIAN.
Two years? All the gods inactive. No capricious power behind, which might bethink itself to cross my plans—— Two years? In two years I can bring the earth under my sway.
#MAXIMUS.
You spoke, my Julian;—what said you?
#JULIAN.
I am young and strong and healthy. Maximus—it is my will to live long.
#MAKRINA.
Oh, Basil, see—each paler and more haggard than the last!
#BASIL.
And countless multitudes of our Christian brethren among them! Woe to the Emperor Julian! This is a cruelty more cunningly contrived than all the horrors of the torture - chamber. Against whom is he leading his hosts? Less against the Persian king than against Christ.
#MAKRINA.
Do you believe this dreadful thing of him?
#BASIL.
Yes, Makrina, it becomes more and more clear to me that ’tis against
#MAKRINA.
Fresh multitudes! Innumerable, unceasing——
#SUBALTERN.
Up with you, lazy hound!
#MAKRINA.
Oh, do not strike him!
#THE SOLDIER.
Let them strike me;—I am so glad to suffer.
#AMMIAN.
Again a stoppage!—Oh, it is he. Can he really go no further?
#THE SUBALTERN.
I do not know what to say, sir; he falls at every step.
#MAKRINA.
Oh, be patient! Who is this unhappy man?—See, suck the juice of these fruits.—Who is he, sir? Cappadocian,—one of the fanatics who took part in the desecration of the temple of Venus at Antioch.
#MAKRINA.
Oh, one of those martyrs——!
#AMMIAN.
Try to rise, Agathon! I am sorry for this fellow. They chastised him more severely than he could bear. He has been out of his mind ever since.
#AGATHON.
I can bear it very well, and I am in my right mind, sir! Strike, strike, strike;—I rejoice to suffer.
#AMMIAN.
Forward; we have no time to waste.
#THE SUBALTERN.
Forward, forward!
#AGATHON.
Babylonius fell;—soon shall the Babylonian whoremonger fall likewise. The lion of Zaita was slain—the crowned lion of the earth is doomed!
#AMMIAN.
You strange people;—you go astray and yet you do good. Thanks for your refreshment to the weary; and would that my duty to the Emperor permitted me to treat your brethren as forbearingly as I should desire.
#BASIL.
God be with you, noble heathen!
#MAKRINA.
Who may that man be?
#BASIL.
I know him not. Oh see, see—there he is himself!
#MAKRINA.
The Emperor? Is that the Emperor?
#BASIL.
Yes, that is he.
#JULIAN.
Why talk of fatigue? Should the fall of a horse bring me to a standstill? Or is it less becoming to go on foot than to bestride an inferior animal? Fatigue! My ancestor said that it befits an Emperor to die standing. I say that it befits an Emperor, not only in the hour of death, but throughout his whole life, to set an example of endurance; I say—— Ah, by the great light of heaven! do I not see Basil of Caesarea before my eyes?
#BASIL.
Your meanest servant, oh most mighty lord!
#JULIAN.
Ah, I know what that means! Truly you serve me well, Basil! So this is the villa that has become so renowned by reason of the epistles that go forth from it. This house is more talked of throughout the provinces than all the lecture - halls together, although I have spared neither care nor pains to restore their glory. Tell me—is not this woman your sister, Makrina?
#BASIL.
She is, sire!
#JULIAN.
You are a fair woman, and still young. And yet, as I hear, you have renounced life.
#MAKRINA.
Sire, I have renounced life in order truly to live.
#JULIAN.
Ah, I know your delusions very well. You sigh for that which lies beyond, of which you have no certain knowledge; you mortify your flesh; you repress all human desires. And yet I tell you this may be a vanity, like the rest.
#BASIL.
Think not, sire, that I am blind to the danger that lurks in renunciation. I know that my friend Gregory says well when he writes that he holds himself a hermit in heart, though not in the body. And I know that this coarse clothing is of small profit to my soul if I take merit to myself for wearing it. But that is not my case. This secluded life fills me with unspeakable happiness; that is all. The wild convulsions through which, in these days, the world is passing, do not here force themselves, in all their hideousness, upon my eyes. Here I feel my body uplifted in prayer, and my soul purified by a frugal life.
#JULIAN.
Oh my modest Basil, I fear you are ambitious of more than this. If what I hear be true, your sister has gathered round her a band of young women whom she is training up in her own likeness. And you yourself, like your Galilean master, have chosen twelve disciples. What is your purpose with them?
#BASIL.
To send them forth into all lands, that they may strengthen our brethren in the fight.
#JULIAN.
Truly! Equipped with all the weapons of eloquence, you send your army against me. And whence did you obtain this eloquence, this glorious Greek art? From our schools of learning. What right have you to it? You have stolen like a spy into our camp, to find out where you can most safely strike at us. And this knowledge you are now applying to our greatest hurt! Let me tell you, Basil, that I have no mind to suffer this scandal any longer. I will strike this weapon out of your hands. Keep to your Matthew and Luke, and other such unpolished babblers. But henceforth you shall not be permitted to interpret our ancient poets and philosophers; for I hold it unreasonable to let you suck knowledge and skill from sources in the truth of which you do not believe. In like manner shall all Galilean scholars be forbidden our lecture - halls; for what is their business there? To steal our weapons and use them against us.
#BASIL.
Sire, I have already heard of this strange determination. And I agree with Gregory in maintaining that you have no exclusive right either to Grecian learning or to Grecian eloquence. I agree with him when he points out that you use the alphabet which was invented by the Egyptians, and that you clothe yourself in purple, although it first came into use among the people of Tyre. Ay, sire—and more than that. You subdue nations, and make yourself ruler over peoples, whose tongues are unknown and whose manners are strange to you. And you have a right to do so. But by the same right whereby you rule the visible world, he whom you call the Galilean rules the invisible——
#JULIAN.
Enough of that! I will no longer listen to such talk. You speak as though there were two rulers of the world, and on that plea you cry halt to me at every turn. Oh fools! You set up a dead man against a living one. But you shall soon be convinced of your error. Do not suppose that amid the cares of war I have laid aside the treatise I have long been preparing against you. Perhaps you think I spend my nights in sleep? You are mistaken! For “The Beard - Hater” I reaped nothing but scorn,—and that from the very people who had most reason to lay certain truths to heart. But that shall in nowise deter me. Should a man with a cudgel in his hand shrink from a pack of yelping dogs?—Why did you smile, woman? At what did you laugh?
#MAKRINA.
Why, sire, do you rage so furiously against one who, you say, is dead?
#JULIAN.
Ah, I understand! You mean to say that he is alive.
#MAKRINA.
I mean to say, oh mighty Emperor, that in your heart you feel of a surety that he lives. What next! I feel——!
#MAKRINA.
What is it that you hate and persecute? Not him, but your belief in him. And does he not live in your hate and persecution, no less than in our love?
#JULIAN.
I know your tortuous tricks of speech. You Galileans say one thing and mean another. And that you call rhetoric! Oh mediocre minds! What folly!
#MAKRINA.
And I tell you, Emperor Julian, that you are nought but a scourge in the hand of God—a scourge foredoomed to chasten us by reason of our sins. Woe to us that it must be so! Woe to us for the discords and the lovelessness that have caused us to swerve from the true path! There was no longer a king in Israel. Therefore has the Lord stricken you with madness, that you might chastise us. What a spirit has he not darkened, that it should rage against us! What a blossoming tree has he not stripped to make rods for our sin - laden shoulders! Portents warned you, and you heeded them not. Voices called you, and you heard them not. Hands wrote in letters of fire upon the wall, and you rubbed out the writing ere you had deciphered it.
#JULIAN.
Basil—I would I had known this woman before to - day.
#BASIL.
Come, Makrina!
#MAKRINA.
Woe is me that ever I saw those shining eyes! Angel and serpent in one; the apostate’s longing wedded to the tempter’s guile! Oh, how have our brethren and sisters borne their hope of victory so high, in the face of such an instrument of wrath? In him dwells a greater than he. Do you not see it, Basil—in him will the Lord God smite us even to death.
#JULIAN.
You have said it!
#MAKRINA.
Not I!
#JULIAN.
First - won soul!
#MAKRINA.
Avaunt from me!
#BASIL.
Come—come!
#JULIAN.
Stay here!—Anatolus, set a guard about them!—’Tis my will that you shall follow the army—both you and your disciples,—youths and women.
#BASIL.
Sire, you cannot desire this!
#JULIAN.
’Tis not wise to leave fortresses in our rear. See, I stretch forth my hand and quench the burning shower of arrows which you have sent forth from yonder villa.
#BASIL.
Nay, nay, sire—this deed of violence——
#MAKRINA.
Alas, Basil—here or elsewhere—all is over.
#JULIAN.
Is it not written “Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s”? I require all aid in this campaign. You can tend my sick and wounded. In that you will be serving the Galilean as well; and if you still think that a duty, I counsel you to make good use of your time. His end is near!
#MAKRINA.
Sunset over our home; sunset of hope and of light in the world! Oh Basil! that we should live to see the night!
#BASIL.
The light is.
#JULIAN.
The light shall be. Turn your backs to the sunset, Galileans! Your faces to the east, to the east, where Helios lies dreaming. Verily I say unto you, you shall see the Sun - King of the world.
#NEVITA.
See, now, how rightly the Emperor has chosen! Here we stand, without a stroke, on the enemy’s territory; no one has opposed our passage of the river; not even a single Persian horseman is to be seen.
#JOVIAN.
No, sir, by this route, the enemy certainly did not expect us.
#NEVITA.
You speak as if you still thought this route unwisely chosen.
#JOVIAN.
Yes, sir, it is still my opinion that we should rather have taken a more northerly direction. Then our left wing would have rested on Armenia, which is friendly towards us, and all our supplies might have come from that fruitful province. But here? Hampered in our progress by the heavy freight - ships, surrounded by a barren plain, almost a desert—— Ah! the Emperor is coming. I will go; I am not in his good graces at present.
#JULIAN.
Thus does the empire grow. Every step I take towards the east shifts the frontier of my dominion. This earth is mine! I am in the empire, not beyond it.—Well, Priscus——?
#PRISCUS.
Incomparable Emperor, your command has been executed. Your marvellous dream has been read to every division of the army.
#JULIAN.
Good, good. And how did my dream seem to affect the soldiers?
#KYTRON.
Some praised you with joyful voices, and hailed you as divine; others on the contrary——
#PRISCUS.
Those others were Galileans, Kytron!
#KYTRON.
Yes, yes, most of them were Galileans; and these smote upon their breasts and uttered loud lamentations.
#JULIAN.
I will not let the matter rest here. The busts of myself, which I have provided for erection in the towns I am to conquer, shall be set up round the camp, over all the paymasters’ tables. Lamps shall be lighted beside the busts; braziers, with sweet - smelling incense, shall burn before them; and every soldier, as he comes forward to receive his pay, shall cast some grains of incense on the fire.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Most gracious Emperor, forgive me, but—is that expedient?
#JULIAN.
Why not? I marvel at you, my Oribases!
#PRISCUS.
Ah, sire, you may well marvel! Not expedient to——?
#KYTRON.
Should not a Julian dare what less god - like men have dared?
#JULIAN.
I, too, think that the more daring course would now be to disguise the counsels of the mystic powers. If it be the case that the divinities have deputed their sovereignty into earthly hands—as many signs justify us in concluding—it would indeed be most ungrateful to conceal the fact. In such hazardous circumstances as these, ’tis no trifling matter that the soldiers should pay their devotions in a quite different quarter from that in which they are due. I tell you, Oribases, and all of you,—if, indeed, there be present any one else who would set limits to the Emperor’s power,—that this would be the very essence of impiety, and that I should therefore be forced to take strong measures against it. Has not Plato long ago enunciated the truth that only a god can rule over men? What meant he by that saying? Answer me—what did he mean? Far be it from me to assert that Plato—incomparable sage though he was—had any individual, even the greatest, in his prophetic eye. But I think we have all seen what disorders result from the parcelling out, as it were, of the supreme power into several hands. Enough of that. I have already commanded that the imperial busts shall be displayed about the camp. Ah! what seek you in such haste, Eutherius?
#EUTHERIUS.
Exalted Emperor,—this man of Antioch is sent by the governor, Alexander, and brings you a letter which, he says, is of great importance.
#JULIAN.
Ah, let me see! Light here!
#JULIAN.
Can this be possible! More light! Yes, here it is written—and here—; what next?—Truly this exceeds all I could have conceived!
#NEVITA.
Bad news from the west, sire?
#JULIAN.
Nevita, tell me, how long will it take us to reach Ctesiphon?
#NEVITA.
It cannot be done in less than thirty days.
#JULIAN.
It must be done in less! Thirty days! A whole month! And while we are creeping forward here, I must let those madmen——
#NEVITA.
You know yourself, sire, that, on account of the ships, we must follow all the windings of the river. The current is rapid, and the bed, too, shallow and stony. I hold it impossible to proceed more quickly.
#JULIAN.
Thirty days! And then there is the city to be taken,—the Persian army to be routed,—peace to be concluded. What a time all this will take! Yet there were some among you foolish enough to urge upon me an even more roundabout route. Ha - ha; they would compass my ruin!
#NEVITA.
Never fear, sire; the expedition shall advance with all possible speed.
#JULIAN.
It must indeed. Can you imagine what Alexander tells me? The frenzy of the Galileans has passed all bounds since my departure. And it increases day by day. They understand that my victory in Persia will bring their extirpation in its train; and with that shameless Gregory as their leader, they now stand, like a hostile army in my rear; in the Phrygian regions secret things are preparing, no one knows to what end——
#NEVITA.
What does this mean, sire? What are they doing?
#JULIAN.
What are they doing? Praying, preaching, singing, prophesying the end of the world. And would that that were all!—but they carry our adherents away, and entice them into their rebellious conspiracies. In Caesarea the congregation has chosen the judge Eusebius to be their bishop,—Eusebius, an unbaptised man—and he has been so misguided as to accept their call, which, moreover, the canon of their own church declares invalid. But that is far from being the worst; worse, worse, ten times worse is it, that Athanasius has returned to Alexandria.
#NEVITA.
Athanasius!
#PRISCUS.
That mysterious bishop who, six years ago, vanished into the desert. council of the church expelled him on account of his unseemly zeal. The Galileans were tractable under my predecessor. Yes, just think of it—this raging fanatic has returned to Alexandria. His entrance was like a king’s; the road was strewn with carpets and green palm - branches. And what followed? What do you think? The same night a riot broke out among the Galileans. George, their lawful bishop, that right - minded and well - disposed man, whom they accused of lukewarmness in the faith, was murdered—torn to pieces in the streets of the city.
#NEVITA.
But, sire, how were things suffered to go so far? Where was the governor, Artemius?
#JULIAN.
You may well ask where Artemius was. I will tell you. Artemius has gone over to the Galileans. Artemius himself has broken by force of arms into the Serapeion, that most glorious of earthly temples,—has shattered the statues—has plundered the altars, and destroyed that vast treasury of books, which was of such inestimable value precisely in this age of error and ignorance. I could weep for them as for a friend bereft me by death, were not my wrath too great for tears.
#KYTRON.
Truly, this surpasses belief!
#JULIAN.
And not to be within reach of these miserable beings to punish them! To be doomed to look idly on while such atrocities spread wider and wider around!—Thirty days, you say! Why are we loitering? Why are we pitching our tents? Why should we sleep? Do my generals not know what is at stake? We must hold a council of war. When I remember what the Macedonian Alexander achieved in thirty days——
#JOVIAN.
Forgive me, sire, for appearing before you: but this stranger—— Persian warrior!
#THE PERSIAN.
No warrior, oh mighty Emperor!
#JOVIAN.
He came riding over the plains unarmed, and surrendered at the outposts——
#JULIAN.
Then your countrymen are at hand?
#THE PERSIAN.
No, no!
#JULIAN.
Whence come you then?
#THE PERSIAN.
Look at these arms, oh ruler of the world,—bleeding from rusty fetters. Feel this flayed back,—sore upon sore. I come from the torture chamber, sire!
#JULIAN.
Ah—a fugitive from King Sapor?
#THE PERSIAN.
Yes, mighty Emperor, to whom all things are known! I stood high in King Sapor’s favour until, impelled by the terror of your approach, I dared to prophesy that this war would end in his destruction. Would you know, sire, how he has rewarded me? My wife he gave as a prey to his archers from the mountains; my children he sold as slaves; all my possessions he divided among his servants; myself he tortured for nine days. Then he bade me ride forth and die like a beast in the desert.
#JULIAN.
And what would you with me?
#THE PERSIAN.
What would I after such treatment? I would help you to destroy my persecutor.
#JULIAN.
Ah, poor tortured wretch,—how can you help?
#THE PERSIAN.
I can lend wings to your soldiers’ feet.
#JULIAN.
What mean you by that? Rise and explain yourself.
#THE PERSIAN.
No one in Ctesiphon expected you to choose this route——
#JULIAN.
I know that.
#THE PERSIAN.
Now ’tis no longer a secret.
#JULIAN.
You lie, fellow! You Persians know nought of my designs.
#THE PERSIAN.
You, sire, whose wisdom is born of the sun and of fire, know well that my countrymen are now acquainted with your designs. You have crossed the rivers by means of your ships; these ships, more than a thousand in number, and laden with all the supplies of the army, are to be towed up the Tigris, and the troops are to advance abreast of the ships.
#JULIAN.
Incredible——!
#THE PERSIAN.
When the ships have approached as near Ctesiphon as possible—that is to say, within two days’ march—you will make straight for the city, beleaguer it, and compel King Sapor to surrender.
#JULIAN.
Who has betrayed us?
#THE PERSIAN.
This plan is now no longer practicable. My countrymen have hastily constructed stone dams in the bed of the river, on which your ships will run aground.
#JULIAN.
Man, do you know what it will cost you if you deceive me?
#THE PERSIAN.
My body is in your power, mighty Emperor! If I speak not the truth, you are free to burn me alive.
#JULIAN.
The river dammed! It will take weeks to make it navigable again.
#NEVITA.
If it can be done at all, sire! We have not the implements——
#JULIAN.
And that this should come upon us now—just when so much depends on a speedy victory.
#THE PERSIAN.
Oh ruler of the world, I have said that I can lend your army wings.
#JULIAN.
Speak! Do you know of a shorter way?
#THE PERSIAN.
If you will promise me that after your victory you will restore the possessions of which I have been robbed, and give me a new wife of noble birth, I will——
#JULIAN.
I promise everything; only speak,—speak!
#THE PERSIAN.
Strike straight across the plains, and in four days you will be under the walls of Ctesiphon.
#JULIAN.
Do you forget the mountain chain on the other side of the plains?
#THE PERSIAN.
Sire, have you never heard of that strange defile among the mountains?
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes, a chasm; “Ahriman’s Street” it is called. Is it true that it exists?
#THE PERSIAN.
I rode through “Ahriman’s Street” two days ago.
#JULIAN.
Nevita!
#NEVITA.
In truth sire, if it be so——
#JULIAN.
Miraculous help in the hour of need——!
#THE PERSIAN.
But if you would pass that way, oh mighty one, there is not a moment to be lost. The Persian army which had been assembled in the northern provinces, is now recalled to block the mountain passes.
#JULIAN.
Know you that for certain?
#THE PERSIAN.
Delay, and you will discover it for yourself.
#JULIAN.
How many days will it take your countrymen to get there?
#THE PERSIAN.
Four days, sire!
#JULIAN.
Nevita, in three days we must be beyond the defiles!
#NEVITA.
Is it possible to reach the defiles in three days?
#THE PERSIAN.
Yes, great warrior, it is possible, if you make use of this night as well.
#JULIAN.
Let the camp be broken up! No time now for sleep, for rest! In four days—or five at the utmost—I must stand before Ctesiphon.—What are you thinking about! Ah, I know.
#NEVITA.
The fleet, sire!
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes, yes, the fleet!
#NEVITA.
Should the Persian army reach the defiles a day later than we, they will—if they cannot injure you in any other way—turn westward against your ships——
#JULIAN.
And seize a vast amount of booty, wherewith to continue the war——
#NEVITA.
If we could leave twenty thousand men with the ships, they would be safe——
#JULIAN.
What are you thinking of! Twenty thousand? Well nigh a third of our fighting strength. Where would be the force with which I must strike the great blow? Divided, dispersed, frittered away. Not one man will I detach for such a purpose. No, no, Nevita; but there may be a middle course——
#NEVITA.
My great Emperor—!
#JULIAN.
The fleet must neither fall into the hands of the Persians, nor yet cost us men. There is a middle course, I tell you! Why do you falter? Why not speak it out?
#NEVITA.
Do you know whether the citizens of Ctesiphon have stores of corn and oil?
#THE PERSIAN.
Ctesiphon overflows with supplies of all sorts.
#JULIAN.
And when we have once taken the city, the whole rich country lies open to us.
#THE PERSIAN.
The citizens will open their gates to you, sire. I am not the only one who hates King Sapor. They will rise against him and straightway submit to you, if you come upon them, unprepared and panic - stricken, with your whole united force.
#JULIAN.
Yes; yes.
#THE PERSIAN.
Burn the ships, sire!
#NEVITA.
Ah!
#JULIAN.
His hate has eyes where your fidelity is blind, Nevita!
#NEVITA.
My fidelity saw, sire; but it shrank from what it saw.
#JULIAN.
Are not these ships like fetters on our feet? We have provisions for four full days in the camp. It is well that the soldiers should not be too heavily laden. Of what use, then, are the ships? We have no more rivers to pass——
#NEVITA.
Sire, if it be indeed your will——
#JULIAN.
My will,—my will? Oh, on an evening like this,—so angry and tempestuous,—why cannot a flash of lightning descend and——
#MAXIMUS.
Oh chosen son of Helios—hear me, hear me!
#JULIAN.
Not now, my Maximus!
#MAXIMUS.
Nothing can be more pressing than this. You must hear me!
#JULIAN.
Then in the name of fortune and wisdom, speak, my brother!
#MAXIMUS.
You know how I have striven to search and spell out, both in books and through auguries, the issue of this campaign?
#JULIAN.
I know that you have been unable to foretell anything.
#MAXIMUS.
The omens spoke and the writings confirmed them. But the answer which always came was so strange that I could not but think myself mistaken.
#JULIAN.
But now——?
#MAXIMUS.
When we departed from Antioch, I wrote to Rome to consult the Sibylline Books——
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes——!
#MAXIMUS.
This very moment the answer has arrived; a courier from the governor of Antioch brought it.
#JULIAN.
Ah, Maximus,—and its purport——?
#MAXIMUS.
The same as that of the omens and the books; and now I dare interpret it. Rejoice, my brother,—in this war you are invulnerable.
#JULIAN.
The oracle,—the oracle?
#MAXIMUS.
The Sibylline Books say: “Julian must beware of the Phrygian regions.”
#JULIAN.
The Phrygian——? Ah, Maximus!
#MAXIMUS.
Why so pale, my brother?
#JULIAN.
Tell me, dear teacher—how do you interpret this answer?
#MAXIMUS.
Is more than one interpretation possible? The Phrygian regions? What have you to do in Phrygia? In Phrygia—a remote province lying far behind you, where you need never set your foot. No danger threatens you, fortunate man—that is the interpretation.
#JULIAN.
This oracle has a twofold meaning. No danger threatens me in this war,—but from that distant region—— Nevita, Nevita!
#NEVITA.
Sire——!
#JULIAN.
In Phrygia? Alexander writes of secret things preparing in Phrygia. It has been foretold that the Galilean is to come again—— Burn the ships, Nevita!
#NEVITA.
Sire, is this your firm and irrevocable will——?
#JULIAN.
Burn them! No delay! Lurking dangers threaten us in the rear. Give close heed to this stranger. He is to be our guide. Refresh him with food and drink, and let him have thorough rest.
#JOVIAN.
My Emperor, I implore you—build not too securely on the reports of a deserter like this.
#JULIAN.
Aha—you seem perturbed, my Galilean councillor! All this is not quite to your mind. Perhaps you know more than you care to tell. Go, Nevita,—and burn the ships!
#JULIAN.
Traitors in my own camp! Wait, wait,—I shall get to the bottom of these machinations. The camp shall break up! Go, Jovian, see that the vanguard is afoot within an hour. The Persian knows the way. Go!
#JOVIAN.
As you command, my august Emperor!
#MAXIMUS.
You would burn the fleet? Then surely you have great things in your mind.
#JULIAN.
Tell me, would the Macedonian Alexander have ventured this?
#MAXIMUS.
Did Alexander know where the danger threatened?
#JULIAN.
True, true! I know it. All the powers of victory are in league with me. Omens and signs yield up their mystic secrets to advance my empire. Is it not said of the Galilean, that spirits came and ministered unto him?—To whom do the spirits now minister? What would the Galilean say, were he present unseen among us?
#MAXIMUS.
He would say: the third empire is at hand.
#JULIAN.
The third empire is here, Maximus! I feel that the Messiah of the earth lives in me. The spirit has become flesh and the flesh spirit. All creation lies within my will and my power. See, see,—there are the first sparks drifting aloft. The flames are licking up the cordage and the clustered masts. Spread; spread!
#MAXIMUS.
The wind anticipates your will. ’Tis rising to serve you.
#JULIAN.
Swell into a storm! More westerly! I command it!
#FROMENTINUS.
Most gracious Emperor,—suffer me to warn you. dangerous disturbance has broken out in the camp.
#JULIAN.
I will have no more disturbances. The army shall advance.
#FROMENTINUS.
Yes, my Emperor,—but the refractory Galileans——
#JULIAN.
The Galileans? What of them?
#FROMENTINUS.
Before the tables where the paymasters were distributing the soldiers’ pay, your august image had been set up——
#JULIAN.
It is always to be so for the future.
#FROMENTINUS.
Every man was ordered, as he came forward, to cast a grain of incense into the braziers——
#JULIAN.
Yes—well, well?
#FROMENTINUS.
Many of the Galilean soldiers did so unthinkingly, but others refused——?
#JULIAN.
What! they refused?
#FROMENTINUS.
At first, sire; but when the paymasters told them that ’twas an old custom revived, in no wise pertaining to things divine——
#JULIAN.
Aha! what then?
#FROMENTINUS.
——they yielded and did as they were bidden.
#JULIAN.
There you see; they yielded!
#FROMENTINUS.
But afterward, sire, our own men laughed and mocked at them, and said, unthinkingly, that now they had best efface the sign of the cross and the fish which they are wont to imprint upon their arms; for now they had worshipped the divine Emperor.
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes! And the Galileans?
#FROMENTINUS.
They broke out into loud lamentations——; listen, listen, sire! It is impossible to bring them to reason.
#JULIAN.
The madmen! Rebellious to the last. They know not that their master’s power is broken.
#SOLDIER.
Christ died for me, and I forsook him!
#ANOTHER SOLDIER.
Smite me, oh wrathful Lord in heaven; for I have worshipped false gods!
#THE SOLDIER AGATHON.
The devil on the throne has slain my soul! Woe, woe, woe!
#OTHER SOLDIERS.
We will not serve idols!
#OTHERS AGAIN.
The Apostate is not our ruler! We will go home! home!
#JULIAN.
Fromentinus, seize these madmen! Hew them down!
#OFFICERS AND SOLDIERS.
The fleet is burning!
#JULIAN.
Yes, the fleet is burning! And more than the fleet is burning. In that blazing, swirling pyre the crucified Galilean is burning to ashes; and the earthly Emperor is burning with the Galilean. But from the ashes shall arise—like that marvellous bird—the God of earth and the Emperor of the spirit in one, in one, in one!
#SEVERAL VOICES.
Madness has seized him!
#NEVITA.
It is done.
#JOVIAN.
Quench the fire! Out, out with it!
#JULIAN.
Let it burn! Let it burn!
#AMMIAN.
Sire, you are betrayed. That Persian fugitive was a traitor——
#JULIAN.
Man, you lie! Where is he?
#AMMIAN.
Fled!
#JOVIAN.
Vanished like a shadow——
#NEVITA.
Fled!
#JOVIAN.
His guards protest that he disappeared almost under their very eyes.
#AMMIAN.
His horse, too, is gone from its pen; the Persian must have fled over the plains.
#JULIAN.
Quench the fire, Nevita!
#NEVITA.
Impossible, my Emperor!
#JULIAN.
Put it out, I say. It shall be possible!
#NEVITA.
Nothing could be more impossible. All the cables are cut; the rest of the ships are all drifting down upon the burning wrecks.
#PRINCE HORMISDAS.
Curses upon my countrymen! Oh sire, how could you give ear to that deceiver?
#CRIES FROM THE CAMP.
The fleet on fire! Cut off from home! Death before us!
#THE SOLDIER AGATHON.
False god, false god,—bid the storm to cease! bid the flames die down!
#JOVIAN.
The storm increases. The fire is like a rolling sea——
#MAXIMUS.
Beware of the Phrygian regions.
#JULIAN.
Let the fleet burn! Within seven days you shall burn Ctesiphon.
#KYTRON.
Is is not incredible that this council of war should last so long?
#PRISCUS.
Ay, truly; one would think there were only two courses to choose between: to advance or to retire.
#KYTRON.
’Tis utterly incomprehensible—— Tell me, good Anatolus, why, in the name of the gods, do we not advance?
#PRISCUS.
Yes, why alarm us by halting here in the middle of the desert?
#ANATOLUS.
See you the quivering air on the horizon, to the north, east, and south?
#KYTRON.
Of course, of course; that is the heat——
#ANATOLUS.
It is the desert burning.
#PRISCUS.
What say you? The desert burning?
#KYTRON.
Do not jest so unpleasantly, good Anatolus! Tell us,—what is it?
#ANATOLUS.
The desert burning, I tell you. Out yonder, where the sand ceases, the Persians have set the grass on fire. We can make no progress till the ground cools.
#KYTRON.
Oh is not this appalling! What barbarians! To have recourse to such means——!
#PRISCUS.
Then there is no choice left us. Without provisions, without water——; why do we not retreat?
#ANATOLUS.
Over the Tigris and Euphrates?
#KYTRON.
And the fleet burnt! What way is this to conduct the war? Oh, why does not the Emperor think more of his friends! How shall I get home again?
#ANATOLUS.
Like the rest of us, friend!
#KYTRON.
Like the rest? Like the rest! That is a fine way to talk. With you it is quite another matter. You are soldiers. ’Tis your calling to endure certain hardships to which I am not at all accustomed. I did not join the Emperor’s suite to go through all this. Here am I tortured with gnats and poisonous flies;—look at my hands!
#PRISCUS.
Most certainly we did not come for this. We consented to accompany the army in order to compose panegyrics on the victories the Emperor intended to win. What has come of these victories? What has been achieved during the six toilsome weeks since the fleet was burnt? We have destroyed a few deserted towns of the sorriest kind. A few prisoners have been exhibited in the camp, whom the advance - guard are said to have taken—truly I know not in what battles! The prisoners, methought, looked more like poor kidnapped shepherds and peasants——
#KYTRON.
And to think of burning the fleet! Said I not from the first that it would be a source of disaster?
#ANATOLUS.
I did not hear you say so.
#KYTRON.
What? Did I not say so? Oh Priscus, did you not hear me say it?
#PRISCUS.
Truly, I do not know, friend; but I know that I myself in vain denounced that luckless measure. Indeed I may say that I opposed the whole campaign at this time of year. What rash haste! Where were the Emperor’s eyes? Is this the same hero who fought with such marvellous success upon the Rhine? One would think he had been struck with blindness or some spiritual disease.
#ANATOLUS.
Hush, hush;—what talk is this?
#KYTRON.
’Twas indeed no fitting way for our Priscus to express himself. Yet I, too, cannot deny that I observe a deplorable lack of wisdom in many of the crowned philosopher’s recent proceedings. How precipitate to set up his busts in the camp, and claim worship as if he were a god! How imprudent so openly to scoff at that strange teacher from Nazareth, who undeniably possesses a peculiar power, which might have stood us in good stead in these perilous conjunctures. Ah! here comes Nevita himself. Now we shall hear——
#NEVITA.
Tell me openly, Oribases,—is there anything amiss with the Emperor’s mind?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
What should make you think that, sir?
#NEVITA.
How else can I interpret his conduct?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Oh my beloved Emperor——!
#NEVITA.
Oribases, you must hide nothing from me.
#KYTRON.
Oh valiant general, if it be not indiscreet——
#NEVITA.
Presently, presently!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Do not fear, sir! No misfortune shall happen. Eutherius and I have promised each other to keep an eye upon him.
#NEVITA.
Ah, you do not mean to say that——?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Last night he had well nigh shortened his life. Fortunately Eutherius was at hand——; oh speak of it to no one!
#NEVITA.
Do not lose sight of him.
#PRISCUS.
It would greatly relieve our minds to hear what the council of war——?
#NEVITA.
Pardon me; I have weighty matters to attend to.
#JOVIAN.
It shall be done, my gracious Emperor!
#KYTRON.
Ah, most excellent Jovian! Well? Is the retreat decided on?
#JOVIAN.
I would not counsel any one to call it a retreat.
#KYTRON.
Oh these soldiers! A philosopher’s peace of mind is nothing to them. Ah!
#JULIAN.
Rejoice, my friends! All will soon be well now.
#KYTRON.
Ah, gracious Emperor, have you discovered an expedient?
#JULIAN.
There are expedients enough, Kytron; the only difficulty is to choose the best. We will slightly alter the line of advance——
#PRISCUS.
Oh, praise be to your wisdom!
#JULIAN.
This eastward march—it leads to nothing.
#KYTRON.
No, no, that is certain!
#JULIAN.
Now we will turn northward, Kytron!
#KYTRON.
What, sire,—northward?
#PRISCUS.
Not westward?
#JULIAN.
Not westward. Not by any means westward. That might be difficult on account of the rivers. And Ctesiphon we must leave till another time. Without ships we cannot think of taking the city. It was the Galileans who brought about the burning of the fleet; I have noted one thing and another. Who dares call this northward movement a retreat? What know you of my plans? The Persian army is somewhere in the north; of that we are now pretty well assured. When I have crushed Sapor—one battle will finish the matter—we shall find abundant supplies in the Persian camp. When I lead the Persian king as my captive through Antioch and the other cities, I would fain see whether the citizens will not fall at my feet.
#CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS.
Doomed is the world’s proud cedar - tree, The axe shall its roots dissever; The palm He planted on Calvary, Blood - watered, shall bloom for ever.
#JULIAN.
The Galileans are always singing. Songs about death and wounds and pain. Those women whom I brought with me to tend the sick—they have done us more harm than good. They have taught the soldiers strange songs, such as I have never heard before. But hereafter I will punish no one for such things. It does but lead them deeper into error. Know you, Priscus, what happened of late, in the case of those mutineers who refused to show due reverence to the imperial busts?
#PRISCUS.
Of late, sire?
#JULIAN.
When, wishing to beget a wholesome dread in their companions in error, I ordered some of these men to be executed, the oldest of them stepped forward with loud cries of joy, and begged to be the first to die.—Look you, Priscus—when I heard that yesterday——
#PRISCUS.
Yesterday? Oh, sire, you are mistaken. That happened forty days ago.
#JULIAN.
So long? Yes, yes, yes! The Hebrews had to wander forty years in the wilderness. All the older generation had to die out. A new generation had to spring up; but they—mark that!—they entered into the promised land.
#EUTHERIUS.
’Tis late in the day, sire; will you not eat?
#JULIAN.
Not yet, my Eutherius. ’Tis good for all men to mortify the flesh. Yes, I tell you, we must make haste to become a new generation. I can do nothing with you as you are. If you would escape from the desert, you must lead a pure life. Look at the Galileans. We might learn more than one lesson from these men. There are none poverty - stricken and helpless among them; they live together as brethren and sisters,—and most of all now, when their obstinacy has forced me to chastise them. These Galileans, you must know, have something in their hearts which I could greatly desire that you should emulate. You call yourselves followers of Socrates, of Plato, of Diogenes. Is there one of you who would face death with ecstasy for Plato’s sake? Would our Priscus sacrifice his left hand for Socrates? Would Kytron, for Diogenes’ sake, let his ear be cut off? No, truly! I know you, whited sepulchres! Begone out of my sight;—I can do nothing with you!
#JULIAN.
How strange! Is it not inconceivable, unfathomable? Oribases,—can you rede me this riddle?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
What riddle do you mean, my Emperor?
#JULIAN.
With twelve poor ignorant fishermen, he founded all this.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Oh sire, these thoughts exhaust you.
#JULIAN.
And who has held it together until this day? Women and ignorant people, for the most part——
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Yes, yes, sire; but now the campaign will soon take a happy turn——
#JULIAN.
Very true, Oribases; as soon as fortune has taken a turn, all will be well. The dominion of the carpenter’s son is drawing to its close; we know that. His reign is to last as many years as the year has days; and now we have——
#EUTHERIUS.
My beloved master, would not a bath refresh you?
#JULIAN.
Do you think so?—You may go, Eutherius! Go, go! I have something to say to Oribases.
#JULIAN.
Has Eutherius told you aught this morning?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
No, sire!
#JULIAN.
Has he told you nothing about last night——?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
No, my Emperor—nothing at all. Eutherius is very silent.
#JULIAN.
If he should tell you anything, do not believe it. The thing did not happen at all as he pretends. ’Tis he who is seeking my life.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
He,—your old and faithful servant!
#JULIAN.
I shall keep an eye on him.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
I too.
#JULIAN.
We will both keep an eye on him.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Sire, I fear you had but little sleep last night.
#JULIAN.
Very little.
#JULIAN.
Know you what kept me from sleeping?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
No, my Emperor.
#JULIAN.
The victor of the Milvian Bridge was with me.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
The great Constantine?
#JULIAN.
Yes. For some nights past his shade has given me no rest. He comes a little after midnight, and does not depart until the dawn is at hand.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
The moon is full, sire; that has always had a strange effect on your mind.
#JULIAN.
According to the ancients, such apparitions are wont——What can have become of Maximus? But their opinions are by no means to be relied on. We see how greatly they erred in many things. Even what they tell us of the gods we cannot believe without reserve. Nor what they report as to the shades, and the powers, as a whole, which rule the destinies of men. What know we of these powers? We know nothing, Oribases, except their capriciousness and inconstancy, of which characteristics we have evidence enough. I wish Maximus would come—— Here? ’Tis not here that the menacing storm is drawing up. ’Twas said to be in the Phrygian regions——
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
What regions, sire,—and what storm?
#JULIAN.
Oh nothing—nothing.
#NEVITA.
My Emperor, the army is now on the march.
#JULIAN.
Northwards?
#NEVITA.
Of course, sire!
#JULIAN.
We ought to have waited till Maximus——
#NEVITA.
What mean you, my Emperor? There is nothing to wait for. We are without supplies; scattered bands of the enemy’s horsemen are already appearing both in the east and in the south——
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes, we must advance,—northwards. Maximus must soon be here. I have sent to the rear for the Etruscan soothsayers; they shall try once more—— I have also discovered some Magians, who say they are well versed in the Chaldean mysteries. Our own priests are taking the omens in nine different places——
#NEVITA.
Sire, whatever the omens may say, I tell you we must go hence. The soldiers are no longer to be depended on; they see clearly that our only hope lies in reaching the Armenian mountains.
#JULIAN.
We will do so, Nevita,—whatever the omens say. Nevertheless it gives one a great feeling of security to know that one is acting, as it were, in concert with those unfathomable powers who, if they will, can so potently influence our destinies.
#NEVITA.
Anatolus, strike the Emperor’s tent!
#JULIAN.
All auguries for these forty days have been inauspicious; and that proves that we may place trust in them; for in all that time our affairs have made but scant headway. But now, you see, my Oribases,—now that I have a fresh enterprise in view—— Ah! Maximus!
#MAXIMUS.
The army is already on the march, sire; get to horse!
#JULIAN.
The auguries—the auguries?
#MAXIMUS.
Oh—the auguries! Ask not about the auguries.
#JULIAN.
Speak! I demand to know what they say.
#MAXIMUS.
All auguries are silent.
#JULIAN.
Silent?
#MAXIMUS.
I went to the priests; the entrails of the sacrifices gave no sign. I went to the Etruscan jugglers; the flight and cries of the birds said nothing. I went also to the Magians; their writings had no answer to give. And I myself——
#JULIAN.
You yourself, my Maximus?
#MAXIMUS.
Now I can tell you. Last night I studied the aspect of the stars. They told me nothing, Julian.
#JULIAN.
Nothing.—Silence—silence, as though in an eclipse. Alone! No longer any bridge between me and the spirits. Where are you now, oh white - sailed fleet, that sped to and fro in the sunlight and carried tidings between earth and heaven? The fleet is burnt. That fleet too is burnt. Oh all my shining ships. Tell me, Maximus—what do you believe as to this?
#MAXIMUS.
I believe in you.
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes—believe!
#MAXIMUS.
The world - will has resigned its power into your hands; therefore it is silent.
#JULIAN.
So will we read it. And we must act accordingly,—although we might have preferred that—— This silence! To stand so utterly alone. But there are others who may also be said to stand almost alone. The Galileans. They have but one god; and one god is next thing to no god. How is it, then, that we daily see these men——?
#ANATOLUS.
My Emperor, now must you get to horse; I dare not let you remain here longer.
#JULIAN.
Yes, now I will mount. Where is my good Babylonius? See now; sword in hand—— Come, my dear friends!
#MAKRINA AND THE WOMEN.
Woe to us! Woe! Upon us all God’s wrath will fall! Death we shall know!
#ONE OF THE SOLDIERS.
Hark! Do you hear? The Galilean women are singing over yonder.
#ANOTHER SOLDIER.
They sing like owls and night ravens.
#THIRD SOLDIER.
Yet would I willingly be with them. ’Tis safer with the Galileans than with us. The God of the Galileans is stronger than our gods.
#THE FIRST SOLDIER.
The thing is that the Emperor has angered the gods. How could he think of setting himself up in their place?
#THE THIRD SOLDIER.
What is worse is that he has angered the Galileans’ God. Have you not heard, they say positively that, a few nights since, he and his magician ripped open a pregnant woman, to read omens in her entrails?
#THE FIRST SOLDIER.
Ay, but I do not believe it. At any rate, I am sure ’twas not a Greek woman; it must have been a barbarian.
#THE THIRD SOLDIER.
They say the Galileans’ God cares for the barbarians too; and if so, ’twill be the worse for us.
#THE SECOND SOLDIER.
Oh, pooh—the Emperor is a great soldier.
#THE FIRST SOLDIER.
They say King Sapor is a great soldier too.
#THE SECOND SOLDIER.
Think you we have the whole Persian army before us?
#THE FIRST SOLDIER.
Some say ’tis only the advance - guard; no one knows for certain.
#THE THIRD SOLDIER.
I would I were among the Galileans.
#THE FIRST SOLDIER.
Are you going over to them, too?
#THE THIRD SOLDIER.
So many are going over. In the last few days——
#THE FIRST SOLDIER.
Halt—halt! Who goes there?
#HANK.
Friends from the outposts!
#THE SECOND SOLDIER.
Ho - ho; a deserter.
#ONE OF THE NEW-COMERS.
No; he has gone out of his mind.
#AGATHON.
I have not gone out of my mind. Oh, for God’s great mercy’s sake,—let me go!
#THE SOLDIER FROM THE OUTPOSTS.
He says he wants to slay a beast with seven heads.
#AGATHON.
Yes, yes, yes, I will, I will. Oh, let me go! See you this spear? Know you what spear it is? With this spear will I slay the beast with seven heads, and then I shall get back my soul again. Christ himself has promised me that. He was with me to - night.
#THE FIRST SOLDIER.
Hunger and weariness have turned his brain.
#ONE OF THE NEW-COMERS.
To the camp with him; there he can sleep his weariness away.
#AGATHON.
Let me go! Oh, if you but knew what spear this is!
#THE THIRD SOLDIER.
What could he mean by that beast?
#THE FIRST SOLDIER.
That is one of the Galilean secrets. They have many such secrets among them.
#EUTHERIUS.
Do you not see him?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
No.—Ah, soldiers!—Tell me, good friends, has any one passed by here?
#THE FIRST SOLDIER.
Yes, a detachment of spearmen.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Good, good! But nobody else? No great person? None of the generals?
#THE SOLDIERS.
No, none.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Not here then! Oh, Eutherius, how could you——?
#EUTHERIUS.
Could I help——? Could I help it——? I have not closed my old eyes for three nights——
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
You must help us to search. I demand it in the name of the general - in - chief. Spread yourselves among the trees; and should you find any great person, report it at the watch - fire yonder.
#THE SOLDIERS.
We will not fail, sir!
#JULIAN.
Hist! Come forward, Maximus! They did not see us.
#MAXIMUS.
Oribases was one of them.
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes; both he and Eutherius keep watch on me. They imagine that—— Has neither of them told you aught?
#MAXIMUS.
No, my Julian! But why have you awakened me? What would you here in the darkness?
#JULIAN.
I would be alone with you for the last time, my beloved teacher!
#MAXIMUS.
Not for the last time, Julian!
#JULIAN.
See that dark water. Think you—if I utterly vanished from the earth, and my body was never found, and none knew what had become of me,—think you the report would spread abroad that Hermes had come for me, and carried me away, and that I had been exalted to the fellowship of the gods?
#MAXIMUS.
The time is at hand when men will not need to die, in order to live as gods on the earth.
#JULIAN.
I am pining with home - sickness, Maximus,—with home - sick longing for the light and the sun and all the stars.
#MAXIMUS.
Oh, I beseech you—think not of sorrowful things. The Persian army is before you. To - morrow will come the battle. You will conquer——
#JULIAN.
I—conquer? You do not know who was with me an hour ago.
#MAXIMUS.
Who was with you?
#JULIAN.
I had fallen asleep on my couch in the tent. Suddenly I was awakened by a strong red glare, that seemed to burn through my closed eye - lids. I looked up and beheld a figure standing in the tent. Over its head was a long drapery, falling on both sides, so as to leave the face free.
#MAXIMUS.
Knew you this figure?
#JULIAN.
It was the same face which I saw in the light that night at Ephesus, many years ago,—that night when we held symposium with the two others.
#MAXIMUS.
The spirit of the empire.
#JULIAN.
Since then it has appeared to me once in Gaul,—on an occasion I would fain forget.
#MAXIMUS.
Did it speak?
#JULIAN.
No. It seemed as though it wished to speak; but it did not. It stood motionless, looking at me. Its face was pale and distorted. Suddenly, with both arms, it drew the drapery together over its head, hid its face, and went straight out through the tent - wall.
#MAXIMUS.
The decisive hour is at hand.
#JULIAN.
Ay, truly, ’tis at hand.
#MAXIMUS.
Courage, Julian! He who wills, conquers.
#JULIAN.
And what does the conqueror win? Is it worth while to conquer? What has the Macedonian Alexander, what has Julius Caesar won? Greeks and Romans talk of their renown with cold admiration,—while the other, the Galilean, the carpenter’s son, sits throned as the king of love in the warm, believing hearts of men. Where is he now?—Has he been at work elsewhere since that happened at Golgotha? I dreamed of him lately. I dreamed that I had subdued the whole world. I ordained that the memory of the Galilean should be rooted out on earth; and it was rooted out.—Then the spirits came and ministered to me, and bound wings on my shoulders, and I soared aloft into infinite space, till my feet rested on another world. It was another world than mine. Its curve was vaster, its light more golden, and many moons circled around it. Then I looked down at my own earth—the Emperor’s earth, which I had made Galileanless—and I thought that all that I had done was very good. But behold, my Maximus,—there came a procession by me, on the strange earth where I stood. There were soldiers, and judges, and executioners at the head of it, and weeping women followed. And lo!—in the midst of the slow - moving array, was the Galilean, alive, and bearing a cross on his back. Then I called to him, and said, “Whither away, Galilean?” But he turned his face toward me, smiled, nodded slowly, and said: “To the place of the skull.” Where is he now? What if that at Golgotha, near Jerusalem, was but a wayside matter, a thing done, as it were, in passing, in a leisure hour? What if he goes on and on, and suffers, and dies, and conquers, again and again, from world to world? Oh that I could lay waste the world! Maximus,—is there no poison, no consuming fire, that could lay creation desolate, as it was on that day when the spirit moved alone over the face of the waters?
#MAXIMUS.
I hear a noise from the outposts. Come, Julian——
#JULIAN.
To think that century shall follow century, and that in them all shall live men, knowing that ’twas I who was vanquished, and he who conquered! I will not be vanquished! I am young; I am invulnerable,—the third empire is at hand—— There he stands!
#MAXIMUS.
Who? Where?
#JULIAN.
Do you see him? There, among the tree - stems—in a crown and a purple robe——
#MAXIMUS.
’Tis the moon glimmering on the water. Come—come, my Julian!
#JULIAN.
Avaunt! Thou art dead! Thy empire is past. Off with the juggler’s cloak, carpenter’s son! What dost thou there? At what art thou hammering?—Ah!
#EUTHERIUS.
All gods be praised!—Oribases,—here, here!
#JULIAN.
What has become of him?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Is he here?
#EUTHERIUS.
Yes.—Oh my beloved Emperor!
#JULIAN.
Who was it that said, “I am hammering the Emperor’s coffin”?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
What mean you, sire?
#JULIAN.
Who spoke, I ask? Who was it that said, “I am hammering the Emperor’s coffin”?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Come with me to your tent, I implore you.
#MAXIMUS.
War - cries! The Persians are upon us——
#EUTHERIUS.
There is already fierce fighting at the outposts.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
The enemy is in the camp! Ah, sire, you are unarmed——!
#JULIAN.
I will sacrifice to the gods.
#MAXIMUS.
To what gods, oh fool? Where are they—and what are they?
#JULIAN.
I will sacrifice to this god and to that. I will sacrifice to many. One or another must surely hear me. I must call upon something without me and above me——
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
There is not a moment to be lost——!
#JULIAN.
Ah—saw you the burning torch behind the cloud? It flashed forth and went out in the same instant. A message from the spirits! A shining ship between heaven and earth!—My shield! My sword!
#MAXIMUS.
Emperor, Emperor—do not fight to - night!
#AMMIAN.
Right, right! Close with them! Thrust them down! Give them no time to shoot!
#NEVITA.
Well fought, Ammian!
#AMMIAN.
Oh sir, why come not the cavalry to our help?
#NEVITA.
They cannot. The Persians have elephants in their front rank. The very smell strikes terror to the horses. Thrust—thrust! Upwards, men,—under their breastplates?
#KYTRON.
Oh that I should be in the midst of such horrors!
#NEVITA.
Have you seen the Emperor, friend?
#KYTRON.
Yes, but he heeds me not. Oh, I humbly beg for a detachment of soldiers to protect me!
#NEVITA.
They are giving ground! The shield - bearers forward!
#KYTRON.
You do not listen to me, sir! My safety is of the utmost importance; my book, “On Equanimity in Affliction,” is not finished——
#NEVITA.
The Persians have been reinforced on the right. They are pressing forward again!
#KYTRON.
Pressing forward again? Oh this bloodthirsty ferocity! An arrow! It almost struck me! How recklessly they shoot; no care for life or limb!
#NEVITA.
The battle hangs in the balance. Neither side gains ground. Ho, captain,—have you seen the Emperor?
#FROMENTINUS.
Yes, sir; he is fighting at the head of the white horsemen.
#NEVITA.
Not wounded?
#FROMENTINUS.
He seems invulnerable. Arrows and javelins swerve aside wherever he shows himself.
#AMMIAN.
Help, help; we can hold out no longer!
#NEVITA.
Forward, my bold Fromentinus!
#FROMENTINUS.
Shoulder to shoulder, and at them, Greeks!
#ANATOLUS.
Is not the Emperor here?
#NEVITA.
The Emperor! Is it not your business to answer for him?
#ANATOLUS.
His horse was shot under him,—a terrible tumult arose; it was impossible to get near him——
#NEVITA.
Think you he has come to any harm?
#ANATOLUS.
No, I think not. There was a cry that he was unhurt, but——
#MANY OF NEVITA’S FOLLOWERS.
There he is! There he is!
#JULIAN.
’Tis well I have found you, Nevita!
#NEVITA.
Ah, sire—without armour; how imprudent——
#JULIAN.
In these regions no weapon can touch me. But go, Nevita; take the supreme command; my horse was shot under me, and——
#NEVITA.
My Emperor, then after all you are hurt?
#JULIAN.
No; only a blow on the head; a little dizzy. Go, go—— What is this? So many strange multitudes thronging in among us!
#NEVITA.
Anatolus, you must answer for the Emperor.
#ANATOLUS.
Never fear, sir!
#JULIAN.
How many of our men think you have fallen, Anatolus?
#ANATOLUS.
Certainly not a few, sire; but I am sure the Persians have lost more than we.
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes; but many have fallen, both Greeks and Romans. Do you not think so?
#ANATOLUS.
Surely you are unwell, my Emperor. Your face is so pale——
#JULIAN.
Look at those lying there,—some on their backs, others on their faces, with outstretched arms. They must all be dead?
#ANATOLUS.
Yes, sire, beyond a doubt.
#JULIAN.
They are dead, yes! They know nought, then, either of the defeat at Jerusalem or the other defeats.—Think you many more Greeks will fall in the battle, Anatolus?
#ANATOLUS.
Sire, let us hope the bloodiest work is over.
#JULIAN.
Many, many more will fall, I tell you! But not enough. Of what use is it that many should fall? None the less will posterity learn—— Tell me, Anatolus, how think you the Emperor Caligula pictured to himself that sword?
#ANATOLUS.
What sword, sire?
#JULIAN.
You know he wished for a sword wherewith he might at one blow——
#ANATOLUS.
Hark to the shouts, sire! Now I am sure the Persians are retreating.
#JULIAN.
What song is that in the air?
#ANATOLUS.
Sire, let me summon Oribases; or still better,—come,—come; you are sick!
#JULIAN.
There is singing in the air. Can you not hear it?
#ANATOLUS.
If it be so, it must be the Galileans——
#JULIAN.
Ay, be sure ’tis the Galileans. Ha - ha - ha, they fight in our ranks, and see not who stands on the other side. Oh fools, all of you! Where is Nevita? Why should he attack the Persians? Can he not see that ’tis not the Persians who are most dangerous?—You betray me, all of you.
#ANATOLUS.
Hasten to the camp; bring hither the Emperor’s physician?
#JULIAN.
What innumerable hosts! Think you they have caught sight of us, Anatolus?
#ANATOLUS.
Who, sire? Where?
#JULIAN.
Do you not see them—yonder—high up and far away! You lie! You see them well enough!
#ANATOLUS.
By the immortal gods, they are only the morning clouds,—’tis the day dawning.
#JULIAN.
’Tis the hosts of the Galilean, I tell you! Look—those in the red - edged garments are the martyrs who died in blood. Singing women surround them, and weave bowstrings of the long hair torn from their heads. Children are with them, twining slings from their unravelled entrails. Burning torches——! Thousandfold—multitudinous! They are hastening hitherward! They are all looking at me; all rushing straight upon me!
#ANATOLUS.
’Tis the Persians, sire! Our ranks are giving way——
#JULIAN.
They shall not give way!—You shall not! Stand fast, Greeks! Stand, stand, Romans! Today we will free the world!
#ANATOLUS.
Help, help! The Emperor is in deadly peril!
#JULIAN.
I see him; I see him! A longer sword! Who has a longer sword to lend me?
#SOLDIERS.
With Christ for the Emperor!
#AGATHON.
With Christ for Christ!
#JULIAN.
Ah!
#AGATHON.
The Roman’s spear from Golgotha!
#CONFUSED CRIES.
The Emperor! Is the Emperor wounded?
#JULIAN.
Thou hast conquered, Galilean!
#MANY VOICES.
The Emperor has fallen!
#ANATOLUS.
The Emperor is wounded! Shield him—shield him, in the name of the gods!
#JOVIAN.
On—on, believing brethren; give Caesar what is Caesar’s!
#RETREATING SOLDIERS.
He has fallen! The Emperor has fallen!
#JOVIAN.
Fallen! Oh mighty God of vengeance! On, on; ’tis God’s will that his people shall live! I see heaven open; I see the angels with flaming swords——
#THE SOLDIERS.
Christ is among us!
#AMMIAN’S TROOPS.
The Galileans’ God is among us! Close round him! He is the strongest!
#MAKRINA.
He bleeds again. I must bind the bandage tighter.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Thanks to you, tender woman; your heedful hands do us good service here.
#EUTHERIUS.
Is it possible that he still lives?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Certainly he lives.
#EUTHERIUS.
But he does not breathe.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Yes, he breathes.
#PRISCUS.
Ah, good captain, how go affairs without?
#AMMIAN.
Better than here. Is he already——?
#PRISCUS.
No, no, not yet. But is it certain that we have defeated the Persians?
#AMMIAN.
Completely. It was Jovian who put them to flight. Three noblemen have even now arrived as envoys from King Sapor, to beg for a truce.
#PRISCUS.
And think you Nevita will accede to it?
#AMMIAN.
Nevita has yielded up the command to Jovian. All flock around him. All see in him our one hope of safety——
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Speak low; he moves.
#AMMIAN.
He moves. Mayhap he is awakening to consciousness! Oh, if he should live to see this!
#EUTHERIUS.
What, Ammian?
#AMMIAN.
Both soldiers and leaders are taking counsel as to the choice of the new Emperor.
#PRISCUS.
What say you?
#EUTHERIUS.
Oh, what shameful haste!
#AMMIAN.
The perilous situation of the army partly excuses it; and yet——
#MAKRINA.
He is waking;—he opens his eyes——
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Sire, do you know me?
#JULIAN.
Very well, my Oribases.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Only lie quiet.
#JULIAN.
Lie quiet? You remind me! I must be up!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Impossible, sire; I implore you——
#JULIAN.
I must up, I say. How can I lie quiet now? I must utterly vanquish Sapor.
#EUTHERIUS.
Sapor is vanquished, sire! He has sent envoys to the camp to beg for a truce.
#JULIAN.
Has he, indeed? That is good news. So him, at least, I have conquered. But no truce. I will crush him to the earth.—Ah, where is my shield? Have I lost my shield?
#AMMIAN.
No, my Emperor,—here are both your shield and your sword.
#JULIAN.
I am very glad of that. My good shield. I should grieve to think of it in the hands of the barbarians. Give it me, on my arm——
#MAKRINA.
Oh, sire, ’tis too heavy for you now!
#JULIAN.
Ah, you? You are right, pious Makrina; ’tis a little too heavy for me.—Lay it before me, that I may see it. What? Is that you, Ammian? Are you on guard here? Where is Anatolus?
#AMMIAN.
Sire, he is now in bliss.
#JULIAN.
Fallen? My trusty Anatolus fallen for my sake!—In bliss, you say? Ha—— One friend the less. Ah, my Maximus!—I will not receive the Persian king’s envoys to - day. Their design is merely to waste my time. But I will grant no terms. I will follow up the victory to the utmost. The army shall turn against Ctesiphon again.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Impossible, sire; think of your wounds.
#JULIAN.
My wounds will soon be healed. Will they not, Oribases—do you not promise me——?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Above all things rest, sire!
#JULIAN.
What a most untimely chance! Just at this moment, when so many weighty matters are crowding in upon me. I cannot leave these things in Nevita’s hands. In such matters I can trust neither him nor others; I must do all myself.—’Tis true, I feel somewhat weary. How unfortunate!—Tell me, Ammian, what is the name of that ill - omened place?
#AMMIAN.
What place, my gracious Emperor?
#JULIAN.
The spot where the Persian javelin struck me?
#AMMIAN.
’Tis called after the village of Phrygia——
#MAXIMUS.
Ah!
#JULIAN.
What is it called——? What say you the region is called?
#AMMIAN.
’Tis called from the village over yonder, the Phrygian region.
#JULIAN.
Ah, Maximus—Maximus!
#MAXIMUS.
Betrayed!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
My Emperor, what alarms you?
#JULIAN.
Nothing—nothing—— Phrygia? Is it so? Nevita and the others will have to take the command after all. Go, tell them——
#AMMIAN.
Sire, they have already, on your behalf——
#JULIAN.
Have they? Yes, yes, that is well. The world - will has laid an ambush for me, Maximus!
#MAKRINA.
Your wound bleeds afresh, sire!
#JULIAN.
Oh, Oribases, why did you seek to hide it from me?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
What did I seek to hide, my Emperor?
#JULIAN.
That I must die. Why not have told me before.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Oh, my Emperor!
#BASIL.
Julian—Julian!
#JULIAN.
Basil,—friend, brother,—we two have lived beautiful days together—— You must not weep because I depart from you so young. ’Tis not always a sign of the Fates’ displeasure when they call a man away in his prime. What, after all, is death? ’Tis nought but paying our debt to the ever - changing empire of the dust. No lamentations! Do we not all love wisdom? And does not wisdom teach us that the highest bliss lies in the life of the soul, not in that of the body? So far the Galileans are right, although——; but we will not speak of that. Had the powers of life and death suffered me to finish a certain treatise, I think I should have succeeded in——
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Oh my Emperor, does it not weary you to talk so much?
#JULIAN.
No, no, no. I feel very light and free.
#BASIL.
Julian, my beloved brother,—is there nought you would recall?
#JULIAN.
Truly I know not what it should be.
#BASIL.
Nothing to repent of, Julian?
#JULIAN.
Nothing. That power which circumstances placed in my hands, and which is an emanation of divinity, I am conscious of having used to the best of my skill. I have never wittingly wronged any one. For this campaign there were good and sufficient reasons; and if some should think that I have not fulfilled all expectations, they ought in justice to reflect that there is a mysterious power without us, which in a great measure governs the issue of human undertakings.
#MAKRINA.
Oh listen—listen how heavily he breathes.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
His voice will soon fail him.
#JULIAN.
As to the choice of my successor, I presume not to give any advice.—You, Eutherius, will divide my possessions among those who have stood nearest to me. I do not leave much; for I have always held that a true philosopher—— What is this? Is the sun already setting?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Not so, my Emperor; ’tis still broad day.
#JULIAN.
Strange! It seemed to me to turn quite dark—— Ah, wisdom—wisdom. Hold fast to wisdom, good Priscus! But be always armed against an unfathomable something without us, which—— Is Maximus gone?
#MAXIMUS.
No, my brother!
#JULIAN.
My throat is burning. Can you not cool it? draught of water, sire?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
His wound bleeds inwardly.
#JULIAN.
Do not weep. Let no Greek weep for me; I am ascending to the stars—— Beautiful temples—— Pictures—— But so far away.
#MAKRINA.
Of what is he talking?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
I know not; I think his mind is wandering.
#JULIAN.
’Twas given to Alexander to enter in triumph—into Babylon.—I too will—— Beautiful wreath—crown’d youths—dancing maidens,—but so far away. Beautiful earth,—beautiful life—— Oh, Helios, Helios—why didst thou betray me?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
That was death.
#THE BYSTANDERS.
Dead—dead!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Yes, now he is dead.
#SHOUTS FROM THE CAMP.
Long live the Emperor Jovian!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Oh, heard you that shout?
#AMMIAN.
Jovian is proclaimed Emperor.
#MAXIMUS.
The Galilean Jovian! Yes—yes—yes!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Shameful haste! Before they knew that——
#PRISCUS.
Jovian,—the victorious hero who has saved us all! The Emperor Jovian assuredly deserves a panegyric. I trust that crafty Kytron has not already——
#BASIL.
Forgotten, ere your hand is cold. And for this pitiful splendour you sold your immortal soul!
#MAXIMUS.
The world - will shall answer for Julian’s soul!
#MAKRINA.
Blaspheme not; though surely you have loved this dead man——
#MAXIMUS.
Loved, and led him astray—Nay, not I! Led astray like Cain. Led astray like Judas.—Your God is a spendthrift God, Galileans! He wears out many souls. Wast thou not then, this time either, the chosen one—thou victim on the altar of necessity? What is it worth to live? All is sport and mockery.—To will is to be made to thee, and to thy two guests in the symposium.
#MAKRINA.
Basil—did you understand the heathen’s speech?
#BASIL.
No,—but it dawns on me like a great and radiant light, that here lies a noble, shattered instrument of God.
#MAKRINA.
Ay, truly, a dear and dear - bought instrument.
#BASIL.
Christ, Christ—how came it that thy people saw not thy manifest design? The Emperor Julian was a rod of chastisement,—not unto death, but unto resurrection.
#MAKRINA.
Terrible is the mystery of election. How know we——?
#BASIL.
Is it not written: “Some vessels are fashioned to honour, and some to dishonour”?
#MAKRINA.
Oh brother, let us not seek to fathom that abyss. Erring soul of man—if thou wast indeed forced to err, it shall surely be accounted to thee for good on that great day when the Mighty One shall descend in the clouds to judge the living dead and the dead who are yet alive!—— ——
