#PAYNTER.
Where's she gone?
#BURNEY.
Just walks about, I fancy.
#PAYNTER.
She and the Governor don't hit it! One of these days she'll flit - you'll see. I like her - she's a lady; but these thoroughbred 'uns - it's their skin and their mouths. They'll go till they drop if they like the job, and if they don't, it's nothing but jib - jib - jib. How was it down there before she married him?
#BURNEY.
Oh! Quiet, of course.
#PAYNTER.
Country homes - I know 'em. What's her father, the old Rector, like?
#BURNEY.
Oh! very steady old man. The mother dead long before I took the place.
#PAYNTER.
Not a penny, I suppose?
#BURNEY.
No; and seven of them.
#PAYNTER.
The Governor!
#GEORGE.
Look here, Paynter! When I send up from the Club for my dress things, always put in a black waistcoat as well.
#PAYNTER.
I asked the mistress, sir.
#GEORGE.
In future - see?
#PAYNTER.
Yes, sir. Shall I leave the sunset, sir?
#GEORGE.
Where's Mrs. Dedmond?
#PAYNTER.
I hardly know, sir.
#GEORGE.
Dined in?
#PAYNTER.
She had a mere nothing at seven, sir.
#GEORGE.
Has she gone out, since?
#PAYNTER.
Yes, sir - that is, yes. The - er - mistress was not dressed at all. A little matter of fresh air, I think; sir.
#GEORGE.
What time did my mother say they'd be here for Bridge?
#PAYNTER.
Sir Charles and Lady Dedmond were coming at half - past nine; and Captain Huntingdon, too - Mr. and Mrs. Fullarton might be a bit late, sir.
#GEORGE.
It's that now. Your mistress said nothing?
#PAYNTER.
Not to me, sir.
#GEORGE.
Send Burney.
#PAYNTER.
Very good, sir.
#GEORGE.
Did your mistress say anything before she went out?
#BURNEY.
Yes, sir.
#GEORGE.
Well?
#BURNEY.
I don't think she meant it, sir.
#GEORGE.
I don't want to know what you don't think, I want the fact.
#BURNEY.
Yes, sir. The mistress said: "I hope it'll be a pleasant evening, Burney!"
#GEORGE.
Oh! - Thanks.
#BURNEY.
I've put out the mistress's things, sir.
#GEORGE.
Ah!
#BURNEY.
Thank you, sir.
#GEORGE.
Damn!
#SIR CHARLES.
Hullo! Where are they? H'm!
#LADY DEDMOND.
Well, George. Where's Clare?
#GEORGE.
Afraid she's late.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Are we early?
#GEORGE.
As a matter of fact, she's not in.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Oh?
#SIR CHARLES.
H'm! Not - not had a rumpus?
#GEORGE.
Not particularly. What I can't stand is being made a fool of before other people. Ordinary friction one can put up with. But that -
#SIR CHARLES.
Gone out on purpose? What!
#LADY DEDMOND.
What was the trouble?
#GEORGE.
I told her this morning you were coming in to Bridge. Appears she'd asked that fellow Malise, for music.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Without letting you know?
#GEORGE.
I believe she did tell me.
#LADY DEDMOND.
But surely -
#GEORGE.
I don't want to discuss it. There's never anything in particular. We're all anyhow, as you know.
#LADY DEDMOND.
I see. My dear, I should be rather careful about him, I think.
#SIR CHARLES.
Who's that?
#LADY DEDMOND.
That Mr. Malise.
#SIR CHARLES.
Oh! That chap!
#GEORGE.
Clare isn't that sort.
#LADY DEDMOND.
I know. But she catches up notions very easily. I think it's a great pity you ever came across him.
#SIR CHARLES.
Where did you pick him up?
#GEORGE.
Italy - this Spring - some place or other where they couldn't speak English.
#SIR CHARLES.
Um! That's the worst of travellin'.
#LADY DEDMOND.
I think you ought to have dropped him. These literary people - From exchanging ideas to something else, isn't very far, George.
#SIR CHARLES.
We'll make him play Bridge. Do him good, if he's that sort of fellow.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Is anyone else coming?
#GEORGE.
Reggie Huntingdon, and the Fullartons.
#LADY DEDMOND.
You know, my dear boy, I've been meaning to speak to you for a long time. It is such a pity you and Clare - What is it?
#GEORGE.
God knows! I try, and I believe she does.
#SIR CHARLES.
It's distressin' - for us, you know, my dear fellow - distressin'.
#LADY DEDMOND.
I know it's been going on for a long time.
#GEORGE.
Oh! leave it alone, mother.
#LADY DEDMOND.
But, George, I'm afraid this man has brought it to a point - put ideas into her head.
#GEORGE.
You can't dislike him more than I do. But there's nothing one can object to.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Could Reggie Huntingdon do anything, now he's home? Brothers sometimes -
#GEORGE.
I can't bear my affairs being messed about -
#LADY DEDMOND.
Well! it would be better for you and Clare to be supposed to be out together, than for her to be out alone. Go quietly into the dining - room and wait for her.
#SIR CHARLES.
Good! Leave your mother to make up something. She'll do it!
#LADY DEDMOND.
That may be he. Quick!
#LADY DEDMOND.
Don't say anything about your master and mistress being out. I'll explain.
#PAYNTER.
The master, my lady?
#LADY DEDMOND.
Yes, I know. But you needn't say so. Do you understand?
#PAYNTER.
Just so, my lady.
#SIR CHARLES.
By Jove! That fellow smells a rat!
#LADY DEDMOND.
Be careful, Charles!
#SIR CHARLES.
I should think so.
#LADY DEDMOND.
I shall simply say they're dining out, and that we're not to wait Bridge for them.
#SIR CHARLES.
He's having a palaver with that man of George's.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Ah! It's you, Reginald!
#HUNTINGDON.
How d'you do? How are you, sir? What's the matter with their man?
#SIR CHARLES.
What!
#HUNTINGDON.
I was going into the dining - room to get rid of my cigar; and he said: "Not in there, sir. The master's there, but my instructions are to the effect that he's not."
#SIR CHARLES.
I knew that fellow -
#LADY DEDMOND.
The fact is, Reginald, Clare's out, and George is waiting for her. It's so important people shouldn't -
#HUNTINGDON.
Rather!
#LADY DEDMOND.
It's getting serious, Reginald. I don't know what's to become of them. You don't think the Rector - you don't think your father would speak to Clare?
#HUNTINGDON.
Afraid the Governor's hardly well enough. He takes anything of that sort to heart so - especially Clare.
#SIR CHARLES.
Can't you put in a word yourself?
#HUNTINGDON.
Don't know where the mischief lies.
#SIR CHARLES.
I'm sure George doesn't gallop her on the road. Very steady - goin' fellow, old George.
#HUNTINGDON.
Oh, yes; George is all right, sir.
#LADY DEDMOND.
They ought to have had children.
#HUNTINGDON.
Expect they're pretty glad now they haven't. I really don't know what to say, ma'am.
#SIR CHARLES.
Saving your presence, you know, Reginald, I've often noticed parsons' daughters grow up queer. Get too much morality and rice puddin'.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Charles!
#SIR CHARLES.
What was she like when you were kids?
#HUNTINGDON.
Oh, all right. Could be rather a little devil, of course, when her monkey was up.
#SIR CHARLES.
I'm fond of her. Nothing she wants that she hasn't got, is there?
#HUNTINGDON.
Never heard her say so.
#SIR CHARLES.
I don't know whether old George is a bit too matter of fact for her. H'm?
#LADY DEDMOND.
There's a Mr. Malise coming here to - night. I forget if you know him.
#HUNTINGDON.
Yes. Rather a thorough - bred mongrel.
#LADY DEDMOND.
He's literary. You - you don't think he - puts - er - ideas into her head?
#HUNTINGDON.
I asked Greyman, the novelist, about him; seems he's a bit of an Ishmaelite, even among those fellows. Can't see Clare -
#LADY DEDMOND.
No. Only, the great thing is that she shouldn't be encouraged. Listen! - It is her - coming in. I can hear their voices. Gone to her room. What a blessing that man isn't here yet! Tt! There he is, I expect.
#SIR CHARLES.
What are we goin' to say?
#HUNTINGDON.
Say they're dining out, and we're not to wait Bridge for them.
#SIR CHARLES.
Good!
#LADY DEDMOND.
How do you do? My son and daughter - in - law are so very sorry. They'll be here directly.
#SIR CHARLES.
How d'you do, sir?
#HUNTINGDON.
We've met, I think.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Clare will be so grieved. One of those invitations
#MALISE.
On the spur of the moment.
#SIR CHARLES.
You play Bridge, sir?
#MALISE.
Afraid not!
#SIR CHARLES.
Don't mean that? Then we shall have to wait for 'em.
#LADY DEDMOND.
I forget, Mr. Malise - you write, don't you?
#MALISE.
Such is my weakness.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Delightful profession.
#SIR CHARLES.
Doesn't tie you! What!
#MALISE.
Only by the head.
#SIR CHARLES.
I'm always thinkin' of writin' my experiences.
#MALISE.
Indeed!
#SIR CHARLES.
You smoke, Mr. MALISE?
#MALISE.
Too much.
#SIR CHARLES.
Ah! Must smoke when you think a lot.
#MALISE.
Or think when you smoke a lot.
#SIR CHARLES.
Don't know that I find that.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Charles!
#LADY DEDMOND.
Well, my dear!
#SIR CHARLES.
Ah! George. Good dinner?
#GEORGE.
How are you? Clare! Mr. MALISE!
#CLARE.
Yes, we met on the door - mat.
#SIR CHARLES.
Deuce you did!
#LADY DEDMOND.
Mr. Malise doesn't play Bridge, it appears. Afraid we shall be rather in the way of music.
#SIR CHARLES.
What! Aren't we goin' to get a game?
#GEORGE.
Paynter! Take that table into the dining room.
#PAYNTER.
Yes, sir.
#MALISE.
Let me give you a hand.
#SIR CHARLES.
Very fine sunset!
#HUNTINGDON.
Bring the tray along, old man.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Well, if we're going to play, Charles?
#SIR CHARLES.
What?
#LADY DEDMOND.
Now you will be able to have your music.
#MALISE.
Delicious!
#CLARE.
Perfectly beastly of me! I'm so sorry. I simply can't help running amok to - night.
#MALISE.
Never apologize for being fey. It's much too rare.
#CLARE.
On the door - mat! And they'd whitewashed me so beautifully! Poor dears! I wonder if I ought -
#MALISE.
Don't spoil it!
#CLARE.
I'd been walking up and down the Embankment for about three hours. One does get desperate sometimes.
#MALISE.
Thank God for that!
#CLARE.
Only makes it worse afterwards. It seems so frightful to them, too.
#MALISE.
Blessed be the respectable! May they dream of - me! And blessed be all men of the world! May they perish of a surfeit of - good form!
#CLARE.
I like that. Oh, won't there be a row! And the usual reconciliation.
#MALISE.
Mrs. Dedmond, there's a whole world outside yours. Why don't you spread your wings?
#CLARE.
My dear father's a saint, and he's getting old and frail; and I've got a sister engaged; and three little sisters to whom I'm supposed to set a good example. Then, I've no money, and I can't do anything for a living, except serve in a shop. I shouldn't be free, either; so what's the good? Besides, I oughtn't to have married if I wasn't going to be happy. You see, I'm not a bit misunderstood or ill - treated. It's only -
#MALISE.
Prison. Break out!
#CLARE.
Did you see the sunset? That white cloud trying to fly up?
#MALISE.
Ah - h - h! Play me something.
#CLARE.
I'm awfully grateful to you. You don't make me feel just an attractive female. I wanted somebody like that. All the same, I'm glad not to be ugly.
#MALISE.
Thank God for beauty!
#PAYNTER.
Mr. and Mrs. Fullarton.
#MALISE.
Who are they?
#CLARE.
She's my chief pal. He was in the Navy.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
We've only come for a minute.
#CLARE.
They're playing Bridge in the dining - room. Mr. Malise doesn't play. Mr. Malise - Mrs. Fullarton, Mr. Fullarton.
#FULLARTON.
Most awfully jolly dress, Mrs. Dedmond.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
Yes, lovely, Clare. We can't stay for Bridge, my dear; I just wanted to see you a minute, that's all. Edward, I want to speak to Clare. How d'you do, Captain Huntingdon?
#MALISE.
I'll say good - night.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
How are things, Clare? Have you done what I suggested? Your room?
#CLARE.
No.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
Why not?
#CLARE.
I don't want to torture him. If I strike - I'll go clean. I expect I shall strike.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
My dear! You'll have the whole world against you.
#CLARE.
Even you won't back me, Dolly?
#MRS. FULLARTON.
Of course I'll back you, all that's possible, but I can't invent things.
#CLARE.
You wouldn't let me come to you for a bit, till I could find my feet?
#MRS. FULLARTON.
Of course - the only thing is that -
#CLARE.
It's all right, Dolly. I'm not coming.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
Oh! don't do anything desperate, Clare - you are so desperate sometimes. You ought to make terms - not tracks.
#CLARE.
Haggle? What have I got to make terms with? What he still wants is just what I hate giving.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
But, Clare -
#CLARE.
No, Dolly; even you don't understand. All day and every day - just as far apart as we can be - and still - Jolly, isn't it? If you've got a soul at all.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
It's awful, really.
#CLARE.
I suppose there are lots of women who feel as I do, and go on with it; only, you see, I happen to have something in me that - comes to an end. Can't endure beyond a certain time, ever.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
Look here, my child; this won't do. You must get a rest. Can't Reggie take you with him to India for a bit?
#CLARE.
Reggie lives on his pay.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
That was Mr. Malise, then?
#FULLARTON.
I say, Mrs. Dedmond, you wouldn't sing me that little song you sang the other night, "If I might be the falling bee and kiss thee all the day"? Remember?
#MRS. FULLARTON.
"The falling dew," Edward. We simply must go, Clare. Good - night.
#FULLARTON.
It suits you down to the ground - that dress.
#CLARE.
Good - night.
#HUNTINGDON.
Look here, Clare!
#CLARE.
Well, Reggie?
#HUNTINGDON.
This is working up for a mess, old girl. You can't do this kind of thing with impunity. No man'll put up with it. If you've got anything against George, better tell me. You ought to know I should stick by you. What is it? Come?
#CLARE.
Get married, and find out after a year that she's the wrong person; so wrong that you can't exchange a single real thought; that your blood runs cold when she kisses you - then you'll know.
#HUNTINGDON.
My dear old girl, I don't want to be a brute; but it's a bit difficult to believe in that, except in novels.
#CLARE.
Yes, incredible, when you haven't tried.
#HUNTINGDON.
I mean, you - you chose him yourself. No one forced you to marry him.
#CLARE.
It does seem monstrous, doesn't it?
#HUNTINGDON.
My dear child, do give us a reason.
#CLARE.
Look! If George saw that for the first time he'd just say, "Ah, Westminster! Clock Tower! Can you see the time by it?" As if one cared where or what it was - beautiful like that! Apply that to every - every - everything.
#HUNTINGDON.
George may be a bit prosaic. But, my dear old girl, if that's all -
#CLARE.
It's not all - it's nothing. I can't explain, Reggie - it's not reason, at all; it's - it's like being underground in a damp cell; it's like knowing you'll never get out. Nothing coming - never anything coming again - never anything.
#HUNTINGDON.
My dear old thing; you mustn't get into fantods like this. If it's like that, don't think about it.
#CLARE.
When every day and every night! - Oh! I know it's my fault for having married him, but that doesn't help.
#HUNTINGDON.
Look here! It's not as if George wasn't quite a decent chap. And it's no use blinking things; you are absolutely dependent on him. At home they've got every bit as much as they can do to keep going.
#CLARE.
I know.
#HUNTINGDON.
And you've got to think of the girls. Any trouble would be very beastly for them. And the poor old Governor would feel it awfully.
#CLARE.
If I didn't know all that, Reggie, I should have gone home long ago.
#HUNTINGDON.
Well, what's to be done? If my pay would run to it - but it simply won't.
#CLARE.
Thanks, old boy, of course not.
#HUNTINGDON.
Can't you try to see George's side of it a bit?
#CLARE.
I do. Oh! don't let's talk about it.
#HUNTINGDON.
Well, my child, there's just one thing you won't go sailing near the wind, will you? I mean, there are fellows always on the lookout.
#CLARE.
"That chap, Malise, you'd better avoid him!" Why?
#HUNTINGDON.
Well! I don't know him. He may be all right, but he's not our sort. And you're too pretty to go on the tack of the New Woman and that kind of thing - haven't been brought up to it.
#CLARE.
British home - made summer goods, light and attractive - don't wear long. They seem 'to be going, Reggie.
#HUNTINGDON.
Don't head for trouble, old girl. Take a pull. Bless you! Good - night.
#CLARE.
Nothing more wanted, thank you, Paynter. You can go home, and the maids can go to bed.
#PAYNTER.
We are much obliged, ma'am.
#CLARE.
I ran over a dog, and had to get it seen to.
#PAYNTER.
Naturally, ma'am!
#CLARE.
Good - night.
#PAYNTER.
I couldn't get you a little anything, ma'am?
#CLARE.
No, thank you.
#PAYNTER.
No, ma'am. Good - night, ma'am.
#GEORGE.
You needn't have gone out of your way to tell a lie that wouldn't deceive a guinea - pig. Pleased with yourself to - night? Before that fellow as if our own people weren't enough!
#CLARE.
Is it worth while to rag me? I know I've behaved badly, but I couldn't help it, really!
#GEORGE.
Couldn't help behaving like a shop - girl? My God! You were brought up as well as I was.
#CLARE.
Alas!
#GEORGE.
To let everybody see that we don't get on - there's only one word for it - Disgusting!
#CLARE.
I know.
#GEORGE.
Then why do you do it? I've always kept my end up. Why in heaven's name do you behave in this crazy way?
#CLARE.
I'm sorry.
#GEORGE.
You like making a fool of me!
#CLARE.
No - Really! Only - I must break out sometimes.
#GEORGE.
There are things one does not do.
#CLARE.
I came in because I was sorry.
#GEORGE.
And at once began to do it again! It seems to me you delight in rows.
#CLARE.
You'd miss your - reconciliations.
#GEORGE.
For God's sake, Clare, drop cynicism!
#CLARE.
And truth?
#GEORGE.
You are my wife, I suppose.
#CLARE.
And they twain shall be one - spirit.
#GEORGE.
Don't talk wild nonsense!
#CLARE.
I don't give satisfaction. Please give me notice!
#GEORGE.
Pish!
#CLARE.
Five years, and four of them like this! I'm sure we've served our time. Don't you really think we might get on better together - if I went away?
#GEORGE.
I've told you I won't stand a separation for no real reason, and have your name bandied about all over London. I have some primitive sense of honour.
#CLARE.
You mean your name, don't you?
#GEORGE.
Look here. Did that fellow Malise put all this into your head?
#CLARE.
No; my own evil nature.
#GEORGE.
I wish the deuce we'd never met him. Comes of picking up people you know nothing of. I distrust him - and his looks - and his infernal satiric way. He can't even 'dress decently. He's not - good form.
#CLARE.
Ah - h!
#GEORGE.
Why do you let him come? What d'you find interesting in him? mind.
#GEORGE.
Deuced funny one! To have a mind - as you call it - it's not necessary to talk about Art and Literature.
#CLARE.
We don't.
#GEORGE.
Then what do you talk about - your minds? Will you answer a straight question? Is he falling in love with you?
#CLARE.
You had better ask him.
#GEORGE.
I tell you plainly, as a man of the world, I don't believe in the guide, philosopher and friend business.
#CLARE.
Thank you.
#CLARE.
Let me go! You'd be much happier with any other woman.
#GEORGE.
Clare!
#CLARE.
I believe - I'm sure I could earn my living. Quite serious.
#GEORGE.
Are you mad?
#CLARE.
It has been done.
#GEORGE.
It will never be done by you - understand that!
#CLARE.
It really is time we parted. I'd go clean out of your life. I don't want your support unless I'm giving you something for your money.
#GEORGE.
Once for all, I don't mean to allow you to make fools of us both.
#CLARE.
But if we are already! Look at us. We go on, and on. We're a spectacle!
#GEORGE.
That's not my opinion; nor the opinion of anyone, so long as you behave yourself.
#CLARE.
That is - behave as you think right.
#GEORGE.
Clare, you're pretty riling.
#CLARE.
I don't want to be horrid. But I am in earnest this time.
#GEORGE.
So am I.
#GEORGE.
Look here! I'm sorry. God knows I don't want to be a brute. I know you're not happy.
#CLARE.
And you - are you happy?
#GEORGE.
I don't say I am. But why can't we be?
#CLARE.
I see no reason, except that you are you, and I am I.
#GEORGE.
We can try.
#CLARE.
I HAVE - haven't you?
#GEORGE.
We used -
#CLARE.
I wonder!
#GEORGE.
You know we did.
#CLARE.
Too long ago - if ever.
#GEORGE.
I - still -
#CLARE.
You know that's only cupboard love.
#GEORGE.
We've got to face the facts.
#CLARE.
I thought I was.
#GEORGE.
The facts are that we're married - for better or worse, and certain things are expected of us. It's suicide for you, and folly for me, in my position, to ignore that. You have all you can reasonably want; and I don't - don't wish for any change. If you could bring anything against me - if I drank, or knocked about town, or expected too much of you. I'm not unreasonable in any way, that I can see.
#CLARE.
Well, I think we've talked enough.
#GEORGE.
Look here, Clare; you don't mean you're expecting me to put up with the position of a man who's neither married nor unmarried? That's simple purgatory. You ought to know.
#CLARE.
Yes. I haven't yet, have I?
#GEORGE.
Don't go like that! Do you suppose we're the only couple who've found things aren't what they thought, and have to put up with each other and make the best of it.
#CLARE.
Not by thousands.
#GEORGE.
Well, why do you imagine they do it?
#CLARE.
I don't know.
#GEORGE.
From a common sense of decency.
#CLARE.
Very!
#GEORGE.
By Jove! You can be the most maddening thing in all the world! After behaving as you have this evening, you might try to make some amends, I should think.
#CLARE.
No, no - no!
#GEORGE.
Can't you make it up?
#CLARE.
I don't feel very Christian.
#MALISE.
"Not a word, not a whisper of Liberty from all those excellent frock - coated gentlemen - not a sign, not a grimace. Only the monumental silence of their profound deference before triumphant Tyranny."
#MALISE.
Wait, Mrs. Miller!
#MRS. MILER.
I'm gettin' be'ind'and, sir.
#MRS. MILER.
There's a man 'angin' about below.
#MRS. MILER.
I see him first yesterday afternoon. I'd just been out to get meself a pennyworth o' soda, an' as I come in I passed 'im on the second floor, lookin' at me with an air of suspicion. I thought to meself at the time, I thought: You're a'andy sort of 'ang - dog man.
#MALISE.
Well?
#MRS. MILER.
Well - peekin' down through the balusters, I see 'im lookin' at a photograft. That's a funny place, I thinks, to look at pictures - it's so dark there, ye 'ave to use yer eyesight. So I giv' a scrape with me 'eel an' he pops it in his pocket, and puts up 'is 'and to knock at number three. I goes down an' I says: "You know there's no one lives there, don't yer?" "Ah!" 'e says with an air of innercence, "I wants the name of Smithers." "Oh!" I says, "try round the corner, number ten." "Ah!" 'e says tactful, "much obliged." "Yes," I says, "you'll find 'im in at this time o' day. Good evenin'!" And I thinks to meself Rats! There's a good many corners hereabouts.
#MALISE.
Very good, Mrs. Miler.
#MRS. MILER.
So this mornin', there e' was again on the first floor with 'is 'and raised, pretendin' to knock at number two. "Oh! you're still lookin' for 'im?" I says, lettin' him see I was 'is grandmother. "Ah!" 'e says, affable, "you misdirected me; it's here I've got my business." "That's lucky," I says, "cos nobody lives there neither. Good mornin'!" And I come straight up. If you want to see 'im at work you've only to go downstairs, 'e'll be on the ground floor by now, pretendin' to knock at number one. Wonderful resource!
#MALISE.
What's he like, this gentleman?
#MRS. MILER.
Just like the men you see on the front page o' the daily papers. Nasty, smooth - lookin' feller, with one o' them billycock hats you can't abide.
#MALISE.
Isn't he a dun?
#MRS. MILER.
They don't be'ave like that; you ought to know, sir. He's after no good. Ain't he to be put a stop to? If I took me time I could get 'im, innercent - like, with a jug o' water.
#MALISE.
You can get on now; I'm going to shave.
#CLARE.
Is Mr. Malise in?
#MRS. MILER.
Yes. But 'e's dressin'.
#CLARE.
Oh.
#MRS. MILER.
Won't take 'im long. What name?
#CLARE.
Would you say - a lady.
#MRS. MILER.
It's against the rules. But if you'll sit down a moment I'll see what I can do. A lady to see you. This is my hour. I shan't make much dust. I'm particular about not disturbin' things.
#CLARE.
I'm sure you are.
#MRS. MILER.
He likes 'is 'abits regular.
#MRS. MILER.
He takes his claret fresh - opened - not like these 'ere bawgwars.
#CLARE.
I think I'll come back later.
#MRS. MILER.
Mr. Malise is not in my confidence. We keep each other to ourselves. Perhaps you'd like to read the paper; he has it fresh every mornin' - the Westminister.
#MRS. MILER.
I wouldn't interrupt yer with my workin,' but 'e likes things clean. That's 'im; 'e's cut 'isself! I'll just take 'im the tobaccer!
#MRS. MILER.
The tobaccer. The lady's waitin'.
#MALISE.
Do the other room.
#MALISE.
Jolly of you to come. Can I do anything?
#CLARE.
I want advice - badly.
#MALISE.
What! Spreading your wings?
#CLARE.
Yes.
#MALISE.
Ah! Proud to have given you that advice. When?
#CLARE.
The morning after you gave it me .
#MALISE.
Well?
#CLARE.
I went down to my people. I knew it would hurt my Dad frightfully, but somehow I thought I could make him see. No good. He was awfully sweet, only - he couldn't.
#MALISE.
We English love liberty in those who don't belong to us. Yes.
#CLARE.
It was horrible. There were the children - and my old nurse. I could never live at home now. They'd think I was - Impossible - utterly! I'd made up my mind to go back to my owner - And then - he came down himself. I couldn't d it. To be hauled back and begin all over again; I simply couldn't. I watched for a chance; and ran to the station, and came up to an hotel.
#MALISE.
Bravo!
#CLARE.
I don't know - no pluck this morning! You see, I've got to earn my living - no money; only a few things I can sell. All yesterday I was walking about, looking at the women. How does anyone ever get a chance?
#MALISE.
Sooner than you should hurt his dignity by working, your husband would pension you off.
#CLARE.
If I don't go back to him I couldn't take it.
#MALISE.
Good!
#CLARE.
I've thought of nursing, but it's a long training, and I do so hate watching pain. The fact is, I'm pretty hopeless; can't even do art work. I came to ask you about the stage.
#MALISE.
Have you ever acted? You mightn't think so, but I've heard there's a prejudice in favour of training. There's Chorus - I don't recommend it. How about your brother?
#CLARE.
My brother's got nothing to spare, and he wants to get married; and he's going back to India in September. The only friend I should care to bother is Mrs. Fullarton, and she's - got a husband.
#MALISE.
I remember the gentleman.
#CLARE.
Besides, I should be besieged day and night to go back. I must lie doggo somehow.
#MALISE.
It makes my blood boil to think of women like you. God help all ladies without money.
#CLARE.
I expect I shall have to go back.
#MALISE.
No, no! We shall find something. Keep your soul alive at all costs. What! let him hang on to you till you're nothing but - emptiness and ache, till you lose even the power to ache. Sit in his drawing - room, pay calls, play Bridge, go out with him to dinners, return to - duty; and feel less and less, and be less and less, and so grow old and - die!
#MALISE.
By the wayhe'd no means of tracing you?
#MALISE.
Was there a man on the stairs as you came up?
#CLARE.
Yes. Why?
#MALISE.
He's begun to haunt them, I'm told.
#CLARE.
Oh! But that would mean they thought I - oh! no!
#MALISE.
Confidence in me is not excessive.
#CLARE.
Spying!
#MALISE.
Will you go in there for a minute? Or shall we let them ring - or - what? It may not be anything, of course.
#CLARE.
I'm not going to hide.
#MALISE.
Mrs. Miler, just see who it is; and then go, for the present.
#MRS. MILER.
The cards.
#MALISE.
Mr. Robert Twisden. Sir Charles and Lady Dedmond.
#CLARE.
Let them come.
#MALISE.
Show them in!
#TWISDEN.
Mr. Malise? How do you do, Mrs. Dedmond? Had the pleasure of meeting you at your wedding. I am Mr. George Dedmond's solicitor, sir. I wonder if you would be so very kind as to let us have a few words with Mrs. Dedmond alone?
#SIR CHARLES.
What!
#LADY DEDMOND.
Mr. Twisden, will you - ?
#TWISDEN.
Mrs. Dedmond I must apologize, but you - you hardly gave us an alternative, did you? Your disappearance has given your husband great anxiety. Really, my dear madam, you must forgive us for this - attempt to get into communication.
#CLARE.
Why did you spy, HERE?
#SIR CHARLES.
No, no! Nobody's spied on you. What!
#TWISDEN.
I'm afraid the answer is that we appear to have been justified. Now, Mrs. Dedmond, I'm a lawyer and I know that appearances are misleading. Don't think I'm unfriendly; I wish you well. What we want to say to you is this: Don't let this split go on! Don't commit yourself to what you'll bitterly regret. Just tell us what's the matter. I'm sure it can be put straight.
#CLARE.
I have nothing against my husband - it was quite unreasonable to leave him.
#TWISDEN.
Come, that's good.
#CLARE.
Unfortunately, there's something stronger than reason.
#TWISDEN.
I don't know it, Mrs. Dedmond.
#CLARE.
No?
#TWISDEN.
Are you - you oughtn't to take a step without advice, in your position.
#CLARE.
Nor with it?
#TWISDEN.
Come, now; isn't there anything you feel you'd like to say - that might help to put matters straight?
#CLARE.
I don't think so, thank you.
#LADY DEDMOND.
You must see, Clare, that -
#TWISDEN.
In your position, Mrs. Dedmond - a beautiful young woman without money. I'm quite blunt. This is a hard world. Should be awfully sorry if anything goes wrong.
#CLARE.
And if I go back?
#TWISDEN.
Of two evils, if it be so - choose the least!
#CLARE.
I am twenty - six; he is thirty - two. We can't reasonably expect to die for fifty years.
#LADY DESMOND.
That's morbid, Clare.
#TWISDEN.
What's open to you if you don't go back? Come, what's your position? Neither fish, flesh, nor fowl; fair game for everybody. Believe me, Mrs. Dedmond, for a pretty woman to strike, as it appears you're doing, simply because the spirit of her marriage has taken flight, is madness. You must know that no one pays attention to anything but facts. If now - excuse me - you - you had a lover, you would, at all events, have some ground under your feet, some sort of protection, but as you have not - you've none.
#CLARE.
Except what I make myself.
#SIR CHARLES.
Good God!
#TWISDEN.
Yes! Mrs. Dedmond! There's the bedrock difficulty. As you haven't money, you should never have been pretty. You're up against the world, and you'll get no mercy from it. We lawyers see too much of that. I'm putting it brutally, as a man of the world.
#CLARE.
Thank you. Do you think you quite grasp the alternative?
#TWISDEN.
But, my dear young lady, there are two sides to every contract. After all, your husband's fulfilled his.
#CLARE.
So have I up till now. I shan't ask anything from him - nothing - do you understand?
#LADY DEDMOND.
But, my dear, you must live.
#TWISDEN.
Have you ever done any sort of work?
#CLARE.
Not yet.
#TWISDEN.
Any conception of the competition nowadays?
#CLARE.
I can try.
#CLARE.
It's real to me - this - you see!
#SIR CHARLES.
But, my dear girl, what the devil's to become of George?
#CLARE.
He can do what he likes - it's nothing to me.
#TWISDEN.
Mrs. Dedmond, I say without hesitation you've no notion of what you're faced with, brought up to a sheltered life as you've been. Do realize that you stand at the parting of the ways, and one leads into the wilderness.
#CLARE.
Which?
#TWISDEN.
Of course, if you want to play at wild asses there are plenty who will help you.
#SIR CHARLES.
By Gad! Yes!
#CLARE.
I only want to breathe.
#TWISDEN.
Mrs. Dedmond, go back! You can now. It will be too late soon. There are lots of wolves about.
#CLARE.
But not where you think. You say I need advice. I came here for it.
#TWISDEN.
In that case I don't know that I can usefully stay.
#CLARE.
Please don't have me followed when I leave here. Please!
#LADY DEDMOND.
George is outside, Clare.
#CLARE.
I don't wish to see him. By what right have you come here? Please come in, Mr. Malise.
#TWISDEN.
I am sorry. I am sorry. Good morning.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Mr. Malise, I'm sure, will see -
#CLARE.
Mr. Malise will stay here, please, in his own room.
#SIR CHARLES.
My dear girl, 'pon my soul, you know, I can't grasp your line of thought at all!
#CLARE.
No?
#LADY DEDMOND.
George is most willing to take up things just as they were before you left.
#CLARE.
Ah!
#LADY DEDMOND.
Quite frankly - what is it you want?
#CLARE.
To be left alone. Quite frankly, he made a mistake to have me spied on.
#LADY DEDMOND.
But, my good girl, if you'd let us know where you were, like a reasonable being. You can't possibly be left to yourself without money or position of any kind. Heaven knows what you'd be driven to!
#MALISE.
Delicious!
#SIR CHARLES.
You will be good enough to repeat that out loud, sir.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Charles! Clare, you must know this is all a fit of spleen; your duty and your interest - marriage is sacred, Clare.
#CLARE.
Marriage! My marriage has become the - the reconciliation - of two animals - one of them unwilling. That's all the sanctity there is about it.
#SIR CHARLES.
What!
#LADY DEDMOND.
You ought to be horribly ashamed. CLARE. Of the fact - I am.
#LADY DEDMOND.
If we are to talk this out, it must be in private.
#MALISE.
Do you wish me to go?
#CLARE.
No.
#LADY DEDMOND.
I should have thought ordinary decent feeling - Good heavens, girl! Can't you see that you're being played with?
#CLARE.
If you insinuate anything against Mr. Malise, you lie.
#LADY DEDMOND.
If you will do these things - come to a man's rooms -
#CLARE.
I came to Mr. Malise because he's the only person I know with imagination enough to see what my position is; I came to him a quarter of an hour ago, for the first time, for definite advice, and you instantly suspect him. That is disgusting.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Is this the natural place for me to find my son's wife?
#CLARE.
His woman.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Will you listen to Reginald?
#CLARE.
I have.
#LADY DEDMOND.
Haven't you any religious sense at all, Clare?
#CLARE.
None, if it's religion to live as we do.
#LADY DEDMOND.
It's terrible - this state of mind! It's really terrible!
#SIR CHARLES.
For God's sake don't laugh like that!
#LADY DEDMOND.
For the sake of the simple right, Clare!
#CLARE.
Right? Whatever else is right - our life is not. I swear before God that I've tried and tried. I swear before God, that if I believed we could ever again love each other only a little tiny bit, I'd go back. I swear before God that I don't want to hurt anybody.
#LADY DEDMOND.
But you are hurting everybody. Do - do be reasonable!
#CLARE.
Can't you see that I'm fighting for all my life to come - not to be buried alive - not to be slowly smothered. Look at me! I'm not wax - I'm flesh and blood. And you want to prison me for ever - body and soul.
#SIR CHARLES.
By Jove! I don't know, I don't know! What!
#LADY DEDMOND.
If you have any decency left, sir, you will allow my son, at all events, to speak to his wife alone. We'll wait below. want to speak. My dear, if you feel like this, I can only say - as a - as a gentleman -
#LADY DEDMOND.
Charles!
#SIR CHARLES.
Let me alone! I can only say that - damme, I don't know that I can say anything!
#GEORGE.
Will you come outside and speak to me?
#CLARE.
No.
#GEORGE.
Clare!
#CLARE.
Well!
#GEORGE.
You try me pretty high, don't you, forcing me to come here, and speak before this fellow? Most men would think the worst, finding you like this.
#CLARE.
You need not have come - or thought at all.
#GEORGE.
Did you imagine I was going to let you vanish without an effort -
#CLARE.
To save me?
#GEORGE.
For God's sake be just! I've come here to say certain things. If you force me to say them before him - on your head be it! Will you appoint somewhere else?
#CLARE.
No.
#GEORGE.
Why not?
#CLARE.
I know all those "certain things." "You must come back. It is your duty. You have no money. Your friends won't help you. You can't earn your living. You are making a scandal." You might even say for the moment: "Your room shall be respected."
#GEORGE.
Well, it's true and you've no answer.
#CLARE.
Oh! Our life's a lie. It's stupid; it's disgusting. I'm tired of it! Please leave me alone!
#GEORGE.
You rather miss the point, I'm afraid. I didn't come here to tell you what you know perfectly well when you're sane. I came here to say this: Anyone in her senses could see the game your friend here is playing. It wouldn't take a baby in. If you think that a gentleman like that champions a pretty woman for nothing, you make a fairly bad mistake.
#CLARE.
Take care.
#GEORGE.
I don't pretend to be subtle or that kind of thing; but I have ordinary common sense. I don't attempt to be superior to plain facts -
#CLARE.
Facts!
#GEORGE.
Oh! for goodness' sake drop that hifalutin' tone. It doesn't suit you. Look here! If you like to go abroad with one of your young sisters until the autumn, I'll let the flat and go to the Club.
#CLARE.
Put the fire out with a penny hose. I am not coming back to you, George. The farce is over.
#GEORGE.
Then there is something between you and this fellow.
#MALISE.
I beg your pardon!
#CLARE.
There - is - nothing.
#GEORGE.
At all events, I won't - I won't see a woman who once - I won't see her go to certain ruin without lifting a finger.
#CLARE.
That is noble.
#GEORGE.
I don't know that you deserve anything of me. But on my honour, as a gentleman, I came here this morning for your sake, to warn you of what you're doing.
#CLARE.
Will you go, please?
#GEORGE.
I will go when you do. man of the world should know better than that.
#GEORGE.
Are you coming?
#MALISE.
That is inconceivable.
#GEORGE.
I'm not speaking to you, sir.
#MALISE.
You are right. Your words and mine will never kiss each other.
#GEORGE.
Will you come?
#GEORGE.
D'you mean to stay in this pigsty with that rhapsodical swine?
#MALISE.
By God, if you don't go, I'll kill you.
#GEORGE.
That remains to be seen.
#MALISE.
Yes, I will kill you.
#CLARE.
Please.
#CLARE.
Now will you go!
#GEORGE.
You mad little fool! Understand this; if you've not returned home by three o'clock I'll divorce you, and you may roll in the gutter with this high - souled friend of yours. And mind this, you sir - I won't spare you - by God! Your pocket shall suffer. That's the only thing that touches fellows like you.
#CLARE.
Horrible!
#MALISE.
Nothing could be better.
#CLARE.
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do!
#MALISE.
Thank the stars for your good fortune.
#CLARE.
He means to have revenge on you! And it's all my fault.
#MALISE.
Let him. Let him go for his divorce. Get rid of him. Have done with him - somehow.
#CLARE.
If I must bring you harm - let me pay you back! I can't bear it otherwise! Make some use of me, if you don't mind!
#MALISE.
My God!
#MALISE.
You poor -
#MALISE.
No, no! This is not the house of a "gentleman."
#CLARE.
I'm sorry.
#MALISE.
I understand.
#CLARE.
I don't feel. And without - I can't, can't.
#MALISE.
Quite right. You've had enough of that.
#MALISE.
Not going?
#MALISE.
You don't trust me?
#CLARE.
I do! But I can't take when I'm not giving.
#MALISE.
I beg - I beg you! What does it matter? Use me! Get free somehow.
#CLARE.
Mr. Malise, I know what I ought to be to you, if I let you in for all this. I know what you want - or will want. Of course - why not?
#MALISE.
I give you my solemn word -
#CLARE.
No! if I can't be that to you - it's not real. And I can't. It isn't to be manufactured, is it?
#MALISE.
It is not.
#CLARE.
To make use of you in such a way! No.
#MALISE.
Where are you going?
#MALISE.
Not back to him? Thank God! But where? To your people again?
#CLARE.
No.
#MALISE.
Nothing - desperate?
#CLARE.
Oh! no.
#MALISE.
Then what - tell me - come!
#CLARE.
I don't know. Women manage somehow.
#MALISE.
But you - poor dainty thing!
#CLARE.
It's all right! Don't be unhappy! Please!
#MALISE.
D'you imagine they'll let you off, out there - you with your face? Come, trust me trust me! You must!
#CLARE.
Good - bye!
#MALISE.
This great damned world, and - you! Listen! Into that! alone - helpless - without money. The men who work with you; the men you make friends of - d'you think they'll let you be? The men in the streets, staring at you, stopping you - pudgy, bull - necked brutes; devils with hard eyes; senile swine; and the "chivalrous" men, like me, who don't mean you harm, but can't help seeing you're made for love! Or suppose you don't take covert but struggle on in the open. Society! The respectable! The pious! Even those who love you! Will they let you be? Hue and cry! The hunt was joined the moment you broke away! It will never let up! Covert to covert - till they've run you down, and you're back in the cart, and God pity you!
#CLARE.
Well, I'll die running!
#MALISE.
No, no! Let me shelter you! Let me!
#CLARE.
I'm going to seek my fortune. Wish me luck!
#MALISE.
I can't let you go.
#CLARE.
You must.
#MALISE.
Good luck, then! Good luck!
#HAYWOOD.
Sorry to press an old customer, sir, but a year and an 'alf without any return on your money -
#MALISE.
Your tobacco is too good, Mr. Haywood. I wish I could see my way to smoking another.
#HAYWOOD.
Well, sir - that's a funny remedy.
#MALISE.
Yes. What is it?
#BOY.
Your copy for "The Watchfire," please, sir.
#MALISE.
Yes. Wait!
#MALISE.
This is a very fine unexpurgated translation of Boccaccio's "Decameron," Mr. Haywood illustrated. I should say you would get more than the amount of your bill for them.
#HAYWOOD.
Them books worth three pound seven!
#MALISE.
It's scarce, and highly improper. Will you take them in discharge?
#HAYWOOD.
Well, I 'ardly know what to say - No, Sir, I don't think I'd like to 'ave to do with that.
#MALISE.
You could read them first, you know?
#HAYWOOD.
I've got my wife at 'ome.
#MALISE.
You could both read them.
#HAYWOOD.
No, Sir, I couldn't.
#MALISE.
Very well; I'll sell them myself, and you shall have the result.
#HAYWOOD.
Well, thank you, sir. I'm sure I didn't want to trouble you.
#MALISE.
Not at all, Mr. Haywood. It's for me to apologize.
#HAYWOOD.
So long as I give satisfaction.
#MALISE.
Certainly. Good evening.
#HAYWOOD.
Good evenin', sir; no offence, I hope.
#MALISE.
On the contrary.
#MALISE.
Yes, now for you.
#MALISE.
Yes, Mr. Haywood?
#HAYWOOD.
About that little matter, sir. If - if it's any convenience to you - I've - thought of a place where I could -
#MALISE.
Read them? You'll enjoy them thoroughly.
#HAYWOOD.
No, sir, no! Where I can dispose of them.
#MALISE.
It might be as well. I congratulate you, Mr. Haywood; it's a classic.
#HAYWOOD.
Oh, indeed - yes, sir. In the event of there being any -
#MALISE.
Anything over? Carry it to my credit. Your bill - Send me the receipt. Good evening!
#MALISE.
"Man of the world - good form your god! Poor buttoned - up philosopher" "inbred to the point of cretinism, and founded to the bone on fear of ridicule - you are the slave of facts!"
#MALISE.
Who is it?
#HUNTINGDON.
I apologize, sir; can I come in a minute?
#HUNTINGDON.
I don't know if you remember me - Clare Dedmond's brother.
#MALISE.
I remember you.
#HUNTINGDON.
I've come to you, sir, as a gentleman -
#MALISE.
Some mistake. There is one, I believe, on the first floor.
#HUNTINGDON.
It's about my sister.
#MALISE.
D - n you! Don't you know that I've been shadowed these last three months? Ask your detectives for any information you want.
#HUNTINGDON.
We know that you haven't seen her, or even known where she is.
#MALISE.
Indeed! You've found that out? Brilliant!
#HUNTINGDON.
We know it from my sister.
#MALISE.
Oh! So you've tracked her down?
#HUNTINGDON.
Mrs. Fullarton came across her yesterday in one of those big shops - selling gloves.
#MALISE.
Mrs. Fullarton the lady with the husband. Well! you've got her. Clap her back into prison.
#HUNTINGDON.
We have not got her. She left at once, and we don't know where she's gone.
#MALISE.
Bravo!
#HUNTINGDON.
Look here, Mr. Malise, in a way I share your feeling, but I'm fond of my sister, and it's damnable to have to go back to India knowing she must be all adrift, without protection, going through God knows what! Mrs. Fullarton says she's looking awfully pale and down.
#MALISE.
Why do you come to me?
#HUNTINGDON.
We thought -
#MALISE.
Who?
#HUNTINGDON.
My - my father and myself.
#MALISE.
Go on.
#HUNTINGDON.
We thought there was just a chance that, having lost that job, she might come to you again for advice. If she does, it would be really generous of you if you'd put my father in touch with her. He's getting old, and he feels this very much. This is his address.
#MALISE.
Let there be no mistake, sir; I do nothing that will help give her back to her husband. She's out to save her soul alive, and I don't join the hue and cry that's after her. On the contrary - if I had the power. If your father wants to shelter her, that's another matter. But she'd her own ideas about that.
#HUNTINGDON.
Perhaps you don't realize how unfit my sister is for rough and tumble. She's not one of this new sort of woman. She's always been looked after, and had things done for her. Pluck she's got, but that's all, and she's bound to come to grief.
#MALISE.
Very likely - the first birds do. But if she drops half - way it's better than if she'd never flown. Your sister, sir, is trying the wings of her spirit, out of the old slave market. For women as for men, there's more than one kind of dishonour, Captain Huntingdon, and worse things than being dead, as you may know in your profession.
#HUNTINGDON.
Admitted - but -
#MALISE.
We each have our own views as to what they are. But they all come to - death of our spirits, for the sake of our carcases. Anything more?
#HUNTINGDON.
My leave's up. I sail to - morrow. If you do see my sister I trust you to give her my love and say I begged she would see my father.
#MALISE.
If I have the chance - yes.
#MALISE.
Poor fugitive! Where are you running now?
#MALISE.
"Man of the world - product of a material age; incapable of perceiving reality in motions of the spirit; having 'no use,' as you would say, for 'sentimental nonsense'; accustomed to believe yourself the national spine - your position is unassailable. You will remain the idol of the country - arbiter of law, parson in mufti, darling of the playwright and the novelist - God bless you! - while waters lap these shores."
#MALISE.
You're going straight back to "The Watchfire"?
#BOY.
Yes, sir.
#MALISE.
You're a masterpiece. D'you know that?
#BOY.
No, sir.
#MALISE.
Get out, then.
#MALISE.
You!
#CLARE.
Not very glorious, is it?
#MALISE.
Come! Sit down, sit down! Tea's nearly ready.
#CLARE.
Do you think me an awful coward for coming? Would you mind if I smoked?
#MALISE.
So you've lost your job?
#CLARE.
How did you - ?
#MALISE.
Your brother. You only just missed him. They had an idea you'd come. He's sailing to - morrow - he wants you to see your father.
#CLARE.
Is father ill?
#MALISE.
Anxious about you.
#CLARE.
I've written to him every week. They're still hunting me!
#MALISE.
It's all right - all right.
#CLARE.
My nerves have gone funny lately. It's being always on one's guard, and stuffy air, and feeling people look and talk about you, and dislike your being there.
#MALISE.
Yes; that wants pluck.
#CLARE.
I curl up all the time. The only thing I know for certain is, that I shall never go back to him. The more I've hated what I've been doing, the more sure I've been. I might come to anything - but not that.
#MALISE.
Had a very bad time?
#CLARE.
I'm spoilt. It's a curse to be a lady when you have to earn your living. It's not really been so hard, I suppose; I've been selling things, and living about twice as well as most shop girls.
#MALISE.
Were they decent to you?
#CLARE.
Lots of the girls are really nice. But somehow they don't want me, can't help thinking I've got airs or something; and in here I don't want them!
#MALISE.
I know.
#CLARE.
Mrs. Fullarton and I used to belong to a society for helping reduced gentlewomen to get work. I know now what they want: enough money not to work - that's all! Don't think me worse than I am - please! It's working under people; it's having to do it, being driven. I have tried, I've not been altogether a coward, really! But every morning getting there the same time; every day the same stale "dinner," as they call it; every evening the same "Good evening, Miss Clare," "Good evening, Miss Simpson," "Good evening, Miss Hart," "Good evening, Miss Clare." And the same walk home, or the same 'bus; and the same men that you mustn't look at, for fear they'll follow you. Oh! and the feeling - always, always - that there's no sun, or life, or hope, or anything. It was just like being ill, the way I've wanted to ride and dance and get out into the country. Don't think too badly of me - it really is pretty ghastly!
#MALISE.
H'm! Why a shop?
#CLARE.
References. I didn't want to tell more lies than I could help; a married woman on strike can't tell the truth, you know. And I can't typewrite or do shorthand yet. And chorus - I thought - you wouldn't like. What have I - ? Have men been brutes?
#CLARE.
One followed me a lot. He caught hold of my arm one evening. I just took this out and said: "Will you leave me alone, please?" And he did. It was rather nice. And there was one quite decent little man in the shop - I was sorry for him - such a humble little man!
#MALISE.
Poor devil - it's hard not to wish for the moon.
#CLARE.
How have you been? Working very hard?
#MALISE.
As hard as God will let me.
#CLARE.
Have you any typewriting I could do? I could learn, and I've still got a brooch I could sell. Which is the best kind?
#MALISE.
I had a catalogue of them somewhere.
#MALISE.
Can you typewrite where you are?
#CLARE.
I have to find a new room anyway. I'm changing - to be safe. I took my things to Charing Cross - only a bag and one trunk. You don't want me now, I suppose.
#MALISE.
What?
#CLARE.
Because - if you still wanted me - I do - now.
#MALISE.
You mean it? You do? You care - ?
#CLARE.
I've thought of you - so much! But only - if you're sure.
#MALISE.
It's the housekeeper. Give me that ticket; I'll send for your things.
#MALISE.
That lady will stay here, Mrs. Miler. Kindly go with this ticket to the cloak - room at Charing Cross station, and bring back her luggage in a cab. Have you money?
#MRS. MILER.
'Arf a crown. In case you don't know - there's two o' them men about the stairs now.
#MALISE.
You've run her to earth; your job's done. Kennel up, hounds!
#CLARE.
Kenneth, when this is paid, I shall have made two pound seventeen in the three months, and saved you about three pounds. One hundred and seventeen shillings at tenpence a thousand is one hundred and forty thousand words at fourteen hundred words an hour. It's only just over an hour a day. Can't you get me more?
#CLARE.
I'm quite packed. Shall I pack for you? Can't we have more than three days at the sea? You did sleep last night.
#MALISE.
Yes, I slept.
#CLARE.
Bad head? By this time the day after to - morrow the case will be heard and done with. You're not worrying for me? Except for my poor old Dad, I don't care a bit.
#CLARE.
Kenneth, do you understand why he doesn't claim damages, after what he said that day - here? It is true that he doesn't?
#MALISE.
It is not.
#CLARE.
But you told me yourself
#MALISE.
I lied.
#CLARE.
Why?
#MALISE.
No use lying any longer - you'd know it tomorrow.
#CLARE.
How much am I valued at?
#MALISE.
Two thousand. He'll settle it on you. Masterly! By one stroke, destroys his enemy, avenges his "honour," and gilds his name with generosity!
#CLARE.
Will you have to pay?
#MALISE.
Stones yield no blood.
#CLARE.
Can't you borrow?
#MALISE.
I couldn't even get the costs.
#CLARE.
Will they make you bankrupt, then? But that doesn't mean that you won't have your income, does it? What is your income, Kenneth? A hundred and fifty from "The Watchfire," I know. What else?
#MALISE.
Out of five books I have made the sum of forty pounds.
#CLARE.
What else? Tell me.
#MALISE.
Fifty to a hundred pounds a year. Leave me to gnaw my way out, child.
#MALISE.
Full of smoke.
#MRS. MILER.
Put your coat on. It's a bitter wind.
#CLARE.
Where are you going?
#MALISE.
To "The Watchfire."
#MRS. MILER.
You know he's takin' this to make 'im sleep?
#CLARE.
Where was it?
#MRS. MILER.
In the bathroom chest o' drawers, where 'e keeps 'is odds and ends. I was lookin' for 'is garters.
#CLARE.
Give it to me!
#MRS. MILER.
He took it once before. He must get his sleep.
#CLARE.
Give it to me!
#MRS. MILER.
I've 'ad it on my mind a long time to speak to yer. Your comin' 'ere's not done 'im a bit o' good.
#CLARE.
Don't!
#MRS. MILER.
I don't want to, but what with the worry o' this 'ere divorce suit, an' you bein' a lady an' 'im havin' to be so careful of yer, and tryin' to save, not smokin' all day like 'e used, an' not gettin' 'is two bottles of claret regular; an' losin' his sleep, an' takin' that stuff for it; and now this 'ere last business. I've seen 'im sometimes holdin' 'is 'ead as if it was comin' off. I can see yer fond of him; an' I've nothin' against yer you don't trouble me a bit; but I've been with 'im eight years - we're used to each other, and I can't bear to see 'im not 'imself, really I can't.
#CLARE.
This last business - what do you mean by that?
#MRS. MILER.
If 'e a'n't told yer, I don't know that I've any call to.
#CLARE.
Please.
#MRS. MILER.
Well, it's to do with this 'ere "Watchfire." One of the men that sees to the writin' of it 'e's an old friend of Mr. Malise, 'e come 'ere this mornin' when you was out. I was doin' my work in there an' the door open, so I 'earl 'em. Now you've 'ung them curtains, you can't 'elp it.
#CLARE.
Yes?
#MRS. MILER.
It's about your divorce case. This 'ere "Watchfire," ye see, belongs to some fellers that won't 'ave their men gettin' into the papers. So this 'ere friend of Mr. Malise - very nice 'e spoke about it: "If it comes into Court," 'e says, "you'll 'ave to go," 'e says. "These beggars, these dogs, these dogs," 'e says, "they'll 'oof you out," 'e says. An' I could tell by the sound of his voice, 'e meant it - proper upset 'e was. So that's that!
#CLARE.
It's inhuman!
#MRS. MILER.
That's what I thinks; but it don't 'elp, do it? "'Tain't the circulation," 'e says, "it's the principle," 'e says; and then 'e starts in swearin' horrible. 'E's a very nice man. And Mr. Malise, 'e says: "Well, that about does for me!" 'e says.
#CLARE.
Thank you, Mrs. Miler - I'm glad to know.
#MRS. MILER.
Yes; I don't know as I ought to 'ave told you. You see, I don't take notice of Mr. MALISE, but I know 'im very well. 'E's a good 'arted gentleman, very funny, that'll do things to help others, and what's more, keep on doin' 'em, when they hurt 'im; very obstinate 'e is. Now, when you first come 'ere, three months ago, I says to meself: "He'll enjoy this 'ere for a bit, but she's too much of a lady for 'im." What 'e wants about 'im permanent is a woman that thinks an' talks about all them things he talks about. And sometimes I fancy 'e don't want nothin' permanent about 'im at all.
#CLARE.
Don't!
#MRS. MILER.
Gawd knows I don't want to upset ye. You're situated very hard; an' women's got no business to 'urt one another - that's what I thinks.
#CLARE.
Will you go out and do something for me? Take this with the note to that address - it's quite close. He'll give you thirty pounds for it. Please pay these bills and bring me back the receipts, and what's over.
#MRS. MILER.
It's a pretty thing.
#CLARE.
Yes. It was my mother's.
#MRS. MILER.
It's a pity to part with it; ain't you got another?
#CLARE.
Nothing more, Mrs. Miler, not even a wedding ring.
#MRS. MILER.
You make my 'eart ache sometimes.
#MRS. MILER.
There's a lady and gentleman out here. Mrs. Fuller - wants you, not Mr. Malise.
#CLARE.
Mrs. Fullarton? Ask them to come in.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
Clare! My dear! How are you after all this time?
#CLARE.
Yes?
#MRS. FULLARTON.
I brought Mr. Twisden to tell you something. May I stay?
#CLARE.
Yes. Now!
#TWISDEN.
As you're not defending this case, Mrs. Dedmond, there is nobody but yourself for me to apply to.
#CLARE.
Please tell me quickly, what you've come for.
#TWISDEN.
I am instructed by Mr. Dedmond to say that if you will leave your present companion and undertake not to see him again, he will withdraw the suit and settle three hundred a year on you. Don't misunderstand me, please - it is not - it could hardly be, a request that you should go back. Mr. Dedmond is not prepared to receive you again. The proposal - forgive my saying so - remarkably Quixotic - is made to save the scandal to his family and your own. It binds you to nothing but the abandonment of your present companion, with certain conditions of the same nature as to the future. In other words, it assures you a position - so long as you live quietly by yourself.
#CLARE.
I see. Will you please thank Mr. Dedmond, and say that I refuse?
#MRS. FULLARTON.
Clare, Clare! For God's sake don't be desperate.
#TWISDEN.
Mrs. Dedmond, I am bound to put the position to you in its naked brutality. You know there's a claim for damages?
#CLARE.
I have just learnt it.
#TWISDEN.
You realize what the result of this suit must be: You will be left dependent on an undischarged bankrupt. To put it another way, you'll be a stone round the neck of a drowning man.
#CLARE.
You are cowards.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
Clare, Clare! She doesn't mean it; please be patient.
#CLARE.
I do mean it. You ruin him because of me. You get him down, and kick him to intimidate me.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
My dear girl! Mr. Twisden is not personally concerned. How can you?
#CLARE.
If I were dying, and it would save me, I wouldn't take a penny from my husband.
#TWISDEN.
Nothing could be more bitter than those words. Do you really wish me to take them back to him?
#CLARE.
Yes.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
Please leave me alone with her, don't say anything to Mr. Dedmond yet.
#TWISDEN.
Mrs. Dedmond, I told you once that I wished you well. Though you have called me a coward, I still do that. For God's sake, think - before it's too late.
#CLARE.
I'm sorry I called you a coward. It's the whole thing, I meant.
#TWISDEN.
Never mind that. Think!
#MRS. FULLARTON.
My dear sweet thing, don't be cross with met How can I help wanting to see you saved from all this ghastliness?
#CLARE.
Please don't, Dolly! Let me be!
#MRS. FULLARTON.
I must speak, Clare! I do think you're hard on George. It's generous of him to offer to withdraw the suit - considering. You do owe it to us to try and spare your father and your sisters and - and all of us who care for you.
#CLARE.
You say George is generous! If he wanted to be that he'd never have claimed these damages. It's revenge he wants - I heard him here. You think I've done him an injury. So I did - when I married him. I don't know what I shall come to, Dolly, but I shan't fall so low as to take money from him. That's as certain as that I shall die.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
Do you know, Clare, I think it's awful about you! You're too fine, and not fine enough, to put up with things; you're too sensitive to take help, and you're not strong enough to do without it. It's simply tragic. At any rate, you might go home to your people.
#CLARE.
After this!
#MRS. FULLARTON.
To us, then?
#CLARE.
"If I could be the falling bee, and kiss thee all the day!" No, Dolly!
#MRS. FULLARTON.
You can't be - you aren't - happy, here?
#CLARE.
Aren't I?
#MRS. FULLARTON.
Oh! Clare! Save yourself - and all of us!
#CLARE.
You see, I love him.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
You used to say you'd never love; did not want it - would never want it.
#CLARE.
Did I? How funny!
#MRS. FULLARTON.
Oh! my dear! Don't look like that, or you'll make me cry.
#CLARE.
One doesn't always know the future, does one? I love him! I love him!
#MRS. FULLARTON.
If you love him, what will it be like for you, knowing you've ruined him?
#CLARE.
Go away! Go away!
#MRS. FULLARTON.
Love! - you said!
#CLARE.
I must - I will keep him. He's all I've got.
#MRS. FULLARTON.
Can you - can you keep him?
#CLARE.
Go!
#MRS. FULLARTON.
I'm going. But, men are hard to keep, even when you've not been the ruin of them. You know whether the love this man gives you is really love. If not - God help you! Good - bye, my child! If you can -
#CLARE.
Well? "The Watchfire?" You may as well tell me.
#MALISE.
Nothing to tell you, child.
#CLARE.
Then you are to lose that, too? I know about it - never mind how.
#MALISE.
Sanctimonious dogs!
#CLARE.
There are other things to be got, aren't there?
#MALISE.
Thick as blackberries. I just go out and cry, "MALISE, unsuccessful author, too honest journalist, freethinker, co - respondent, bankrupt," and they tumble!
#CLARE.
Kenneth, do you care for me? Am I anything to you but just prettiness?
#MALISE.
Now, now! This isn't the time to brood! Rouse up and fight.
#CLARE.
Yes.
#MALISE.
We're not going to let them down us, are we? Life on sufferance, breath at the pleasure of the enemy! And some day in the fullness of his mercy to be made a present of the right to eat and drink and breathe again. Fine! That's the last groan they get from me.
#CLARE.
Are you going out again? Where?
#MALISE.
Blackberrying! Our train's not till six.
#CLARE.
Give me a kiss!
#MRS. MILER.
I've settled the baker, the milk, the washin' an' the groceries - this 'ere's what's left.
#CLARE.
Take your wages; and give him this when he comes in. I'm going away.
#MRS. MILER.
Without him? When'll you be comin' back?
#CLARE.
I shan't be coming back. I'm leaving Mr. Malise, and shan't see him again. And the suit against us will be withdrawn - the divorce suit - you understand?
#MRS. MILER.
I never meant to say anything to yer.
#CLARE.
It's not you. I can see for myself. Don't make it harder; help me. Get a cab.
#MRS. MILER.
The porter's outside, cleanin' the landin' winder.
#CLARE.
Tell him to come for my trunk. It is packed.
#MRS. MILER.
Come 'ere!
#MRS. MILER.
The lady wants a cab. Wait and carry 'er trunk down.
#MRS. MILER.
Now.
#MRS. MILER.
D'you want this 'ere, too?
#CLARE.
Yes.
#CLARE.
Don't! It's all right. Good - bye!
#MANAGER.
Four shillin' apiece to - night, see?
#ARNAUD.
Yes, Sare.
#LANGUID VOICE.
Awful row they're kickin' up in there, Mr. Varley. fellow with a horn.
#MANAGER.
Gaddesdon Hunt, my lord - always have their supper with us, Derby night. Quiet corner here, my lord. Arnaud!
#ARNAUD.
Nice table, Madame.
#ARNAUD.
Madame is waiting for some one? Then Madame will be veree well here - veree well. I take Madame's cloak?
#LANGUID VOICE.
Waiter!
#ARNAUD.
Milord!
#LANGUID VOICE.
The Roederer.
#ARNAUD.
At once, Milord.
#ARNAUD.
Madame feels the 'eat? You wish something, Madame?
#CLARE.
Must I order?
#ARNAUD.
Non, Madame, it is not necessary. A glass of water. I have not the pleasure of knowing Madame's face.
#CLARE.
No.
#ARNAUD.
Madame will find it veree good 'ere, veree quiet.
#LANGUID VOICE.
Waiter!
#ARNAUD.
Pardon!
#ARNAUD.
It is not rowdy here, Madame, as a rule - not as in some places. To - night a little noise. Madame is fond of flowers? These smell good!
#CLARE.
You are very kind.
#ARNAUD.
Not at all, Madame; a pleasure.
#YOUNG MAN.
How d'you do? Didn't recognize you at first. So sorry - awfully rude of me.
#CLARE.
How d'you do?
#YOUNG MAN.
You - you been down there to - day?
#CLARE.
Where?
#YOUNG MAN.
The Derby. What? Don't you generally go down? May I?
#CLARE.
Yes.
#ARNAUD.
The plovers' eggs veree good to - night, Sare. Veree good, Madame. A peach or two, after. Veree good peaches. The Roederer, Sare - not bad at all. Madame likes it frappe, but not too cold - yes?
#YOUNG MAN.
I say - these are jolly, aren't they? They do you pretty well here.
#CLARE.
Do they?
#YOUNG MAN.
You've never been here? By Jove! I thought I didn't know your face. I mean - not -
#CLARE.
It doesn't matter.
#YOUNG MAN.
Of course, if I - if you were waiting for anybody, or anything - I -
#CLARE.
It's all right, thank you.
#YOUNG MAN.
The wine, quick.
#ARNAUD.
At once, Sare.
#YOUNG MAN.
Don't you ever go racing, then?
#CLARE.
No.
#YOUNG MAN.
I remember awfully well my first day. It was pretty thick - lost every blessed bob, and my watch and chain, playin' three cards on the way home.
#CLARE.
Everything has a beginning, hasn't it?
#YOUNG MAN.
I say - about things having beginnings - did you mean anything?
#YOUNG MAN.
What! D'you mean it's really the first - ?
#YOUNG MAN.
By George! I've often wondered.
#ARNAUD.
Monsieur finds -
#YOUNG MAN.
It's all right.
#YOUNG MAN.
Of course I can see that you're not - I mean, that you're a - a lady. And I say, you know - if you have to - because you're in a hole - I should feel a cad. Let me lend you - ?
#CLARE.
'Le vin est tire, il faut le boire'!
#YOUNG MAN.
Look here! I'm afraid you must feel me rather a brute, you know.
#CLARE.
No, I don't; really.
#YOUNG MAN.
Are you absolute stoney? But you're so awfully well -
#CLARE.
I had the sense to keep them.
#YOUNG MAN.
I say, you know - I wish you'd let me lend you something. I had quite a good day down there.
#CLARE.
I can't take, for nothing.
#YOUNG MAN.
By Jove! I don't know - really, I don't - this makes me feel pretty rotten. I mean, it's your being a lady.
#CLARE.
That's not your fault, is it? You see, I've been beaten all along the line. And I really don't care what happens to me. I really don't; except that I don't take charity. It's lucky for me it's you, and not some - The supper - party is getting still more boisterous, and there comes a long view holloa, and a blast of the horn.
#YOUNG MAN.
But I say, what about your people? You must have people of some sort.
#CLARE.
Oh, yes; I've had people, and a husband, and - everything - And here I am! Queer, isn't it? This is going to my head! Do you mind? I sha'n't sing songs and get up and dance, and I won't cry, I promise you!
#YOUNG MAN.
By George! One simply can't believe in this happening to a lady.
#CLARE.
Have you got sisters? My brother's in India. I sha'n't meet him, anyway.
#YOUNG MAN.
No, but - I say - are you really quite cut off from everybody? Something rather awful must have happened?
#CLARE.
Who are those two?
#YOUNG MAN.
Don't know - not been much about town yet. I'm just back from India myself. You said your brother was there; what's his regiment?
#CLARE.
You're not going to find out my name. I haven't got one - nothing.
#CLARE.
First of June! This day last year I broke covert - I've been running ever since.
#YOUNG MAN.
I don't understand a bit. You - must have had a - a - some one -
#YOUNG MAN.
Anyway it must have been like riding at a pretty stiff fence, for you to come here to - night.
#CLARE.
Yes. What's the other side?
#CLARE.
Not yet please! I'm enjoying this. May I have a cigarette?
#CLARE.
Yes, I'm enjoying it. Had a pretty poor time lately; not enough to eat, sometimes.
#YOUNG MAN.
Not really! How damnable! I say - do have something more substantial. peach?
#CLARE.
Thank you.
#CLARE.
Eat and drink, for tomorrow we - Listen!
#CLARE.
"This day a stag must die." Jolly old song!
#YOUNG MAN.
Rowdy lot! I say - I admire your pluck.
#CLARE.
Haven't kept my end up. Lots of women do! You see: I'm too fine, and not fine enough! My best friend said that. Too fine, and not fine enough. I couldn't be a saint and martyr, and I wouldn't be a soulless doll. Neither one thing nor the other - that's the tragedy.
#YOUNG MAN.
You must have had awful luck!
#CLARE.
I did try. But what's the good - when there's nothing before you? - Do I look ill?
#YOUNG MAN.
No; simply awfully pretty.
#CLARE.
A man once said to me: "As you haven't money, you should never have been pretty!" But, you see, it is some good. If I hadn't been, I couldn't have risked coming here, could I? Don't you think it was rather sporting of me to buy these with the last shilling over from my cab fare?
#YOUNG MAN.
Did you really? D - d sporting!
#CLARE.
It's no use doing things by halves, is it? I'm - in for it - wish me luck! In for it - deep! Down, down, till they're just above water, and then - down, down, down, and - all over! Are you sorry now you came and spoke to me?
#YOUNG MAN.
By Jove, no! It may be caddish, but I'm not.
#CLARE.
Thank God for beauty! I hope I shall die pretty! Do you think I shall do well?
#YOUNG MAN.
I say - don't talk like that!
#CLARE.
I want to know. Do you?
#YOUNG MAN.
Well, then - yes, I do.
#CLARE.
That's splendid. Those poor women in the streets would give their eyes, wouldn't they? - that have to go up and down, up and down! Do you think I - shall -
#YOUNG MAN.
I think you're getting much too excited. You look all - Won't you eat your peach? Do! Have something else, then - some grapes, or something?
#CLARE.
No, thanks.
#YOUNG MAN.
Well, then, what d'you think? It's awfully hot in here, isn't it? Wouldn't it be jollier drivin'? Shall we - shall we make a move?
#CLARE.
Yes.
#YOUNG MAN.
D - n that waiter! Wait half a minute, if you don't mind, while I pay the bill. fiver you don't get her to!
#BLOND ONE.
Done!
#ARNAUD.
Madame! Madame! Bon Dieu!
#LANGUID LORD.
Good God!
#ARNAUD.
The boss. Quick! 'Monsieur, elle a fui! Elle est morte'!
#LANGUID LORD.
What's this? Friend of yours?
#YOUNG MAN.
My God! She was a lady. That's all I know about her. lady!
