#CLARA.
Does your letter contain any sad news, ma?
#MRS. GRANBY.
Not exactly sad news,—but disagreeable, to say the least.
#CINDERELLA.
What is it?
#MRS. GROVENOR.
This is a letter from Aunt Patience Burton. She is coming to make us a visit.
#CINDERELLA.
That is horrible news. I shouldn’t want Ernest to see her—she is so fussy and homely.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
He will, no doubt, feel as we do, that money is of more consequence than a handsome face. Besides, we shan’t be troubled with her long.
#CINDERELLA.
How long do you suppose she will stop here? week or two, I suppose. That is the usual length of her visits.
#CINDERELLA.
Well, I suppose we must try to endure her presence for that length of time—hoping for our final reward.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
If she could only be persuaded into making her will in our favor, I shouldn’t consider the trouble of having her here anything.
#CINDERELLA.
How much is she supposed to be worth?
#MRS. GROVENOR.
About thirty thousand dollars.
#CINDERELLA.
Just think how much more that amount would benefit us than it does her. I dare say she hoards it up like a miser.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
That will be all the better for us.
#CINDERELLA.
Yes, if we get it. But when does the letter say she is coming?
#MRS. GROVENOR.
I did not notice particularly. Let me see. “You may expect me Friday, the twenty - fifth, wind and weather permitting.”
#CINDERELLA.
The twenty - fifth! Why, that’s to - day!
#MRS. GROVENOR.
And there is the bell. I shouldn’t be at all surprised if that were she.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Why, Aunt Patience, how glad I am to see you! Clara and I were just speaking of you.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
Wait a minute, Elviry. There, now we can talk.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
I had no idea you were so deaf, aunt.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
I’m getting old, you know, and can’t expect to keep my faculties like younger people. But where’s Clara?
#MRS. GROVENOR.
This is Clara. Didn’t you recognize her?
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
No, she’s grown so I didn’t know her. How d’ye do, dear?
#CINDERELLA.
How do you do, aunt? I’m glad to see you here.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
Thank ye, child. It’s pleasant to find that old folks aint always forgotten and wished out of the way.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Let me assist you in taking off your bonnet.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
You needn’t speak so loud when I have my trumpet.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Then you can hear without using it?
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
Yes, but not without you speak pretty loud.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
You see, she’s as deaf as can be.
#CINDERELLA.
That’s lucky. We can relieve our minds without her hearing us. Is she going to stay long?
#MRS. GROVENOR.
I don’t know. I will ask her. I hope you are going to make us a long visit.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
I shan’t be able to stop more than a month. But perhaps it won’t be convenient for you to have me with you so long.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
We shall be delighted when you go away. That’s true, isn’t it, Clara?
#CINDERELLA.
Yes, indeed. But do you suppose we can live through the month?
#MRS. GROVENOR.
We must try to, for the sake of the money. Have you been well, lately, aunt?
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
No, I’ve enjoyed dreadful poor health this winter. I’ve been most dead with roomatiz and I haven’t got over it yet.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
It must have been hard to bear.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
Yes, it made me feel as if I ought to make my will, and I think I shall make it as soon as I get home again.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Oh, you have many years yet to live, aunt.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
I can see well enough that I am getting old, and cannot live long, anyway. I get tired out very easy. I think I shall have to ask you to show me to the room I am to occupy, and I will lie down awhile. I aint much used to travelling, and it tires me.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Shan’t I get you a cup of tea, aunt?
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
Oh, no. All I need is a little rest.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
There, I think we have made a good impression. If she only makes a will in our favor, I shall consider the attentions we pay her a good investment.
#CINDERELLA.
But suppose she shouldn’t leave her money to us?
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Oh, don’t let your imagination run in that direction. We must manage to get into her good graces, so that we may become her heirs.
#CINDERELLA.
Well, I will do all I can to bring about so desirable a result.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
Didn’t you hear the bell just now, Clara?
#CINDERELLA.
Yes, I am expecting a friend here to - night. Ah , good - evening, Ernest.
#ERNEST MONTGOMERY.
Good - evening. You were expecting me, I suppose.
#CINDERELLA.
Of course I was. I always remember appointments. But I suppose I must introduce you to my aunt. Aunt Patience, this is Mr. Montgomery.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
I am very glad to see him.
#CINDERELLA.
We shan’t need to take any further notice of her. She’s deaf as an adder, and can’t hear a word without her trumpet unless we scream at her. I believe you never saw her before.
#ERNEST MONTGOMERY.
No.
#CINDERELLA.
She isn’t very handsome, is she?
#ERNEST MONTGOMERY.
Aren’t you afraid she’ll hear you?
#CINDERELLA.
Oh no, she’s too deaf.
#ERNEST MONTGOMERY.
But deaf people generally hear things that are not intended for their ears.
#CINDERELLA.
Well, I’ll run the risk. When we speak to her she seldom hears the first time.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
What was that you said?
#CINDERELLA.
Only that it was so long since you had been here that we should try to make you have a pleasant time.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
Oh, was that it? Thank you, child.
#ERNEST MONTGOMERY.
You got out of that well.
#CINDERELLA.
Trust me for that. When one has a rich aunt, it is the best to keep on the right side of her.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
Did you speak to me, Clara?
#CINDERELLA.
No; I was telling Mr. Montgomery how fond I was of cider.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
I used to like cider when I was a girl; but that was the genuine article, and we used to go to the mill where they made it, and take it through a straw.
#ERNEST MONTGOMERY.
So your aunt is rich?
#CINDERELLA.
Yes; she is said to be worth thirty thousand dollars.
#ERNEST MONTGOMERY.
That’s quite a fortune.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
Yes; deafness is quite a misfortune; but one doesn’t mind it so much when they’re stopping among their own relations.
#CINDERELLA.
Yes, it is quite a fortune, and of course we put up with her oddities for the sake of the money, which will, most of it, come to us.
#ERNEST MONTGOMERY.
She may outlive you.
#CINDERELLA.
That’s what I’m afraid of. It would be just our luck to have her live to be a hundred.
#ERNEST MONTGOMERY.
How old is she now?
#CINDERELLA.
About sixty - five.
#ERNEST MONTGOMERY.
Then you would only have to wait thirty - five years for it.
#CINDERELLA.
We might as well never have her money as to wait so long as that for it.
#ERNEST MONTGOMERY.
It would be rather a long while, that’s a fact. By that time you would look as your aunt does now. Do you know, I think you resemble her very much?
#CINDERELLA.
Take that for your impertinence, sir. I must be a charming damsel, if that were the case.
#ERNEST MONTGOMERY.
So I thought; which was why I made the remark.
#CINDERELLA.
I don’t esteem it any compliment.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
What was that you said, Clara?
#CINDERELLA.
I was saying to Mr. Montgomery that people seldom say what they mean.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
That’s true—that’s true enough. Well, there, I’ve got that stocking pretty well along, and haven’t been knitting a great while, either. Mr. Montgomery, may I trouble you to tell me what time it is?
#ERNEST MONTGOMERY.
It is no trouble, madam, I assure you. It is about five minutes past ten.
#AUNT PRUDENCE.
Five minutes past ten! I had no idea ’twas so late. That’s long past the time I usually go to bed. Good - night, Mr. Montgomery; good - night, Clara.
#CINDERELLA.
Good - night, aunt.
#ERNEST MONTGOMERY.
Good - evening, madam.
#CINDERELLA.
What made you tell her it was so late? It isn’t more than nine o’clock.
#ERNEST MONTGOMERY.
It is just half - past eight. But although I enjoyed her society exceedingly, I was willing to deny myself that pleasure for the sake of having a little private conversation with you on a very important matter.
#CINDERELLA.
Doesn’t it seem a great relief to have Aunt Patience gone?
#MRS. GROVENOR.
I must say that it does. I was constantly anxious for fear she would learn our real feelings, though I flatter myself we concealed them quite carefully.
#CINDERELLA.
I don’t believe she suspected at all that we were glad her visit was over. Deaf people are most always obtuse.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
I hope it may prove so, for her money would be a great help to us. In fact, I don’t see how we can get along without it.
#CINDERELLA.
It would be very convenient if she would let us have an instalment of a few thousands soon—before my marriage, for instance.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Yes, in that case we could afford to send to Paris for your trousseau. But has the time for the wedding been fixed?
#CINDERELLA.
Yes; Ernest wishes it to take place in June.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
I spoke of your marriage as liable to take place soon, and hoped Aunt Patience would take the hint; but she didn’t seem to.
#CINDERELLA.
What reply did she make?
#MRS. GROVENOR.
She said she hadn’t anything special against Mr. Montgomery, but that she would never think of choosing him for a husband.
#CINDERELLA.
Perhaps he reciprocates her feelings. I don’t think it would be a suitable match myself.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Being an interested party, perhaps you are not a suitable judge.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
A letter from Aunt Patience, as I live!
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Yes, ma’am, and there’s a box downstairs, with one end of the old lady’s ear - trumpet sticking out of it.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Very well, you may let it remain there for the present.
#CINDERELLA.
Don’t say Aunt Patience is coming back again. I certainly think I couldn’t survive such an event.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
It is worse than that.
#CINDERELLA.
Worse! I don’t know of anything that could be worse than another visit from Aunt Patience.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Very well—read the letter and satisfy yourself.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
So it seems we are not to have any of Aunt Patience’s money after all.
#CINDERELLA.
It’s a real mean thing for any one to be so deceitful—going round pretending to be deaf. I’m glad she isn’t coming here again. I couldn’t endure the sight of her.
#SERVANT.
Here’s a note that Mr. Montgomery left for you.
#CINDERELLA.
Has he been here?
#SERVANT.
Yes, he came just after the expressman brought the box.
#CINDERELLA.
But why didn’t he stop?
#SERVANT.
He heard you reading the letter, and he said he couldn’t stop but a moment; a message would do just as well as seeing you. So he wrote this note in the drawing - room, and asked me to give it to you.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Why don’t you read your note?
#CINDERELLA.
I am so surprised.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
What does it mean?
#CINDERELLA.
It means that he overheard enough of Aunt Patience’s letter to know that we are not to have any of her property; so he has magnanimously released me from my engagement.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
But what are you going to do about it?
#CINDERELLA.
Do? I don’t know as there is anything to be done. In fact, my present feelings of indifference towards him show that my affections were not involved, and I am well satisfied to have him leave me as he has done. As to Aunt Patience, I guess we can get along without any of her money. I have several accomplishments that can be turned to account if necessity requires it.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
But young ladies who earn their own living are considered strong - minded, and never get married. I couldn’t bear to have you an old maid.
#CINDERELLA.
Well, I don’t know as that would be a terrible fate. It would be a more independent life than marriage would give me. On the whole, I think I shall decide to live a single life. Still, as an old lady of eighty once said: “I’ve made up my mind not to get married, and I don’t expect to; but if the Lord should see fit to send me a good husband, I should try to be resigned.”
