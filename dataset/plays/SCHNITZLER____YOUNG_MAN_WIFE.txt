#YOUNG MAN.
Thank you.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Alfred—Alfred!
#YOUNG MAN.
Come, Madame… Come, Emma…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Let me be for a minute—please … oh, please, please, Alfred!
#YOUNG WIFE.
Where am I?
#YOUNG MAN.
With me.
#YOUNG WIFE.
This house is terrible, Alfred.
#YOUNG MAN.
Why terrible? It is a very proper house.
#YOUNG WIFE.
But I met two gentlemen on the staircase.
#YOUNG MAN.
Acquaintances of yours?
#YOUNG WIFE.
I don’t know. It’s possible.
#YOUNG MAN.
But, Madame—You surely know your friends!
#YOUNG WIFE.
I couldn’t see their faces.
#YOUNG MAN.
But even had they been your best friends—they couldn’t possibly have recognized you… I, myself … if I didn’t know it was you … this veil—
#YOUNG WIFE.
There are two.
#YOUNG MAN.
Won’t you come closer?… And take off your hat, at least?
#YOUNG WIFE.
What are you thinking of, Alfred? I promised you: Five minutes… Not a moment more … I swear it, no more—
#YOUNG MAN.
Well, then, your veil—
#YOUNG WIFE.
There are two of them.
#YOUNG MAN.
Very well, both of them—you will at least let me see your face.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Do you really love me, Alfred?
#YOUNG MAN.
Emma! You ask me…
#YOUNG WIFE.
It’s so warm here.
#YOUNG MAN.
You’re still wearing your fur - coat—really, you will catch cold.
#YOUNG WIFE.
I’m tired—dead tired.
#YOUNG MAN.
Permit me.
#YOUNG WIFE.
What is the matter?
#YOUNG MAN.
You’ve never been so beautiful.
#YOUNG WIFE.
How is that?
#YOUNG MAN.
Alone … alone with you—Emma—
#YOUNG WIFE.
And now … now let me go again. I have done what you asked me to do.
#YOUNG WIFE.
You promised me to be good.
#YOUNG MAN.
Yes.
#YOUNG WIFE.
It is stifling hot in this room.
#YOUNG MAN.
You still have your coat on.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Put it with my hat.
#YOUNG WIFE.
And now—good - by—
#YOUNG MAN.
Emma—! Emma—!
#YOUNG WIFE.
The five minutes are long past.
#YOUNG MAN.
Not one yet!—
#YOUNG WIFE.
Alfred, tell me truly now, how late it is.
#YOUNG MAN.
It is now exactly a quarter past six.
#YOUNG WIFE.
I should have been at my sister’s long ago.
#YOUNG MAN.
You can see your sister any time…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Oh, Merciful Heaven, Alfred, why did you tempt me to come?
#YOUNG MAN.
Because … I adore you, Emma!
#YOUNG WIFE.
To how many have you said the same thing?
#YOUNG MAN.
Since I met you, to no one.
#YOUNG WIFE.
What a foolish woman I am! If anybody had predicted … just a week ago … or even yesterday…
#YOUNG MAN.
But you had already promised me the day before yesterday.
#YOUNG WIFE.
You plagued me so. But I didn’t want to do it. God is my witness—I didn’t want to do it… Yesterday, I was firmly decided… Do you know I even wrote you a long letter last night?
#YOUNG MAN.
I didn’t receive any.
#YOUNG WIFE.
I tore it up later. Oh, if only I had sent it to you.
#YOUNG MAN.
It is better as it is.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Oh, no, it’s awful … of me. I don’t understand myself. Good - by, Alfred, let me go.
#YOUNG WIFE.
So … is that the way you keep your word…
#YOUNG MAN.
One more kiss—one more.
#YOUNG WIFE.
The last.
#YOUNG MAN.
Shall I tell you something, Emma? It is now for the first time that I know what happiness is.
#YOUNG MAN.
… or rather, I know now what happiness might be.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Alfred—Alfred, what are you doing to me!
#YOUNG MAN.
Wasn’t I right?—It isn’t so awfully uncomfortable here… And we are so safe here. It’s a thousand times better than those meetings outdoors…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Oh, don’t remind me of them.
#YOUNG MAN.
I shall always recall them with a thousand delights. Every minute you have let me spend with you is a sweet memory.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Do you remember the ball at the Manufacturers’ Club?
#YOUNG MAN.
Do I remember it…? I sat beside you through the whole supper—quite close to you. Your husband had champagne…
#YOUNG MAN.
I meant to speak only of the champagne. Emma, would you like a glass of cognac?
#YOUNG WIFE.
Only a drop, but first give me a glass of water.
#YOUNG MAN.
Surely… But where is—oh, yes, I remember…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Where have you been?
#YOUNG MAN.
In … the adjoining room.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Now I’m going to ask you something, Alfred—and you must tell me the truth.
#YOUNG MAN.
I swear—
#YOUNG WIFE.
Has there ever been any other woman in these rooms?
#YOUNG MAN.
But, Emma—this house was built twenty years ago!—
#YOUNG WIFE.
You know what I mean, Alfred … in these rooms, with you!
#YOUNG MAN.
With me—here—Emma!—It’s not kind of you even to imagine such a thing.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Then there was … how shall I… But, no, I’d rather not ask. It is better that I shouldn’t ask. It’s my own fault. Every fault has its punishment.
#YOUNG MAN.
But what is wrong? What is the matter with you? What fault?
#YOUNG WIFE.
No, no, no, I mustn’t think… Otherwise I would sink through the floor with shame.
#YOUNG MAN.
Emma, if you only knew how you hurt me.
#YOUNG MAN.
I want to tell you something, Emma. If you’re ashamed of being here—if you don’t care for me—if you don’t feel you are all the happiness in the world for me—then you’d better go.—
#YOUNG WIFE.
Yes, I shall go.
#YOUNG MAN.
But if you feel that I cannot live without you, that a kiss upon your hand means more to me than all the caresses of all the women in the whole world… Emma, I’m not like other young men, who are experienced in love - making—perhaps, I am too naïve … I…
#YOUNG WIFE.
But suppose you were like other young men?
#YOUNG MAN.
Then you wouldn’t be here to - night—because you are not like other women.
#YOUNG WIFE.
How do you know that?
#YOUNG MAN.
I have thought a lot about it. I know you are unhappy.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Yes.
#YOUNG MAN.
Life is so dreary, so empty—and then,—so short—so horribly short! There is only one happiness—to find some one who loves you.—
#YOUNG MAN.
Give me half of it!
#YOUNG WIFE.
What are you doing, Alfred?… Is that the way you keep your promise?
#YOUNG MAN.
Life is so short.
#YOUNG WIFE.
But that’s no reason—
#YOUNG MAN.
Oh, yes.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Alfred, you promised to be good … and then it’s so light…
#YOUNG MAN.
Come, come, you only, only…
#YOUNG WIFE.
What are you doing?
#YOUNG MAN.
It’s not so light in the other room.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Is there another room?
#YOUNG MAN.
A beautiful one … and quite dark.
#YOUNG WIFE.
We’d better stay in here.
#YOUNG WIFE.
You are so… O merciful Heaven, what are you doing with me!—Alfred!
#YOUNG MAN.
I adore you, Emma!
#YOUNG WIFE.
So then wait, wait a little… Go… I’ll call you.
#YOUNG MAN.
Let you help me—let us help you … let … me—help—you.
#YOUNG WIFE.
But you’ll tear everything.
#YOUNG MAN.
You have no corset on?
#YOUNG WIFE.
I never wear a corset. Odilon doesn’t wear any either. But you can unbutton my shoes.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Oh, how cold it is.
#YOUNG MAN.
It’ll be warm in a minute.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Do you think so?
#YOUNG MAN.
She ought not to have said that.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Come, come, come!
#YOUNG MAN.
In a minute, dear—
#YOUNG WIFE.
It smells like violets here.
#YOUNG MAN.
That’s you… Yes you, yourself.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Alfred… Alfred!!!!
#YOUNG MAN.
Emma…
#YOUNG MAN.
Apparently I love you too much … yes… I am as if out of my senses.
#YOUNG WIFE.
… …
#YOUNG MAN.
I have been beside myself all these days. I was afraid of this.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Don’t mind.
#YOUNG MAN.
Oh, certainly not. It’s perfectly natural, if one…
#YOUNG WIFE.
No … don’t… You are nervous. Calm yourself first.
#YOUNG MAN.
Do you know Stendhal?
#YOUNG WIFE.
Stendhal?
#YOUNG MAN.
The “Psychologie de l’amour.”
#YOUNG WIFE.
No. Why do you ask me?
#YOUNG MAN.
There’s a story in that book which is very much to the point.
#YOUNG WIFE.
What kind of a story?
#YOUNG MAN.
There is a gathering of cavalry officers—
#YOUNG WIFE.
Yes.
#YOUNG MAN.
And they are telling each other about their love affairs. And each one of them tells that with the woman he loved best—most passionately, you know … that with him, that then—well, in short, that the same thing happened just as it happened to me now.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Yes.
#YOUNG MAN.
That is very characteristic.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Yes.
#YOUNG MAN.
The story is not yet ended. One of them maintained … that this thing had never in his life happened to him, but, adds Stendhal—he was known as a great boaster.
#YOUNG WIFE.
And.—
#YOUNG MAN.
And, yet, it makes you feel blue—that’s the stupid side of it, even though it’s so unimportant.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Of course. Anyway, you know … you promised me to be good.
#YOUNG MAN.
Sh - h! Don’t laugh. That doesn’t help things any.
#YOUNG WIFE.
But no, I’m not laughing. That story of Stendhal’s is really interesting. I have always thought that only older people … or people who … you know, people who have lived fast…
#YOUNG MAN.
The idea! That has nothing to do with it. By the way, I had completely forgotten the prettiest of Stendhal’s stories. One of the cavalry officers went so far as to say that he stayed for three or even six nights… I don’t remember now—that is he stayed with a woman, whom he wanted for weeks—desirée—you understand—and nothing happened all those nights except that they wept for happiness … both…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Both?
#YOUNG MAN.
Yes. Does that surprise you? It seems very comprehensible—especially when two people love each other.
#YOUNG WIFE.
But surely there are many who don’t weep.
#YOUNG MAN.
Certainly … however, that is an exceptional case.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Oh—I thought Stendhal said that all cavalry officers weep on such an occasion.
#YOUNG MAN.
Look here, now you are laughing at me.
#YOUNG WIFE.
What an idea! Don’t be childish, Alfred.
#YOUNG MAN.
Well, it makes me nervous anyway… Besides I have the feeling that you are thinking about it all the time. That embarrasses me still more.
#YOUNG WIFE.
I’m not thinking of it at all.
#YOUNG MAN.
If I were only sure that you love me.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Do you want still further proofs?
#YOUNG MAN.
Didn’t I tell you … you are always laughing at me.
#YOUNG WIFE.
How so? Come, let me hold your sweet little head.
#YOUNG MAN.
Oh, that feels so good.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Do you love me?
#YOUNG MAN.
Oh, I’m so happy.
#YOUNG WIFE.
But you needn’t cry about it.
#YOUNG MAN.
There! Again! I begged you not to…
#YOUNG WIFE.
To tell you that you shouldn’t cry…
#YOUNG MAN.
You said: “You needn’t cry about it.”
#YOUNG WIFE.
You are nervous, sweetheart.
#YOUNG MAN.
I know.
#YOUNG WIFE.
But you ought not to be. It is beautiful even that … that we are together like good comrades…
#YOUNG MAN.
Now you are beginning again.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Don’t you remember! That was one of our first talks. We wanted to be comrades, nothing more. Oh, how nice that was … at my sister’s ball in January, during the quadrille… For heaven’s sake, I should have gone long ago… My sister expects me—what shall I tell her… Good - by, Alfred—
#YOUNG MAN.
Emma!—You will leave me in this way!
#YOUNG WIFE.
Yes—so!—
#YOUNG MAN.
Five minutes more…
#YOUNG WIFE.
All right. Five minutes more. But you must promise me … not to move?… Yes?… I want to give you a good - by kiss… Psst … be still … don’t move, I told you, otherwise I’ll get up at once, you, my sweetheart, sweet…
#YOUNG MAN.
Emma … my ador… …
#YOUNG WIFE.
My Alfred!
#YOUNG MAN.
Oh, it is heaven to be with you.
#YOUNG WIFE.
But now I’ve really got to go.
#YOUNG MAN.
Oh, let your sister wait.
#YOUNG WIFE.
I must go home. It is much too late to see my sister. How late is it?
#YOUNG MAN.
How should I know?
#YOUNG WIFE.
You might look at your watch.
#YOUNG MAN.
My watch is in my waistcoat.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Get it.
#YOUNG MAN.
Eight o’clock.
#YOUNG WIFE.
For heaven’s sake… Quick, Alfred, give me my stockings. What shall I say? They must be waiting for me at home … eight o’clock…
#YOUNG MAN.
When shall I see you again?
#YOUNG WIFE.
Never.
#YOUNG MAN.
Emma! Don’t you love me any more?
#YOUNG WIFE.
Just for that reason. Give me my shoes.
#YOUNG MAN.
Never again? Here are your shoes.
#YOUNG WIFE.
My button - hook is in my bag. Please, be quick…
#YOUNG MAN.
Here is the button - hook.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Alfred, this may cost us our lives.
#YOUNG MAN.
In what way?
#YOUNG WIFE.
What shall I say, if he asks me where I’ve been?
#YOUNG MAN.
At your sister’s.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Oh, if I only could lie.
#YOUNG MAN.
Well, you’ll have to.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Everything for a man like you. Oh, come here … let me give you a last kiss. —And now—leave me by myself, go in the other room.—I can’t dress, if you are around.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Alfred!
#YOUNG MAN.
Yes, sweetheart.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Isn’t it better that we didn’t weep?
#YOUNG MAN.
How can you talk so frivolously?—
#YOUNG WIFE.
Oh, how difficult it will be now—if we should meet by chance in company?
#YOUNG MAN.
By chance?—sometime?… Surely you are coming to Lobheimer’s to - morrow?
#YOUNG WIFE.
Yes. You too?
#YOUNG MAN.
Of course. May I ask for the cotillion?
#YOUNG WIFE.
Oh, I shall not go. What do you imagine?—I would… sink through the floor.
#YOUNG MAN.
To - morrow at Lobheimer’s. That’s fine.
#YOUNG WIFE.
No, no… I shall decline … certainly decline—
#YOUNG MAN.
Well, the day after to - morrow … here.
#YOUNG WIFE.
The idea!
#YOUNG MAN.
At six…
#YOUNG WIFE.
There are cabs at this corner, aren’t there?
#YOUNG MAN.
Yes, as many as you want. Well, the day after to - morrow, here at six o’clock. Please say “yes,” sweetheart.
#YOUNG WIFE.
… We’ll discuss that to - morrow night during the cotillion.
#YOUNG MAN.
My angel.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Don’t muss my hair again.
#YOUNG MAN.
Well then, to - morrow night at Lobheimer’s, and the day after to - morrow in my arms.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Good - by…
#YOUNG MAN.
And what will you—tell him to - night?—
#YOUNG WIFE.
Don’t ask me … don’t ask me … it’s too terrible.—Why do I love you so?—Good - by—If I meet any one again on the stairway, I shall faint.—Ugh!
#YOUNG MAN.
Now, at last, I have an affair with a respectable woman.
