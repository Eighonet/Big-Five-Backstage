#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh dear, I never thought I should have such a careless child.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Why didn't you think so, mother?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Because I was so very tidy myself when I was a little girl - just like your Cousin Kitty. Oh, why are you not like her!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I do think Kitty is so boring.
#MRS. LEMMY.
My dear child! How wrong to say such a thing of your cousin.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
But, mother, you always say I'm to tell the truth. So as she is boring, I must say so.
#MRS. LEMMY.
It's wrong to be bored by people who are good. Kitty is so tidy, so careful about everything: so unlike you. You're so heedless I can't even send you to the village shop for me.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh, mother do let me go to the shop for you. I'm sure I could.
#MRS. LEMMY.
I do want two pennorth of pepper, but I can't trust you to get it. I'm sure you would lose the pennies.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
No, no. I would hold them tightly in my hand. You see, I haven't a pocket in this frock. That's one reason why I lose things.
#MRS. LEMMY.
That is true, and I have made you a nice little pocket to tie on, in hopes it will make you more careful.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh, mother, what a darling pocket, and what a pretty binding!
#MRS. LEMMY.
Yes, I've just sewn it on.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Do give me the two pennies, and I'll put them into the pocket.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Take care that bow doesn't slip. You've tied it very loosely. Oh, here is your cousin Kitty.
#KITTY.
Good morning, Aunt Jane.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Good morning, my child, and how is my good little girl this morning?
#KITTY.
Very well, thank you, aunt, and I feel very happy, too.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
So do I.
#KITTY.
Ah, but not for the same reason, I fear. I feel happy because I am so very good. I'm so tidy and careful, and I never forget anything.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
How dull that must be!
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, my dear Lucy. Don't say that! Ask Kitty to tell you how she does it, while I go and write my letters.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
No, don't tell me anything about it, Kitty. Look at my new pocket.
#KITTY.
I hope you won't lose it. I never lose anything.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh, then, you do miss a lot of excitement! When I'm going out I have to rush about looking for my things, and it is so thrilling when I see my shoe far back under the bed, or my handkerchief in the coal - scuttle.
#KITTY.
Oh, Lucy, how much better it would be if your shoes were tidily side by side! You shock me. I always put my things where they ought to be, and then I find them again at once.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Well, I wish you wouldn't, then, and put it into my mother's head. She's always wanting me to do the same.
#KITTY.
You must try, Lucy. Try as hard as you can, and perhaps some day you will grow up like me.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I hope I shan't.
#KITTY.
Oh, how distressing! I never make a face.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Now I'm going out to shop for mother.
#KITTY.
Oh, poor girl, how I pity her! What is that I see on the ground over there? Why, I believe this is Lucy's pocket! Dear, dear, how careless of her! What a good thing I was there ready to pick it up. Nothing in it. Ha! there's something. No, it's only the binding round it. Dear, dear, she has lost the money too! I must go and find my aunt and take it to her.
#MRS. LEMMY.
What's that you have, Kitty?
#KITTY.
It's Lucy's pocket.
#MRS. LEMMY.
What! Lucy's pocket, that I made her this morning? What are you doing with it, Kitty?
#KITTY.
I'm sorry to say, Aunt Jane, that Lucy dropped it, and as I happened to be looking round me to see if I could be useful in any way I saw it and picked it up.
#MRS. LEMMY.
And what about the pence that were in it?
#KITTY.
They are not there. I'm very sorry, as I know people ought to be so careful of money. I always am.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I've lost my pocket! I've lost my pocket!
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, you careless girl! you may well cry. Luckily for you, Kitty Fisher found it.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh, Kitty, did you? Oh, I am so glad. Give it to me quickly!
#KITTY.
Don't you think, Aunt Jane, I had better have it? I am so careful of my things.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
No, you shan't. You shan't have my nice pocket.
#MRS. LEMMY.
You are not to fight. That is very wrong.
#KITTY.
Very wrong. I forgot myself, I am afraid.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Where are the pence you had in the pocket, Lucy?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh, mother, it must have come untied when I jumped about. I'm so dreadfully sorry. I shall never be happy again.
#KITTY.
No, of course you can't feel happy as I do.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Mother, do let me try once more; I really will be good.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Are you sure, Lucy? Will you really try?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Yes, yes, I promise. I'll be like a little girl in a book, who changes all of a sudden, and never does it again.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Very well, then, I'll trust you with it once more.
#KITTY.
I'm a little surprised at you, aunt.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
And you'll never tell me I'm to be as good as Kitty?
#MRS. LEMMY.
No, because you will be just as good without my telling you.
#KITTY.
Good - bye then, aunt, I don't care to stay here if I'm of no use in setting an example to Lucy.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I can do without your example, thank you.
#KITTY.
We shall see. But next time Lucy Locket loses her pocket Kitty Fisher will not find it.
