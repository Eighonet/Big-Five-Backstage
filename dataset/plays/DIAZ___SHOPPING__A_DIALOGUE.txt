#CELIA.
O Annie! did your mother give you a cent?
#ANNIE.
Yes. See!
#CELIA.
Want me to go with you to spend it?
#ANNIE.
Yes, come. There’s the shop.
#CELIA.
Will you let me taste?
#ANNIE.
If you won’t taste very big.
#CELIA.
I will only take just a little teenty teenty mite.
#ANNIE.
Here’s the shop.
#CLERK.
Well, my little girls, what will you have?
#CELIA.
She wants to spend her cent.
#CLERK.
That’s right. This is the place.
#ANNIE.
I want a stick of candy.
#CLERK.
Red candy?
#ANNIE.
No, sir. Mamma says white candy is best for little girls.
#CLERK.
Good - morning, Mrs. Highfly.
#MRS. HIGHFLY.
Have you any canary - seeds? I wish to get some for my bird.
#CLERK.
We have all kinds of flower - seeds, ma’am.
#MRS. HIGHFLY.
Those won’t do. Have you nice prunes?
#CLERK.
We don’t keep prunes. We have some very nice squashes, ma’am.
#MRS. HIGHFLY.
What do you ask?
#CLERK.
Six cents a pound.
#MRS. HIGHFLY.
I’ll take half a one. My family is quite small.
#CLERK.
Can’t cut it, ma’am. It sells by wholesale.
#MRS. HIGHFLY.
I’ll try some other store.
#OLD LADY.
Good - morning, sir. I’ve come to town, and I want to buy some sugar - plums for my grandchildren.
#CLERK.
Large or small kind?
#OLD LADY.
Which are the best?
#CLERK.
Large ones are better for large children, and small for the small ones.
#OLD LADY.
Let me see. There’s Sarah Emeline and Polly and Jemima and John Alexander and Hiram,—five. I’ll take five cents’ worth, mixed.
#CLERK.
Yes’m. ’Twill come to just five cents.
#OLD LADY.
Drop them right in here.
#CLERK.
Good - morning, sir. Wish to trade to - day?
#MR. JONES.
I wish to buy some toys for my children.
#CLERK.
How old are your children?
#MR. JONES.
All ages.
#CLERK.
Would you like a whip, sir?
#MR. JONES.
Well, a whip isn’t a very good thing to have in the house.
#CLERK.
Would you buy a ball? These will every one bounce.
#MR. JONES.
No, sir. I’m about tired of setting glass.
#CLERK.
These are warranted not to break windows. But here’s a trumpet. A trumpet is a very pleasing toy.
#MR. JONES.
Don’t show me any thing that will make a noise.
#CLERK.
How would a hoop suit you?
#MR. JONES.
I couldn’t think of spending money for hoops. A barrel - hoop drives just as well.
#CLERK.
Have they got marbles?
#MR. JONES.
Yes, plenty. My Sammy got one in his throat, and came very near being choked.
#CLERK.
Try a jumping - jack.
#MR. JONES.
Oh! they’d soon break the string.
#CLERK.
How would a knife please them?
#MR. JONES.
Well enough. But they’d be sure to lose it, or cut themselves. Jemmy’s got six fingers tied up now.
#CLERK.
Are they supplied with boats?
#MR. JONES.
I never let my children sail boats, for fear of their being drowned.
#CLERK.
How is it about a kite?
#MR. JONES.
Kites are likely to blow away.
#CLERK.
Perhaps you’d like something useful.
#MR. JONES.
My children don’t like useful things.
#CLERK.
Here’s a good hatchet.
#MR. JONES.
They’d hack my fruit - trees. hammer?
#MR. JONES.
Nails would be driven in everywhere.
#CLERK.
Buy a doll for your little girl.
#MR. JONES.
She has a houseful now. silver thimble? pewter one does as well to lose.
#CLERK.
You are a hard customer, sir.
#MR. JONES.
Not at all. Your wares don’t suit me.
#CLERK.
We expect a new lot of toys in soon.
#MR. JONES.
I’ll call again. Good - morning.
#CLERK.
Good - day, sir.
