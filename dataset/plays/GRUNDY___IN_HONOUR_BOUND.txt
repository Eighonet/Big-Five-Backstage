#SIR GEORGE.
Ah, the old story! I need read no more. What's this? Oh - ah! - the letter that came by this morning's post for Philip. A woman's writing. How alike they write! The very double of my niece's hand! Eleven o'clock. What has become of Philip? Ah, there you are!
#PHILIP.
Are you at liberty?
#SIR GEORGE.
Yes, I have done work for to - night. Come in. I am afraid I have neglected you.
#PHILIP.
Not in the least. I stayed upstairs on purpose, knowing you were busy. I have been unpacking.
#SIR GEORGE.
Sit down. You must be tired after your journey.
#PHILIP.
I was tired and hungry, but your cook has kindly seen to that.
#SIR GEORGE.
Lady Carlyon had quite given you up, or she would have stayed in to welcome you.
#PHILIP.
My train was very late.
#SIR GEORGE.
Oh, by - the - bye there is a letter waiting for you.
#PHILIP.
Thanks. Rose's hand.
#SIR GEORGE.
My wife is at the theatre.
#PHILIP.
Oh!
#SIR GEORGE.
We have had another visitor to - day - a niece of mine, who has come from abroad. I promised I would take her to the play, but just as I was leaving chambers some briefs tumbled in, and I thought it might be as well to glance them over; so my wife has taken her.
#PHILIP.
Lady Carlyon is quite well, I hope.
#SIR GEORGE.
Perfectly, thank you.
#PHILIP.
It is two years since I saw her.
#SIR GEORGE.
So it is. We have seen nothing of you lately - you, whom we used to see so much of. Where have you been?
#PHILIP.
Well, all over the world. The day I met you, when you were so kind as to invite me here, was the day of my arrival home.
#SIR GEORGE.
So kind as to invite you! My dear boy, you raised objections enough to my invitation.
#PHILIP.
I was afraid of trespassing on your hospitality.
#SIR GEORGE.
And so you have been round the world?
#PHILIP.
From Dan to Beersheba.
#SIR GEORGE.
And you found all barren?
#PHILIP.
On the contrary, I've had a very jolly time - especially upon the voyage home.
#SIR GEORGE.
You look the better for it.
#PHILIP.
I am a new man.
#SIR GEORGE.
You weren't well when you went away.
#PHILIP.
I was depressed and out of sorts.
#SIR GEORGE.
So I observed.
#PHILIP.
You noticed it?
#SIR GEORGE.
And I remember thinking at the time there was a woman in the case.
#PHILIP.
That is all over now. I am as happy as the sandboy in the saying.
#SIR GEORGE.
Then, there's another woman in the case.
#PHILIP.
My dear Sir George, according to your views, there is a woman in every case.
#SIR GEORGE.
There are some twenty briefs. Open which one of them you please, and somewhere in the folds you'll find a petticoat.
#PHILIP.
What, twenty women hidden in these briefs?
#SIR GEORGE.
At least. There never was a case without a woman in it, and I never leave one till I've found her; for I know well enough until I do I have not mastered it. There is a woman in your case, my friend.
#PHILIP.
To tell the truth, there is. A charming girl I met upon the voyage home.
#SIR GEORGE.
The jolly voyage home!
#PHILIP.
I am in love this time, Sir George.
#SIR GEORGE.
Oh, yes! we always are in love this time.
#PHILIP.
I thought I was before, but I was wrong.
#SIR GEORGE.
Of course! we never were before!
#PHILIP.
And, better still, I am engaged.
#SIR GEORGE.
What, to the charming girl?
#PHILIP.
The only girl in the wide world for me.
#SIR GEORGE.
Well, you've been round it, so you ought to know. I hope you will be happy. It's a toss - up, Philip.
#PHILIP.
I'm afraid your profession makes you cynical.
#SIR GEORGE.
Gad, it would make an angel cynical.
#PHILIP.
No doubt, you meet with some extraordinary cases.
#SIR GEORGE.
Never. All ordinary. To a man who has had twenty years' experience, no possible case can appear extraordinary. There aren't three there of which I didn't know the end before I turned a page. No wonder we don't always read our briefs, for we know most of them by heart.
#PHILIP.
Hallo!
#SIR GEORGE.
What have you found? breach of promise case. This looks amusing.
#SIR GEORGE.
Very amusing for the judge and jury. Very amusing for the public too. Very amusing for the new - made wife to read in all the newspapers her husband's past.
#PHILIP.
Is the defendant married, then?
#SIR GEORGE.
Of course he is. They always are. And of course he was on with the new love before he was off with the old. They always will be. The old love was no better than she need be, and no more was he. Very amusing for the new love, isn't it?
#PHILIP.
Of course the letters will be read in court?
#SIR GEORGE.
And published in the papers. "November, 1877 - your own loving and devoted Harry. November, 1878 - Yours most affectionately, Henry. November, 1879 - Yours truly, Henry Horrocks. ." Oh, it's a most amusing case - for Mrs. Henry Horrocks.
#PHILIP.
Why don't you settle it? You are for the defendant.
#SIR GEORGE.
We've tried, but it's too late. Take warning by my client.
#SIR GEORGE.
You be in time, if you are not too late already.
#PHILIP.
Excuse me, mine was quite a different case. Thank heaven, I have no reason to reproach myself. There was no love, at any rate on my side, in the matter you allude to.
#SIR GEORGE.
And yet you fled the country to avoid the lady.
#PHILIP.
I never said so.
#SIR GEORGE.
No, my boy; you never said that two and two makes four, but it does, doesn't it?
#PHILIP.
No doubt. I felt that my position was -
#SIR GEORGE.
Equivocal.
#PHILIP.
That is the word I wanted.
#SIR GEORGE.
Useful word.
#PHILIP.
And feeling that, I thought the best course was to -
#SIR GEORGE.
Run away.
#PHILIP.
But as for promises of marriage, there was nothing of that sort. In fact, there couldn't be.
#SIR GEORGE.
Because the lady was already -
#PHILIP.
Hang it, Sir George, you're telling me my case!
#SIR GEORGE.
You'll find it in the third brief on your right.
#PHILIP.
"Winter v. Winter and Hockheimer"?
#SIR GEORGE.
That's your case, as far as it has gone.
#PHILIP.
"In the High Court of Justice - Probate and" - But this is a divorce case!
#SIR GEORGE.
Just so.
#PHILIP.
Oh, that's not my case.
#SIR GEORGE.
I said as far as it had gone. Hockheimer ran away. You ran away. But Hockheimer came back again. And I observe that you've come back again.
#PHILIP.
But I'm not Hockheimer!
#SIR GEORGE.
As far as you have gone. Hockheimer was a friend of Winter's -
#PHILIP.
But I'm not! I never saw the man in my life!
#SIR GEORGE.
No, but the other man?
#PHILIP.
What other man?
#SIR GEORGE.
The husband.
#PHILIP.
I didn't say he was my friend!
#SIR GEORGE.
Oh, yes, you did.
#PHILIP.
When did I say so?
#SIR GEORGE.
When you ran away.
#PHILIP.
Spare me, Sir George. You make me feel like a witness under cross - examination. I didn't mean to breathe a word of this, and somehow I have told you everything.
#SIR GEORGE.
Well, you have told me a good deal. Now, will you let me give you my advice?
#PHILIP.
By all means.
#SIR GEORGE.
Keep those women apart.
#PHILIP.
Which women?
#SIR GEORGE.
The charming girl and the neglected wife.
#PHILIP.
I never said she was neglected.
#SIR GEORGE.
But she is, isn't she?
#PHILIP.
Those glasses worry me.
#SIR GEORGE.
I beg your pardon; it's the force of habit. Off with the old love - friend - or what you will - and never let the new one see her. Off with her entirely! That's my advice; and many a hundred guineas have been paid for worse.
#PHILIP.
Oh, they will never meet. I mean to live abroad. The girl I am engaged to is a South Australian. And she has only come to England on a visit. Her parents are both dead, and she came over with a maiden aunt with whom she is now stopping.
#SIR GEORGE.
Where?
#PHILIP.
At Bayswater. In a few weeks she will go back to Melbourne; and then all danger, if there be any, is over.
#SIR GEORGE.
So you have come from Melbourne in the "Kangaroo"?
#PHILIP.
Who told you what boat I came over in?
#SIR GEORGE.
I gathered it from what you said yourself.
#PHILIP.
I won't say a word more, or in two minutes you will guess the lady's name.
#SIR GEORGE.
I have already guessed it.
#PHILIP.
What!
#SIR GEORGE.
Rose Dalrymple.
#PHILIP.
This is inexplicable!
#SIR GEORGE.
Not at all.
#PHILIP.
I have told nobody!
#SIR GEORGE.
You have told me.
#PHILIP.
You know Miss Dalrymple?
#SIR GEORGE.
She is my niece. She is a South Australian. She came to England in the "Kangaroo," and has been stopping with a maiden aunt at Bayswater.
#PHILIP.
Your niece!
#SIR GEORGE.
I am her guardian, since my sister died.
#PHILIP.
Then, she is your wife's -
#SIR GEORGE.
Niece by marriage. They have just come back from the theatre.
#PHILIP.
Oh!
#SIR GEORGE.
I hear them.
#ROSE.
Ah, Uncle George!
#PHILIP.
Rose!
#ROSE.
Philip!
#SIR GEORGE.
Humph. Exit Uncle George.
#ROSE.
How late you are! We've been expecting you all the afternoon.
#PHILIP.
You didn't say that you were coming here!
#ROSE.
No! didn't I tell you I would give you a surprise?
#PHILIP.
When?
#ROSE.
In my letter. Haven't you received it?
#PHILIP.
Yes, but I haven't had time to open it. And when I told you of my invitation here, you didn't tell me that you knew Sir George.
#ROSE.
Because I wanted to surprise you, dear.
#PHILIP.
Well, you have done so most effectually. Tell me, does Lady Carlyon know of our engagement?
#ROSE.
No, not yet. I never saw her till to - day, and I didn't like to be so confidential.
#PHILIP.
Ah!
#ROSE.
You're not angry with me for not having told her?
#PHILIP.
Not at all. We will surprise her.
#ROSE.
Shall we?
#PHILIP.
To - night we will pretend we are strangers.
#ROSE.
But I shall pretend very badly, I am sure.
#PHILIP.
Oh, you can keep a secret. You have shown me that.
#ROSE.
I'll try, at any rate.
#SIR GEORGE.
Now, Miss Dalrymple, if you are at liberty, perhaps you will be kind enough to tell me what has become of my wife.
#ROSE.
She'll be here directly. She is only speaking to the servants.
#LADY CARLYON.
Philip!
#SIR GEORGE.
Ah, here she is! My dear, you don't look well!
#LADY CARLYON.
The theatre was so close.
#SIR GEORGE.
It always makes you ill. But you have not seen Philip.
#LADY CARLYON.
Ah, Mr. Graham! Excuse me for not recognising you.
#SIR GEORGE.
What has turned Philip into Mr. Graham, pray?
#LADY CARLYON.
He has not been to see us for so long.
#PHILIP.
Allow me.
#SIR GEORGE.
No wonder, if you make a stranger of him when he comes.
#LADY CARLYON.
If Philip is a stranger, he has made one of himself.
#PHILIP.
The fault is mine entirely.
#LADY CARLYON.
Thanks.
#SIR GEORGE.
Well, how did you enjoy the play?
#ROSE.
Oh, so much, Uncle George! Although it was in French, I followed every word.
#PHILIP.
It is the French plays you have been to?
#SIR GEORGE.
What was the piece?
#LADY CARLYON.
"Une Chaine," by Eugène Scribe.
#SIR GEORGE.
I don't remember it.
#ROSE.
And it is so exciting. There is a young man in it - such a nice young man, with a moustache - oh, such a sweet moustache!
#SIR GEORGE.
Well?
#ROSE.
He's in love.
#SIR GEORGE.
Of course.
#ROSE.
With a young girl - oh, such a stupid girl! I can't think what he could have seen in her - and she's in love with him.
#SIR GEORGE.
And they get married, I suppose.
#ROSE.
In the last act; but in the meantime there is such a to - do.
#SIR GEORGE.
Why?
#ROSE.
It appears, before the play began, the hero - the young man -
#PHILIP.
With the moustache -
#ROSE.
Had been in love with someone else.
#SIR GEORGE.
Ah!
#ROSE.
But now he doesn't care for her a bit.
#SIR GEORGE.
What is the difficulty, then?
#ROSE.
She cares for him; and though he's trying through the whole four acts, do what he will, he can't get rid of her.
#SIR GEORGE.
I see. That is the chain.
#ROSE.
He nearly breaks it half a dozen times, but something always happens to prevent him. You've no idea how interesting it is - although, of course, it's very, very wrong.
#SIR GEORGE.
Why wrong?
#ROSE.
Well, you see, someone else is married; and of course she oughtn't to care anything about the nice young man.
#SIR GEORGE.
Although he has so lovely a moustache.
#ROSE.
But she does - which is wicked - but it's very interesting.
#SIR GEORGE.
What did you think of it, my dear?
#LADY CARLYON.
It is a painful subject.
#ROSE.
Aunt Bell didn't like it; but she took it all so seriously. If it were real, it would be very sad; but after all what is it but a play? Besides, it all takes place in Paris: nobody pretends that such things happen here.
#LADY CARLYON.
Of course.
#PHILIP.
Of course.
#SIR GEORGE.
Of course.
#ROSE.
I read a notice of the piece this morning, and I quite agreed with it.
#SIR GEORGE.
What did the notice say?
#ROSE.
It said it was "an admirable play, but that an English version of it was impossible."
#SIR GEORGE.
Why so?
#ROSE.
"Because" - how did it put it? - oh, "because these vivid but unwholesome pictures of French life have happily no" - something - I forget exactly what - "to the chaste beauty of our English homes." I can't remember the precise words, but I know the criticism made me long to see the play.
#SIR GEORGE.
Of course it filled the theatre?
#LADY CARLYON.
The house was crowded, and the atmosphere was insupportable.
#SIR GEORGE.
No doubt; if you were bending all night long over those sickly flowers. Give them to me. Why, they are almost withered.
#LADY CARLYON.
They were fresh yesterday.
#SIR GEORGE.
To - days and yesterdays are different things.
#ROSE.
It wasn't the flowers, though. Aunt Bell didn't like the play
#PHILIP.
It isn't everybody who admires French plays.
#SIR GEORGE.
What, were you scandalised? You must know, Philip - you do know, of course - Lady Carlyon is a dragon in her way - the very pink and pattern of propriety. Now, I'll be bound, she didn't like the moral of that comedy.
#LADY CARLYON.
Had it a moral?
#SIR GEORGE.
Certainly! and one men would do well to lay to heart. If that young man -
#ROSE.
The one with the moustache?
#SIR GEORGE.
Had buried his first love when it was dead, he wouldn't have been haunted by its ghost. When passion is burnt out, sweep the hearth clean, and clear away the ash, before you set alight another fire. It is a law of life. Old things give place to new. The loves of yesterday are like these faded flowers, fit only to be cast into the flames. That is the moral: and I call it excellent.
#LADY CARLYON.
He doesn't speak to me. Am I a faded flower?
#ROSE.
Very good, Uncle George. That ought to get the verdict.
#SIR GEORGE.
Let us hope it will.
#ROSE.
If all your speeches are as nice as that, I must come down to court and hear you plead.
#SIR GEORGE.
I shall be proud to have so fair an auditor. But we've not told your aunt the news.
#LADY CARLYON.
What news?
#SIR GEORGE.
Philip informs me, much to my surprise -
#PHILIP.
Sir George! I have considered your advice, and have resolved to act on it. Till I have done so it would perhaps be better -
#SIR GEORGE.
Not to say anything? I will respect your confidence.
#LADY CARLYON.
You have some private matter to discuss. Shall we go?
#SIR GEORGE.
We will go, if you will excuse us.
#LADY CARLYON.
Certainly.
#SIR GEORGE.
Come with me.
#PHILIP.
In case I don't see you again, Miss Dalrymple, good night.
#ROSE.
Good evening, Mr. Graham.
#LADY CARLYON.
What can they have to talk about - those two?
#PHILIP.
Good night.
#LADY CARLYON.
Good night. How glad he is to go!
#ROSE.
Is anything the matter?
#LADY CARLYON.
I beg your pardon, dear. I don't feel very well to - night.
#ROSE.
Sit down and let me talk to you. A chat will cheer you perhaps.
#LADY CARLYON.
I am so glad to have you with me, Rose. I wish I had you always. I am very lonely.
#ROSE.
You have Uncle George!
#LADY CARLYON.
Sir George is always busy, and I do not care to interrupt him.
#ROSE.
But he has some leisure.
#LADY CARLYON.
I never knew him to have any, since I was his wife. It's not his fault. A man in his position has so much to do. When he is not in court, he is in Parliament.
#ROSE.
He is at home to - night.
#LADY CARLYON.
And when he is at home, he is at work.
#ROSE.
Poor lonely aunt! I told you at the theatre how like you were to Madame de Saint Géran in the play.
#LADY CARLYON.
Don't let us talk about that cruel play.
#ROSE.
Why was it cruel?
#LADY CARLYON.
What did it make you think of Madame de Saint Géran?
#ROSE.
Well - I thought she was a very wicked woman. Wasn't she?
#LADY CARLYON.
Perhaps. But if we had been told her history - if we had ever been in her position - we might have sympathised with her. Were you ever in love?
#ROSE.
Yes! I mean no! I can't exactly say.
#LADY CARLYON.
If you had been, you wouldn't hesitate. There is no doubt about it. It is a weird thing. Sometimes it leads to heights, sometimes to depths. I do not say it is an excuse. All I say is, those who have never loved are not entitled to judge those who have. Wait till you are in love yourself, before you judge poor Madame de Saint Géran. And if you ever should be -
#ROSE.
Oh, I shall be!
#LADY CARLYON.
Marry for love, my dear, or not at all.
#ROSE.
What did you marry for?
#LADY CARLYON.
I didn't marry; I was married. Don't ask me any more.
#ROSE.
Poor Aunt Bell! lie down, and let me play to you.
#LADY CARLYON.
Do, dear. I am too tired to talk.
#ROSE.
What shall I play you?
#LADY CARLYON.
Anything you please.
#ROSE.
Aunt! Aunt! She's fast asleep. How pretty she looks! but how pale! I like you, aunt! I never saw you till to - day, but I like you. If I stop I shall wake her. I'll lower the lamp and go. Good night, Aunt Bell! Good night - and pleasant dreams!
#SIR GEORGE.
Yes, they have gone to bed. The lamp has been turned down. Now we can smoke.
#PHILIP.
Don't turn it up, please. This half light is charming.
#SIR GEORGE.
Just as you like, but I can scarcely see you.
#PHILIP.
So much the better. cigar?
#PHILIP.
Thanks.
#SIR GEORGE.
Now we can talk more comfortably. Thanks. As I was saying, Rose being my ward, I am concerned in this affair, and what I just now recommended as a friend, in my position as her guardian I can insist upon.
#PHILIP.
I have already said, Sir George, that I intend to act on your advice.
#SIR GEORGE.
How does the matter stand?
#PHILIP.
Exactly as it stood when I left England. It was a friendship, nothing but a friendship.
#SIR GEORGE.
Friendship?
#PHILIP.
Dangerous, no doubt; that's why I went abroad.
#SIR GEORGE.
Have you communicated with the lady since?
#PHILIP.
Never.
#SIR GEORGE.
Nor she with you? Eh?
#PHILIP.
Once.
#SIR GEORGE.
Ah! Now I understand the case. May I inquire what you propose to do?
#PHILIP.
To see her and to tell her I am going to be married.
#SIR GEORGE.
What does that put an end to?
#PHILIP.
Everything.
#SIR GEORGE.
What, friendship?
#PHILIP.
Well -
#SIR GEORGE.
You said friendship.
#PHILIP.
Yes.
#SIR GEORGE.
Does marriage put an end to friendship? I hope not.
#PHILIP.
Of course it doesn't, but -
#SIR GEORGE.
That friendship must be put an end to. Philip, you are the son of an old comrade, and I believe that, if you start fair, you will make an admirable husband. But you must start fair, or you won't. I don't ask you to bring to me a spotless character - a history without a speck or flaw; all I ask - and on that I insist - is that you shall begin your future life unhampered by the past.
#PHILIP.
What would you have me do?
#SIR GEORGE.
Make your fair friend distinctly understand that all - however little that all may have been - is over.
#PHILIP.
Will that satisfy you?
#SIR GEORGE.
Yes; but I must have proof she understands it.
#PHILIP.
What sort of proof?
#SIR GEORGE.
We lawyers have great faith in black and white. You laymen think it a cumbrous form; but I have seen too many fortunes turn on a forgotten sheet of notepaper, not to appreciate its value.
#PHILIP.
What do you mean?
#SIR GEORGE.
That you must bring to me a letter from your friend - letter from her! mere acknowledgment that all is over. letter!
#SIR GEORGE.
Signed, mind you, signed.
#PHILIP.
Signed!
#SIR GEORGE.
Nothing like a signature.
#PHILIP.
Wouldn't you like it stamped as well, Sir George? penny postage stamp will be enough.
#PHILIP.
That is impossible.
#SIR GEORGE.
It must be got. I feel so strongly that is the right course, because in my own life I have pursued the opposite; and I have paid - nay, I have not yet paid the penalty. I claim to be no better than my kind. When I was married, I too was entangled. I was a rising man - and it was necessary that I should obtain a seat in Parliament. Lady Carlyon's father had much influence in the county which I represent. My marriage was political. I had a charming wife, who did her best to love me, heaven knows; and I might have loved her, if this entanglement from which I could not extricate myself had not been there. But there it was, and with a woman's quickness she discovered it. I know she did, although she never spoke; and with a generosity which I can never repay, she did not add to my embarrassment. What was the sequel? Death cut the knot which I could not unravel. I am free. Now, many a time amongst these dead dry bones I hunger for the love it is too late to win. Still that accursed past stands like a wall betwixt my wife and me. Profit by my experience.
#PHILIP.
No doubt, the course you recommend would be the proper course to take, if it were possible; but in the circumstances it is quite impossible.
#SIR GEORGE.
Difficult, perhaps, but not impossible. Have no false delicacy in a case like this. This lady - I presume, whoever she may be, she is a lady - who is fond of you, for that is evident, but of whose friendship you are weary, must be sacrificed. I pity her, but there is no help for it.
#PHILIP.
None! but a letter is out of the question.
#SIR GEORGE.
Why?
#PHILIP.
How could I ask her - oh, it is impossible!
#SIR GEORGE.
Then, you do feel for her?
#PHILIP.
I can't help pitying her.
#SIR GEORGE.
Perhaps still care for her - a little?
#PHILIP.
Sir George , I give you my assurance as a gentleman, nothing has passed between us but kind words. I never loved her; and when I think of all the trouble she has brought on me - how she has banished me for months abroad - how nearly she has made me a false friend - I hate the very mention of her name!
#LADY CARLYON.
Philip!
#PHILIP.
What's that?
#SIR GEORGE.
My wife! She is asleep. Bell! Isabel!
#LADY CARLYON.
Oh, how you startled me!
#SIR GEORGE.
Nay, how you startled us!
#LADY CARLYON.
How so?
#SIR GEORGE.
By calling out.
#LADY CARLYON.
Forgive me for disturbing you, but I was dreaming.
#SIR GEORGE.
And not a pleasant dream, apparently. Why, you are trembling all over.
#LADY CARLYON.
So I am.
#SIR GEORGE.
And you cried out as though you were in pain.
#LADY CARLYON.
It was in terror. I dreamt that I was walking on the edge of a high cliff.
#SIR GEORGE.
Pshaw!
#LADY CARLYON.
Philip was with me.
#SIR GEORGE.
You had a safe escort.
#LADY CARLYON.
But the path grew so difficult, we had to separate. I followed him; when suddenly he turned and -
#SIR GEORGE.
And what?
#LADY CARLYON.
Flung me over! I shrieked out, "Philip!" - and awoke.
#SIR GEORGE.
That was what startled us.
#LADY CARLYON.
Forgive me. Mr. Graham, for having even dreamt that you could be so little chivalrous.
#SIR GEORGE.
You are not well, my dear. It's time you went upstairs. I'll ring for your maid.
#LADY CARLYON.
She has gone to bed. It doesn't matter. I can go alone.
#SIR GEORGE.
Where is Miss Dalrymple?
#LADY CARLYON.
I'll look for her.
#SIR GEORGE.
Stay where you are. I'll look for her.
#LADY CARLYON.
Well, Philip?
#PHILIP.
Was this really a dream?
#LADY CARLYON.
No.
#PHILIP.
You have overheard my conversation with Sir George?
#LADY CARLYON.
The end of it.
#PHILIP.
And you cried out because -
#LADY CARLYON.
I realised the truth.
#PHILIP.
I didn't weigh my words. Perhaps I over - stated -
#LADY CARLYON.
That will do. You chose a curious confidant!
#PHILIP.
I had no choice. Sir George is so acute; he guessed so much, I had to pass it off by asking him to give me his advice.
#LADY CARLYON.
It was a dangerous expedient. Does he suspect - who -
#PHILIP.
No.
#LADY CARLYON.
Though he is so acute?
#PHILIP.
Those who are gifted with long sight are often blind to what is at their feet.
#LADY CARLYON.
How did you come to talk on such a subject?
#PHILIP.
I had been telling him -
#LADY CARLYON.
Go on.
#PHILIP.
That I am going to be married.
#LADY CARLYON.
Oh. That was your secret?
#PHILIP.
Yes. He guessed the reason why I went abroad, and putting this and that together, he divined there was a difficulty.
#LADY CARLYON.
What is the difficulty?
#PHILIP.
The lady to whom I am engaged is not yet of age, and those who have the care of her insist upon some proof that our acquaintanceship is at an end.
#LADY CARLYON.
They also know -
#PHILIP.
Not who you are!
#LADY CARLYON.
You make too many confidants. What proof do they require? monstrous proof!
#LADY CARLYON.
What?
#PHILIP.
Why, a letter with your signature! It is outrageous!
#LADY CARLYON.
Does Sir George think so?
#PHILIP.
He agrees with them.
#LADY CARLYON.
What does he say you ought to do?
#PHILIP.
To ask for such a letter.
#LADY CARLYON.
Then why don't you?
#PHILIP.
Oh, have some pity on me!
#LADY CARLYON.
That is but fair: for you have pitied me. You shall not ask me for the document you want; but you shall have it.
#PHILIP.
Ah, you don't understand - letter with my signature. I understand.
#PHILIP.
But -
#LADY CARLYON.
I only ask one favour in return.
#PHILIP.
Whatever I can do -
#LADY CARLYON.
Once whilst you were away, I was so foolish as to write to you. Whether or not my note was forwarded, I don't know; but if you received it -
#PHILIP.
I did.
#LADY CARLYON.
Please to return it to me; that is all I ask. Well?
#PHILIP.
I regret -
#LADY CARLYON.
Surely you will do that?
#PHILIP.
I can't.
#LADY CARLYON.
Can't! Why?
#PHILIP.
I have destroyed it.
#LADY CARLYON.
Ah! Sit down a moment whilst I write the letter.
#PHILIP.
It would be to no purpose.
#LADY CARLYON.
Oh, I will make it to the purpose.
#PHILIP.
Ah, if you only understood my situation!
#LADY CARLYON.
Pray sit down.
#PHILIP.
How shall I tell her who it is requires it? Lady Carlyon -
#LADY CARLYON.
In one moment.
#PHILIP.
How am I to say it?
#LADY CARLYON.
There is the letter.
#PHILIP.
It is of no use.
#LADY CARLYON.
It is signed.
#PHILIP.
That is the very reason. How can I show your signature -
#LADY CARLYON.
You have my leave. The guardian is a gentleman, I hope.
#PHILIP.
Undoubtedly.
#LADY CARLYON.
Then he will not betray me.
#PHILIP.
But you don't know -
#LADY CARLYON.
My husband! hush!
#SIR GEORGE.
Rose has gone up stairs, but I've sent word you want her. Are you no better? You're upset to - night.
#PHILIP.
It is my fault, Sir George. I've just been telling your wife of my difficulties.
#SIR GEORGE.
You couldn't have done better. I'm sure she will agree with me, that you should get the signature required. That is the only difficulty in the matter.
#PHILIP.
But it is insurmountable. If I had the signature, how could I use it?
#SIR GEORGE.
Not without permission.
#PHILIP.
No!
#LADY CARLYON.
But you have permission!
#SIR GEORGE.
What?
#LADY CARLYON.
I've said too much.
#SIR GEORGE.
How did you get it? There's no post at this hour.
#PHILIP.
In the letter which you gave to me -
#SIR GEORGE.
Oh - ah!
#PHILIP.
And which I have just opened.
#SIR GEORGE.
The letter in the lady's handwriting.
#PHILIP.
Of her own accord, she releases me -
#SIR GEORGE.
This is a marvellous coincidence.
#PHILIP.
But here the letter is.
#SIR GEORGE.
How alike you women write! I could almost have sworn that envelope was in my niece's hand.
#LADY CARLYON.
How could that be?
#SIR GEORGE.
Why not?
#LADY CARLYON.
Rose write to Philip, whom she doesn't know!
#SIR GEORGE.
Not know?
#LADY CARLYON.
They never saw each other till to - night.
#SIR GEORGE.
You said Philip had told you -
#PHILIP.
All but that.
#SIR GEORGE.
You have not told my wife it's Rose you are engaged to?
#LADY CARLYON.
Rose!
#SIR GEORGE.
You may well look surprised. It seems they met on board the "Kangaroo."
#LADY CARLYON.
He is engaged to Rose?
#PHILIP.
Yes.
#LADY CARLYON.
Then the guardian is -
#SIR GEORGE.
I. Give me the letter. You hesitate.
#PHILIP.
Sir George, you must make some allowances. This letter is addressed to me, and I should not be justified in letting it go out of my possession.
#SIR GEORGE.
How, then, do you propose to satisfy me?
#LADY CARLYON.
Might he not read it?
#SIR GEORGE.
Thank you, my dear, for the suggestion. That will meet the difficulty.
#PHILIP.
Then, I will read it. "I hear you are going to be married. Good - bye, Philip. You need not fear that I shall trouble you again; I have your happiness too much at heart; but if I should, this letter puts me at your mercy. Should the necessity arise, you have my leave to give it to whoever has the right to ask for it. - Yours, for the last time - "
#SIR GEORGE.
Stop. Is the letter signed?
#PHILIP.
In full.
#SIR GEORGE.
Now, give it me.
#PHILIP.
Sir George -
#SIR GEORGE.
The ground is cut from under you. You are expressly authorised to give that letter to whoever has the right to ask for it. I have the right -
#PHILIP.
But you never will exercise it!
#SIR GEORGE.
Now. I have a reason.
#PHILIP.
Lady Carlyon!
#SIR GEORGE.
I accept the arbiter. Lady Carlyon, am I right or wrong?
#LADY CARLYON.
Right.
#SIR GEORGE.
The award's against you.
#LADY CARLYON.
Give him the letter.
#PHILIP.
But -
#SIR GEORGE.
Sir, I demand it! I want it for a very special purpose. The woman who wrote this will never trouble you. If she has done wrong, she has borne her punishment. Therefore, in pity, let us hide her shame.
#ROSE.
You want me, aunt?
#SIR GEORGE.
I want you, Rose. Philip has asked for my consent to your engagement. I give it cordially. He is the son of a good father, and I think he will make you a good husband.
#ROSE.
Uncle George! You haven't kept our secret!
#PHILIP.
No, I couldn't wait.
#SIR GEORGE.
Won't you congratulate them?
#LADY CARLYON.
Yes.
#ROSE.
Aren't you surprised, Aunt Bell?
#LADY CARLYON.
I was, when first I heard. I hope you will be very happy. You, too, Philip.
#ROSE.
Why don't you kiss her, Philip?
#PHILIP.
I'll kiss you instead.
#LADY CARLYON.
What are you thinking of?
#SIR GEORGE.
I was just wondering if that poor woman's love, which had so gone astray, will ever go back to her husband.
#LADY CARLYON.
Yes, if he is as generous as you.
#SIR GEORGE.
How was I generous?
#LADY CARLYON.
In sparing her.
#SIR GEORGE.
I was not generous. I simply paid a debt of honour I have owed too long. If I was generous, was it not you who taught me generosity?
#LADY CARLYON.
George, you have guessed her name!
#SIR GEORGE.
But I shall never mention it.
