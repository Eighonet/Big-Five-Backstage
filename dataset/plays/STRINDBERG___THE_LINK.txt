#THE SHERIFF.
Did you ever see such a lot of people at the summer sessions before?
#THE CONSTABLE.
Not in fifteen years, or since we had the big murder at Alder Lake.
#SHERIFF.
Well, this story here is almost as good as a double parricide. That the Baron and the Baroness are going to separate is scandal enough, but when on top of it the families take to wrangling about properties and estates, then it's easy to see that there's going to be a hot time. The only thing wanting now is that they get to fighting over the child, too, and then King Solomon himself can't tell what's right.
#CONSTABLE.
What is there behind this case anyhow? Some say this and some say that, but the blame ought to rest on somebody?
#SHERIFF.
I don't know about that. Sometimes it is nobody's fault when two quarrel, and then again one alone is to blame for the quarrel of two. Now take my old shrew, for instance, she's running around at home scolding for dear life all by herself when I am away, they tell me. Besides, this is not just a quarrel, but a full - fledged criminal case, and in most such one party is complainant, or the one that has been wronged, and the other is defendant, or the one that has committed the crime. But in this case it is not easy to tell who is guilty, for both parties are at once complainants and defendants.
#CONSTABLE.
Well, well, queer things do happen these days. It's as if the women had gone crazy. My old one has spells when she says that I should bear children also, if there was any justice in things - just as if the Lord didn't know how he made his own creatures. And then I get long rigmaroles about her being human also, just as if I didn't know that before, or had said anything to the contrary; and of her being tired of acting as my servant girl, when, for a fact, I am not much better than her hired man.
#SHERIFF.
So - o. So you have got that kind of plague in your house too. Mine reads a paper she gets at the manor, and then she tells me as something wonderful, one day, that some farmer's lass has turned mason, and the next that an old woman has set upon and beaten her sick husband. I cannot quite get at what's the meaning of it all, but it looks most as if she was mad at me for being a man.
#CONSTABLE.
Mighty queer, that's what it is. Fine weather we're having. The rye is standing as thick as the hairs in a fox fell, and we got over the black frosts without a hitch.
#SHERIFF.
There is nothing of mine growing, and good years are bad for me: no executions and no auctions. Do you know anything about the new judge who is going to hold court to - day?
#CONSTABLE.
Not much, but I understand he's a youngster who has just got his appointment and is going to sit for the first time now -
#SHERIFF.
And they say he is religious. Hm!
#CONSTABLE.
Hm - hm! - They're taking an awful time over the church services this year.
#SHERIFF.
It cannot be long till they're done now, for they have been at it most of an hour.
#CONSTABLE.
He's a wonder at preaching, is the Pastor, once he gets going. Are the parties to put in a personal appearance?
#SHERIFF.
Both of them, so I guess we'll have some scrapping - There, now they're done - Just give the tables a wiping, and I think we are ready to start.
#CONSTABLE.
And there's ink in all the wells?
#BARON.
Then, before we part for a year, we are perfectly agreed on all points. First, no recriminations in court?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Do you think I would care to lay open the intimate details of our common life before a lot of curious peasants?
#BARON.
So much the better! And further: you keep the child during the year of separation, provided it may visit me when I so desire, and provided it is educated in accordance with the principles laid down by me and approved by you?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Exactly!
#BARON.
And out of the income from the estate I give you three thousand crowns during the year of separation?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Agreed.
#BARON.
Then I have nothing more to add, but ask only to bid you good - bye. Why we part is known only to you and me, and for the sake of our son no one else must know it. But for his sake I beg you also: start no fight, lest we be goaded into soiling the names of his parents. It is more than likely, anyhow, that life in its cruelty will make him suffer for our divorce.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
I don't care to fight as long as I may keep my child.
#BARON.
Let us then concentrate our attention on the child's welfare and forget what has happened between us. And remember another thing: if we fight about the child and question each other's fitness to take care of it, the judge may take it away from both of us and put it with some of those religious people who will bring it up in hatred and contempt for its parents.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
That's impossible!
#BARON.
Such, my dear, is the law.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
It is a stupid law.
#BARON.
Maybe, but it holds; and for you no less than for others.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
It is unnatural! And I should never submit to it.
#BARON.
You don't have to, as we have decided to raise no objections against each other. We have never agreed before, but on this one point we are at one, are we not: to part without any kind of hostility? Could the Baroness be permitted to wait in that room over there?
#SHERIFF.
Certainly, walk right in.
#LAWYER.
Look here, my girl: that you have stolen, I don't doubt for a moment; but as your master has no witnesses to it, you are not guilty. But as your master has called you a thief in the presence of two witnesses, he is guilty of slander. And now you are complainant and he defendant. Remember this one thing: the first duty of a criminal is - to deny!
#ALMA JONSSON.
But please, sir, didn't you just say I was no criminal, and master was?
#LAWYER.
You are a criminal because you have committed a theft, but as you have called for a lawyer, it is my unmistakable duty to clear you and convict your master. Therefore, and for the last time: deny! And as to the witnesses, what are they going to testify? Listen: a good witness sticks to the case. Now you must bear in mind that the question is not whether Alma has stolen anything or not, but only whether Alexandersson said that she had stolen. For, mark you, he has no right to prove his assertions, but we have. Why it should be so, the devil only knows! But that's none of your business. Therefore: keep your tongues straight and your fingers on the Bible!
#MILKMAID.
Lord, but I'm that scared, for I don't know what I'm going to say!
#FARM HAND.
You say as I do, and then you won't be lying.
#THE JUDGE.
Permit me to thank you for the sermon, Pastor.
#PASTOR.
Oh, don't mention it, Judge.
#THE JUDGE.
Yes - for, as you know, this is my first court. To tell the truth, I have felt some fear of this career, into which I have been thrown almost against my will. For one thing, the laws are so imperfect, the judicial practices so uncertain, and human nature so full of falsehood and dissimulation, that I have often wondered how a judge could dare to express any definite opinion at all. And to - day you have revived all my old fears.
#PASTOR.
To be conscientious is a duty, of course, but to be sentimental about it won't do. And as everything else on this earth is imperfect, there is no reason why we should expect judges and judgments to be perfect.
#THE JUDGE.
That may be, but it does not prevent me from harbouring a sense of tremendous responsibility, as I have men's fates in my hand, and a word spoken by me may show its effects through generations. I am especially thinking of this separation suit started by the Baron and his wife, and I have to ask you - you who have administered the two prescribed warnings before the Vestry Board - what is your view concerning their mutual relations and relative guilt?
#PASTOR.
In other words, Judge, you would either put me in your own place or base your decision on my testimony. And all I can do is to refer you to the minutes of the board.
#THE JUDGE.
Yes, the minutes - I know them. But it is just what does not appear in the minutes that I need to know.
#PASTOR.
What charges the couple made against each other at the private hearings must be my secret. And besides, how can I know who told the truth and who lied? I have to tell you what I told them: there is no reason why I should believe more in one than in the other.
#THE JUDGE.
But were you not able to form some kind of opinion in the matter during the hearings?
#PASTOR.
When I heard one, I formed one opinion, and another when I was hearing the other. In a word: I have no settled view in this question.
#THE JUDGE.
But I am to express a definite view - I, who know nothing at all.
#PASTOR.
That is the heavy task of the judge, which I could never undertake.
#THE JUDGE.
But there are witnesses to be heard? Evidence to be obtained?
#PASTOR.
No, they are not accusing each other in public. And furthermore: two false witnesses will furnish sufficient proof, and a perjurer will do just as well. Do you think I would base my judgment on servant gossip, on the loose - tongued chatter of envious neighbours, or on the spiteful partisanship of relatives?
#THE JUDGE.
You are a terrible sceptic, Pastor.
#PASTOR.
Well, one gets to be so after sixty, and particularly after having tended souls for forty years. The habit of lying clings like original sin, and I believe that all men lie. As children we lie out of fear; as grown - ups, out of interest, need, instinct for self - preservation; and I have known those who lied out of sheer kindliness. In the present case, and in so far as this married couple is concerned, I fear you will find it very hard to figure out who has told most of the truth, and all I can do is to warn you against being caught in the snares set by preconceived opinions. You were married not long ago yourself, and you are still under the spell of the young woman's witchery. For this reason you may easily become prejudiced in favor of a young and charming lady, who is an unhappy wife and a mother besides. On the other hand, you have also recently become a father, and as such you cannot escape being moved by the impending separation of the father from his child. Beware of sympathy with either side, for sympathy with one is cruelty to the other.
#THE JUDGE.
One thing will make my task more easy at least, and that is their mutual agreement on the principal points.
#PASTOR.
Don't rely too much on that, for it is what they all say. And when they appear in court, the smouldering fire breaks into open flames. In this case a tiny spark will be enough to start a conflagration. Here comes the jury. Well, good - by for a while! I stay, although I shall not be seen.
#THE JUDGE.
With a reminder of the provisions in Chapter Eleven, Sections Five, Six, and Eight, of the Criminal Code, as to the peace and order that must be maintained in Court, I hereby declare the proceedings of the Court opened. Will the newly chosen jury please take the oath.
#JURORS.
I, Alexander Eklund; I, Emmanuel Wickberg; I, Carl Johan Sjöberg; I, Eric Otto Boman; I, Ärenfrid Söderberg; I, Olof Andersson of Wik; I, Carl Peter Andersson of Berga; I, Axel Wallin; I, Anders Eric Ruth; I, Swen Oscar Erlin; I, August Alexander Vass; I, Ludwig Östman; promise and swear by God and His Holy Gospel, that I will and shall, according to my best reason and conscience, judge rightly in all cases, no less for the poor than for the rich, and decide in accordance with the law of God and that of this country, as well as its legal statutes: never tamper with the law or further any wrong, for the sake of either kinship by blood, kinship by marriage, friendship, envy, ill - will, or fear; nor for the sake of bribe or gift or any other cause, under any form whatsoever: and not make him responsible who has no guilt, or set him free who is guilty. Neither before judgment nor afterward, neither to parties in court nor to others, am I to discover such counsel as may be taken by the Court behind closed doors. All this I will and shall faithfully keep as an honest and upright judge, without fell deceit or design - So help God my life and soul!
#THE JUDGE.
Call the case of Alma Jonsson against the farmer Alexandersson.
#LAWYER.
I wish to present my power of attorney for the complainant.
#THE JUDGE.
The servant girl Alma Jonsson has had writ served on her former master, Alexandersson, bringing charges under Chapter Sixteen, Section Eight, of the Criminal Code, providing for imprisonment of not more than six months, or a fine, because Alexandersson has called her a thief without supporting his accusation or making legal charges. What have you to say, Alexandersson?
#ALEXANDERSSON.
I called her a thief because I caught her stealing.
#THE JUDGE.
Have you witnesses to her theft?
#ALEXANDERSSON.
No, as luck would have it, there's no witnesses, for I mostly go about by myself.
#THE JUDGE.
Why did you not make a charge against her?
#ALEXANDERSSON.
Well, I never go to court. And then it isn't the usage among us masters to prosecute household thefts, partly because there are so many of 'em, and partly because we don't like to spoil a servant's whole future.
#THE JUDGE.
Alma Jonsson, what have you to say in answer to this?
#ALMA JONSSON.
Ya - es -
#LAWYER.
You keep quiet! Alma Jonsson, who is not a defendant in this case, but the complainant, asks to have her witnesses heard in order that she may prove the slander uttered against her by Alexandersson.
#THE JUDGE.
As Alexandersson has admitted the slander, I shall ask for no witnesses. On the other hand, it is of importance for me to know whether Alma Jonsson be guilty of the offence mentioned, for if Alexandersson had reasonable grounds for his utterance, this will be held a mitigating circumstance when sentence is passed.
#LAWYER.
I must take exception to the statement made by the Court, for by Chapter Sixteen, Section Thirteen, of the Criminal Code, one charged with slander is denied the right to bring evidence as to the truth of his defamation.
#THE JUDGE.
Parties, witnesses, and spectators will retire so that the Court may consider the case.
#THE JUDGE.
Is Alexandersson an honest and reliable man?
#ALL THE JURORS.
Alexandersson is a reliable man.
#THE JUDGE.
Is Alma Jonsson known as an honest servant?
#ERIC OTTO BOMAN.
I had to discharge Alma Jonsson last year for petty thievery.
#THE JUDGE.
And nevertheless I have now to fine Alexandersson. There is no way out of it. Is he poor? ÖSTMAN. He's behind with his Crown taxes, and his crop failed last year. So I guess the fine will be more than he can carry.
#THE JUDGE.
And yet I can find no reason to postpone the case, as it is a clear one, and Alexandersson has no right to prove anything on his side. Has any one here anything to add or object?
#ALEXANDER EKLUND.
I would just ask leave to make a general reflection. A case like this, where one not only innocent, but offended against, has to take the punishment, while the thief has his so - called honour restored, may easily bring about that people grow less forbearing toward their fellow - men, and that taking cases to court grows more common.
#THE JUDGE.
This is quite possible, but general reflections have no place in the proceedings, and the Court has to make a decision. Consequently my one question to the jury is: can Alexandersson be held guilty under Chapter Sixteen, Section Thirteen, of the Criminal Code?
#ALL THE JURORS.
Yes.
#THE JUDGE.
Call in the parties and the witnesses.
#THE JUDGE.
In the case of Alma Jonsson against the farmer Alexandersson, Alexandersson is sentenced to pay a fine of one hundred crowns for slander.
#ALEXANDERSSON.
But I saw her stealing with my own eyes! - That's what one gets for being kind!
#LAWYER.
What did I tell you! If you only deny, everything is all right. Alexandersson acted like a fool and denied nothing. If I had been his counsel, and he had denied the charge, I should have challenged your witnesses, and there you would have been! - Now we'll go out and settle up this business.
#ALEXANDERSSON.
And perhaps I have now got to give Alma her papers and write down that she has been honest and faithful?
#SHERIFF.
That's none of my concern!
#ALEXANDERSSON.
And for a thing like this I am to lose house and land! Who'd believe it, that justice means honour for the thief and a flogging for him that's robbed! Damn it! - Come and have a cup of coffee with a stick in it afterward, Öman.
#CONSTABLE.
I'll come, but don't make a row.
#ALEXANDERSSON.
Yes, I'll be damned if I don't, even if it should cost me three months!
#CONSTABLE.
Now please don't make a row - don't make a row!
#THE JUDGE.
Call the separation suit of Baron Sprengel and his wife, born Malmberg.
#SHERIFF.
Separation suit of Baron Sprengel and his wife, born Malmberg.
#THE JUDGE.
In the proceedings entered against his wife, Baron Sprengel declares his intention of not continuing the marriage, and requests that, as the warnings of the Vestry Board have proved fruitless, order be issued for a year's separation in bed and board. What objection have you to make to this, Baroness?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
To the separation I make no objection at all; if I can only have my child. That is my condition.
#THE JUDGE.
The law recognises no conditions in a case like this, and it is for the Court to dispose of the child.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Why, that's very peculiar!
#THE JUDGE.
For this reason it is of utmost importance that the Court learn who has caused the dissension leading to this suit. According to appended minutes of the Vestry Board, it appears that the wife has admitted having at times shown a quarrelsome and difficult disposition, while the husband has admitted no fault. Thus, Baroness, you appear to have admitted -
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
That's a lie!
#THE JUDGE.
I find it difficult to believe that the minutes of the Vestry Board, countersigned by the Pastor and eight other trustworthy men, can be inaccurate.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
The report is false!
#THE JUDGE.
Such remarks cannot be made with impunity before this Court.
#BARON.
May I call attention to the fact that I have voluntarily surrendered the child to the Baroness on certain conditions?
#THE JUDGE.
And I have to repeat once more what I said before, namely, that the case will be decided by the Court and not by the parties to it. Therefore: you deny having caused any dissension, Baroness?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Indeed, I do! And it is not the fault of one that two quarrel.
#THE JUDGE.
This is no quarrel, Baroness, but a criminal case; and furthermore, you seem now to be displaying a contentious temperament as well as inconsiderate behaviour.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Then you don't know my husband.
#THE JUDGE.
Will you please explain yourself, for I can base no decision on mere insinuations.
#BARON.
Then I must ask to have the case dismissed, so that I can obtain separation in other ways.
#THE JUDGE.
The case is already before the Court and will have to be carried to its conclusion - Baroness, you maintain then that your husband has caused the estrangement. Can this be proved?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Yes, it can be proved.
#THE JUDGE.
Please do so then, but bear in mind that it is a question of depriving the Baron of his parental rights and also of his rights to the property.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
He has forfeited it many times over, and not the least when he denied me sleep and food.
#BARON.
I feel compelled to state that I have never refused to let the Baroness sleep. I have merely asked her not to sleep in the afternoon, because thereby the house was neglected and the child left without proper care. As to food, I have always left such matters to my wife, and I have only objected to some extravagant entertainments, as the neglected household could not bear such expenses.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
And he has let me lie sick without calling in a physician.
#BARON.
The Baroness would always be taken sick when she could not have her own way, but that kind of ailment did not last long as a rule. After I had brought a specialist from the city, and he had declared it to be nothing but tricks, I did not judge it necessary to call a physician the next time the Baroness was taken sick - because the new pier - glass cost fifty crowns less than originally intended.
#THE JUDGE.
All this is not of such nature that it can be considered when such a serious case has to be decided. There must be some deeper motives.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
It ought to be counted a motive that the father will not permit the mother to bring up her own child.
#BARON.
First of all, the Baroness left the care of the child to a maid, and whenever she tried to assist, things went wrong. Secondly, she tried to bring up the boy as a woman, and not as a man. For instance, she dressed him as a girl until he was four years old; and to this very day, when he is eight years old, he carries his hair long as a girl, is forced to sew and crochet, and plays with dolls; all of which I regard as injurious to the child's normal development into a man. On the other hand, she has amused herself by dressing up the daughters of our tenants as boys, cutting their hair short, and putting them to work on things generally handled by boys. In a word, I took charge of my son's education because I noticed symptoms of mental derangement which before this have led to offences against the Eighteenth Chapter of the Criminal Code.
#THE JUDGE.
And yet you are now willing to leave the child in the hands of the mother?
#BARON.
Yes, for I have never been able to contemplate such a cruelty as to separate mother and child - and also because the mother has promised to mend her ways. And for that matter, I had only promised conditionally, and with the understanding that the law was not to be invoked in the matter. But since we have not been able to keep away from recriminations, I have changed my mind - especially as, from being the complainant, I have been turned into a defendant.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
That's the way this man always keeps his promises.
#BARON.
My promises, like those of other people, have always been conditional, and I have kept them as long as the conditions were observed.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
In the same way he had promised me personal freedom within the marriage.
#BARON.
Naturally with the provision that the laws of decency were kept inviolate; but when all bounds were exceeded, and when ideas of license appeared under the name of freedom, then I regarded my promise as annulled.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
And for this reason he tormented me with the most absurd jealousy, and that is generally enough to make a common life unbearable. He even made himself ridiculous to the extent of being jealous of the doctor.
#BARON.
This alleged jealousy may be reduced to an advice on my part against the employment of a notorious and tattling masseur for an ailment commonly treated by women - unless the Baroness is having in mind the occasion when I showed our steward the door for smoking in my drawing - room and offering cigars to my wife. we have not been able to keep away from scandal - mongering, it is just as well that the whole truth should get out: the Baron has been guilty of adultery. Is not this enough to make him unworthy of bringing up my child alone?
#THE JUDGE.
Can you prove this, Baroness?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Yes, I can, and here are letters that show.
#THE JUDGE.
How long ago did this happen? year ago.
#THE JUDGE.
Of course, the time limit for prosecution has already expired, but the fact itself weighs heavily against the husband and may cause him to lose the child entirely as well as a part of the marriage portion. Do you admit the truth of this charge, Baron?
#BARON.
Yes, with remorse and mortification; but there were circumstances which ought to be held extenuating. I was forced into humiliating celibacy by the calculated coldness of the Baroness, although I, and in all courtesy, asked as a favour, what the law allowed me to demand as a right. I tired of buying her love, she having prostituted our marriage by selling her favours first for power and later for presents and money; and in the end I found myself compelled, with the express consent of the Baroness, to take up an irregular relationship.
#THE JUDGE.
Had you given your consent, Baroness?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
No, that is not true! I demand proofs!
#BARON.
It is true, but I cannot prove it, since the only witness, my wife, denies it.
#THE JUDGE.
What is unproved need not be untrue, but a com - pact of this kind, trespassing upon prevailing laws, must be held a pactum turpe and invalid in itself. Baron, so far everything is against you.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
And as the Baron has confessed his guilt with remorse and shame, I, who have now become complainant instead of defendant, ask that the Court proceed to render a decision, as further details are not needed.
#THE JUDGE.
In my capacity as presiding officer of this Court, I wish to hear what the Baron has to say in justification, or at least in palliation.
#BARON.
I have just admitted the charge of adultery and have advanced as extenuating circumstances, partly that it was the result of pressing need when, after ten years of married life, I suddenly found myself unmarried, and partly that it was done with the consent of the Baroness herself. As I have now come to believe that all this was a trap set to make a case against me, it is my duty, for the sake of my son, to hold back no further -
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Axel!
#BARON.
What caused me to break my marital vows was the faithlessness of the Baroness.
#THE JUDGE.
Baron, can you prove that the Baroness has been faithless to you?
#BARON.
No! For I was concerned about the honour of the family, and I destroyed all proofs that I obtained. But I still venture to believe that, in this matter, the Baroness will stand by the confession she once made to me.
#THE JUDGE.
Baroness, do you admit this offence as preceding and, therefore, probably causing the lapse of the Baron?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
No!
#THE JUDGE.
Are you willing to repeat under oath that you are innocent of this charge?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Yes!
#BARON.
Good heavens! No, she must not do that! No perjury for my sake!
#THE JUDGE.
I ask once more: is the Baroness willing to take the oath?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Yes.
#BARON.
Permit me to suggest that the Baroness just now appears as complainant, and a complaint is not made under oath.
#THE JUDGE.
As you have charged her with a criminal offence, she is defendant. What does the Jury hold?
#EMMANUEL WICKBERG.
As the Baroness is a party to this suit, it seems to me that she can hardly be allowed to testify in her own behalf.
#SWEN OSCAR ERLIN.
It seems to me that if the Baroness is to testify under oath, then the Baron should also be allowed to do so in the same matter, but as oath may not be put against oath, the whole matter remains in the dark.
#AUGUST ALEXANDER VASS.
I should say that it is not a question of testifying under oath here, but of taking an oath on one's own innocence.
#ANDERS ERIC RUTH.
Well, isn't that the question which has to be settled first of all?
#AXEL WALLIN.
But not in the presence of the parties, as the deliberations of the Court are not public.
#CARL JOHAN SJÖBERG.
The right of the jury to express itself is not limited or conditioned by secrecy.
#THE JUDGE.
Out of so many meanings I can get no guidance. But as the guilt of the Baron can be proved, and that of the Baroness still remains unproved, I must demand that the Baroness take oath on her innocence.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
I am ready!
#THE JUDGE.
No, wait a moment! - Baron, if you were granted time, would you be able to produce evidence or witnesses in support of your charge?
#BARON.
This I neither can nor will do, as I am not anxious to see my dishonour made public.
#THE JUDGE.
The proceedings of the Court will be adjourned while I consult with the chairman of the Vestry Board.
#BARON.
You do not shrink from perjuring yourself?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
I shrink from nothing when my child is concerned.
#BARON.
But if I have proofs?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Well, you have not.
#BARON.
The letters were burned, but certified copies of them are still in existence.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
You lie to frighten me!
#BARON.
To show you how deeply I love my child, and to save the mother at least, as I seem to be lost, you - may have the proofs. But don't be ungrateful.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
That you are a liar, I knew before, but that you were scoundrel enough to have the letters copied, that I could never have believed.
#BARON.
That is your thanks! But now both of us are lost.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Yes, let both go down - then there will be an end to the fight -
#BARON.
Is it better for the child to lose both its parents and be left alone in the world?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
That will never occur!
#BARON.
Your absurd conceit, which makes you think yourself above all laws and above other human beings, has lured you into starting this fight, in which there can be only one loser: our son! What were you thinking of when you began this attack, which could not fail to provoke a defence? Not of the child, I am sure. But of revenge, I suppose? Revenge for what? For my discovery of your guilt?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
The child? Were you thinking of the child when you dragged me in the mire before this rabble?
#BARON.
Helen! - Like wild beasts we have clawed each other bloody. We have laid our disgrace open to all these who take pleasure in our ruin, for in this room we have not a single friend. Our child will after this never be able to speak of his parents as respectable people; he will not be able to start life with a recommendation from father and mother; he will see the home shunned, the old parents isolated and despised, and so the time must come when he will flee us!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
What do you want then?
#BARON.
Let us leave the country after selling the property.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
And begin the same squabble all over again! I know what will happen: for a week you will be tame, and then you will abuse me.
#BARON.
Just think - now they are settling our fate in there. You cannot hope for a good word from the Pastor, whom you have just called a liar; and I, who am known to be no Christian, can expect no mercy either. Oh, I wish I were in the woods, so that I could crawl in under some big roots or put my head under a rock - this is more shame than I can bear!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
It is true that the minister hates both of us, and it may happen as you say. Why don't you speak to him?
#BARON.
Of what? Making up?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Of anything you please, if it only be not too late! Oh, if it should be too late! - What can that man Alexandersson want that makes him prowl about us two all the time? I am afraid of that man!
#BARON.
Alexandersson is a nice fellow.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Yes, he is nice to you, but not to me - I have observed those glances before - Go and see the Pastor now; but take my hand first - I am scared!
#BARON.
Of what, dear, of what?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
I don't know - Everything, everybody!
#BARON.
But not of me?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
No, not now! It is as if our clothes had been caught in the mill wheels, and we had been dragged into the machinery. What have we been doing? What have we been doing in our anger? How they will enjoy themselves, all these who are now seeing the Baron and the Baroness stripped naked and flogging each other - Oh, I feel as if I were standing here without a rag to cover me.
#BARON.
Calm yourself, my dear. It is not exactly the proper place to tell you what I have said before: that there is only one friend and one home - but we might start over again! - Well, heaven knows! No, we cannot do it. You have gone too far. It is all over. And this last - yes, let it be the last! And it had to come after all the rest. No, we are enemies for life! And if I let you go away with the child now, then you might marry again - I see that now. And my child might have a step - father; and I should have to watch another man going about with my wife and child - Or I might myself be going about with somebody else's wench hanging on my arm. No! Either you or I! One of us must be struck down! You or I!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
You! For if I let you take the child, you might marry again, and I might have to see another woman taking my place with my own child. The mere thought of it could make me a murderess! A step - mother for my child!
#BARON.
You might have thought of it before! But when you saw me champing at the chain of love that bound me to you, then you believed me incapable of loving anybody but yourself.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Do you think I ever loved you?
#BARON.
Yes, once at least. When I had been faithless to you. Then your love grew sublime. And your pretended scorn made you irresistible. But my error caused you to respect me, too. Whether it was the male or the criminal you admired most, I don't know, but I believe it was both - it must have been both, for you are the most typical woman I have ever met. And now you are already jealous of a new wife whom I have never thought of. What a pity that you became my mate! As my mistress, your victory would have been unchallenged, and your infidelities would only have seemed the bouquet of my new wine.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Yes, your love was always material.
#BARON.
Material as everything spiritual, and spiritual as all that is material! My weakness for you, which gave strength to my feeling, made you believe yourself the stronger, when you were simply coarser, more ill - natured, and more unscrupulous than I.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
You the stronger? You, who never want the same thing two minutes in a stretch! You, who as a rule never know what you want!
#BARON.
Yes, I know perfectly well what I want, but there is room in me for both love and hatred, and while I love you one minute, I hate you the next. And just now I hate you!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Are you now thinking of the child also?
#BARON.
Yes, now and always! And do you know why? Because he is our love that has taken flesh. He is the memory of our beautiful hours, the link that unites our souls, the common ground where we must ever meet without wishing to do so. And that is why we shall never be able to part, even if our separation be declared - Oh, if I could only hate you as I want to!
#THE JUDGE.
Thus I recognize the utter hopelessness of seeking justice or discovering truth. And it seems to me as if the laws were a couple of centuries behind our ideas of right. Did I not have to punish Alexandersson, who was innocent, and exonerate the girl, who was guilty of theft? And as for this separation suit, I know nothing at all about it at this minute, and I cannot take upon my conscience to render a decision.
#PASTOR.
But a decision has to be rendered.
#THE JUDGE.
Not by me! I shall give up my place and choose another profession.
#PASTOR.
Why, such a scandal would only bring you notoriety and close every career to you. Keep on judging a few years, and you will come to think it quite easy to crush human fates like egg shells. And for that matter, if you want to stand clear of this case, let yourself be outvoted by the jury. Then they must take the responsibility on themselves.
#THE JUDGE.
That is a way - and I suspect that they will be practically at one against me, for I have formed an opinion in this matter, which, however, is wholly intuitive and, therefore, not to be trusted - I thank you for your advice.
#SHERIFF.
In my capacity of public prosecutor, I have to report the farmer Alexandersson as a witness against Baroness Sprengel.
#THE JUDGE.
In relation to the adultery charge?
#SHERIFF.
Yes.
#THE JUDGE.
Here is a new clue that may lead to a solution.
#PASTOR.
Oh, there are lots of clues, if you can only get hold of them.
#THE JUDGE.
But nevertheless it is horrible to see two persons who have loved trying to ruin each other. It is like being in a slaughter - house!
#PASTOR.
Well, that is love, Judge!
#THE JUDGE.
What then is hatred?
#PASTOR.
It is the lining of the coat.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Help us, Pastor! Help us!
#PASTOR.
I cannot, and as a clergyman, I must not. And furthermore, did I not warn you not to play with such serious matters? You thought it so simple to part! Well, part then! The law will not prevent you, so don't put the blame on it.
#THE JUDGE.
The Court will now resume its proceedings. According to the report of the public prosecutor, Sheriff Wiberg, a new witness has appeared against the Baroness and is ready to affirm her guilt under the charge of adultery. Farmer Alexandersson!
#ALEXANDERSSON.
I am here.
#THE JUDGE.
How can you prove your assertion?
#ALEXANDERSSON.
I saw the offence committed.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
He is lying! Let him bring proof!
#ALEXANDERSSON.
Proof? I'm a witness now, ain't I?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Your assertion is no proof, although you happen to be called a witness for the moment.
#ALEXANDERSSON.
Maybe the witness has to have two more witnesses, and those still others?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Yes, it might be needed when one cannot tell whether the whole lot are lying or not.
#BARON.
The testimony of Alexandersson will not be required. I beg leave to offer the Court all the correspondence by which the marital infidelity of the Baroness stands completely proved - Here are the originals; copies of them will be found in the possession of defendant.
#THE JUDGE.
And yet, Baroness, you were willing to take the oath a little while ago?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
But I didn't take it! And now I think the Baron and I may cry quits.
#THE JUDGE.
We do not let one crime cancel another. The account of each one has to be settled separately.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Then I want to file a claim at once against the Baron for my dowry which he has squandered.
#THE JUDGE.
If you have squandered your wife's dowry, Baron, it might be well to settle that matter right here.
#BARON.
The Baroness brought with her six thousand crowns in stock that was then unsalable and soon became wholly worthless. As at the time of our marriage she held a position as a telegrapher and declared herself unwilling to take support from her husband, we made a marriage contract and agreed that each one should be self - supporting. But she lost her position after the marriage, and I have been supporting her ever since. To this I had no objection whatever, but as she is now putting in bills, I shall ask leave to present one of my own to meet hers. It totals up to thirty - five thousand crowns, this being one - third of the household expenses since the beginning of our marriage, and I being willing to take two - thirds upon myself.
#THE JUDGE.
Have you this agreement in black and white, Baron?
#BARON.
I have not.
#THE JUDGE.
Have you any documents to prove the disposition of your dowry, Baroness?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
I didn't think at the time it would be necessary to get anything in writing, as I supposed myself to be dealing with honourable people.
#THE JUDGE.
Then this whole question cannot come under consideration here. The jury will please step into the small court - room for discussion of the case and formulation of a decision.
#ALEXANDERSSON.
This here justice is more than I can get any sense out of.
#SHERIFF.
I think it would be wiser for you to go right home now, or you might have the same experience as the farmer from Mariestad. Did you ever hear of it?
#ALEXANDERSSON.
No.
#SHERIFF.
Well, he went to court as spectator, was dragged into the case as witness, became a party to it, and ended up with a flogging at the whipping - post.
#ALEXANDERSSON.
Oh, hell! But I believe it of 'em! I believe anything of 'em!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
You find it hard to keep away from me.
#BARON.
Now I have struck you down, and I am bleeding to death myself, for your blood is mine -
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
And how clever you are at making out bills!
#BARON.
Only when it comes to counter - claims! Your courage is that of despair, or that of a person sentenced to death. And when you leave here, you will collapse. Then you will no longer be able to load your sorrow and guilt on me, and you will be suffering from remorse. Do you know why I have not killed you?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Because you did not dare!
#BARON.
No! Not even the thought of hell could have held me back - for I don't believe in it. But this was the thought that did it: even if you get the child, you will be gone in five years. That is what the doctor tells me. And then the child might be left without either father or mother. Think of it - all alone in the world!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Five years! - It is a lie!
#BARON.
In five years! And then I am left behind with the child whether you want it or not.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Oh no! For then my family will bring suit to get the child away from you. I don't die when I die!
#BARON.
Evil never dies! That is so! But can you explain why you grudge me the child, and grudge the child me, whom it needs? Is it sheer malice - a craving for revenge that punishes the child? Do you know, I remarked to the Pastor that I thought possibly you might have some doubts concerning the child's parentage, and that this might be a reason why you would not let me have the child, lest my happiness be built on a false foundation. And he replied: No, I don't think her capable of it - not of such a fine motive - I don't think you know yourself what makes you so fanatical about this one thing: it is the yearning for continued existence that goads you into maintaining your hold. Our son has your body, but my soul, and that soul you cannot rid him of. In him you will have me back when you least expect it; in him you will find my thoughts, my tastes, my passions, and for this reason you will hate him one day, as you hate me now. That is what I fear!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
You seem still a little afraid that he may become mine?
#BARON.
In your quality of mother and woman, you have a certain advantage over me with our judges, and although justice may throw dice blindfolded, there is always a little lead on one side of each die.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
You know how to pay compliments even in the moment of separation. Perhaps you don't hate me as much as you pretend?
#BARON.
Frankly speaking, I think that I hate not so much you as my dishonour, though you, too, come in for a share. And why this hatred? Perhaps I have overlooked that you are near the forties, and that a masculine element is making its appearance in you. Perhaps it is this element that I notice in your kisses, in your embraces - perhaps that is what I find so repulsive?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Perhaps. For the sorrow of my life has been, as you well know, that I was not born a man.
#BARON.
Perhaps that became the sorrow of my life! And now you try to avenge yourself on nature for having played with you, and so you want to bring up your son as a woman. Will you promise me one thing?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Will you promise me one thing?
#BARON.
What is the use of promising?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
No, let us give no more promises.
#BARON.
Will you answer a question truthfully?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
If I told the truth, you would think I lied.
#BARON.
Yes, so I should!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Can you see now that all is over, for ever?
#BARON.
For ever! It was for ever that we once swore to love each other.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
It is too bad that such oaths must be taken!
#BARON.
Why so? It is always a bond, such as it is.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
I never could bear with bonds!
#BARON.
Do you think it would have been better for us not to bind ourselves?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Better for me, yes.
#BARON.
I wonder. For then you could not have bound me.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Nor you me.
#BARON.
And so the result would have been the same - as when you reduce fractions. Consequently: not the law's fault; not our own; not anybody else's. And yet we have to assume the responsibility! So! Now the verdict has been pronounced - Good - bye, Helen!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Good - bye - Axel!
#BARON.
It is hard to part! And impossible to live together. But the fight is over at least!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
If it were! I fear it is just about to begin.
#SHERIFF.
The parties will retire while the Court takes action.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Axel, a word before it is too late! After all, they might take the child away from both of us. Drive home and take the boy to your mother, and then we will flee from here, far away!
#BARON.
I think you are trying to fool me again.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
No, I am not. I am no longer thinking of you, or of myself, or of my revenge. Save the child only! Listen, Axel - you must do it!
#BARON.
I will. But if you are deceiving me - Never mind: I'll do it!
#THE JUDGE.
As we now have the case complete before us, I shall ask each juror separately to state his opinion before decision is rendered. Personally, I can only hold it reasonable that the child be given to the mother, as both parties are equally to blame for the estrangement, and as the mother must be held better adapted to the care of the child than the father.
#ALEXANDER EKLUND.
According to prevailing law, it is the wife who takes her rank and condition from the husband, not the husband from the wife.
#EMMANUEL WICKBERG.
And the husband is the proper guardian of his wife.
#CARL JOHAN SJÖBERG.
The ritual, which gives binding force to the marriage, says that the wife should obey her husband, and so it is clear to me that the man takes precedence of the woman.
#ERIC OTTO BOMAN.
And the children are to be brought up in the faith of the father. ÄRENFRID SÖDERBERG. From which may be concluded that children follow the father and not the mother.
#OLOF ANDERSSON OF WIK.
But as in the case before us both man and wife are equally guilty, and, judging by what has come to light, equally unfit to rear a child, I hold that the child should be taken away from both.
#CARL PETER ANDERSSON OF BERGA.
In concurring with Olof Andersson, I may call to mind that in such cases the Court names two good men as guardians to take charge of children and property, so that out of the latter man and wife may have their support together with the child.
#AXEL WALLIN.
And for guardians I wish in this case to propose Alexander Eklund and Ärenfrid Söderberg, both of whom are well known to be of honest character and Christian disposition.
#ANDERS ERIC RUTH.
I concur with Olof Andersson of Wik as to the separation of the child from both father and mother, and with Axel Wallin as to the guardians, whose Christian disposition makes them particularly fitted to bring up the child.
#SWEN OSCAR ERLING.
I concur in what has just been said.
#AUGUST ALEXANDER VASS.
I concur. ÖSTMAN. I concur. the opinion expressed by a majority of the jurors is contrary to my own, I must ask the Jury to take a vote on the matter. And I think it proper first to put the motion made by Olof Andersson for the separation of the child from both father and mother, and for the appointment of guardians. Is it the unanimous will of the Jury that such action be taken?
#ALL THE JURORS.
Yes.
#THE JUDGE.
If anybody objects to the motion, he will hold up his hand. The opinion of the Jury has won out against my own, and I shall enter an exception on the minutes against what seems to me the needless cruelty of the decision - The couple will then be sentenced to a year's separation of bed and board, at the risk of imprisonment if, during that period, they should seek each other. Call in the parties.
#THE JUDGE.
Is Baron Sprengel not present?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
The Baron will be here in a moment.
#THE JUDGE.
Whoever does not observe the time, has only himself to blame. This is the decision of the County Court: that husband and wife be sentenced to a year's separation of bed and board, and that the child be taken from the parents and placed in charge of two guardians for education. For this purpose the Court has selected and appointed the jurors Alexander Eklund and Ärenfrid Söderberg.
#BARON.
Your Honor! I heard the sentence of the Court from the outside, and I wish to enter a challenge, first against the Jury as a whole, it being made up of my personal enemies, and secondly against the guardians, Alexander Eklund and Ärenfrid Söderberg, neither of whom possesses the financial status demanded of guardians. Furthermore, I shall enter proceedings against the judge for incompetence displayed in the exercise of his office, in so far as he has failed to recognise that the primary guilt of one led to the subsequent guilt of the other, so that both cannot be held equally responsible.
#THE JUDGE.
Whosoever be not satisfied with the decision rendered may appeal to the higher court within the term set by law. Will the Jury please accompany me on house visitation to the Rectory in connection with the suit pending against the communal assessors?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Where is Emil?
#BARON.
He was gone!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
That's a lie!
#BARON.
Yes - I did not bring him to my mother, whom I cannot trust, but to the Rectory.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
To the minister!
#BARON.
Your one reliable enemy! Yes. Who was there else that I might trust? And I did it because a while ago I caught a glance in your eye which made me think that you possibly might kill yourself and the child.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
You saw that! - Oh, why did I let myself be fooled into believing you.
#BARON.
Well, what do you say of all this?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
I don't know. But I am so tired that I no longer feel the blows. It seems almost a relief to have received the final stab.
#BARON.
You give no thought to what is now going to happen: how your son is going to be brought up by two peasants, whose ignorance and rude habits will kill the child by slow torture; how he is going to be forced down into their narrow sphere; how his intelligence is going to be smothered by religious superstition; how he is going to be taught contempt for his father and mother -
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Hush! Don't say another word, or I shall lose my reason! My Emil in the hands of peasant women, who don't know enough to wash themselves, who have their beds full of vermin, and who cannot even keep a comb clean! My Emil! No, it is impossible!
#BARON.
It is the actual reality, and you have nobody but yourself to blame for it.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Myself? But did I make myself? Did I put evil tendencies, hatred, and wild passions into myself? No! And who was it that denied me the power and will to combat all those things? - When I look at myself this moment, I feel that I am to be pitied. Am I not?
#BARON.
Yes, you are! Both of us are to be pitied. We tried to avoid the rocks that beset marriage by living unmarried as husband and wife; but nevertheless we quarrelled, and we were sacrificing one of life's greatest joys, the respect of our fellow - men - and so we were married. But we must needs steal a march on the social body and its laws. We wanted no religious ceremony, but instead we wriggled into a civil marriage. We did not want to depend on each other - we were to have no common pocket - book and to insist on no personal ownership of each other - and with that we fell right back into the old rut again. Without wedding ceremony, but with a marriage contract! And then it went to pieces. I forgave your faithlessness, and for the child's sake we lived together in voluntary separation - and freedom! But I grew tired of introducing my friend's mistress as my wife - and so we had to get a divorce. Can you guess - do you know against whom we have been fighting? You call him God, but I call him nature. And that was the master who egged us on to hate each other, just as he is egging people on to love each other. And now we are condemned to keep on tearing each other as long as a spark of life remains. New proceedings in the higher court, reopening of the case, report by the Vestry Board, opinion from the Diocesan Chapter, decision by the Supreme Court. Then comes my complaint to the Attorney - General, my application for a guardian, your objections and counter - suits: from pillory to post! Without hope of a merciful executioner! Neglect of the property, financial ruin, scamped education for the child! And why do we not put an end to these two miserable lives? Because the child stays our hands! You cry, but I cannot! Not even when my thought runs ahead to the night that is waiting for me in a home laid waste! And you, poor Helen, who must go back to your mother! That mother whom you once left with such eagerness in order to get a home of your own. To become her daughter once more - and perhaps find it worse than being a wife! One year! Two years! Many years! How many more do you think we can bear to suffer?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
I shall never go back to my mother. Never! I shall go out on the high - roads and into the woods so that I may find a hiding - place where I can scream - scream myself tired against God, who has put this infernal love into the world as a torment for us human creatures - and when night comes, I shall seek shelter in the Pastor's barn, so that I may sleep near my child.
#BARON.
You hope to sleep to - night - you?
