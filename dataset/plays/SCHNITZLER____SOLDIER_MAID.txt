#MAID.
Now tell me why you wanted to leave.
#MAID.
It was so beautiful and I so love to dance.
#MAID.
But we aren’t dancing now. Why do you hold me so tight?
#SOLDIER.
What’s your name? Katy?
#MAID.
You’ve always got a “Katy” on your mind.
#SOLDIER.
I know—I know … Marie.
#MAID.
Goodness, it’s dark here. I’m afraid.
#SOLDIER.
You needn’t be afraid when I’m with you. I can take care of myself!
#MAID.
But where are we going? There’s no one around. Come, let’s go back!… It’s so dark!
#SOLDIER.
There … it’s already getting brighter. Ha—! Oh, you dearie!
#MAID.
Oh! what are you doing there? If I had known this before!
#SOLDIER.
The devil take me, if any one at the dance to - day felt softer and rounder than you, Miss Marie.
#MAID.
Did you find it out in the same way with all the others?
#SOLDIER.
You notice things … dancing. You find out lots that way!
#MAID.
But you danced much oftener with that cross - eyed blonde than with me.
#SOLDIER.
She’s an old friend of one of my pals.
#MAID.
Of the corporal with the upturned mustache?
#SOLDIER.
Oh no, I mean the civilian. You know, the one who was talking with me at the table in the beginning. The one who has such a husky voice.
#MAID.
Oh I know. He’s fresh.
#SOLDIER.
Did he do anything to you? I’ll show him! What did he do to you?
#MAID.
Oh nothing… I only noticed how he was with the others.
#SOLDIER.
Tell me, Miss Marie…
#MAID.
You’ll burn me with your cigar.
#SOLDIER.
Pardon me!—Miss Marie—or may I say Marie?
#MAID.
We’re not such good friends yet…
#SOLDIER.
There’re many who don’t like each - other, and yet use first names.
#MAID.
Next time, if we… But, Frank!
#SOLDIER.
Oh, you remember my name?
#MAID.
But, Frank…
#SOLDIER.
That’s right, call me Frank, Miss Marie.
#MAID.
Don’t be so fresh—but, sh - h, suppose some one should come!
#SOLDIER.
What if some one did come? They couldn’t see anything two steps off.
#MAID.
For goodness’ sake, where are we going?
#SOLDIER.
Look! There’s two just like us.
#MAID.
Where? I don’t see anything.
#SOLDIER.
There … just ahead of us.
#MAID.
Why do you say: “two like us”—
#SOLDIER.
Well, I mean, they like each other too.
#MAID.
Look out! What’s that there? I nearly fell.
#SOLDIER.
Oh, that’s the meadow - gate.
#MAID.
Don’t shove me so. I’ll fall.
#SOLDIER.
Sh - h, not so loud.
#MAID.
Stop! Now I’m really going to scream—What are you doing?… Stop now—
#SOLDIER.
There’s no one anywhere around.
#MAID.
Then, let’s go back where the people are.
#SOLDIER.
We don’t need them. Why—Marie, we need … for that…
#MAID.
Stop, Frank, please, for Heaven’s sake! Listen to me, if I had … known … oh … come!
#SOLDIER.
Once more… Oh…
#MAID.
… I can’t see your face at all.
#SOLDIER.
Don’t matter—my face…
#SOLDIER.
Well, Miss Marie, you can’t stay here on the grass all night.
#MAID.
Please, Frank, help me.
#SOLDIER.
Oh, come along.
#MAID.
Oh, Lord help me, Frank.
#SOLDIER.
Well, what’s the matter with me?
#MAID.
You’re a bad man, Frank.
#SOLDIER.
Yes, yes. Say, wait a minute.
#MAID.
Why do you leave me alone?
#SOLDIER.
Can’t you let me light my cigar!
#MAID.
It’s so dark.
#SOLDIER.
It’ll be light again to - morrow morning.
#MAID.
Tell me, at least, you love me.
#SOLDIER.
Well, you must have felt that, Miss Marie!
#MAID.
Where are we going now?
#SOLDIER.
Back, of course.
#MAID.
Please, don’t walk so fast.
#SOLDIER.
Well, what’s wrong? I don’t like to walk around in the dark.
#MAID.
Tell me, Frank … do you love me?
#SOLDIER.
But I just told you that I loved you!
#MAID.
Won’t you give me a little kiss?
#SOLDIER.
There… Listen—There’s the music again.
#MAID.
Would you really like to go back, and dance again?
#SOLDIER.
Of course, why not?
#MAID.
But, Frank, see, I have to get home. Madame will scold me anyway,—she’s cranky … she’d like it best if I never went out.
#SOLDIER.
Well, you can go home.
#MAID.
But, I thought, Frank, you’d take me home.
#SOLDIER.
Take you home? Oh!
#MAID.
Please, it’s so sad to go home alone.
#SOLDIER.
Where do you live?
#MAID.
Not very far—in Porzellanstrasse.
#SOLDIER.
So? Then we go the same way … but it’s still too early for me … me for the dance… I’ve got late leave to - day… I don’t need to be back at the barracks before twelve o’clock. I’m going to dance.
#MAID.
Oh, I see, now it’s that cross - eyed blonde’s turn.
#SOLDIER.
Humph!—Her face isn’t so bad.
#MAID.
Oh Lord, how wicked men are. I’m sure you do the same to every one.
#SOLDIER.
That’d be too much!—
#MAID.
Please, Frank, no more to - day—stay with me to - day, you see—
#SOLDIER.
Oh, very well, all right. But I suppose I may dance.
#MAID.
I’m not going to dance with any one else to - night.
#SOLDIER.
There it is already…
#MAID.
What?
#SOLDIER.
The hall! How quick we got back. They’re still playing the same thing … that tatata - tum tatata - tum … Well, I’ll take you home, if you want to wait for me … if not … good - by—
#MAID.
Yes, I’ll wait.
#SOLDIER.
Say, Miss Marie, get yourself a glass of beer. Miss, may I ask for a dance?—
