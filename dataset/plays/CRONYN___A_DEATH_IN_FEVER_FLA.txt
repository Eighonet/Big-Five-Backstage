#A JOLLY SOUL.
Pitch into her, boys! Tune up your gullets! "She was born in old Kentucky" -
#ANOTHER SUCH.
Aw, shet up, that's moldy! Giv's that Tennessee warble, Hank!
#VOICE OF HANK.
"When your heart was mine, true love, And your head lay on my breast, That the sun rose up in the west - "
#A VOICE.
Y'oughter go courtin' with that throat o' yourn, Hank.
#MACE.
Aw, women -
#VOICES.
Stage's come! Stage's come!
#STAGE DRIVER.
Uh! perty lumpy bags - come in, folks, come in! Seems like you might be carryin' all your b'longings.
#STAGE DRIVER.
Come in and set, lady; don't be skeered. Looks a little spooky, but Hank'll have a glim fer ye in two shakes. Here, I know you're plumb tuckered. Make y'self t'home. 'S fer 's yer able.
#THE MAN.
I thought the stage went through to Hollow Eye to - night?
#STAGE DRIVER.
Well, sir, she do, but this time she don't. I've been havin' to run ten miles on low already and I jest don't dast take her across that thirty miles of sand the way she is. She'll drink water like a thusty hoss and like as not lay down and die on us half way out. Then where'd we be? No sir; you folks'll just have to camp here at Fever Flat till I kin do a tinkerin' job to - morrow mornin'. So I'll step into the Bar and tell Hank you're here. Hank'll do the best he kin fer ye. He's a squ'ar man. Good - night to ye!
#THE MAN.
Good - night. What a hole! Like somebody died here and they'd gone off and left it all stand just the way it was. Them hills gits my goat. They're nothin' but blitherin skeletons, and this bunch of shacks they call Fever Flat looks like no more'n a damn bone yard to me. Ugh! it's cold in here. Feel like I was sittin' on my own grave's edge.
#THE WOMAN.
You didn't use to be so pernickety, when you was punchin' on the range, Lon.
#LON.
And you didn't use to look like a hag, neither, Padie.
#PADIE.
Drink's poisoning your tongue, too.
#LON.
Who's drinking? Cain't I take a thimbleful now'n then without all this jawin'?
#PADIE.
You ain't takin' thimblefuls. You're just soakin' it up. You'll be gettin' snakes if you keep on. 'n then, what'll I do? Not that I care so much what you do with yourself - or what becomes of me. Nothing matters.
#LON.
There you go, actin' abused. How 'bout my rights 'n pleasures? Ain't got none, I s'pose.
#PADIE.
Oh, shut up, you make me sick.
#HANK.
Howdyedo, folks! Howdye do! Well, this is a kinda rough lay - out fer you - all. Y'see the Stage is due here at five, and stops fer grub, then makes Hollow Eye by about nine, but here 'tis ... half an hour of midnight an' I s'pose you ain't et, yet, eh?
#PADIE.
Thanks. We've had sandwiches, but maybe my husband'd like something.
#LON.
Wet.
#LON.
Padie! Sit down! Are you gittin' plumb loco drivin' out so late in autymobiles? You kinda flustered us, mister, cause you have a little the look a friend of ourn that died suddint. Mournful case. Pardner o'mine. No, you're not much like. He was tall, heavy - built and lighter complected. Must a been consid'ble older, too.
#PADIE.
No.
#LON.
Older, I say. My wife's kinda wrought up by this here little spell of travelin'.
#HANK.
Oh, you're not used to it, eh?
#PADIE.
We've been at it - years.
#LON.
That is, off'n on, m'dear. Only off'n on.
#PADIE.
All the time.
#HANK.
Should think you might hanker after yer own nest, lady.
#PADIE.
Well, just keep your thoughts!
#HANK.
Yes, ma'am. Your room is just at the top of the landin'. I'll make ye a light.
#LON.
You're always tryin' to belittle me in public. Is that any way fer a wife to act? I wanta know.
#PADIE.
What do you always lie so fer?
#LON.
That's my business. I'll do as I damn please. And don't you go too fer, crossin' me. I won't stand it. Some day I'll up, an -
#PADIE.
Beat me. That's all that's left to you, wife - beater.
#HANK.
Excuse me, m'am. Have you your own towels by you? Ourn is pretty scaly. It's been so long since we've had in women folks, at least, ladies.
#PADIE.
Thanks, we have some.
#LON.
You might as well be decent, Padie. You ain't got none other but me.
#PADIE.
Yes, you've took me from 'em. We've been trapsin and trapsin till I'm plumb sick. Yes, I'm -
#HANK.
Stidy, stidy. There's the ladder, m'am. Can't I fetch you somethin'? Toddy?
#HANK.
Women folks is cur'us, cur'us.
#LON.
Take my advice and keep free from 'em.
#HANK.
It was a woman did fer my brother.
#LON.
Oh, you've got a brother, eh?
#HANK.
Had.
#LON.
Where is he?
#HANK.
Down at Laguna Madre, Arizony.
#LON.
Ranchin'?
#HANK.
Buried.
#LON.
How - what were you saying - about a woman? woman done fer him. That's what they said, I don't know. I didn't git there fer a long time. There was a mix - up.
#LON.
Well, well. That's strange.
#HANK.
I s'pose you heard of it? It was in all the papers. It even got as fer as Denver.
#LON.
No, I don't remember. But I've read of similar cases.
#HANK.
You've been to Arizony, I s'pose.
#LON.
No, not quite. I've been all around them parts, but never Arizony.
#HANK.
'Tain't what you'd call a perty country, but it's mighty satisfyin'. Too blame cold up here.
#LON.
Why don't you move?
#HANK.
I'm agoin' to, but you see my brother had half interest in this here tavern and there was some litigation about it. Case's just finished. I been here three years, ever since he went. But I'm pullin' my stakes, you bet. I wouldn't be buried here! Would you?
#LON.
I'd rather not.
#HANK.
So she took me fer a friend that'd croaked, eh? That's cur'us.
#LON.
Eh? What's that? Who?
#HANK.
Your wife.
#LON.
Oh, yes. Well, he was a good ten years older. And dark - complected.
#HANK.
Thought you said he was light.
#LON.
Mebbe I did. Well, he mought have been a trifle lighten'n you, but then, size him up by the average, he was dark. Let's fergit him. Bring us a bottle of your best - and see that the glass is clean.
#HANK.
To be sure.
#HANK.
There's many a girl can go all round about And hear the small birds sing. And many a girl that stays at home alone, And rocks the cradle and spins.
#HANK.
There's many a star shall jangle in the west; There's many a leaf below. There's many a damn that will light upon the man For treating a poor girl so.
#HANK.
Here, mister, I was just comin'.
#LON.
What the devil's the matter with your doors?
#HANK.
Them? Oh, the lock's no good. When the wind's southwest they fly right open. Got to be wedged with a shingle.
#LON.
H'm. Well, that's all right.
#HANK.
Now it's blame cur'us the way old places gits. You'll hear these floor boards creak at times like as if som'un was sneakin' over 'em b'ar - foot. Feller told me onct it was made by contrapshun and temper'ture. Mebbe so, but I reckon there's more goes on around than we give credit fer.
#LON.
You mean - spirits?
#HANK.
Well, I dunno as you'd call 'em that. But it's a fact, there's more liquor goes over the Bar than gits paid for. 'Tain't stole either. It just goes.... As old Pete Gunderson used to say, "I'm a hell of a th'usty p'uson, and when I croak I'll be a hell of a th'usty spirit." I sometimes wonder -
#PADIE.
Lon, please fetch some water.
#LON.
I don't dast go out in the night. I've caught a kind of chill from to - day's drive.
#HANK.
I'll fetch it you, m'am.
#PADIE.
Ain't you comin' up soon, Lon?
#LON.
Scarcely no resemblance whatever.
#PADIE.
You lie!
#PADIE.
You'll be seein' things, Lon, if you keep it up.
#LON.
Mind your business. Wish to hell I had a newspaper.
#PADIE.
Is it the light in your eyes, mister?
#HANK.
It's you, ma'am, are blinding them.
#PADIE.
You'd better reach it to me. Maybe the landing'll not hold the two of us.
#HANK.
It'll hold two that have such light hearts as we.
#PADIE.
Ah, you don't know mine, mister.
#HANK.
There, the clumsy mut I am! Spillt the cold water on your pretty bare toes!
#PADIE.
I've most smothered you!
#HANK.
I wouldn't want a sweeter death.
#PADIE.
Indeed, you're the picture of - an old lover of mine.
#HANK.
I'd rather be the picture of the new.
#PADIE.
You've been very kind to a wanderer - from Arizony. Don't spoil it. Good - night!
#HANK.
Good - night.
#HANK.
All fixed fer the night, eh?
#LON.
G'night.
#HANK.
Well, I hope you like this country better'n Arizony.
#LON.
The hell you say!
#HANK.
Your wife was wishing herself back there.
#LON.
Well, that's where she come from. I don't. Women allus want what they ain't got.
#HANK.
When your heart was mine, true love, And your head lay on my breast, You could make me believe by the falling of your arm That the sun rose in the west.
#GHOST.
You could make me believe by the falling of your arm That the sun rose up in the west. -
#LON.
And what'r you doin' here?
#LON.
Cain't you stay where you was put - with a heap o' rocks on top o' ye?
#GHOST.
Can't seem to give up the old habits, y' know.
#LON.
What's the hell's a corpse got to do with habits?
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
You pore fool, you'll learn when you come over.
#LON.
Come over - wh'ar?
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
Where I am. There's many a girl can go all round about And hear the small birds sing -
#LON.
Dry up on them corpse tunes o' yourn, Harvey Mace.
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
Oh, you recognize me, eh? You recognize your old friend and pardner, do you, Lon Purdy?
#LON.
I knowed you'd come.
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
And you believe in me, eh? Well, that's good, too.
#LON.
Believe? Well! I knowed I'd be seein' things soon, what with the booze. I knowed it'd be the snakes or you. Padie told me I'd be seein' things.
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
So you believe in her, anyway. Well, how's Padie - and the children?
#LON.
You know damn well we ain't had none.
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
What, no children! How unfortunate! The house of love not to be graced with fruit ... sterile, sterile.
#LON.
Er you referrin' to me?
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
To your spiritual union only, my friend. Physically, I know, nothing was wanting for a perfect match, - female form divine to mate with big blond beast. A race of superpeople!
#LON.
What the hell 'r' you gabbin'? You allus had a lot of talky - talk. That's what made a hit with Padie, before, before -
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
Before the Other Man came along and cut us both out. And many a girl that stays at home alone And rocks the cradle and spins.
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
Yes, I'm afraid we both stood up pretty poorly alongside him. I had the words, the brain, the idea. I could charm her, tantalize her, quicken her mind, arouse her imagination. That's why I cut you out with her.
#LON.
Gab!
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
Yes, gab. It was one better to her than mere brute - guts! You personified strength. You didn't have nerves enough to be afraid of anything. You had endurance, cheek, deviltry, and a kind of raw good nature. These took with the gay, immature girl she was, until I came. You had - Guts; I had - Gab.
#LON.
And the Other Feller?
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
He had the Gift.
#LON.
What you mean?
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
He was a full man. His personality exuded from him like incense. It wrapped and enfolded you and warmed you, and yet it was not a grain feminine, but deeply, proudly masculine. You tolerated him, I - loved him. I had the fine passion for Padie, but when I first saw the two of them together I knew she was his, or ought to be ... and she has been, always.
#LON.
You lie like hell! She's mine! She's been mine all these three years! I won her and I own her! What little of love she ever had fer you or him is buried down in Laguna Madre with the bones of both of ye! And all hell can't take her from me!
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
He kin, and he's done it! You thought you'd got her. But he's had her, or rather, she's had him in her heart ever since they took the rope from his neck and pronounced him legally dead, and justice vindicated, and laid him away in the desert. All that time since, he's belonged to her. When you laid by her side nights, it was his arm she felt about her waist, not yours; his breath was on her cheek, and his heart was beating against hers. Oh you poor, poor fool!
#LON.
You lyin' pup!
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
Ha! ha! ha! you poor fool! Now you believe in me!
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
Go on, my boy! Let's have another one here.
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
Another one, just like the last - for your friend and pardner. Do you remember the last time you pulled that trick? What a foxy one it was! How astutely planned! Planned, my friend. I remember when we two went up the canyon together, just such a shining night as this, I asked you why you had borrowed - the Other Man's horse, and you said, yours was a little lame. Oh! excellent dissembler! Most crafty of liars! You stole that horse. You stole that horse to put a rope around the Other Man's neck! You knew the pinto was shod different from any pony in those parts. You knew where they'd track him to, when they found the job you'd done. Then we sat down to smokes and cards. And I remember the curious glitter in your eyes. I was dealing. Cut!
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
And after several hands, you brought up the subject of Padie. And I told you I was out of the race - and that you'd better get out too, because the best man already had her. And then - and then I sensed you were going to draw, and when I had my gun out, it was empty. Clever boy! You had it fixed right. And so you plugged me square. And the moon and stars went out for me and I dropped into the black gulf.
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
You left me with my face to the stars for the coyotes to find. Then, very coolly, you turned the Other Man's horse toward home and sent him off cracking. And you jumped to a piñon log that led off to a ledge of lava where your footprints wouldn't show. And you turned up in half an hour with the boys in town. Then you inquired casually where the Other Man was. You knew, you devil! You knew they'd never get an alibi from him for that night, 'cause - Padie was with him. Padie had her dear arms about his neck while you, clever dog! were out fixing to put a rope there. And you done it, too! Won her? Yes, you did - like hell! After the trial was all over, and the dead buried, me and him, you passed a dirty whisper around town about her, and then married her, to save her good name. That's how you won her.
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
There's many a star shall jangle in the west, There's many a leaf below, There's many a damn that will light upon the man For treating a poor girl so.
#GHOST OF MARLEY.
But I ain't forgot all you done for me. Neither has the Other Man, and he's come - to settle too -
#LON.
No! I don't believe in you! You're nothin' at all! There ain't no -
#GHOST.
Murderer! betrayer! We've come to settle!
#LON.
No! no! no! I don't believe -
#PADIE.
Lon! Lon! What's the matter?
#HANK.
Go back! It's something terrible.
#HANK.
I'm afraid he's done for.
#PADIE.
Oh.
#HANK.
He must 'a' fell.
#PADIE.
I knew - drink'd do fer him.
#HANK.
Did you - love him - so much?
#PADIE.
Once - a little. I don't care! Now - I kin - live!
#HANK.
Both of us.
