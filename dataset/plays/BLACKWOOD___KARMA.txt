#MRS. LATTIN.
What time is it, nurse - now?
#NURSE.
Close on half - past five.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Not later? Are you sure? It’s so dark.
#NURSE.
The dusk is closing in; I’ll light your lamp.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Half - past five, you said? My husband expected to be back before this. Hasn’t he come? The appointment was for half - past two.
#NURSE.
The Foreign Office takes its time. Mr. Lattin will come to you the moment he gets in.
#MRS. LATTIN.
You’re sure? I thought I heard his step.
#NURSE.
I’ll go and see the moment the lamp is lit. But he never forgets. He always comes in here first.
#MRS. LATTIN.
But he’s so long to - day, longer than usual. And he looked so grave, nurse, when he left. He looked worried, I thought. You noticed it?
#NURSE.
He is taken up with these politics just now. It’s only natural, considering the crisis in Egypt. But he’s always so in earnest, isn’t he? I noticed nothing unusual. The Government is lucky to have him at such a time. No one could fill his place. There’s the lamp. Is the shading right?
#MRS. LATTIN.
Fill his place! No, indeed. Phillip understands the natives better than anybody in the world. And the country too If only I could bring myself to go back to Egypt with him. The light catches my eye there. To the left a little. Now to the right. Thank you.
#NURSE.
The doctors all agree it’s best not, don’t they? The dry climate -
#MRS. LATTIN.
It’s not that, nurse. Dryness is what I need - warmth and dryness. It’s something else. Egypt frightens me. I can’t sleep there. Dreams come to me.
#NURSE.
The doctors said it was the effect of the climate on the nerves.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Oh, I know. I’d face it if I could - another winter. It means so much to Mr. Lattin, doesn’t it? Nurse! It’s curious - it’s strange, don’t you think - that Mr. Lattin feels nothing of that I feel there? I mean -
#NURSE.
Hark! I think that’s Mr. Lattin’s step. I’ll go and see.
#MRS. LATTIN.
It can’t be the new doctor, can it?
#NURSE.
Dr. Ogilvie? Not yet. Six o’clock he was to come. He won’t be here before his time. These great specialists are busy men.
#MRS. LATTIN.
I’ve seen so many doctors. I hardly feel as if I had the strength for a new examination. Dr. Ogilvie will do me no good.
#NURSE.
Still you will see him. For your husband’s sake.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Ah, yes, for Phillip’s sake. I think my husband’s coming, nurse.
#NURSE.
Good - evening, Mr. Lattin. Mrs. Lattin is a trifle better. I’ll leave you for a little, but she must not tire herself. We are expecting Dr. Ogilvie at six.
#PHILLIP.
I’ll be very careful.
#MRS. LATTIN.
At last, Phillip. I’m so glad you’ve come, dear. I’ve been waiting and longing so. They kept you - but you belong to me, don’t you? You’re tired, poor old thing. Come to me, Phillip - closer.
#PHILLIP.
I am a bit late. I’m sorry, Little Child. They kept me, yes. But YOU. - ?
#MRS. LATTIN.
I’m well enough to listen. You’re back; I forgive you. And it’s all arranged as you wished - as you hoped?
#PHILLIP.
Sir George was kindness itself -
#MRS. LATTIN.
You saw the Foreign Secretary!
#PHILLIP.
You didn’t know I was such a big - wig, did you? It is important, you see, dear. The situation out there is complicated. I’ve left them in the lurch a little, and my advice - er - my knowledge, Sir George was good enough to say - at such a time -
#MRS. LATTIN.
In the lurch, Phillip! How in the lurch? You’re only asking a longer leave than usual.
#PHILLIP.
There, there. I don’t want you to worry your dear head with politics. The new doctor will be here any minute now. That’s far more important.
#MRS. LATTIN.
I would rather know exactly. It doesn’t worry me.
#PHILLIP.
It’s all been arranged most satisfactorily, dear; and I’m very pleased. So you’re pleased with me - eh?
#MRS. LATTIN.
Phillip - what has been arranged?
#PHILLIP.
Sir George was most complimentary. The Government would recognise my services - my long services, he called it. He even discussed with me - asked my advice, if you must know the full weight of honour placed upon me! - as to my successor -
#MRS. LATTIN.
Successor!
#PHILLIP.
But, darling, some one must fill my place. There must be a locum tenens, as they say in the church.
#MRS. LATTIN.
You’ve - resigned!
#PHILLIP.
Dear one, there was no other way. It’s a formality, you see. I can always take it up again where I left it off. Our man in Egypt - just now - must be THERE. He must be on the spot, of course -
#MRS. LATTIN.
But six months’ leave! Surely, six months’ leave -
#PHILLIP.
Means the entire winter. There, there, Little Child, it’s nothing. You must not exaggerate like this. What is my work in Egypt compared to being with you. The doctors forbid you to go out. It’s quite simple: I prefer to stay with you. My world lies in your heart. I - I can always take up the work again when - when you’re better.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Resigned, resigned! You have actually resigned. Your career - I have broken your career - at last - completely. Is it wrong, then, that I need you so?
#PHILLIP.
Hush, dearest -
#MRS. LATTIN.
You have paid this tremendous price - and I have made you pay it.
#PHILLIP.
I wish to be always with you. That is my only wish, my only happiness.
#MRS. LATTIN.
For my sake you have sacrificed -
#PHILLIP.
It’s I who am selfish to tire you with all this stupid Government business. There, now; you’ve talked too much and I have done you harm. There’s only happiness in my heart. No more nonsense - talk about sacrifice. You must lie quiet and rest again. I can be always with you.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Yes, to the end - my end and yours. O God! Why did I not understand before?
#PHILLIP.
You must not speak like that. Love - our love - knows no end.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Oh, I am miserable, Phillip, miserable, miserable.
#PHILLIP.
PLEASE. do not say such things.
#MRS. LATTIN.
But I must, I must. My selfishness has brought you to this last renouncement. Egypt has meant so much to you.
#PHILLIP.
Too much, Mary, too much. Egypt was coming between us.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Your work there, the great work I have ruined…! Egypt meant home to you.
#PHILLIP.
Home is where you are, dearest, and nowhere else. You have taught me this - in time. Egypt! Ah, Egypt!
#MRS. LATTIN.
I hate it. It terrifies me. There is pain for me in Egypt. An instinctive dread comes over me always - something from very far away. I have struggled against it, for your sake, but - oh, it’s so, so strong. If only you could forgive me - !
#PHILLIP.
Hush, dearest!
#MRS. LATTIN.
But it has come between us. You love it so. And it’s my fault that you can’t - your career, I mean -
#PHILLIP.
Dear one, whatever is, is right. There is nothing to regret. Egypt, indeed, has drawn me strangely. There is some power out there - a spiritual power - that has cast a glamour over me. It has been a passion with me.
#MRS. LATTIN.
My instinctive terror!
#PHILLIP.
And my instinctive love! Yes … yes … strange indeed! From my earliest days it drew me. Those palms and temples, that majestic desert - !
#MRS. LATTIN.
Phillip, don’t! Those stars, that river bring me sadness - immense regret. I feel them always rising over me. They watch me!
#PHILLIP.
Forgive me. It was the marvellous beauty took me. I -
#MRS. LATTIN.
But it’s an unearthly beauty. And something in it - lost. It’s lost to you. And I - oh, but I do love you so; for ever and ever you are MINE. aren’t you? Phillip, dearest - something strange comes over me. I see a lifting of this heavy English sky. I have been through this before - I have done this very thing before - long, long ago - injured you somehow! Oh, Phillip, can it be that we have lived before - pre - existence - is it true? I think … I think I must be near to … death!
#PHILLIP.
Hush, hush, my darling. These are sick fancies only. Your brain is tired. We must not talk like this.
#MRS. LATTIN.
I am tired, yes; but it is my soul that aches and not my body. Phillip, I want your forgiveness.
#PHILLIP.
There is nothing to forgive. I love you.
#MRS. LATTIN.
I want your real forgiveness - before I go. I have been suffering deeply, deeply. Curtains have been rising. I almost see. Something seems growing clearer to me. I’ve done wrong somewhere! Why have I pulled against you all these years - against your work? It cannot be my love that is at fault. You’re wholly mine - and yet I want your forgiveness somehow -
#PHILLIP.
All the love and forgiveness in the world I give you, Little Child. But you ask for what was always yours.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Your broken mission. You alone have the strength and patience Egypt needs. I have ruined all, all, all!
#PHILLIP.
There! I forgive you, then. I forgive you all, all, all. But please calm yourself. This excitement does you harm. You torment yourself for nothing. It is I who have been, and am, the egoist. All men who think their work is a mission are shameless egoists.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Thank you, Phillip, for this great gift of your forgiveness. But it is not enough. I want to understand - and so forgive myself.
#PHILLIP.
You must rest now a little. It was criminal of me to let you talk so much. No, not another word. I’ll leave you for a bit. You must be calm to see the Doctor. It’s nearly six -
#MRS. LATTIN.
Dr. Ogilvie can’t help me.
#PHILLIP.
What! The first man of the day! His wonderful cures -
#MRS. LATTIN.
He cures the body only. I need a soul physician. Oh, Phillip, I believe sometimes my yearning must bring him to me.
#PHILLIP.
My darling, it is your body alone that is ill. Your suffering gives you these strange fancies.
#MRS. LATTIN.
You love me too well to understand. My illness is not only of the body. Now, leave me, dearest. I wish to see him quite alone.
#PHILLIP.
Little Child, you shall. You can dismiss the nurse. It is close on six.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Kiss me. If only - ah, if only my great yearning.… The fault lies in my soul, and it comes first from there - from Egypt. The river is rising, rising once again. The stars are rising too. They watch me, and they wait. They’re always watching us. O God! If only some one could make me understand! If some great doctor of the soul…! I beg your pardon. Is it - Dr. Ogilvie?
#DR. BEVAN.
I am the Doctor.
#MRS. LATTIN.
I must apologise. Did no one - ?
#DR. BEVAN.
I found my way.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Ah! Thank you.
#DR. BEVAN.
You called for me.
#MRS. LATTIN.
My husband, I believe, did write. We - expected you.
#DR. BEVAN.
I am come.
#MRS. LATTIN.
It is exceedingly - it is more than kind of you. You are so good. I mean - I am very ill.
#DR. BEVAN.
I know.
#MRS. LATTIN.
You know! Ah yes - you know.
#DR. BEVAN.
That is why you called me. That is why I am here now.
#MRS. LATTIN.
I can tell you very briefly what -
#DR. BEVAN.
It is unnecessary.
#MRS. LATTIN.
But -
#DR. BEVAN.
I have been watching you.
#MRS. LATTIN.
You mean - ?
#DR. BEVAN.
I knew - that you would send for me.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Ah! The medical journals! My case, of course - its peculiar - er - its hopelessness.
#DR. BEVAN.
There are no hopeless cases.
#MRS. LATTIN.
You are very ki - good. I thank you, already.
#DR. BEVAN.
And you already - I see - are on the way to your recovery.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Recovery!
#DR. BEVAN.
Since you realise that you are very ill.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Oh - in that sense.
#DR. BEVAN.
In every sense.
#MRS. LATTIN.
I think - there must be a mistake somewhere. I don’t quite understand how you -
#DR. BEVAN.
There are no mistakes.
#MRS. LATTIN.
But you are sure it is me you have come to see?
#DR. BEVAN.
It is you.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Mrs. Lattin? In this street and house - 13 Bristol Square?
#DR. BEVAN.
This street, this square , this very house you occupy - for the moment.
#MRS. LATTIN.
This - body?
#DR. BEVAN.
Which, for the moment, you - are occupying, Little Child.
#MRS. LATTIN.
You know that name! My husband’s secret name!
#DR. BEVAN.
It is - your name.
#MRS. LATTIN.
My little secret love - name. It is too marvellous - this. I am completely at a loss to -
#DR. BEVAN.
Love names truly always.
#MRS. LATTIN.
He … has … always … called me so.
#DR. BEVAN.
He has loved you truly - always.
#MRS. LATTIN.
But you know everything in the world! Who are you - really?
#DR. BEVAN.
I am the Doctor.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Doctor! The greatest calling in world! A doctor’s powers -
#DR. BEVAN.
Are, by rights, divine.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Life or death -
#DR. BEVAN.
Life and death.
#MRS. LATTIN.
But - you are more than doctor; you are also - Priest.
#DR. BEVAN.
I am at your service.
#MRS. LATTIN.
To heal me. I feel great power pouring from you - into me. It is like wind and fire.
#DR. BEVAN.
Life is a wind and fire. It is life you feel. Your claim is great, because of your great wish, your true desire. You deserve. And I have come.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Deserve! My great desire! My claim…!
#DR. BEVAN.
Your sickness is not of the heart, but of the soul. Your desire was prayer.
#MRS. LATTIN.
You have read my heart.
#DR. BEVAN.
Little Child, it is in your eyes.
#MRS. LATTIN.
And you know my very soul.
#DR. BEVAN.
Little Child, I am come to heal it.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Recovery! You said recovery. While I lie dying here by inches!
#DR. BEVAN.
You love.
#MRS. LATTIN.
With all my heart.
#DR. BEVAN.
And - soul?
#MRS. LATTIN.
I love - wrongly - somewhere. I forgot - my soul. And I have wrecked him, wrecked his life, his work.
#DR. BEVAN.
Again.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Is there recovery for that? Can you heal that?
#DR. BEVAN.
He does not question your love for him?
#MRS. LATTIN.
He is too big - hearted. He has sacrificed all for me. It is regret and remorse that kill me now - they bring death more quickly. If only I could understand!
#DR. BEVAN.
You shall.
#MRS. LATTIN.
When it is too late. Can you give recovery for that? Can the forgiveness that I crave - his forgiveness - undo what has been? I must die without forgiveness.
#DR. BEVAN.
Recovery begins with understanding.
#MRS. LATTIN.
I want his forgiveness.
#DR. BEVAN.
You must - forgive yourself.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Oh, oh, I do not understand. My remorse goes with me even into the grave.
#DR. BEVAN.
Remorse brings weakness. The forgiveness of another affects that other only.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Yes?
#DR. BEVAN.
Understand. Then, without regret, go forward. To forgive yourself is - true forgiveness.
#MRS. LATTIN.
I feel something wonderful in you. Your words bring life again.… I.… There seems something I remember - remember almost - very dim and far away.… The stars … the river … are rising, surely.…
#DR. BEVAN.
You remember - life. And life shall teach you this.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Life! My life! Oh, what is it rising in me? A curtain lifts. I see … myself. Ah, now it goes again.… The pain … the pain is awful! It all has been before somewhere, I know.… Have I done this before, then? If only I could see, I might understand.
#DR. BEVAN.
You shall see. Understanding shall bring recovery.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Recovery! I half remember.… I begin to … understand…!
#DR. BEVAN.
The soul reaps ever its own harvest, for the soul is linked to all its past.
#MRS. LATTIN.
The past! My past…! Our past together.…
#DR. BEVAN.
Your pain and prayer may lift for once the curtain. Remembering, you shall understand. And, understanding, you shall learn to - forgive yourself.
#MRS. LATTIN.
It lifts, it lifts! I hear wind among the palms, and lapping waters. A voice is whispering … “Little Child” … yet in another tongue.…
#DR. BEVAN.
Egypt! Where you began - with him. Your earliest life. Then other lives as well. See - and understand.
#NEFERTITI.
Now leave me, Sethos. And go swiftly. I must be alone. You follow me as wind follows a bird.
#SETHOS.
Yet never touch you as wind does the bird. And when you dance your feet dance on my heart. No other dancing - girl compares with you.
#NEFERTITI.
Last moon Pharaoh himself told me that. I know it. But now leave me. I am here to worship.
#SETHOS.
May I not stay a moment - at least, until Menophis - ?
#NEFERTITI.
Sethos, you heard me. It is the sacred night. The tear of Isis falls into our River when the dusk has passed to darkness. And I must worship.
#SETHOS.
Menophis comes also with the dusk. You meet here every evening; and when he comes I am forgotten. May I not stay and be remembered - till he comes? Your beauty makes me slavish. Out of his plenty he will not miss so little, and I - starve.
#NEFERTITI.
Not now. Sethos, I tell you, go! His coming, as you know, makes the dry desert live for me. I would not have him troubled for so little. He hardly is aware of your existence - as yet. But, should I ever need you - slave - !
#SETHOS.
As yet! Need me! Oh, Nefertiti, if you could use me I should die of happiness.
#NEFERTITI.
Then prepare to die, for the time may come.
#SETHOS.
Oh, may it happen soon!
#NEFERTITI.
The Gods alone know what may happen, and when. You are my slave. Then, vanish!
#SETHOS.
Your slave obeys. But your lover will wait among the palm - trees yonder. Menophis may not come. The Gods know what will happen, and it is said the Gods have claimed him for themselves. He is a prize, it seems, that earth and heaven both desire. I have heard rumours. If you need escort back to Memphis your lightest call will reach me.
#NEFERTITI.
Go! I shall not need your escort. My happiness and his are in the keeping of the Gods. Leave me to worship.
#SETHOS.
Oh, Nefertiti, the wild sweetness of the desert is in your breath! To me you are holy as our sacred River! May the Gods grant you all your heart’s desire. Sethos is your slave for ever - even though his heart should break.
#NEFERTITI.
A slave is always useful - for slavish purposes. I may put you to the test some day! He’ll bury himself in the Temple.… He’ll bury himself in my arms.… He’ll become a monk at Rames’ bidding.… He’ll become mine. I’ve got him … under this very foot!
#MENOPHIS.
You here! Nefertiti! Nefertiti!
#NEFERTITI.
Menophis!
#MENOPHIS.
You worship here at dusk … beside the Nile!
#NEFERTITI.
I often come at sunset - as you know.
#MENOPHIS.
I … had … forgotten.
#NEFERTITI.
Forgotten! Has some Afreet blinded you? Only last night, too, you passed me by without a glance - on your way to Aton’s new Temple.
#MENOPHIS.
It was moonless and I did not see you. No Afreet power could hide you in the sunshine.
#NEFERTITI.
Oh, thank you, Menophis. I thought your heart was too full perhaps to see me.
#MENOPHIS.
You have been worshipping alone - and you were lonely. Forgive me, Little Child, I -
#NEFERTITI.
I forgive you, O handsome Menophis. But I was not lonely. Sethos kept me company awhile.
#MENOPHIS.
Sethos! The Syrian banker’s son! You can find pleasure in such company?
#NEFERTITI.
You did not come here to talk with me of Sethos. You came, like me, to worship - !
#MENOPHIS.
He is rich.
#NEFERTITI.
He is forgotten too. When you call me “Little Child” the whole world is forgotten. There is only - You.
#MENOPHIS.
Little … Child.
#NEFERTITI.
Your eyes seem strange to me to - night: they look far away into space. Your voice sounds distant like the desert jackal’s cry. Yet you call me Little Child, as of old, when we met here every evening in the dusk … to play and talk and dream together … of the future. Menophis , will you not tell me - your Little Child - this sacred night when the Tear of Isis bids our river rise - tell me what wonderful new dream has crept into this faithful heart? I hear another music in your blood. And it is … beautiful.
#MENOPHIS.
It is the Sacred Night. That means - Had you forgotten?
#NEFERTITI.
Oh, you Solemnity! Forgotten what?
#MENOPHIS.
A choice - a decision - made to - night is made for ever.
#NEFERTITI.
I know.
#MENOPHIS.
Little Child, it is for me a crisis, and I must choose between great issues. My life, too, is rising. I must decide in what direction it shall flow.
#NEFERTITI.
You mean … with whom?
#MENOPHIS.
FOR. hom.
#NEFERTITI.
How cold it has grown. Menophis.… I feel the desert - wind’s fingers at my heart. It is the North wind from the sea. You, too, seem distant suddenly. I fear for you. Why is it? I fear something … for myself … as well -
#MENOPHIS.
There is no fear this sacred night. There is courage only. Life increases everywhere. The river rises. The Tear of Isis falls into the Nile and -
#NEFERTITI.
Hark! There are awful things about in Egypt when -
#MENOPHIS.
She is alive, that’s all.
#NEFERTITI.
Listen!
#MENOPHIS.
It is the lapping waves. It is the wind among the palms.
#NEFERTITI.
The waters! That cold desert wind! It blows between us - between you and me. There is a shadow! Surely great Kephren bowed this way!
#MENOPHIS.
The stars shine over us. They cast no shadow. The pyramid stands fast.
#NEFERTITI.
Yet something passed between us, for I felt it. You are all mine?
#MENOPHIS.
There is no room. A shadow cannot separate us. Anything real would bind us closer only.
#NEFERTITI.
Then why are you so solemn, your eyes so far away, your voice so distant? This crisis that you speak of - it could not take you from me?
#MENOPHIS.
Nothing can take you from me, or me from you - for long. The chain of our past and future lives is bound together beyond all breaking.
#NEFERTITI.
What is it, then, that frightens me?
#MENOPHIS.
Ah, Nefertiti, Little Child, to - night I stand - we stand together - at the very gates of life. The choice is difficult, for it involves you too. Since first, three years ago, I saw you flitting, like a swallow, down the river bank at Memphis - since those enchanted days I have had no other human love but you -
#NEFERTITI.
No other human love!
#MENOPHIS.
There is another love, my Nefertiti - a greater; not more enduring, perhaps, but nobler. For it demands the greater sacrifice. And, cold though it seem to your warm, passionate heart - if it should call me -
#NEFERTITI.
Greater! Yet would take you from me! But you ARE ine!
#MENOPHIS.
Your beauty troubles me; my blood rebels. I cannot look at you and hear the call this sacred night may bring me. I must make a still place for my soul to listen. Oh, Nefertiti, you must leave me - for a little.
#NEFERTITI.
Not knowing what is in your troubled heart! Not hearing from your own lips if we shall meet again!
#MENOPHIS.
You should know all. If not from my lips, then from -
#NEFERTITI.
Rames, the great Priest! I understand. He would steal you from me for his dismal Temple, steal you away from life.
#MENOPHIS.
He is among the wisest and noblest of our land, the Great One of Vision, Aton’s servant.
#NEFERTITI.
Aton!
#MENOPHIS.
Hush! Be careful! Even if Aton takes me, the chain of lives must bring us again together. It were but a brief separation - a sacrifice of pain and joy we both may offer as one being. And when, in our next life, we meet again, what ecstasy of strengthened, purified love would be ours - to know each had been faithful to the other - for His sake.
#NEFERTITI.
Me grow old in loneliness while you satisfy your soul with selfish worship! Our sacrifice!
#MENOPHIS.
In dreams we still -
#NEFERTITI.
We should never meet; a dream’s a dream. No children would come to me.
#MENOPHIS.
You would not pine. It would be, for both of us, a preparation for our meeting in a future life -
#NEFERTITI.
You are right, Menophis. I should not pine, for I should marry and know joy. Your sacrifice, if you choose it, you may bear alone, for Nefertiti will not certainly be lonely. There is no lack of those who offer life to her in place of the dream that Rames sets before you -
#MENOPHIS.
Others! Is there another? Nefertiti - !
#NEFERTITI.
Rames is coming. I hear his cautious step. Make your choice with him. I will not influence you. You wished to be alone; I’ll leave you.
#MENOPHIS.
One moment more. Will you not say farewell? And if - and if - until you hear from my own lips -
#NEFERTITI.
If you decide to leave me, Menophis, you will not quite forget -
#MENOPHIS.
Little Child, you know. Always I shall think of you -
#NEFERTITI.
As happy and light - hearted - with another. I am no “dream” to Sethos.
#MENOPHIS.
Your beauty tortures me.
#NEFERTITI.
You do not torture me; you cannot. If you loved me you could not give me up so lightly. You may think of me - of us - walking along this river bank at sunset with laughter and without regret, talking maybe of Menophis, and his passing dream. The echo of our laughter may reach into your little cell.
#MENOPHIS.
Unsay those haunting words.
#NEFERTITI.
It is but impulse that betrays you. You have a “greater love” than me. I have one too! Farewell. I shall not come again unless you call me.
#RAMES.
Your eyes are troubled, although I cannot see them. And your steps leave an uneven pattern on the sands.
#MENOPHIS.
There are too many voices in my ears; and all are sweet. I know not which is true. I am unhappy and afraid. My peace of yesterday is gone.
#RAMES.
These stars that watch you now shall watch your future lives as well. Before they pale at dawn they shall have marked your choice. They are rising in the east. They watch you - and they wait.
#MENOPHIS.
I came here to find peace - between the sunset and the sunrise.
#RAMES.
Sunrise and sunset - the two great moments of the day. Death and resurrection - the two great moments of our life.
#MENOPHIS.
Not death - a disappearance only for a little time.
#RAMES.
To return again and again, each new life linked to those that went before; and each determined by opportunities left or taken.
#MENOPHIS.
The choice! Oh, Rames, there are two calls in me. I hear two voices always. My future life hangs upon the decision that I make.
#RAMES.
YOU. ill not make it. It will make itself. The stronger call must win It is whether you shall live unto yourself alone, or consecrate your powers to Aton. It is not alone your future life that hangs upon the choice; it is your future lives.
#MENOPHIS.
If only the whole of me could choose. I should then know that I am worthy.
#RAMES.
There can be no half - heartedness in the service of our Deity.
#MENOPHIS.
Our Deity - the sun!
#RAMES.
Egypt, our great land, now witnesses the climax of her splendour. A change, which is divine, steals over her. It is no longer the mere disc of the sun we worship; it is the power behind.
#MENOPHIS.
The heat and glory that are in Aton, eternal and all - loving Deity.
#RAMES.
Who calls you for the offering of - yourself. The Temples of our regenerated Egypt demand the best.
#MENOPHIS.
And I might help towards this great uplifting?
#RAMES.
Menophis, Aton calls you to himself.
#MENOPHIS.
I hear the call!
#RAMES.
But other, lesser, calls as well?
#MENOPHIS.
There can be no turning back!
#RAMES.
No turning back.
#MENOPHIS.
I must be sure!
#RAMES.
It is for ever.
#MENOPHIS.
I know which call is highest, yet I hear that sweeter voice. If only I could smother it.
#RAMES.
It is the lust of life - of woman!
#MENOPHIS.
It is love.
#RAMES.
I may not influence you. Years ago I heard these two calls, as you do, singing in my soul.
#MENOPHIS.
And you have never known regret?
#RAMES.
I have known perfect joy.
#MENOPHIS.
To yield what is most dear to another is very hard. Oh, Rames, I am so young, the choice is difficult. If I had some sign that Aton accepts me - ! Aton, guide my decision and grant my choice be wise!
#RAMES.
Weigh carefully. Hear every call with honesty. Aton, indeed, does call you, but it is all or nothing. I leave you - to yourself.
#MENOPHIS.
Great Aton, guide me.
#SETHOS.
My head spins, Nefertiti. Then it was in play that you dismissed me? I can hardly believe my happiness is real.
#NEFERTITI.
Everything’s real - at the moment when - you’ve got it.
#MENOPHIS.
With … Sethos…! You’ve come back…!
#NEFERTITI.
The river bank is public, I believe. All Memphis will be here presently - this sacred night. Forgive me - forgive us - if we disturbed your meditations. We enjoy the starlight like the other lovers!
#MENOPHIS.
Together! young girl does not come out unattended. I am proud that Nefertiti accepts my protection - as before.
#MENOPHIS.
Little Child!
#NEFERTITI.
Menophis, you know, is half a priest already. He has put aside all common things - youth, dancing, laughter - love.
#SETHOS.
Wise Menophis! I envy a man grown old before his time. He has had some bitter disappointment probably.
#MENOPHIS.
If you really love each other, I -
#SETHOS.
Come this way, Nefertiti. I hear a pipe. Let’s go and dance. This atmosphere is too holy.
#MENOPHIS.
Can this be a sign from Aton - that you are worthless?
#NEFERTITI.
We’ll dance, yes, as we did at Memphis when the harvest ripened. And then we’ll bathe together, Sethos. It all is worship, and my blood this sacred night is burning -
#SETHOS.
And to - morrow I may see your father - ?
#MENOPHIS.
Nefertiti!
#NEFERTITI.
I heard a dead voice calling from a Tomb. It’s not for us. We are alive!
#MENOPHIS.
Little Child!
#MENOPHIS.
MY. ittle Child.
#SETHOS.
Come, Nefertiti. Come with me, lest the Temple snatch you, too.
#MENOPHIS.
Listen! The waters wait the sign! A few brief moments and the Tear of Isis falls - and the choice is made, not for this life only, but for ever. You would bind your soul to his … for all future lives … for ever?
#NEFERTITI.
“For ever”! “For all future lives”! For an hour - a few hours, perhaps -
#SETHOS.
You swore to me that you -
#NEFERTITI.
I danced and played and sang with you. You dance lightly and your voice is sweet. But - if it is true that vows taken to - night can bind me to your soul for ever -
#MENOPHIS.
It is true.
#NEFERTITI.
… the journey would tire me.
#SETHOS.
Nefertiti!
#MENOPHIS.
Let her alone. Since her eyes first opened to the sun she has been mine. A hundred future lives shall take our feet together. And she knows it. She plays with you - this singing, dancing. She lives with me. Leave us together, Sethos. Go!
#NEFERTITI.
I played with you. You know it. You had forgotten our appointment! I did it - for my love’s sake.
#MENOPHIS.
She has finished with you. Go!
#SETHOS.
Finished! You are mistaken, Menophis. Only a while ago she said my love was precious to her - You have strange ideas of play. You’re a -
#MENOPHIS.
Enough, Sethos. You knew, at least, that we belonged to one another. You have yourself to blame.
#NEFERTITI.
Of course. Sethos says the same sweet things to many another maiden too.
#SETHOS.
The Gods have set me free of you, and I am glad. When next we meet, Menophis, you shall hear the soft promises she made me , and how she spoke of you! She called you half woman and half monk - no man at all , fit … only … for … the Temples!
#NEFERTITI.
Yet if I raised my little finger you’d come tumbling back - a helpless slave! I am ashamed. I did pretend he pleased me.
#MENOPHIS.
Little Child.…
#NEFERTITI.
I was a little jealous of - of - your Aton.
#MENOPHIS.
And I, perhaps, of your … Sethos.
#MENOPHIS.
You are a daughter of the sun!
#NEFERTITI.
Isis and Aton both are in our blood!
#MENOPHIS.
Your beauty blinds me. I hear no other voice than your dear singing. I see no stars, your twinkling feet are everywhere.
#NEFERTITI.
It is the call of Life.
#MENOPHIS.
Listen! The moment comes.
#NEFERTITI.
It is here.
#BOTH TOGETHER.
The Tear of Isis!
#MENOPHIS.
Our river takes it.
#NEFERTITI.
The waters rise.
#MENOPHIS.
Our choice is made - for ever.
#NEFERTITI.
My beloved. Mine … for ever and ever … all our future lives.
#MENOPHIS.
The Temple was a dream. Your beauty makes me see it. Rames comes. Great One of Visions!
#NEFERTITI.
And Sethos with him. Let them see us both. Do not hide, but tell them boldly of your glorious choice.
#RAMES.
May Aton bless you both - now - and in all lives to come.
#NEFERTITI.
Aton has blessed us - both.
#MENOPHIS.
Rames - you come to know my choice. The Tear has fallen. The river is rising, and I - I have heard the call.
#RAMES.
The choice is yours - and hers.
#RAMES.
They … bear … witness.
#MENOPHIS.
I have weighed both voices. Another - a worthier than I - must replace me in the Temple.
#RAMES.
Aton does not compel. The call will come to you again - in following lives, until -
#NEFERTITI.
Our love comes from Aton. He has given Menophis to me for my own.
#RAMES.
All gifts are his.
#MENOPHIS.
Holy Rames, I cannot let her go from me.
#RAMES.
The choice is made. The future lives will bring again, and yet again , this same deep opportunity, when you - again - shall lead his soul higher, or delay and hinder by vain selfish love.
#NEFERTITI.
He is mine - for ever. No priest or god shall rob me of him. I keep him for myself.
#RAMES.
The rising water bears witness to your vow. Where the Temple gleams white in the sunlight, and where the palaces run down to the sea, you shall hear the waters in your soul - and - shall - remember.
#NEFERTITI.
Listen! He prophesies!
#MENOPHIS.
Great One of Visions!
#LYDIA.
How you startled me!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Were your thoughts so far away, Little Child?
#LYDIA.
I was thinking.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
And gazing across the sea as usual. What is there so attractive beyond that dim horizon? The future or - ?
#LYDIA.
Perhaps its dimness only. That’s southwards, is it not? There Egypt lies, and - Alexandria - you said - the great, new city.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Distance still haunts your eyes. Little wonder that I startled you. But do not speak of Alexander’s city. Our thoughts lie nearer home - in Athens.
#LYDIA.
Where have you been, Phocion? All day I’ve missed you.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
On the hills - alone. I have been thinking.
#LYDIA.
Thinking - you too!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
I came home by way of Theseus’ Temple, saying a prayer for our loved city and for ourselves.
#LYDIA.
But you are weary, and your feet are splashed with mud.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
I crossed the Ilissus to be sooner home, and found it rising - in flood almost. Yesterday’s rains on Mount Hymettus - Why, what ails you, Lydia? Do I startle you a second time?
#LYDIA.
Forgive me, Phocion; do not notice my little weaknesses. It was merely - there, I’ve often told you - a rising river is an omen that causes me strange uneasiness.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Little Child, I understand. I know your feelings. Athens herself is on edge these days - and little wonder.
#LYDIA.
Phocion, let me tell you honestly - I am afraid.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Anxious, perhaps, but not afraid. The mood of our beloved city takes you with it, as it takes us all. We all are patriots to - day. But the wife of Phocion has proved herself no coward.
#LYDIA.
Alexander is so powerful. Some say the Macedonian is a God.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Pshaw! In his own land, perhaps. But Athens has her own Gods. He is a conqueror, yes; but a conqueror can only take a city, not the souls who dwell in it.
#LYDIA.
Phocion, when I hear your words my fear melts away. Yet Athens is conquered. Our city trembles -
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Hush, Lydia. I do not like to hear you say such things.
#LYDIA.
Who can stand against him, then? Who is there can oppose this conqueror of the Persians?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Every Athenian - every Greek who loves our city more than he fears the Macedonian.
#LYDIA.
All Athens, then!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
All the best in Athens.
#LYDIA.
Your speech is often mysterious like this now - dark with meaning. Each night as twilight gathers from the sea about our city, there are footsteps on the causeway that make me tremble. No sooner has Hymettus darkened than shadows move silently over the courtyard and between the pillars. Oh, my Phocion, it is for you, not for myself, I am afraid.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Calm yourself, beloved. I am an Athenian who obeys his unconquerable Gods. I do no more than accept the destiny they lay upon him who loves his country -
#LYDIA.
But if Alexander discovered you - if - !
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Discovered me! What thought is this?
#LYDIA.
If he discovered you were true to Athens, I was about to say. If he took you from me! Oh, Phocion! In dreams I have seen you lying dead at his feet - lost to me for ever.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Not lost, most loving woman. If the Gods take me - if I die for Athens -
#LYDIA.
Am I, then, less than Athens?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Athens is great because of women like you, Lydia. You would not see her less?
#LYDIA.
How less?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Less free. Liberty is the breath of life.
#LYDIA.
What is my liberty if I lose you? Your voice, your touch, your living presence here beside me - I want you alive and loving -
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Our love has grown with Athens. On the green Cephissian banks we first discovered it, and that evening on Hymettus when the honey - ah, I see it in your eyes, dear heart - you remember even as I remember. If Athens live -
#LYDIA.
But if you die! If Alexander crush you, kill you! Oh, my Phocion, this struggle against the conqueror is vain. You tempt the Gods. I fear for you and for your hopeless schemes -
#PHOCION THE DYER.
My schemes! Lydia, what do you know?
#LYDIA.
I suspect only. I feel you planning dangerous things that must take you from me. Those silent footsteps on our causeway in the dusk, the shadows that pass between the pillars, the rising waters - Phocion! your strange deep love of Athens takes no account of me, your little, suffering wife.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
The love of Athens is ours. It is the love of country that the Gods call sacred. Hellas, your valleys and mountains, streams and happy groves … beautiful, beloved … who would not die for you…!
#LYDIA.
I love you. If you live for me, you live for Hellas even more. Athens lives in our hearts, not otherwise.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
If a barbarian rule our dear city, our hearts are dead. It is better for my heart to mingle with the soil of Hellas than beat as the slave of Alexander.
#LYDIA.
I love you too much to see you run on death. Your wild plot to save our city is but the Fates’ way of taking you away from me.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Try, Lydia, to love me as I love Athens.
#LYDIA.
You ask too much of me. I love Hellas, but I love you more.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Then - not enough. You make it hard for me. I see the right so clearly, but your clinging love makes me weak.
#LYDIA.
There is nothing in the world for a woman but her love. If you were lost to me, Phocion, these lips could kiss one other only - the rising flood of our little Athenian river - or the sea.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
What comes, sweet wife, comes to both of us together. You are overwrought with sleeplessness and watching. Trust me and love me - more I cannot tell you now. Your love shall give me strength. And if there is a greater love than yours, some day we shall find it - know it both together. What comes to me to do now - I must do.
#LYDIA.
A greater love! Ah, Phocion - you’re going from me - going towards death. I know not what you mean. There is no greater love. Then I must save you, since you will not save yourself. I cannot lose you. My love, I cannot let you - My love shall save you from yourself. If I do wrong the Gods forgive - You would see - whom?
#MESSENGER.
The wife of Phocion.
#LYDIA.
Hush! Come softly, I am she. You bring a message for me? You bring a token?
#MESSENGER.
She who sends me bids me say as token this: From one who loves her Lord more than his earthly glory - to her who loves as greatly.
#LYDIA.
To her who loves as greatly. It is to save him that I do it - to save his life for - both of us. Your great mistress bid you bring an answer back to her?
#MESSENGER.
Without delay - my orders are.
#LYDIA.
Have you no more to say? No further message? Do you bring only the token that you come from her?
#MESSENGER.
She bid me say that you should feel perfect confidence.
#LYDIA.
The word of Alexander - ?
#MESSENGER.
Has been given, and cannot change.
#LYDIA.
Though it concern the life of one who was his enemy?
#MESSENGER.
The Queen bid me assure you. He has given her his promise. It will not alter.
#LYDIA.
Then take this message back to her who sent you: To one who comes hither to - night when the moon is high enough to cast a shadow I will reveal what I have promised to reveal. In return I claim the boon the conqueror has sworn - through her - to give me.
#MESSENGER.
Her word and his are both securely given. I take back yours.
#LYDIA.
Go swiftly, silently. I shall await fulfilment here - when the moon is high enough to cast a shadow on the marble causeway. Behind that pillar I shall wait. Go swiftly!
#LYSANDER.
Our last meeting now, and then to action. Oh, Phocion, I feel the Gods are with us. Your daring shall save Athens, and Hellas will live - even if we die.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
We all stand or fall together. They are picked men, and heroes; no one among them thinks of self. The risk, of course, is great, but it is nothing when the stake is considered.
#LYSANDER.
Everything favours us. The best troops of Alexander’s army are still in Egypt. The entire city is behind us. All Athens will rise when it sees you are our leader. We shall drive the proud Macedonian out. Oh, I’m glad the talk is over soon! I burn for action.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
I, too, want action. I am not made for stealth and for conspiracy. Plotting and hesitation weary me.
#LYSANDER.
Phocion, you feel no doubt, though - ? I heard you sigh. Are you less sure of - of anything?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
For myself, boy, I have no doubt. For Athens I am sure and strong. Did I sigh perhaps? If so - if so, it was for others whose lives I hold in trust. For others - the truest, best, and bravest men in all Athens.
#LYSANDER.
The Gods will bear that burden for you, Phocion.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Yes, yes; the Gods will bear it - partly.
#LYSANDER.
No one can lead but you. We are of one accord.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
I will lead, Lysander. Have no fear. Of myself I do not think. The moon is up. I see the evening star o’er Salamis. They will be here very shortly.
#LYSANDER.
We are quite safe here. I took the password round myself at noon.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
We cannot be too cautious. Alexander’s spies are more numerous than the bees upon Hymettus. They can sting as sharply too.
#LYSANDER.
Oh, our secret is well guarded. Yet the least whisper or thoughtless word could so easily betray us. I only would - that Lydia -
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Lydia!
#LYSANDER.
She is in great favour with Alexander’s queen, Statira.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
So much the better! Since she knows nothing there is nothing she can reveal. Alexander seeks to play the generous conqueror. That the wife of Phocion accepts favours that Phocion spurns can only save us from suspicion. The Persian woman helps us without knowing it. And so does Lydia!
#LYSANDER.
You are right, Phocion. The Gods show their will in little things like this. We are under their protection. Yet if word reached Alexander of our gathering in your house to - night -
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Keep your words for later, boy; you waste your strength. How can you hold such idle thoughts? Hellas a Macedonian province! Her ancient liberties crushed! Our last hope dead as soon as born, and no blow struck!
#LYSANDER.
Phocion, forgive me! And, Selene, in yonder rising moon, forgive me too. The Gods protect and help us!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Pallas Athena, give us wisdom to plan and strength to strike. Ah, Lydia.
#LYDIA.
YOU. id not call me, Phocion? It seemed -
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Your maidens called you to the bath. It is your bathing hour.
#LYDIA.
Lysander, good - evening! You are fortunate. Phocion has more time for his brother than for his wife.
#LYSANDER.
Had I a wife as brave and faithful as my brother has, I should be more fortunate still! These are grave times, good Lydia, for true Athenian men.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Ah, Lydia knows too well, Lysander. But do not detain her now. I will come later for you, Little Child - an hour at the most.
#LYDIA.
I am always ready for you, Phocion, and always true. I, too, am an Athenian.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
The Gods watch over you!
#LYDIA.
And over you! You love him, I know, Lysander, and he loves you.
#LYSANDER.
Before he even knew your name, I loved Phocion, and more than Phocion I love Phocion’s honour.
#LYDIA.
And so loving him you would urge him - to his death. You shall not, Lysander; Phocion is mine and he belongs to me. I will hold him fast to this life. A glorious career now lies at Phocion’s feet.
#LYSANDER.
I love Phocion’s honour too well to tempt him to dishonour.
#LYDIA.
Tush, boy! You do not understand. I would not tempt him. Fate does not tempt, it commands. The high Gods bid us to accept fate bravely. The weak resist it; the strong accept and make it glorious. And a glorious career now lies at Phocion’s feet.
#LYSANDER.
You speak with knowledge, Lydia? If so, how come you by such knowledge?
#LYDIA.
Hush, not so loud. Lysander, you faithful brother, I tell you it is common knowledge. The Military Governorship of Alexandria - once offered to Phocion already and refused by him - is open to him still. Alexander knows his worth -
#LYSANDER.
His incorruptibility too. But how know you this, Lydia?
#LYDIA.
I only know that Alexander is generous and will raise him to even greater honour. He places Phocion above all men in Athens -
#LYSANDER.
Has Alexander’s queen informed you thus. It seems strange to me, Lydia, that the wife of - an Athenian patriot -
#PHOCION THE DYER.
How loud your voices grow. Lydia, Little Child, you had best leave us now, for Lysander and I have grave business to transact together - and we expect others too.
#LYDIA.
Lysander chides me that I accept kindness from the queen of Athens’ conqueror.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
I see no harm in that, and possibly much good. Your love will ever guide you. Farewell, now, for a little while. And happiness go with you!
#LYDIA.
I leave you. It is your friends who come to you at twilight now so often. The Fates protect you, my Phocion! Oh, save him, Lysander! Save him from himself - for me, his wife!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Open, Lysander. It is the Citizens.
#CITIZEN.
The Gods deliver Athens!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
They will deliver her! It is safest our meeting should be brief, and no words wasted.
#FIRST CITIZEN.
We stand for action.
#SECOND CITIZEN.
Immediate action.
#THIRD CITIZEN.
Each day that passes consolidates the barbarian power that would ruin Athens.
#LYSANDER.
Citizens, we need two conditions for success - to strike hard, and to surprise.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
We must move warily. The Macedonian’s spies hide everywhere, and money has been flowing.
#LYSANDER.
There are ten thousand hearts in Athens above gold - !
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Our preparations must be sure. You bring to - night the list of patriots?
#FIRST CITIZEN.
It is drawn up Twenty names stand written here, each signed by his own hand, each guaranteeing three hundred men of arms -
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Whom we can trust?
#FIRST CITIZEN.
The names are guarantee, as you will see - the best in Athens.
#SECOND CITIZEN.
Ready to live or die as our beloved city lives - or dies.
#LYSANDER.
And thousands more will follow once we show the way.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Our forlorn hope is favoured of the Gods, and will be led by them.
#CITIZEN.
Upon great leadership hangs success or failure. There can be one leader only.
#CITIZENS.
Phocion! Phocion!
#LYSANDER.
Phocion is our leader. I saw a figure pass. few moments ago I saw one too - between the pillars.
#ANOTHER CITIZEN.
Are we alone here?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
My wife - and her maidens - are about. We are alone.
#FIRST CITIZEN.
Once read, Phocion, the list must be instantly destroyed. Each signature is a warrant for the writer’s death.
#LYSANDER.
I counsel haste. The very stones move as with footsteps. The sky has eyes.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
I have read. The names are - what Athens would expect.
#LYSANDER.
Then let me burn it.
#FIRST CITIZEN.
Phocion, in the names you read, and in the names of all assembled here, we offer you the leadership - the military leadership. We ask you to lead our beloved city back to liberty again.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Citizens, in the name of Athens, and with the approval of the deathless Gods of Athens - I accept the leadership.
#FIRST CITIZEN.
Then we are half - way to success already. The sooner we disband, the better. Three of us may stay with Phocion to decide the final -
#CITIZEN.
We are betrayed! spy! We have been overheard! Persian!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
No stranger is unwelcome in my house, even though he enter - without permission. You would see Phocion? I am he.
#EVERYCHILD.
I ask forgiveness for my unannounced intrusion. I disturb you. But my need is urgent. This is my warrant: I am a messenger from Alexander.
#OTHERS.
From Alexander!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
You bring Phocion a message from Alexander?
#EVERYCHILD.
Of first importance.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
You may deliver it. gift I am bid offer first - a gift from Egypt, where Phocion fought so bravely and so well. From the Temple of Ammon himself in Lybia.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Phocion fights not for gifts; nor can he accept anything from the barbarian conqueror of Athens.
#EVERYCHILD.
I am bid to urge reflection on you. First words are not the truest always, nor the wisest.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
I am an Athenian.
#EVERYCHILD.
Alexander commands me say further - that, with this gift, he would honour Phocion by yet another one. He bids me call you the Military Governor of his new city in Egypt.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
The two gifts are one. I have one answer only.
#EVERYCHILD.
Then, with your answer, I ask permission to take back some trifle - such as that parchment the youth there would destroy - as proof to Alexander that the House of Phocion is loyal.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Loyal - !
#EVERYCHILD.
The parchment.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Alexander!
#ALEXANDER.
Hand it to me, boy, before another name is burned. The hall be surety, Phocion, for your loyalty. I hold you the bravest man in Athens, Phocion, and such men as you I need. But lesser men than you I do not - need!
#LYDIA.
Phocion! Great Alexander!… Statira promised me.… Oh, he is too brave to die…!
#ALEXANDER.
Three of you take the boy away. The rest withdraw. No, let these greybeards go.
#LYSANDER.
The Gods will not desert us…!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
You are the conqueror of Athens.
#ALEXANDER.
Lesser men than you I do not need. Give me your allegiance and I give you - these lives!
#LYDIA.
Phocion, you cannot sacrifice such men!
#CITIZEN.
Do not think of us! What is life to the conquered? Gladly would we die for Athens.
#ALEXANDER.
I wait your decision, Phocion.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Phocion, Military Governor of Alexandria, is Alexander’s host.
#ALEXANDER.
The word of Phocion is enough. Lysander, the boy, shall be Captain of your Bodyguard in Egypt. The Gods - your Gods - are witness to what I say.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Athens! I have failed you! My life is broken in pieces.
#LYDIA.
But I meant to save you, Phocion. My love would save you. Have I done wrong? Oh, tell me.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
You have done - your - best. No one - no woman - can do more.
#LYDIA.
I could not face life without you. I could not see you die. My love made the desperate plan. I bargained with Alexander’s queen - life with honour and glory for you in Egypt, the land you love. Oh, Phocion, beloved, do not judge me hardly. You do not speak.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
There is something here I cannot understand.
#LYDIA.
I love you too much. Is that hard to understand?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Yet the love the Gods bring is otherwise … I think.
#PAULO.
Lucia! At last you return. My love, how I have missed you. It seemed so long. You are excited! Then my uneasiness was not for nothing. Tell me. An adventure, perhaps? An admirer, of course! This flush…! Little Child…!
#LUCIA.
I’ve been but a short hour, my Paulo. And, as for adventures and admirers, they have but one name - Paulo. How quick you are!
#PAULO.
Love makes me quick. I think I guess.
#LUCIA.
Listen! You hear?
#PAULO.
I hear, but I do not understand. It is the water only -
#LUCIA.
The rising water. Nor do I understand. It is my weakness, I suppose. All women have something that makes them fear without a reason, and this is mine -
#PAULO.
For which I love you all the more. For had you reasoned you would not have married me. Strange, strange.… See how it grows, Lucia. All that I scraped out yesterday I have repainted. Long before the Competition Day I shall have finished it. Look!
#LUCIA.
The glow, the warmth, the colour - you’ve caught it all?
#PAULO.
I hope so. But when my model and my critic desert me both at once like this -
#LUCIA.
Dear Paulo. And it’s so difficult for me to make five scudi do the work of ten. I know, oh, I know. Yet somehow, somehow we shall find a way. And it will be wonderful -
#PAULO.
It is you who are wonderful - intriguing with Fate as ever -
#LUCIA.
No, not intriguing. I am but your wife - and model.
#PAULO.
And inspiration -
#LUCIA.
And critic -
#PAULO.
And manager! That is the wonder - that you who fled with a painter to learn poverty like this and this and this should bargain so cleverly in the market - place and carry home our fish and vegetables in your coloured apron - the Lady Lucia, a house - wife of the people!
#LUCIA.
Forgetting the wine as usual, and dropping half the fish on my way! Love makes it beautiful. It is for love’s sake, Paulo.
#PAULO.
And the work’s sake.
#LUCIA.
The work, ah yes, the work’s sake. Oh, my Paulo, what would I not do - what would I not sacrifice for your advancement - I mean, for your art, your wonderful great art.
#PAULO.
This shall be our love’s first - fruits
#LUCIA.
Our love’s first - fruits.
#PAULO.
When you and I float over the lagoons as dust upon the wind - when you and I are gone - remembered, perhaps, only as Paulo the painter, and Lucia his inspiration - this beauty - ah, that is my dream - this beauty shall still shine out for the world.
#LUCIA.
I fear one thing only for you - poverty. You should have everything.
#PAULO.
I have. Everything that matters to an artist, and its name is inspiration.
#LUCIA.
You left Florence for my sake. But for me, the great Princes - the Medici - would have helped.
#PAULO.
We agreed - solemnly, you remember - never to mention your princely lover’s name. Nothing stops good painting like jealousy, and at that name I see blood.
#LUCIA.
Our Palace is too poor to house even that thin ghost. You have no need to think of jealousy.
#PAULO.
No need now, Lucia. In Venice we are safe from Damiano di Medici. Now, will you sit for me? I burn to work. Come! You must have roses in your hands. I will go to the flower - sellers by the bridge.
#LUCIA.
I would have brought them with me from the market - place - one scudi each! I hesitated -
#PAULO.
And bought ten sprats instead! My wonderful, clever house - wife. Without sprats to eat I never could paint roses! But I must have them. I shall be but a moment away, my love - a single moment that will seem like years! Farewell … Little Child.
#LUCIA.
Little Child! Ah, how I love that name, given to me with our first kiss. I love it better than my own. For somehow it seems my very own -
#PAULO.
It is your own. The little love - name that seems to travel like memory up the ages. I shall be back as soon as you are ready.
#LUCIA.
You! And so soon. It is too soon. I’ve had no time to prepare him yet - painter receives his patron without preparation surely -
#LUCIA.
Patron! You must not use that word to him, or all is ruined before it is even begun. You must remember -
#MEDICI.
“Must” to me! And “must” again! My gracious Lady Lucia forgets -
#LUCIA.
Nothing. She remembers that her husband, first of all, is proud, as I have already warned you. He does not yet know that I have been to see you - you, of all men in the world.
#MEDICI.
When you say “proud” you mean, I take it, jealous.
#LUCIA.
I mean both. Oh, Prince, you promised - I have your word that you would be guided in this by me.
#MEDICI.
I was in haste to see the picture -
#LUCIA.
But too great haste -
#MEDICI.
For he is, I swear truly, the man I need - his work, that is to say. As once, my Lady, you were the woman that I needed. But needs do not last for ever, nor is any indispensable - perhaps.
#LUCIA.
Oh, give me time, Prince, please. You do not want to lose him. I have your word and trust it. Will you not take your gondola to the islands - the sun is sweet upon the water - and return in half an hour? I - by that time I -
#MEDICI.
The light is sweet upon your face as well. What do you offer me in return for so great a favour?
#LUCIA.
I am the wife of Paulo Salviati.
#MEDICI.
And have, as I see, married poverty as well as genius! I was too slow for once, as now, it seems, I am too hasty. I should have asked - and taken - all before this fellow -
#LUCIA.
Poverty with Salviati is beauty for eternity. The wealth of a Florentine princess belongs to time.
#MEDICI.
And, therefore, you come humbly to ask me a favour.
#LUCIA.
One it should be an honour for you to grant - that you may share in giving eternal beauty to the world. Had I asked the Collona or the Calviere to see the work of a great painter whom poverty -
#MEDICI.
You came, instead, to me.
#LUCIA.
You have bought the palace on the Grand Canal and need a great - the greatest - painter for your ceiling -
#MEDICI.
Enthusiasm becomes you. You look divine with that passion in your eyes.
#LUCIA.
I am his model too, you see.
#MEDICI.
And that delicious gesture. A little more fire, a touch more of abandon, and I swear that - on certain conditions - oh, very small ones! - I would grant everything you ask.
#LUCIA.
An hour ago, when we talked together, you passed me your word. I appealed to you as lover of the beautiful - the best, the noblest in you. I was, it seems, mistaken, and our interview now had better end. I will call my husband.
#MEDICI.
This change from fire to ice is exquisite! But why so proud, fair Lady Lucia? You hear him coming? It is only the waves. The tide is rising still. That’s all.
#LUCIA.
Yes, rising, rising. Please leave me, Prince. No, no - please stay - a moment longer. Forgive me. Something - a vision - flashed upon me out of darkness. I am confused. I fear. Oh, I have done this very thing before -
#MEDICI.
But not with me, alas!
#LUCIA.
Forgive me. I thought only of myself. For a moment I forgot the work, the beauty that is his divine, his holy mission. Now I’m myself again. The water, the rising water - somehow - in some strange way - reminds me. Oh, I will be wise and loving in the noblest way. It is his need, his poverty, that drive me to ask a favour of you who once aspired to be my lover. Have you no pity? We fled from Florence to escape you - it is true. I would rather ask favours of any in the world but you -
#MEDICI.
And yet - And you are his model. You could live for ever on my ceiling! You are, indeed, a Goddess belonging to eternity!
#LUCIA.
And yet - yes, I came to you an hour ago - as patron. It is true. It was for his sake and for his great art I came. Oh, I ask no favour now more than a little time to talk with him. That is his voice. I will persuade him. I will gain his consent, and he will do the picture for you - for your palace. Leave me, I beg, a few moments with him alone, and then return - to find - I promise it - the greatest painter in all Italy -
#MEDICI.
In all the world.
#LUCIA.
Prepared to give you of his best.
#MEDICI.
To have you in my palace so is, perhaps, the next best thing to - have you in my -
#LUCIA.
Oh, I implore you. Leave me with him. I promise.
#MEDICI.
You have chosen the one spell that moves me. Even more strong than the love of a fair woman is my love of art - its wonder, its beauty, and its triumph. His picture will outlive even your loveliness. My name and my great palace will remind a later world of me, and of what I did for beauty. Well, well, my Lady Lucia, you win me over - for the moment, at any rate. I will stand behind this screen and listen. I must hear how you persuade genius to abjure its principles!
#LUCIA.
Then I do nothing. You must first go.
#MEDICI.
Another “must.” Your self - will is adorable. Upon my word! But I, too, have a “must” - his work, with yourself as model, on my palace ceiling!
#PAULO.
Only two! They were so dear. I have not your skill in bargains. We must make them do. Have I been very long? I had to go nearly to the Zucca.
#LUCIA.
Two roses added to our love makes a whole garden. And one day soon you shall lack nothing the work needs. Oh, Paulo, beloved, by rights everything should be yours now. There is not a painter in Italy who comes near you.
#PAULO.
I shall win the Competition. We shall have plenty then.
#LUCIA.
Your art needs it now. I am so useless to you - and yet -
#PAULO.
And yet - ? Lucia, this anxiety, this nervousness is strange to you. You use unaccustomed words. “Useless”! What can you mean?
#LUCIA.
You would never be angry - you would not scold me, no matter what I might do - for your work’s sake?
#PAULO.
You have such darling moods. I love you. The work is ours, not mine. I understand so well. It is your love that makes you tremble for the work’s sake: the picture grows, the Competition Day comes nearer. It’s like the sea - tides rising - it affects you - I understand!
#LUCIA.
Yes, yes. You always know. You’re always right. An inner tide seems rising in me as the time draws near. You understand my woman’s moods, and so forgive them.
#PAULO.
Picture the scene, as we used to do when scudi were very scarce. It always makes us happy - the brilliant forecast.
#LUCIA.
Tell me again. I love to hear it all.
#PAULO.
The judging will be in the Council Hall where the Doge holds high state, crowded with the noblest and loveliest of all Venice. The pictures chosen for the final verdict - that’s Vernio’s and Marco Gagliano’s, and mine - I mean ours - of course - will stand apart on easels. And on a pillar in front of them shines the jewelled casket with the thousand gold pieces that Venice bestows - a mere trifle - upon him she decrees the greatest artist -
#LUCIA.
And the pillar is garlanded with roses - more than these two, but not more lovely, Paulo.
#PAULO.
Of course. And the competitors waiting in a hungry, anxious group -
#LUCIA.
YOU. on’t be hungry. I’ll have so many sprats the night before -
#PAULO.
I shan’t be anxious either.
#LUCIA.
You will be dressed in a new doublet of purple cloth. If we can buy no golden thread for the embroidery I shall weave this across it. You’ll look magnificent -
#PAULO.
The picture -
#LUCIA.
Still more magnificent. They won’t know which to look at -
#PAULO.
Then they’ll squint.
#LUCIA.
The judge will call aloud your name: Paulo Salviati. You will be victor, and all the Assembly will rise to honour you -
#PAULO.
The work. My art, not me. My art, my work - What is it, Little Child?
#LUCIA.
N - nothing, Paulo. I - I merely thought a moment of those other painters, of Vernio, of Gagliano, the favoured ones who have wealthy patrons, so that they can work in ease and comfort, lacking nothing -
#PAULO.
Except my inspiration - and my liberty. Think what that means. My work is done in freedom, and must surpass their best since it is bought of luxury. What artist, no matter his genius, that can see truth while a patron jogs his brush, bidding him do this and that, set here a touch of gold and there of scarlet, put here a flower, a bird, and there a - a - a sprat - ! Why not? It is the soul alone that sees truth, and such men have sold their souls. They will be paid accordingly.
#LUCIA.
There are some patrons who - it is said - give freedom, liberty too.
#PAULO.
I never heard their names.
#LUCIA.
There are some who know, who understand better. They say the Medicis -
#PAULO.
Such painters and their patrons live for time, not for eternity, my Little Child. And among them the worst - the very worst - is that Florentine whose best claim to merit is that he dared to aspire to your love.
#LUCIA.
I hate and despise him. Yet I dread his help - for others. He is as great in influence almost as his elder brother, Cosimo.
#PAULO.
Bah!
#LUCIA.
Forgive me, Paulo - I reproach myself often that we fled from him - from Florence - where he might - oh, he could have done so much for you - his patronage.
#PAULO.
The mere name, as you see, stops me painting. You must not speak of it, here least of all in our place of work, of worship. Patronage - bah! My fire would go out, my inspiration leave me, my soul die in bondage. I must have liberty.
#LUCIA.
The Madonna help me! Paulo, beloved, see what I have brought you - something your picture needs. My present and my surprise. No questions, now!
#PAULO.
That very broidery we saw together! Lucia - Little Child! How did you pay for it, or - or did you steal it? The merchant asked ten lira, I remember - and we had but three. The colour of wine and pomegranate! Gorgeous! How did you pay for it? Quick, tell me. The long gold earrings! Your last jewel! Lucia! I’ll kiss your ears till they leave blushes you cannot sell, fairer than any jewels, for they are the kisses of my soul which sees eternal beauty.
#LUCIA.
Would that I had a whole casket of both kinds, my Paulo! Of one kind I would sell all. You should have a studio with north light, the best paints that can be bought, the choicest hangings, the fairest models, and - and, oh, everything these others possess who have not risked all for Love and brought a wife from Florence -
#PAULO.
Hush, hush, Little Child! You have given all you had - and that is everything. My art, if it is inspired as we dream, is stronger than circumstances, and will conquer. And I have liberty - love, beauty, liberty! What more can I ask of Heaven? Come, see the picture with me a moment. Let us look at it together.
#LUCIA.
The Gods painted it.
#PAULO.
Your soul and mine, say rather. The hand is nothing. It is the inspiration. It was conceived, at least, in liberty - You whispered something? I did not catch it. Tell me, Little Child. You feel - ? Why, I declare, you tremble.
#LUCIA.
One thing, I fear, one thing alone! The golden bloom, the warmth, the joyous laughter and the richness all Venetians love. It will be judged with the work of - of others whom plenty and comfort and - and all that help which money can provide -
#PAULO.
Men who feed from their patron’s hands like obedient lap - dogs -
#LUCIA.
Madonna, help me! They have never to calculate if their blue paint can last till the sky is finished. Why, in Florence, the Medici gives his painters -
#PAULO.
That name again!
#LUCIA.
I chose it at random - by mistake. It slipped out, I mean. Oh, my too proud Paulo, if you only knew how I love your pride and worship it. I only thought - for a moment only - the merest foolish moment - that this young Medici - oh, he loves beauty too, he worships art and beauty - perhaps - I wondered - he might have helped in a way that even you could have accepted without losing your liberty. I reproach myself so -
#PAULO.
Lucia, I need no man’s help. I have told you. You doubt my art, my power, when you show this fear. It is fear that makes you reproach yourself. Our love knows no fear.
#LUCIA.
It is, perhaps, myself I fear, Paulo. A strange dread haunts me like a dream. I fear lest I injure your great work, your mission -
#PAULO.
You tremble still. You are excited. Tell me, Little Child - do you know something that you hide from me - that you cannot tell me?
#LUCIA.
Nothing, nothing, but my woman’s mood. My passion to help you is so great I sometimes fear lest I guide it wrongly - See, Paulo, the light is good, and we have this broidery you need - the very thing - exactly the tint and texture. I’ll sit for you. There is no time to lose. Some one might disturb us.
#PAULO.
Your mood is new. That is what disquiets me. You seem expectant almost. And this strange haste, Lucia? We never hurry!
#LUCIA.
Only that I long to see this colour in your picture - on the very canvas, alive and burning - before it is seen by - by others.
#PAULO.
Yet who should see it before the Competition Day?
#LUCIA.
Of course, of course. Still I am anxious. Time is precious. Oh, how lovely the silk lies on me! Look! And am I right? Paulo, I feel your brushes on my heart. Paint swiftly, beloved, swiftly.
#PAULO.
Beautiful! Perfect! Divine! There - just as you are now. Don’t move! Even your heart must stop!
#LUCIA.
Madonna, help me!
#PAULO.
She does. Have no fear for the result. Now, talk to me while I work - no movement, mind! Just words. I love the music of your voice. It soothes and blesses me. The gossip of the market - place, for instance?
#LUCIA.
Ah, well, then the Eros will interest you - the one we coveted so.… It’s gone from the merchant’s booth at last.
#PAULO.
Our Grecian Eros! Our little statue! I shall miss it. I wonder who bought it. Or has it flown back to Samos, starved with yearning, on our summer wind? Some day we’ll follow it. Greece! Glorious mother of artists! My heart lies there - sometimes, I almost think, my memory too. Who bought our Eros? Did you hear that as well?
#LUCIA.
The critics say that in your art Greece has come back to life again.
#PAULO.
Who bought it, Lucia? Your head to the right a little - so. great Prince, a stranger to Venice, they said, who has bought the Cavaliere Palazzo on the Grand Canal. Gossip is full of it. He has sworn to make it more beautiful than Cosimo Medici’s in Florence -
#PAULO.
That odious name again! It haunts you, Little Child! Don’t move! don’t move! The pose is perfect.
#LUCIA.
Haunts the gossip of the town, rather - for which you asked me, Signor! The ceilings are to be painted with classical scenes alone - the loves of Apollo, and Athena’s triumph.
#PAULO.
What subjects! And I know that Palazzo. Its ceilings are superb, enormous! Painting the very sky! It’s coming, it’s coming, the very colour I wanted. Yes, yes, they are the biggest in all Venice, so I’m told. Now, just suppose, Lucia - just suppose that one day -
#LUCIA.
Paulo, beloved, do not stop. Paint on quickly. You are in your best vein. Paint on before - before the light changes. Yes, and I heard one other thing.
#PAULO.
Ah!
#LUCIA.
That this Prince will commission the winner of the Competition -
#PAULO.
To paint those ceilings! Not unlikely, Lucia! There are menial fellows enough with talent who would do it. I - win or lose - I accept no commission tainted by patronage. And I shall win. What was this Prince’s name?
#LUCIA.
And those ceilings might be yours!
#PAULO.
Who is he?
#LUCIA.
S - some said one thing, some another. I -
#PAULO.
The merchant must have delivered his Eros - to somebody - somewhere.
#LUCIA.
He didn’t say. I didn’t ask him. It was the gondolier as I came home. Oh, Paulo, I cannot sit well for you if you cross - question me like this! You’re like a judge. I love you so. Why should you suspect - ?
#PAULO.
Suspect! You! Clear water cannot hide the reflections in it. Even if your love guided you amiss, I - I could never think, and far less use - that ugly word! Lucia! Little Child! You tremble -
#MOTHER.
Signor! Signora! A great gentleman comes for you. His gondola is already at the steps. I heard him give orders to wait. I ran on to warn you.
#LUCIA.
Already!
#PAULO.
Great gentleman! Asking for - us!
#MOTHER.
He is no Venetian. By his liveries he must be a Prince at least, and a great one. Your dress, Signora! He’s come to buy the Signor’s pictures! Your fortune’s made. Oh, happy day! I will open the gate for him, so he will not know you have no servant.
#PAULO.
I do not understand. You can explain this to me - Little Child - perhaps?
#LUCIA.
Paulo, Paulo, do not be angry. Oh, forgive me, I implore. For your dear sake - for your work, your art - for you, I did it. It is not me he comes to see. It is your work, your picture. I went this very day - but an hour ago - to make him come. Oh, tell me, tell me I have not done wrong!
#PAULO.
Damiano di Medici! Here!
#LUCIA.
Paulo! Paulo!
#MEDICI.
At your service, Signor Salviati. Signora bellissima! Am I too early still? My promise - you remember - I was impatient to fulfil it.
#PAULO.
Promise! What can a Prince of the Medici promise to my wife?
#MEDICI.
That which only the proudest painter may receive gladly from a humble prince: appreciation of his work.
#PAULO.
My work is not done for the appreciation of princes. I have no work to show.
#MEDICI.
Your wife, Signor, said otherwise. And she is a rare judge of values. A faultless critic!
#PAULO.
The Prince di Medici knows.
#LUCIA.
Oh, do not anger him. And think a little of me. You forget the risk - for your sake - that I ran - your career -
#PAULO.
Love led you a strange errand.
#LUCIA.
For the work’s sake, my Paulo.
#MEDICI.
The Medici have short memories for their failures. Her courage - in coming to visit me - was even more rare than her - her judgment.
#PAULO.
She went to see you - yes. It was a mistaken courage that earned you a favour of that kind.
#MEDICI.
Even in Venice a Medici does not receive strangers - without a name - or, shall I say, whose name is yet to win. Your wife, Signor, had the courage to get her way to me past half a hundred lacqueys. But more! She had the eloquence and wit to persuade my return visit - here. She assured me your picture was worthy of my personal, my immediate inspection.
#LUCIA.
Paulo, beloved - by our love, by little Eros , by everything!
#MEDICI.
With your permission. You will, perhaps, forgive the liberty. The light fails suddenly a little. So -
#PAULO.
For your sake, Little Child, I endure this cruelty.
#LUCIA.
I yearned to help -
#PAULO.
So it was he who bought the Eros too? This is an evil omen. I thought us safe in Venice.
#LUCIA.
You are so calm, so quiet. You terrify. I would fear your anger less. Oh, my great Paulo, my dear, listen to me one moment. This family - this man - vile though he be - loves art and beauty, and in so far is not - Oh, I mean - oh, Paulo, it is his ceilings, his palace, his help to your career that have betrayed me! You could bring Greece to life in Venice - and for ever. Think not of him. Think only of your beauty - lighting the world when he is dust -
#PAULO.
Is my art so poor a thing - have you so misunderstood it - that you think it is for sale?
#LUCIA.
Have I done that!
#MEDICI.
You have been taught of the Gods - the Gods of Greece.
#PAULO.
Your praise -
#LUCIA.
Hush, oh, I beg you - for my sake.
#MEDICI.
The drawing is the equal of del Sarto’s and the composition no poorer than da Vinci’s. I swear it. Yet - the colour - hmm - I miss Titian’s glory. Those shadows are out of tone a little -
#LUCIA.
We ran out of blue that day, alas -
#MEDICI.
Your model was, certainly, perfect. But why have you painted the nymphs from her as well as their divine mistress?
#LUCIA.
Models demand impossible prices -
#MEDICI.
So little more, and it were a masterpiece. Even now it should win the Competition, by rights. Yet Vernio’s is just a shade more rich, more splendid. I have seen it. And Gagliano has a purer colour. But then, of course, Gagliano buys his paint from that fellow by the Zucca who has a secret method - and charges accordingly, the scoundrel!
#PAULO.
I paint as I desire, and as I can. The picture is mine. And not for sale!
#MEDICI.
I admire your spirit, Signor. It has the independence of ancient Greece herself. Yet at what price? You may be satisfied with yourself, but your art thereby suffers. It becomes a slave of your conditions - if you will allow the language.
#LUCIA.
Oh, it must be so! Paulo, it must be so! You see?
#PAULO.
Conditions that leave the spirit free, at least. The spirit of beauty owns no master -
#MEDICI.
The husband of such beauty should be more gracious. Ah, Salviati, you speak to a Medici, indeed, but also to one who loves beauty as you yourself do. I might - had I persisted - have taken your golden bird in my own net. It is my pleasure now to set you free from the hard conditions that enslave you. In this way can a Medici reward good for evil. Signor, I forgive all for the sake of your genius. I admire your picture - its true classic spirit. Yet it has not quite the warmth, the fire, the bounteous splendour we Italians ask. Give but your sky a deeper hue, add to that robe the undertone of scarlet it needs to make it felt, flood our prodigal Italian sunshine over it all - and I will buy your picture at your price.
#LUCIA.
Yes, yes. Oh, Paulo, what an offer! Think!
#PAULO.
It is not for sale.
#MEDICI.
While you may still enter it for the Competition. The judges - er - may hear that Damiano di Medici has bought it for his new Palazzo - and - judge - accordingly.
#PAULO.
The gold, the blue, the scarlet you desire - I mean, suggest - are not in my scheme.
#MEDICI.
Yet they would add the perfect touch now lacking - in my judgment, Signor. Come, now, I will go further. I have sworn that my Palazzo shall surpass even that of Cosimo, my ambitious brother, in Florence. I will have a Gorgione for his Lippo Lippi, and - if you will - a Salviati for his da Vinci. I offer you, further, the painting of my ceilings, Signor - seven years’ inspired and happy labour.
#PAULO.
Seven years of bondage to another’s taste and purse.
#LUCIA.
You could do your own work too.
#MEDICI.
Why not?
#PAULO.
To add this gold and blue and scarlet is - for me - a lie.
#LUCIA.
Oh, my beloved, think, think a little, and weigh your words!
#MEDICI.
My offer stands - but not against unreasonable resistance. I repeat it: this picture at your figure, and seven years to paint the ceilings, with a certain freedom in design and subject, and permission to do your own work in your leisure. It is a matter to conclude now quickly. It is not amusing, though it may be novel, for a Medici to be thwarted of his will - his deep design. poor painter dares the novelty.
#LUCIA.
You forget everything, Paulo - me you forget even - when you say such words!
#MEDICI.
Beauty has turned your head, maybe. Excess, I have heard it said, can affect the reason. You have too much beauty. But there are remedies -
#PAULO.
I do not understand you.
#MEDICI.
As a great patron, I have my duties too. If the possession of too much beauty threaten your great gift, I owe it to the world to help - to save you.
#PAULO.
I prefer plain spoken language from a man - even though he be patron.
#LUCIA.
Oh, guard your tongue at least! The Prince is patient with us.
#MEDICI.
You robbed me once of beauty I desired. You fled from Florence. I accepted with a smile, and did not bestir myself to follow and prevent - as I could well have done. I was too kind, perhaps -
#LUCIA.
But, great Prince, you - you have forgotten all that. You swore -
#MEDICI.
The sight of beauty stirs my memory again. For beauty grows, it seems.
#LUCIA.
My Lord! Oh, Paulo, hold yourself! Am I so little to you?
#MEDICI.
And this increase of beauty makes me remember something I had - as you say - forgotten. To see him who robbed me become my dependant - would have the true Grecian touch of comedy. Salviati - before the light fails, will you now dip your brush in the gold and scarlet we suggested?
#PAULO.
Never! Even in fading light I see only truth.
#LUCIA.
Ah! Oh!
#MEDICI.
There are many flowers in my gardens, but Italy holds one Salviati only. My ceilings need him. I swore, besides, to Cosimo -
#LUCIA.
My Lord, my Lord, you promised - !
#MEDICI.
That I would see the work and offer my patronage - if it pleased me. That offer still holds good. But your husband is obstinate -
#PAULO.
I am true. I claim only liberty.
#MEDICI.
So I must remember my duties as a patron - and apply remedies that may save his unreason - and his - art.
#LUCIA.
What can you mean - ?
#MEDICI.
Ho! Ho! Without there! Take the woman, but do not hurt her.
#LUCIA.
Ah, Dios! Madonna, help me! Alive - never! Paulo! Paulo!
#PAULO.
Never while I live either.
#MEDICI.
Disarm him - gently, gently. No injury. Who bruises that right hand of his answers with his life, remember! Strike up the dagger instantly.
#MEN.
For a painter he fights well. Careful there! His hand - your sword’s point! His right hand, yes. Be wary. This is rare sport. Have you got the arm? Hold fast. I’ve got the dagger. He’s safe, my Lord.
#LUCIA.
Paulo, my Paulo! Oh, that I were dead, to have done this thing!
#PAULO.
My soul stands by yours. I know you true. Fear nothing!
#MEDICI.
Signor Salviati, I regret that my sense of duty - my deep desire that you shall achieve your greatest - force me to this unpleasant remedy. But poverty is not helpful to your work, and I must - as patron of unreasonable genius - protect your art and yourself. I offer, therefore, the best help in my power. If you accept - then I need take nothing from your store of beauty.
#PAULO.
Dios! This cruelty - this treachery!
#LUCIA.
No, no, no. Paulo, do not think of me -
#PAULO.
It is too late. Your vile scheme means this, then: that I submit my art to your paid dictation, become your creature, or you will - Let me free! This bastard is not fit to live.
#A MAN.
Hush! He is a Medici - Cosimo’s own brother.
#MEDICI.
My gondola waits. My new Palazzo lies but half an hour distant - ready to welcome its first fair ornament.
#PAULO.
To be broken and thrown away when done with! Death is better now.
#MEDICI.
Careful. Hold him. Or your lives -
#LUCIA.
Beloved, it is not too late. Forget that I live - oh, forget me - for your work’s sake! Remember beauty only -
#PAULO.
Little Child! My work and beauty live with liberty. Had you forgotten? Did belief in me waver, or did love guide you strangely - misconceiving - ?
#MEDICI.
The light fails rapidly. The gold and scarlet should be laid on now, before dusk falls. One of you go and prepare my gondola - for a lady. Lay a soft silken scarf upon the cushion - there must be no screams in Venice. Oh, I will do it gently, Signor, with my own two hands. There shall be no roughness, no unkindness. Oh, here is the very thing. You will take this small attention from me, I beg, if nothing else.
#LUCIA.
I hate you! Your touch is poison.
#MEDICI.
You should not ask favours, then, of those who poison you. For the mouth I have a yet softer silk, as you shall see. Ah, the Medici, they say, are fortunate in love, and I shall find a way to win you. These arms I am forced to bind shall yet twine willingly about my neck -
#PAULO.
All I possess to him who kills him!
#MEDICI.
All you possess!
#PAULO.
And more - my liberty. Let her go!
#MEDICI.
So reason returns, at last. The remedy works already towards a cure.
#PAULO.
Set her free. I give my word.
#MEDICI.
Though I trust no man, I trust your word, Salviati.
#PAULO.
Unfasten me. Give me my palette.
#MEDICI.
Release him. Release the lady too. But watch him closely, lest he hide a weapon.
#PAULO.
This is my only weapon With it I put chains upon my soul. So - and so.
#MEDICI.
Improved already! So swiftly! You are, indeed, the greatest of them all. We shall beat Verio out of court, and Gagliano will die of envy on the spot. Begone with you! No, stay a moment - take the picture with you and lay it carefully in the gondola. It shall be finished under my own eye - before the ceilings are begun. Carefully! One smear and your lives are forfeit. You are not quick to thank me, Signora, yet I have fulfilled my promise to you. All that you begged of me is accomplished. Henceforth Salviati, your husband, shall work in comfort and lack nothing.
#LUCIA.
How - how could I have done this thing? What ancient deep perversity - what lack of faith - what hidden destiny in me? Paulo, look, look at me! Hark!
#MEDICI.
So you will not thank me - either one of you? No matter. I like a little spirit. Carefully, now! The edges safe. No flick of dust, mind.
#LUCIA.
Hark! It is another sound I hear. Paulo! It is water. The rising water! You hear? That sound is in my soul. Paulo - I half remember - something - that hides behind it, yet comes with it. I have done this thing before - destroyed you - with my selfish love.
#PAULO.
Hush, hush!
#LUCIA.
You look so strangely at me. Your face changes. Dios! Speak to me, beloved! If you cannot forgive - say that you understand. Oh, what is it in your eyes?
#PAULO.
The night is coming - with her stars. In my eyes is only love. There is nothing to forgive. Where is the gold - the scarlet? What is my Lord’s desire?
#LUCIA.
Oh, I have killed - killed again.
#PAULO.
Little Child!
#MEDICI.
She is even more beautiful than I first thought. Well, well, the picture is mine at any rate, and she - A good evening’s work. How dark it grows. And the rising tide is at the full. Ho! Without there! My gondola!
#MRS. LATTIN.
Where am I? Florence … Greece … Egypt … where are they? I am back again. But who am I?
#DR. BEVAN.
You are your Past.
#MRS. LATTIN.
I slept? But yet I lived it. I understand at last. I have found life.
#DR. BEVAN.
YOU. annot die, nor can you sleep.
#MRS. LATTIN.
But time.…
#DR. BEVAN.
Is the body’s measuring.
#MRS. LATTIN.
It was not a dream. I was in Greece with Phocion … with Paulo in Italy … with.… Oh, it is too long ago, too far away. It’s fading. Oh, I would not forget!
#DR. BEVAN.
The results lie in you. That is memory.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Each time I injured … thwarted the highest in him by my selfish love. How small my love! Oh, tell me it is not now too late.…
#DR. BEVAN.
There is no “too late.” What he could do without was added to him. You have taught Menophis, Phocion and Paulo to become … Phillip.
#MRS. LATTIN.
I understand at last, and I am healed. I delayed Menophis. I shall inspire Phillip. I shall go with him … back to … Egypt. Phocion, Paulo, how happy they will be!
#DR. BEVAN.
He is coming now. I leave you.
#MRS. LATTIN.
But he must see you too.…
#DR. BEVAN.
He cannot.
#PHILLIP.
You rang. I just slipped back to see -
#MRS. LATTIN.
Phocion … my faithful.…
#PHILLIP.
Eh? Are you all right? I mustn’t stay. Doctor Ogilvie will be here any minute.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Paulo … my dear one.… I -
#PHILLIP.
You slept a moment probably. Good! You look … so much better!
#MRS. LATTIN.
He came. And I am healed.
#NURSE.
Dr. Ogilvie has just telephoned. He is detained. He cannot get here till seven o’clock.
#PHILLIP.
All right. Hush!
#MRS. LATTIN.
He told me … showed me … everything.
#PHILLIP.
He gave you hope - the best? I see it in your eyes.
#MRS. LATTIN.
It’s not - I am not - too late. That’s all.
#PHILLIP.
Hush! Hush! Lie quiet a little longer. You mean the doctor says - ?
#MRS. LATTIN.
I am so happy. I know and understand now. It’s glorious.
#PHILLIP.
My darling! Gently, gently! Do not excite yourself. Lie still and sleep, if you can, again. He has given you something? Later, you shall tell me -
#MRS. LATTIN.
Ah, your great patient strength! It is too wonderful. And to think that my weakness helped, my selfish - !
#PHILLIP.
The lamp is in your eyes. I’ll move it. Do not stir. There, is that better?
#MRS. LATTIN.
Thank you, but I do not mind the light. I mind nothing. Thank you , Phillip. Ah, it is Phillip! I know you again - as you are - to - day!
#PHILLIP.
Mary!
#MRS. LATTIN.
Not Mary: Little Child.
#PHILLIP.
My - Little Child.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Phillip, dear heart, I’ve seen - I’ve seen my past - with you.
#PHILLIP.
Yes, yes. When you’re more rested you shall tell me everything. Your dreams -
#MRS. LATTIN.
I must speak now. I’ve seen our past.
#PHILLIP.
Tell me, then, dearest, tell me. Then you must lie still -
#MRS. LATTIN.
Life!
#PHILLIP.
Life!
#MRS. LATTIN.
I have recovered. I love you more - but differently. I can forgive myself at last.
#PHILLIP.
Recovery! Forgiveness! I do not understand.
#MRS. LATTIN.
You have not seen. I understand for both of us.
#PHILLIP.
You have had dreams that troubled you. I implore you, dearest -
#MRS. LATTIN.
Look in my face. There is no trouble there - but only joy and life.
#PHILLIP.
Yes, yes, but - my darling, what can you mean?
#MRS. LATTIN.
He came - and went.
#PHILLIP.
And left one word behind him only - ?
#MRS. LATTIN.
One word - Life.
#PHILLIP.
Then - ?
#MRS. LATTIN.
I shall go back with you.
#PHILLIP.
To Egypt!
#MRS. LATTIN.
I shall never delay or thwart again. Ah, so many times I have - by my selfish love - Your work is a mission - always. It is your soul’s career. I understand at last.
#PHILLIP.
Hush, hush, Little Child! You say wild things. I could never hear of it. I know your dread, your shrinking fear of Egypt. It would make you ill again. All the doctors agreed -
#MRS. LATTIN.
I have no dread! My shrinking was - a memory. It was instinctive - a cowardice that shirked sweet expiation - there, where it is due. I am well again. I shall go back with you. Your work - my work - lies out there - in Egypt. Oh, Phillip, be glad with me, for I am forgiven, I am healed!
#PHILLIP.
Dear heart! Your soul is too grand for this frail, precious body. You injure yourself. Such sacrifice from you I could never, never -
#MRS. LATTIN.
It is no sacrifice. It is love, love, love!
#PHILLIP.
That deep love I never doubted. But - the ingrained dread, the fear, the shrinking that have undermined your willing strength. How can you - ?
#MRS. LATTIN.
They are gone for ever. Phillip, how often must I tell you? I am healed. I go back with you. We go together. Our life is there, in Egypt.
#PHILLIP.
I feel some great new reality in you. You are most wonderfully changed. Some star of life is rising over us - again. If - if -
#MRS. LATTIN.
You must at once withdraw your resignation. There is no “too late”! You promise me!
#PHILLIP.
I will see the doctor myself. I promise that if he -
#MRS. LATTIN.
YOU. annot.
#PHILLIP.
Cannot! You mean - you have had a vision?
#MRS. LATTIN.
He has - gone.
#PHILLIP.
It was a vision…?
#MRS. LATTIN.
Egypt - where I first delayed and thwarted him, loving him for myself alone - Egypt, beneath your risen stars, beside your rising river - I shall undo - at last.
#PHILLIP.
Little Child! It is very strange. Almost, it seems, some dream, some memory of long, long ago stirs in me. It is beyond me somewhere, but there is great beauty - that deep, unearthly Egyptian beauty in it. Those palms are rustling, those stars seem to move, the Nile flows down towards the sea. Perhaps.… The Tear of Isis falls.…
#MRS. LATTIN.
Listen … yes…!
#PHILLIP.
Something about you, something new and - and familiar almost - steals upon me. I half believe.…
#MRS. LATTIN.
Phillip, my faithful one, I heard another name as you said that. I heard an ancient name - was it Menophis?
#PHILLIP.
I thought a name came to me too. It floated past - Nefertiti. It must have been the beating of your heart against my own.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Dear, ancient names. How sweet they sound!
#PHILLIP.
I think we are bewitched!
#MRS. LATTIN.
Egypt! I understand - at last.
#PHILLIP.
All but one thing.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Which is - ?
#PHILLIP.
That what you call delay has helped and taught me.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Perhaps I understand that too. That which the soul can do without is added to it. Is it not that?
#PHILLIP.
Ah, you put it so. Perhaps you put it better. I only know that you have given me the thing I needed most - perspective, the longer sight. My vision clears. I feel new power for my work. I see it whole.
#MRS. LATTIN.
Then my forgiveness is complete.
