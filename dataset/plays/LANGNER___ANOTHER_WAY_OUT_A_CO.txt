#MRS. ABBEY.
Breakfast is ready, ma'am.
#MARGARET.
Pommy dear. Breakfast is on the table.
#PENDLETON.
I'll be there in a moment.
#MARGARET.
I thought you were going to stop smoking before breakfast.
#PENDLETON.
My dear, I can't possibly stand the taste of tooth paste in my mouth all day.
#MRS. ABBEY.
Anything the matter, sir?
#PENDLETON.
Dear, dear! My breakfast is quite spoiled again.
#MRS. ABBEY.
Spoiled, sir?
#PENDLETON.
Look at those flowers, Mrs. Abbey. Not only are they quite out of harmony with the color scheme in this room, but they're positively red, and you know I have a perfect horror of red.
#MRS. ABBEY.
But you like them that color sometimes, sir. What am I to do when you're so temperamental about 'em.
#MARGARET.
Temperamental. I should say bad - tempered.
#MRS. ABBEY.
Oh no, ma'am. It isn't bad temper. I understand Mr. Pendleton. It's just another bad night he's had, that's what it is.
#PENDLETON.
Mrs. Abbey, you appear to have an intimate knowledge of how I pass the nights. It's becoming quite embarrassing.
#MRS. ABBEY.
You mustn't mind an old woman like me, sir.
#PENDLETON.
There! That confounded piano again!
#MARGARET.
And they always play the Wedding March. There must be an old maid living there.
#MRS. ABBEY.
They're doing that for a reason.
#MARGARET.
What reason?
#MRS. ABBEY.
Their cook tole me yesterday that her missus thinks if she keeps on a - playing of the Wedding March, p'raps it'll give you an' Mr. Pendleton the idea of getting married. She don't believe in couples livin' to - gether, like you an' Mr. Pendleton.
#MARGARET.
No?
#MRS. ABBEY.
And I just said you an' Mr. Pendleton had been living together so long, it was my opinion you might just as well be married an' done with it.
#MARGARET.
Your opinion is quite uncalled for, Mrs. Abbey.
#PENDLETON.
Why shouldn't Mrs. Abbey give us her opinion? It may be valuable. Look at her experiences in matrimony.
#MRS. ABBEY.
In matrimony, and out of it, too.
#MARGARET.
But Mrs. Abbey has no right to discuss our affairs with other people's maids.
#MRS. ABBEY.
I'll be glad to quit if I don't suit the mistress.
#MARGARET.
There! Mistress again! How often have I asked you not to refer to me as the mistress?
#MRS. ABBEY.
No offense, ma'am.
#PENDLETON.
You'd better see if there's any mail, Mrs. Abbey, and take those flowers away with you.
#MRS. ABBEY.
Very well, sir.
#MARGARET.
What an old - fashioned point of view Mrs. Abbey has.
#MARGARET.
Pommy, why do you stoop so?
#PENDLETON.
Am I stooping?
#MARGARET.
I'm tired of telling you. You ought to take more exercise.
#MARGARET.
One reason why the Greeks were the greatest of artists was because they cultivated the body as carefully as the mind.
#PENDLETON.
Oh! Hang the Greeks!
#MRS. ABBEY.
There are your letters, sir. And these are yours, ma'am.
#MARGARET.
How delightful! Tom Del Valli has asked us to a party at his studio next Friday.
#PENDLETON.
Both of us?
#MARGARET.
Yes, and Helen Marsden wants us for Saturday.
#PENDLETON.
Both of us?
#MARGARET.
Yes, and here's one from Bobby Watson for Sunday.
#PENDLETON.
Both of us?
#MARGARET.
Yes.
#PENDLETON.
Really, Margaret, this is becoming exasperating. Here are four more, I suppose for both of us. People keep on inviting us out together time after time as though we were the most conventional married couple on God's earth.
#MARGARET.
Do you object to going out with me?
#PENDLETON.
No, it isn't that. But we're having too much of a good thing. And I've come to the conclusion that it's your fault.
#MARGARET.
Oh! it's my fault? Of course you'd blame me. Why?
#PENDLETON.
Because you have such an absurd habit of boasting to people of your devotion for me, when we're out.
#MARGARET.
You surely don't expect me to quarrel with you in public?
#PENDLETON.
It isn't necessary to go to that extent. But then everybody believes that we're utterly, almost stupidly in love with one another, what can you expect?
#MARGARET.
You said once you never wanted me to suppress anything.
#PENDLETON.
That was before we began to live together.
#MARGARET.
What could I have done?
#PENDLETON.
Anything just so we could have a little more freedom instead of being tied to one another the way we are. Never a moment when we're not together, never a day when I'm not interviewed by special article writers from almost every paper and magazine in the country, as the only successful exponent of the theory that love can be so perfect that the marriage contract degrades it. I put it to you, Margaret, if this is a free union it is simply intolerable!
#MARGARET.
But aren't we living together so as to have more freedom? Think of what it might be if we were married. Didn't you once write that "When marriage comes in at the door, freedom flies out at the window"?
#PENDLETON.
Are we any better off, with everybody treating us as though we were living together to prove a principle?
#MARGARET.
Well, aren't we incidently? You said so yourself. We can be a beautiful example to other people, and show them how to lead the pure natural lives of the later Greeks?
#PENDLETON.
Damn the later Greeks! Why do you always throw those confounded later Greeks in my face? We've got to look at it from our standpoint. This situation must come to an end.
#MARGARET.
What can we do?
#PENDLETON.
It rests with you.
#MARGARET.
With me?
#PENDLETON.
You can compromise yourself with somebody publicly. That'll put an end to everything.
#MARGARET.
How will that end it?
#PENDLETON.
It'll break down the morally sanctified atmosphere in which we're living. Then perhaps, people will regard us as immoral and treat us like decent human beings again.
#MARGARET.
But I don't want to compromise myself.
#PENDLETON.
If you believe in your own ideas, you must.
#MARGARET.
But why should I have to do it?
#PENDLETON.
It will be so easy for you.
#MARGARET.
Why can't we both be compromised? That would be better still.
#PENDLETON.
I should find it a bore. You, unless my memory fails me, would enjoy it.
#MARGARET.
You needn't be cynical. Even if you don't enjoy it, you can work it into a novel.
#PENDLETON.
It's less exertion to imagine an affair of that sort, and the result would probably be more saleable. Besides I have no interest whatsoever in women, at least, in the women we know.
#MARGARET.
For that matter, I don't know any eligible men.
#PENDLETON.
What about Bob Lockwood?
#MARGARET.
But he's your best friend!
#PENDLETON.
Exactly - no man ever really trusts his best friend. He'll probably compromise you without compunction.
#MARGARET.
I'm afraid he'd be too dangerous - he tells you all his secrets. Whom will you choose?
#PENDLETON.
It's a matter of complete indifference to me.
#MARGARET.
I've heard a lot of queer stories about Jean Roberts. How would she do?
#PENDLETON.
Margaret, I don't mind being party to a flirtation - but I draw the line at being the victim of a seduction.
#MARGARET.
Why not leave it to chance? Let it be the next interesting woman you meet.
#PENDLETON.
That might be amusing. But there must be an age limit. And how about you?
#MARGARET.
Me! Why not the new model who is coming to - day to pose for my Apollo?
#PENDLETON.
Well, if he's anything like that, you ought to be able to create a sensation. Then, perhaps, we shall have some real freedom.
#MARGARET.
Pommy, do you still love me as much as you did?
#PENDLETON.
How you sentimentalize! Do you think I'd be willing to enter into a flirtation with a strange woman, if I didn't want to keep on living with you?
#MARGARET.
And we won't have to break up our little home, will we?
#PENDLETON.
No, anything to save the home. My God! If any of my readers should hear me say that! To think that I, Pomeroy Pendleton, should be trying to save my own home. And yet, how characteristically paradoxical.
#MARGARET.
You are going to philosophize! Give me a kiss.
#PENDLETON.
I have some work to do - I must go. kiss!
#PENDLETON.
There let me go.
#MARGARET.
I want a real kiss.
#PENDLETON.
Don't be silly, dear, I can't play this morning. I've simply got to finish my last chapter.
#MRS. ABBEY.
There's a lady to see Mr. Pendleton.
#MARGARET.
Tell her to come in!
#PENDLETON.
But, Margaret!
#MARGARET.
Remember! The first woman you meet!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Good morning, Mr. Pendleton, I'm the Baroness de Meauville!
#PENDLETON.
Baroness de Meauville? Ah, the costumiere?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Not a costumiere, Mr. Pendleton, I am an artist, an artist in modern attire. A woman is to me what a canvas is to a painter.
#PENDLETON.
Excuse me for receiving you in my dressing gown. I was at work.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
I like to see men in dressing gowns - yours is charming.
#PENDLETON.
Do you like it? I designed it myself.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
How few really creative artists there are in America.
#PENDLETON.
You flatter me.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Not at all. You must know that I'm a great admirer of yours, Mr. Pendleton. I've read every one of your books. I feel I know you as an old friend.
#PENDLETON.
That's very nice of you!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Will you smoke?
#PENDLETON.
Thanks.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Mr. Pendleton, I have a mission in life. It is to make the American woman the best dressed woman in the world. I came here to - day because I want you to help me.
#PENDLETON.
But I have no ambitions in that direction.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Why should you have ambitions? Only the bourgeoisie have ambitions. We artists have inspirations. I want to breathe into you the spirit of my great undertaking. Already I have opened my place in the smartest part of the Avenue. Already I have drawn my assistants from all parts of the world. Nothing is lacking to complete my plans but you.
#PENDLETON.
Me? Why me?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Are you not considered one of the foremost men of letters in America?
#PENDLETON.
Didn't you say you had read all my books?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Are you not the only writer who has successfully portrayed the emotional side of American life?
#PENDLETON.
Yes.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Exactly. That is why I have chosen you to write my advertisements.
#PENDLETON.
But, Baroness!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
You're not going to say that. It's so ordinary.
#PENDLETON.
But, but, you want me to write advertisements!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Please don't disappoint me.
#PENDLETON.
Yes, I suppose that's so. But one has a sense of pride.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Art comes before Pride. Consider my feelings, an aristocrat, coming here to America and engaging in commerce, and advertising, and other dreadful things, and all for the sake of Art!
#PENDLETON.
But you make money out of it!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Only incidentally. Just as you, in writing my advertisements, would make, say ten thousand or so, as a sort of accident. But don't let us talk of money. It's perfectly revolting, isn't it? Art is Life, and I believe in Life for Art's sake. That's why I'm a success.
#PENDLETON.
Indeed? How interesting. Please go on.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
When a woman comes to me for a gown, I don't measure body, why should I? I measure her mind. I find her color harmony. In a moment I can tell whether she ought to wear scarlet, mauve, taupe, magenta, or any other color, so as to fall into her proper rhythm. Every one has a rhythm, you know. But I don't have to explain all this to you, Mr. Pendleton. You understand it intuitively. This heliotrope you are wearing shows me at once that you are in rhythm.
#PENDLETON.
I'm not so sure that I am. What you say interests me. May I ask you a question?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Yes, but I may not answer it.
#PENDLETON.
Why do you wear heliotrope and the same shade as mine?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
You mustn't ask me that.
#PENDLETON.
I'm all curiosity.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Curiosity is dangerous.
#PENDLETON.
Supposing I try to find out?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
That may be even more dangerous.
#PENDLETON.
I'm fond of that kind of danger.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Take care! I'm very fragile.
#PENDLETON.
Isn't heliotrope in rhythm with the faint reflection of passion?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
How brutal of you to have said it.
#PENDLETON.
I, too, am in rhythm with heliotrope.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
How glad I am. Thank God you've no desire to kiss my lips.
#PENDLETON.
Only your finger - tips.
#PENDLETON.
Your fingers are like soft, pale, waxen tapers!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Your kisses are the breathings that light them into quivering flame!
#PENDLETON.
Exquisite - exquisite!
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
That was a moment!
#PENDLETON.
We must have many such.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Many? That's too near too much.
#PENDLETON.
We shall, dear lady.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
How I adore your writings! They have made me realize the beauty of an ideal union, the love of one man for one woman at a time. Let us have such a union, you and me.
#PENDLETON.
But I live in such a union already.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
And only a moment ago you kissed me!
#PENDLETON.
Well - what of it?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Don't you see what we've done? You are living in one of those wonderful unions you describe in your books - and I've let you kiss me. I've committed a sacrilege.
#PENDLETON.
You're mistaken. It isn't a sacrilege. It's an opportunity.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
How can you say that - you whose words have inspired my deepest intimacies. No, I must go. I - must - go.
#PENDLETON.
You don't understand. I exaggerated everything so in my confounded books.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Please ask her to forgive me. Please tell her I thought you were married, otherwise, never, never, would I have permitted you to kiss me.
#PENDLETON.
What made you think I was married?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
One often believes what one hopes.
#PENDLETON.
You take it too seriously. Let me explain.
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
What is there to explain? Our experience has been complete. Why spoil it by anti - climax?
#PENDLETON.
Am I never to see you again?
#BARONESS DE MEAUVILLE.
Who knows? If your present union should end, and some day your soul needs - some one?
#PENDLETON.
Good - by - long, pale fingers.
#MARGARET.
Did you get a good start with the scandal?
#PENDLETON.
Not exactly. I may as well admit it was a failure through no fault of mine, of course. And now, I simply must finish that last chapter.
#MARGARET.
You may clear, Mrs. Abbey.
#MRS. ABBEY.
Very well, ma'am.
#MARGARET.
Mrs. Abbey, have you worked for many people living together, like Mr. Pendleton and myself?
#MRS. ABBEY.
Lor', Ma'am, yes. I've worked in nearly every house on the south side of Washington Square.
#MARGARET.
Mr. Pendleton says I'm as domestic as any wife could be. Were the others like me?
#MRS. ABBEY.
Most of them, ma'am, but some was regular hussies; not only a - livin' with their fellers - but havin' a good time, too. That's what I call real immoral. young man wants to see you, ma'am.
#MARGARET.
That's the new model. I'll get my working apron.
#MRS. ABBEY.
You c'n come in.
#MRS. ABBEY.
You can undress behind there.
#FENTON.
Undress? Say, what's this? A Turkish bath?
#MRS. ABBEY.
Did you expect to have a private room all to yourself?
#FENTON.
What am I to undress for?
#MRS. ABBEY.
The missus will be here in a minute.
#FENTON.
Good night! I'm goin'.
#MRS. ABBEY.
What's the matter? Ain't you the Missus' new model? model! Ha! Ha! You've sure got the wrong number this time. I'm in the dictionary line, ma'am.
#MRS. ABBEY.
Well, of all the impudence! You a book agent, and a - walkin' in here.
#FENTON.
Well, you asked me in, didn't you? Can't I see the missus, jest for a minute?
#MRS. ABBEY.
Very well. Here she is. And I advise you to remove that Spearmint from your mouth, if you want to sell any dictionaries in this house.
#FENTON.
Where shall I put it?
#MRS. ABBEY.
You'd better swallow it!
#MARGARET.
I'm so glad to see you.
#MRS. ABBEY.
But, ma'am -
#MARGARET.
You may go, Mrs. Abbey.
#MRS. ABBEY.
But, but, ma'am -
#MARGARET.
You may go, Mrs. Abbey. I'm so glad they sent you up to see me. Won't you sit down?
#FENTON.
Madam, I represent the Globe Advertising Publishing Sales Co., the largest publishers of dictionaries in the world.
#MARGARET.
Then you're not the new model?
#FENTON.
No, ma'am.
#MARGARET.
What a pity! Never mind, go on.
#FENTON.
As I was saying, ma'am, I represent the Advertising Globe Publishing - I mean the Globe Publishing Sales Publishing Co., the largest publishers of dictionaries in the world. For some time past we have felt there was a demand for a new Encyclopaedic Dictionary, madam, one that would not only fill up a good deal of space in the bookshelf, making an attractive addition to the home, but also containing the most complete collection of words in the English language.
#MARGARET.
Please go on talking, it's so interesting.
#FENTON.
Statistics show that the Woman of Average Education in America, Madam, has command of but fifteen hundred words. This new dictionary, Madam, will give you command of over eight hundred and fifty thousand.
#MARGARET.
So you are a dealer in words - how perfectly romantic.
#FENTON.
Most of these words, madam, are not used more than a dozen times a year. They are our Heritage from the Past. And all these words, to say nothing of the fact that the dictionary fills five inches in a bookshelf, making an attractive addition to the library, being handsomely bound in half - cloth - all these are yours, ma'am, for the price of one dollar.
#FENTON.
If you have a son, madam, the possession of this dictionary will give him an opportunity of acquiring that knowledge of our language which made Abraham Lincoln the Father of our Country. Madam, opportunity knocks at the door only once and This is your opportunity at one dollar.
#MARGARET.
Yes, this is my opportunity! I'll buy the dictionary and now won't you tell me your name?
#FENTON.
My name is Charles P. K. Fenton.
#MARGARET.
Mr. Fenton, would you mind doing me a favor?
#FENTON.
Why, I guess not, ma'am.
#MARGARET.
I want you to take off your coat.
#FENTON.
You're not trying to kid me, ma'am?
#MARGARET.
I just want to see your development. Do you mind?
#FENTON.
Why, no, ma'am, if that's all you want.
#MARGARET.
Now, bring your arm up, tighten the muscles. Splendid! You must take lots of exercise, Mr. Fenton.
#FENTON.
Not me, ma'am. I never had no time for exercise; I got that workin' in a freight yard. Margaret. I suppose you think me rather peculiar, Mr. Fenton.
#FENTON.
You said it, Miss.
#MARGARET.
You see I'm a sculptress. This is my work.
#FENTON.
You made that? Gee! that's great. Just like them statues at the Metropolitan.
#MARGARET.
That figure is Apollo, Mr. Fenton.
#FENTON.
Oh, Apollo.
#MARGARET.
I was to engage a professional model for it, but I could never hope to get a professional as fine a type as you. Will you pose for it?
#FENTON.
Me? That feller there without any clothes. Well, I don't know. It's kind of chilly here.
#MARGARET.
If I draped you, it would spoil some of your lines. But I will if you like.
#FENTON.
Ah, now you're talking.
#MARGARET.
So, you'll really come?
#FENTON.
How about this evening?
#MARGARET.
Splendid! Sit down. Mr. Fenton, you've quite aroused my curiosity. I know so few business men. Is your work interesting?
#FENTON.
Well, I can't say it was, until I started selling around this neighborhood.
#MARGARET.
Is it difficult?
#FENTON.
Not if you've got personality, Miss. That's the thing, personality. If a feller hasn't got personality, he can't sell goods, that's sure.
#MARGARET.
What do you mean by personality, Mr. Fenton.
#FENTON.
Well, it's what sells the goods. I don't know how else to explain it exactly. I'll look it up in the dictionary. Here it is, ma'am. Per - per - why, it isn't in here. I guess they don't put in words that everybody knows. We all know what personality means. It's what sells the goods.
#MARGARET.
I adore a strong, virile, masculine personality.
#FENTON.
I don't quite get you, madam.
#MARGARET.
The men I know have so much of the feminine in them.
#FENTON.
Oh, "Cissies"!
#MARGARET.
They lack the magnetic forcefulness which I like so much in you.
#FENTON.
I believe you are kidding me. Does that mean you like me?
#MARGARET.
That's rather an embarrassing question.
#FENTON.
You must or you wouldn't let me speak to you this way.
#MARGARET.
Never mind whether I like you. Tell me whether you like me?
#FENTON.
Gee! I didn't get on to you at first. Sure I like you.
#MARGARET.
Then we're going to be good friends.
#FENTON.
You just bet we are. Say, got a date for to - morrow evening?
#MARGARET.
No.
#FENTON.
How about the movies? There's a fine feature film at the Strand. Theda Bara in "The Lonesome Vampire," five reels. They say it's got "Gloria's Romance" beat a mile.
#MARGARET.
I don't know that I'd care to go there.
#FENTON.
How about a run down to Coney?
#MARGARET.
Coney! I've always wanted to do wild Pagan things.
#FENTON.
Say, you'll tell me your name, won't you?
#MARGARET.
Margaret Marshall.
#FENTON.
Do you mind if I call you Margie?
#MARGARET.
If you do, I must call you -
#FENTON.
Charley. Gee, I like the name of Margie. Some class to that.
#MARGARET.
I'm glad you like it.
#FENTON.
And some class to you!
#MARGARET.
So you really like me?
#FENTON.
You bet. Say, before I go, you've got to give me a kiss, Margie.
#MARGARET.
Well, I don't know. Aren't you rather "rushing" me?
#FENTON.
Say, you are a kidder.
#MARGARET.
You have the true Greek spirit! If only Pommy would kiss me that way!
#FENTON.
Pommy? Who's Pommy?
#MARGARET.
Pommy is the man I live with.
#FENTON.
Your husband!
#MARGARET.
No, we just live together. You see, we don't believe in marriage.
#FENTON.
I thought there was something queer about all this. Does he live here?
#MARGARET.
Yes. He's in there now.
#FENTON.
Good night! I'm goin'.
#MARGARET.
You're surely not going just on that account.
#FENTON.
Isn't that enough?
#MARGARET.
Please don't go. Listen, I can't suppress my feeling for you; I never do with anybody. I liked you the moment I saw you, I want you as a friend, a good friend. You can't go now, just when everything's about to begin.
#FENTON.
Fair's fair, Miss. If he's keeping you, you can't be taking up with me at the same time. That puts the finish on it.
#MARGARET.
But he doesn't keep me. I keep myself.
#FENTON.
Wait a minute. You support yourself, and live with him of your own free will. Then you've got no excuse for being immoral; 'tisn't like you had to make your living at it. Good - by.
#MARGARET.
But I can explain everything.
#FENTON.
It's no use, Miss. Even though I am a salesman, I've got a sense of honor. I sized you up as a married woman when I came in just now, or I never would have made love to you at all.
#MARGARET.
Oh - wait! Supposing I should want to buy some more dictionaries.
#FENTON.
You've got my card, Miss. The 'phone number is on it. Bryant 4253. Don't feel hurt, Miss. You'll get over these queer ideas some day, and when you do, well, you've got my number. So long, kid.
#MARGARET.
My Apollo, Bryant 4253!
#PENDLETON.
Did you get a good start with your scandal. It's no use; I'm convinced we're in a hopeless muddle.
#MARGARET.
I heartily agree with you.
#PENDLETON.
You've changed your mind very suddenly.
#MARGARET.
I have my reasons.
#PENDLETON.
The fact is, Margaret, that so long as we live together we're public figures, with everybody else as our jury.
#MARGARET.
But lots of people read your books and respect us.
#PENDLETON.
The people that respect us are worse than the people that don't.
#MARGARET.
If they wouldn't always be bothering about our morals!
#PENDLETON.
If we continue living together, we shall simply be giving up our freedom to prove we are free.
#MARGARET.
I suppose we ought to separate.
#PENDLETON.
I believe we should.
#MARGARET.
We'll have to give up the studio.
#PENDLETON.
Yes.
#MARGARET.
It's taken a long time to make the place homelike.
#PENDLETON.
We've been very comfortable here.
#MARGARET.
I shall miss you at meals.
#PENDLETON.
I shall have to start eating at clubs and restaurants again, no more good home cooking.
#MARGARET.
We're kind of used to one another, aren't we?
#PENDLETON.
It isn't an easy matter to break, after five years.
#MARGARET.
And there are mighty few studios with as good a light as this; I don't want to separate if you don't.
#PENDLETON.
But, Margaret. There, that confounded piano again. Margaret, there's another way out!
#MARGARET.
You mean, we ought to marry!
#PENDLETON.
Yes, marry, and do it at once. That'll end everything.
#MARGARET.
Let's do it right away and get it over with; I simply must finish my Apollo.
#PENDLETON.
I'm going to buy you a new gown to get married in, a wedding present from Baroness de Meauville's.
#MARGARET.
I don't know that I want a De Meauville gown.
#PENDLETON.
Please let me. I want to give you something to symbolize our new life together.
#MARGARET.
Very well. And in return, I'll buy you a dictionary, so that I won't have to keep on correcting your spelling.
#MARGARET.
Bryant 4253? Can I speak to Mr. Fenton? Mrs. Abbey. What do you think? We're going to get married!
#MRS. ABBEY.
Well, bless my soul! That's right. You can take it from me, ma'am, you'll find that respectability pays.
#MARGARET.
Bryant 4253? Is that Mr. Fenton? Hello, Charley!
