#YOUNG WIFE.
You have stopped working?
#HUSBAND.
Yes. I’m too tired. And besides…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Well?—
#HUSBAND.
I felt so lonely at my desk all at once. A longing for you came over me.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Really?
#HUSBAND.
Don’t read any more to - night. You will ruin your eyes.
#YOUNG WIFE.
What’s the matter with you?
#HUSBAND.
Nothing, child. I’m in love with you. But you know that.
#YOUNG WIFE.
One might almost forget it sometimes.
#HUSBAND.
One must forget it sometimes.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Why?
#HUSBAND.
Because, otherwise, marriage would be something imperfect. It would … how shall I express it … it would lose its sanctity.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Oh…
#HUSBAND.
Believe me—it is so… If we hadn’t sometimes forgotten that we are in love with each other during the five years we have been married—we might not be in love any longer.
#YOUNG WIFE.
That’s beyond me.
#HUSBAND.
The case is simply this. We have had perhaps ten or twelve love - affairs with each other… Doesn’t it seem that way to you, too?
#YOUNG WIFE.
I haven’t counted them!
#HUSBAND.
If we had enjoyed the first one to the last drop, if I had from the very beginning surrendered without restraint to my passion for you, the same thing would have happened to us that has happened to millions of other lovers. We would be tired of each other.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Ah … do you mean that?
#HUSBAND.
Believe me—Emma—in the early days of our marriage, I was afraid that this would happen.
#YOUNG WIFE.
I, too.
#HUSBAND.
See? Am I not right? Therefore, it is wise every now and then to live only as good friends.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Oh.
#HUSBAND.
And some can always experience new honeymoons, especially since I am careful never to let such weeks of honeymoon…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Run into months.
#HUSBAND.
That is true.
#YOUNG WIFE.
And now … now it seems we are at the end of another such period of friendship—?
#HUSBAND.
So it might seem.
#YOUNG WIFE.
But if … if I should feel differently?
#HUSBAND.
You couldn’t. You are the wisest and most delicious being in the world. I am very happy to have found you.
#YOUNG WIFE.
You know how to make love very well—every now and then.
#HUSBAND.
Well, for a man who has looked about in the world a bit—come, lay your head on my shoulder—who has seen something of the world, marriage is really something much more mysterious than it is for you sheltered young girls. You come to us entirely innocent and … to a certain degree, at least, ignorant of things, and therefore you really understand the essence of love much better than we.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Oh!
#HUSBAND.
Certainly. For we get all tangled up by the many experiences that we have to go through before marriage. You women, of course, hear a lot of things, you know a lot of things, no doubt read too much, but you can’t have any real idea of the things men experience. We men really become quite disgusted with this thing people call love, for the kind of creatures to which we are restricted really are…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Tell me—what kind of creatures are they?
#HUSBAND.
You ought to be glad, dear child, that you never have had a glimpse of relations like that. After all most of the poor things deserve pity—it is not for us to throw stones.
#YOUNG WIFE.
But—this pity—it doesn’t seem quite appropriate to me.
#HUSBAND.
They deserve it. You young girls of good family, who wait quietly under the care of your parents for the man who desires you in marriage,—you won’t know the misery that drives most of these poor creatures into the arms of sin.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Do all of them really sell themselves?
#HUSBAND.
I would hardly say that. I don’t mean the material misery alone. There is also—one might call it—a moral misery, a lack of appreciation for what is permissible, and, especially, for what is noble.
#YOUNG WIFE.
But why are they to be pitied?—They seem to enjoy themselves.
#HUSBAND.
You have strange ideas, my child. You must not forget that such people are predestined by nature to sink lower and lower. There is no stopping them.
#YOUNG WIFE.
It seems pleasant to fall.
#HUSBAND.
How can you say things like that, Emma? I should think that to good women like you, nothing could be more repulsive than those who are not!
#YOUNG WIFE.
Of course, Karl, of course. I was just thinking. Go on, tell me more. I like it when you talk like this. Tell me something.
#HUSBAND.
What?—
#YOUNG WIFE.
Why—about these people.
#HUSBAND.
The idea!
#YOUNG WIFE.
But, I asked you a long time ago—you know, when we were first married to tell me something of your younger days.
#HUSBAND.
Why does that interest you?
#YOUNG WIFE.
Aren’t you my husband? Isn’t it a sort of injustice that I really know nothing about your past?
#HUSBAND.
You surely don’t think I have such bad taste, as to—No, Emma … it would be like a profanation.
#YOUNG WIFE.
And yet you have … heaven knows how many other women you have held in your arms, just as you are holding me now.
#HUSBAND.
Don’t say “women.” You are the woman.
#YOUNG WIFE.
But you must answer one question … otherwise … otherwise … there won’t be any honeymoon.
#HUSBAND.
That’s a nice way to talk … remember you are a mother … our little girl is sleeping in there…
#YOUNG WIFE.
But I want a boy, too.
#HUSBAND.
Emma!
#YOUNG WIFE.
Don’t be silly … of course, I am your wife … but I’d like also to be … to be your sweetheart.
#HUSBAND.
Would you?…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Well—now my question.
#HUSBAND.
All right.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Was there … a married woman … amongst them?
#HUSBAND.
Why? What do you mean?
#YOUNG WIFE.
You know what I mean.
#HUSBAND.
What makes you think of a thing like that?
#YOUNG WIFE.
I would like to know if … I mean—there are such women… I know that very well. But did you?…
#HUSBAND.
Do you know such a woman?
#YOUNG WIFE.
Well, I hardly know.
#HUSBAND.
Is there, perhaps, such a woman among your friends?
#YOUNG WIFE.
How can I be sure that there is—or that there isn’t?
#HUSBAND.
Did any of your friends … women talk about a lot of things—alone among themselves—did any of them ever confess—?
#YOUNG WIFE.
No.
#HUSBAND.
Do you suspect any of your friends—that she…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Suspect … oh … suspect.
#HUSBAND.
It would seem so.
#YOUNG WIFE.
No, indeed, Karl, most certainly not. When I think things over—I don’t believe there is any one.
#HUSBAND.
No one?
#YOUNG WIFE.
Not among my friends.
#HUSBAND.
Promise me something, Emma.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Well?
#HUSBAND.
That you will never associate with a woman about whom you have the slightest suspicion that she … doesn’t lead a completely blameless life.
#YOUNG WIFE.
And you think it necessary for me to promise that?
#HUSBAND.
I know that you will not seek out the company of such women. But, it might happen that you … in fact it often happens that such women, whose reputations are not of the best, seek out good women, partly to give them standing, and partly because they feel … how shall I say?… because they feel a certain homesickness for virtue.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Do they?
#HUSBAND.
Yes. I believe what I just said is very true. Homesickness for virtue. For all of these women are at heart very unhappy; you can believe that.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Why?
#HUSBAND.
You ask me, Emma?—How can you even ask?—Just imagine what a life these women lead! Full of lies, perfidy, vulgarity, and danger.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Yes, of course. You are right.
#HUSBAND.
Truly … they pay for their little happiness … their little…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Pleasure.
#HUSBAND.
Why “pleasure”? Why do you call it “pleasure”?
#YOUNG WIFE.
Well,—there must be something in it—! Otherwise, they wouldn’t do it.
#HUSBAND.
It is nothing … an intoxication.
#YOUNG WIFE.
An intoxication…
#HUSBAND.
No, it is not even intoxication. Like everything—it is dearly paid for, that much is certain.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Well … it has happened to you, hasn’t it?
#HUSBAND.
Yes, Emma.—And it is the thing I most regret.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Who was she? Tell me! Do I know her?
#HUSBAND.
The idea!
#YOUNG WIFE.
Was it long ago? Was it very long before you married me?
#HUSBAND.
Don’t ask me. Please, don’t ask.
#YOUNG WIFE.
But, Karl!
#HUSBAND.
She is dead.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Are you in earnest?
#HUSBAND.
Yes … it sounds almost ridiculous, but I have the feeling that all such women die young.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Did you love her very much?
#HUSBAND.
One doesn’t love women who lie.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Then why…
#HUSBAND.
An intoxication…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Really?
#HUSBAND.
Don’t talk about it any more, please. All that is passed long ago. I have only loved one woman—that is you. You only love where there is purity and truth.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Karl!
#HUSBAND.
Oh, how secure, how happy one feels in such arms. Why didn’t I know you as a child? I am sure I wouldn’t then even have looked at other women.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Karl!
#HUSBAND.
And how beautiful you are!… beautiful!… Oh, come…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Do you know what I am thinking of to - night?
#HUSBAND.
What, sweetheart?
#YOUNG WIFE.
Of … of … of Venice.
#HUSBAND.
Our first night…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Yes…
#HUSBAND.
What then? Tell me!
#YOUNG WIFE.
You love me as much to - day.
#HUSBAND.
Yes, just as much.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Oh … if you would always…
#HUSBAND.
If I would what?
#YOUNG WIFE.
My Karl!
#HUSBAND.
What do you mean? If I would always?…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Well, yes.
#HUSBAND.
Well, what then, if I would always?…
#YOUNG WIFE.
Then I would always know that you love me.
#HUSBAND.
Yes. But you must know that anyway. One cannot always be a lover, sometimes one has to go out into the cold world to struggle and achieve! Don’t forget that, my child. There is a time for everything in marriage—that is the beauty of it. There are not many who can remember their Venice after five years.
#YOUNG WIFE.
True!
#HUSBAND.
And now … good - night, my child.
#YOUNG WIFE.
Good - night!
