#AGNES.
Oh, goody, goody! Did your mothers say you might come?
#LULU.
Yes, my mother said I might; and then I teased Bel’s mother, and she said yes.
#AGNES.
Oh, I’m so glad! How long can you stay? Can you stay to supper?
#LULU.
I can’t stay without I’m invited, mother said.
#BELVAWNEY.
My mother said to come home when the table had begun to be set. I’ve got my new boots on , and I stepped in the mud with ’em.
#BENNY.
What are you trying to do?
#LULU.
We saw a cow, and ran across the street; and Bel stepped in the mud
#BELVAWNEY.
’Twas a hooking cow.
#BENNY.
Ho! run for a cow! ’Fore I’d run for a cow!
#DAN'L DRUCE.
It doesn’t take much to scare girls.
#BENNY.
I know it: anybody could do that.
#AGNES.
He couldn’t scare us; could he, Lulu?
#BENNY.
Don’t you believe I could make you run? Boo, boo!
#LULU.
Oh, we sha’n’t run for that!
#BENNY.
Just wait a little while; and, if I can’t scare you, then I’ll treat.
#AGNES.
Do you believe he could, Lu?
#LULU.
I know he couldn’t. What will you treat us to?
#BENNY.
Oh! any thing. Take your choice.
#AGNES.
Oh, goody, goody! Ice - cream, ice - cream!
#LULU.
Cream - cakes, cream - cakes!
#DAN'L DRUCE.
I’ve got him Why, I haven’t got him! Where is he? Oh, I see!
#BENNY.
You’ve driven away this fly.
#AGNES.
Now let’s play something.
#LULU.
So I say. Let’s play school.
#BELVAWNEY.
But there wouldn’t be enough scholars.
#DAN'L DRUCE.
I’ll be the schoolmaster. Silence! Take your seats. Study your books. Can’t have any recess. You must all stay after school.
#LULU.
Let’s play mother, I say.
#AGNES.
You be the mother?
#LULU.
No, you be the mother, and I’ll be your little girl, and Bel be my little sister.
#AGNES.
Well, I’ll run up and get some of my mother’s things to put on, and you two can be seeing my dollies.
#DAN'L DRUCE.
I’ll be the one to introduce them. This is Miss Cherrydrop, named for her red cheeks; but some say they’re painted, and not real. She’s got a new round comb and a—a sontag.
#BELVAWNEY.
Oh, that isn’t a sontag! ’tis a breakfast - shawl.
#DAN'L DRUCE.
Well, never mind. Here is Miss Patty Troodledum; very proud, so they say, because her dress is spangled. When Aggy thinks too much of her new clothes, mother says, “Ah! who have we here? Miss Patty Troodledum?” Sit down there, Miss Patty. And this is the young sailor - boy, just home from sea. There’s the star on his collar, and his Scotch cap. Jack, take off your cap, and make a bow to the ladies. His mother fainted away with joy at seeing him, and hasn’t come to yet: here she is. But here. is somebody very grand. Now, who do you think came over in the ship with the sailor - boy?
#LULU.
The captain.
#DAN'L DRUCE.
Of course. But I mean passenger.
#LULU.
Who was it?
#DAN'L DRUCE.
Mademoiselle De Waxy, right from Paris.
#LULU.
Oh, she’s a beauty! Don’t touch her, Bel!
#DAN'L DRUCE.
Oh, no! Miss De Waxy mustn’t be touched. Miss De Waxy keeps by herself, and never speaks a word to the others, because they can’t talk French. Miss De Waxy, before she came over, thought all the American dolls were dressed in wild beasts’ skins. See, this is her fan, bought in Paris; and this is her gold chain.
#BELVAWNEY.
And who are all these little ones?
#DAN'L DRUCE.
Those are the children just come from school, waiting for their lunch. See this cunning one! She doesn’t know O yet: she’s in the eleventh class.
#LULU.
And who is that old one with that funny cap on?
#DAN'L DRUCE.
Oh, this! Why, this is—this is old Nurse Trot. Poor old woman, she’s got a lame back, and she’s all worn out tending so many children; but she never complains, nor sheds a tear.
#BELVAWNEY.
Oh, she’s got a bag on her arm!
#DAN'L DRUCE.
Her snuff - box is in that. The sailor - boy brought it home from sea to her. Best of snuff! And he brought her these new spectacles : now she can see as well as ever she could.
#LULU.
How came this one’s arm off?
#DAN'L DRUCE.
Why, that is poor Tabitha. She broke her arm sweeping out the baby - house; and it had to be taken off at the shoulder.
#BELVAWNEY.
Where did she get that clean apron?
#DAN'L DRUCE.
That checked apron? Let me see. That came, I think—oh! that was made at the doll’s sewing - school.
#LULU.
Look, Bel: here’s a blind one!
#BELVAWNEY.
Oh! isn’t that too bad?
#DAN'L DRUCE.
Yes, she’s blind; totally blind. She became so by trying to sleep with her eyes open. Dolls know better now. They shut their eyes when they lie down, and go off to sleep like live folks.
#LULU.
Oh, see this one! she’s all spoiled.
#DAN'L DRUCE.
Yes: she was spoiled having her own way. Fell down when she was told to stand up, and broke her cheek. Doctors were sent for; but they couldn’t do any thing. She ought to have that face tied up. Where’s her pocket - handkerchief? Here it is. Now, isn’t that a beauty? Aggy says the sailor - boy brought it home to her from China. There, now her face is tied up, she won’t get cold. Do you see this pretty girl with the pink dress and curly hair? She is to be the wife of the sailor - boy. These two sit close together all the time, waiting for their wedding - day. The wedding - cake is ordered. See how smiling they look! and no wonder. I will tell you who is invited to the wedding; but you mustn’t tell. First, all the— Oh! here comes Aggy. Wait till by and by.
#LULU.
Oh, what a good mother! What’ll your name be?
#AGNES.
Mrs. White. This is the way mother does.
#DAN'L DRUCE.
Shall I be the father, and do the way father does?
#ALL THE GIRLS.
Oh, yes, yes! Do!
#AGNES.
Children , come and let me put on your sleeved aprons. and BEL. I don’t want to.
#AGNES.
Little girls must think mother knows best. Come, mind mother. Now, children , I am going to have company this afternoon; and you must be very good children. What do you say when a gentleman speaks to you? and BEL. Yes, sir; no, sir.
#AGNES.
What do you say when a lady speaks to you? and BEL. Yes, ma’am; no, ma’am.
#AGNES.
And, if they ask you how you do, don’t hang your head down, and suck your thumbs, so, but speak this way ,—“Very well, I thank you.” Now let me hear you say it.
#CHILDREN.
Very well, I thank you.
#AGNES.
And what do you say at the table?
#BELVAWNEY.
Please give me some more jelly.
#LULU.
Please may I be excused, when we get up.
#AGNES.
That is right. And, if anybody asks you to sing, you must be willing, and sing them one of your little songs. What one do you like the best?
#LULU.
“Gone Away.”
#AGNES.
I think you’d better sing it over with me, to be sure you know it.
#GONE AWAY.
TUNE,—“Nelly Bly.”
#AGNES.
Very well. Now sit down, dears, and play with your playthings, and don’t disturb mother. Mother’s going to make a new head - dress.
#AGNES.
Children, be quiet. Your father’s coming.
#DAN'L DRUCE.
That’s the way father does.
#LULU.
That’s mine.
#BELVAWNEY.
I say ’tisn’t.
#LULU.
I say ’tis.
#BELVAWNEY.
Mother, see Lu! }
#LULU.
Mother, see Bel.} Both together.]
#LULU.
Mother, won’t you speak to Bel?
#BELVAWNEY.
Mother, Lu keeps plaguing.
#DAN'L DRUCE.
Silence, children!
#AGNES.
Bel, you may go to the door.
#BELVAWNEY.
Oh, there’s an old beggar - man there! I’m scared of him!
#ALL THE GIRLS.
Who is it? I’m scared! Let’s run! Come quick!
#DAN'L DRUCE.
Good for you, Ben! I knew they’d be scared.
#BENNY.
Hurrah! let’s chase! No treat, no treat!
#DAN'L DRUCE.
Come on, come on!
