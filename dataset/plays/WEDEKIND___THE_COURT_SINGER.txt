#VALET.
Well? - Come in!
#BOY.
There's a woman downstairs wants to know if Mr. Gerardo is in.
#VALET.
No, he isn't in. Well, who's this now? "Mr. Gerardo." - "Courtsinger Gerardo." - "Monsieur Gerardo." - "Gerardo Esq." - "To the Most Honorable Courtsinger Gerardo" - that's from the chambermaid, sure! - "Mr. Gerardo, Imperial and royal Courtsinger."
#GERARDO.
What, aren't you through with packing yet? - How long does it take you to pack?
#VALET.
I'll be through in a minute, Sir.
#GERARDO.
Be quick about it. I have some work left to do before I go. Come, let me have a look at things. Great Heavens, man! Don't you know how to fold a pair of trousers? Do you call that packing? Well I do believe, I might teach you a thing or two, though, surely, you ought to be better at this than I! Look here, that's the way to take hold of a pair of trousers. Then hook them here. Next, turn to these two buttons. Watch closely now, it all depends on these two buttons; and then - pull - the trousers straight. There you are! Now finish up by folding them once - like this. That's the way. They won't lose their shape now in a hundred years!
#VALET.
Perhaps Mr. Gerardo used to be a tailor once.
#GERARDO.
What? A tailor, I? Not quite. Simpleton! There, put them back, but be quick about it.
#VALET.
There's another batch of letters for you, Sir.
#GERARDO.
Yes, I've seen them.
#VALET.
And flowers!
#GERARDO.
Yes, yes. Now, for pity's sake, hurry up and get through. "... To belong to you who to me are a god! To make me infinitely happy for the rest of my life, how little that would cost you! Consider, please, ..." Great Heavens! Here I am to sing Tristan in Brussels tomorrow night and don't remember a single note! - Not a single note! Half - past three. - Forty - five minutes left. Come i - n!
#BOY.
I was told to put this in Mr....
#GERARDO.
Who told you? - Who is downstairs?
#BOY.
I was told to put this in Mr. Gerardo's room.
#GERARDO.
What is it? Thank you. For mercy's sake! Now what am I to do with this! George!
#VALET.
It's the last lot. Sir.
#GERARDO.
Very well. - I am at home to no one!
#VALET.
I know. Sir.
#GERARDO.
To no one, I say!
#VALET.
You may depend on me, Sir. Here are the keys, Mr. Gerardo.
#GERARDO.
To no one!
#VALET.
The trunks will be taken down at once.
#GERARDO.
Wait a moment ...
#VALET.
Yes, Sir?
#GERARDO.
What I said was: to no one!
#VALET.
Thank you very much indeed. Sir.
#GERARDO.
Half an hour left. The air is simply infernal in here! I feel as if there were a leaden weight on me! I must have a breath of fresh air, quick! Where can that thing be? - On the other side. There! Goodness gracious!
#MISS COEURNE.
Please, do not send me away.
#GERARDO.
What else am I to do with you? Heaven knows I did not ask you to come here. It would be wrong of you to take it amiss but, you see, I have to sing tomorrow night. I must tell you frankly. I thought I should have this half hour to myself. Only just now I've given special and strictest orders not to admit anybody, no matter who it might be.
#MISS COEURNE.
Do not send me away. I heard you as Tannhäuser last night and came here merely to offer you these roses.
#GERARDO.
Yes? - Well? - And - ?
#MISS COEURNE.
And myself! - I hope I am saying it right.
#GERARDO.
Who are you?
#MISS COEURNE.
Miss Coeurne.
#GERARDO.
I see.
#MISS COEURNE.
I am still quite a simple girl.
#GERARDO.
I know. But come here, Miss Coeurne. Let me have a serious talk with you, such as you have never heard before in your young life but seem to need very much at the present time. Do you think because I am an artist - now don't misunderstand me, please. You are - how old are you?
#MISS COEURNE.
Twenty - two.
#GERARDO.
You are sixteen, at most seventeen. You make yourself several years older in order to appear more attractive to me. Well now? You are still quite simple, to be sure. But, as I was going to say, my being an artist certainly does not impose upon me the duty to help you to get over being simple! Don't take it amiss. Well? Why are you looking away now?
#MISS COEURNE.
I told you I was still very simple because that's the way they like to have young girls here in Germany.
#GERARDO.
I am not a German, my child, but at the same time ...
#MISS COEURNE.
Well? - I am not so simple, after all.
#GERARDO.
I am no children's nurse either! That's not the right word, I feel it, for - you are no longer a child, unfortunately?
#MISS COEURNE.
No! - Unfortunately! - Not now.
#GERARDO.
But you see, my dear young woman - you have your games of tennis, you have your skating club, you may go bicycling or take mountain trips with your lady friends. You may enjoy yourself swimming or riding on horseback or dancing whichever you like. I am sure you have everything a young girl could wish for. Then why do you come to me?
#MISS COEURNE.
Because I hate all of that and because it's such a bore!
#GERARDO.
You are right; I won't dispute what you say. Indeed, you embarrass me. I myself, I must frankly confess, see something else in life. But, my child, I am a man and I am thirty - six years old. The time will come when you may likewise lay claim to a deeper and fuller life. Get two years older and, I am sure, the right one will turn up for you. Then it will not be necessary for you to come unasked to me, that is to say to one whom you do not know any more intimately than - all Europe knows him - and to conceal yourself behind the window curtains in order to get a taste of the higher life. Well? - Let me thank you cordially and sincerely for your roses! Will you be satisfied with that for today?
#MISS COEURNE.
As old as I am, I never yet gave a thought to a man until I saw you on the stage yesterday as Tannhäuser. - And I will promise you ...
#GERARDO.
Oh please, child, don't promise me anything. How can a promise you might make at the present time be of any value to me? The disadvantage of it would be entirely yours. You see, my child, the most loving father could not speak more lovingly to you than I. Thank a kind providence for not having been delivered into some other artist's hands by your indiscretion. Let it be a lesson to you for the rest of your life and be satisfied with that.
#MISS COEURNE.
Am I so ugly?
#GERARDO.
Ugly? - How does that make you ugly? - You are young and indiscreet! Listen to me, my child! If I have to sing, if I am an artist by profession, how does that make you ugly? What an unreasonable inference: I am ugly, I am ugly. And yet it is the same wherever I go. Think of it! When I've only a few minutes left to catch the train, and tomorrow night it's Tristan ...! Do not misunderstand me, but surely, my being a singer does not make it incumbent upon me to affirm the charm of your youthfulness and beauty. Does that make you ugly, my child? Make your appeal to other people who are not as hard - pressed as I am. Do you really think it would ever occur to me to, say such a thing to you?
#MISS COEURNE.
To say it? No. But to think it.
#GERARDO.
Now, Miss Coeurne, let us be reasonable! Do not inquire into my thoughts about you. Really, at this moment they do not concern us in the least. I assure you, and please take my word for it as an artist, for I could not be more honest to you: I am unfortunately so constituted that I simply cannot bear to see any creature whatsoever suffer, not even the meanest. And for you, my child, I am sincerely sorry; I may say that much, after you have so far fought down your maidenly pride as to wait for me here. But please, Miss Coeurne, do take into account the life I have to lead. Just think of the mere question of time! At least two hundred, may be as many as three hundred charmingly attractive young girls of your age saw me on the stage yesterday in the part of Tannhäuser. Suppose now every one of these young girls expected as much of me as you do. What in the world would become of my singing? What would become of my voice? Just how could I keep up my profession? It's really sinful of you, my child, to shed tears over being so young. Your whole life is still before you. Be patient. The thought of your youth should make you happy. How glad the rest of us would be - even if one lives the life of an artist like myself - to start over again from the very beginning. Please be not ungrateful for hearing me yesterday. Spare me this disconcerting sequel. Am I to blame for your falling in love with me? You are only one of many. My manager insists on my assuming this august manner on the stage. You see there's more to it than mere singing. I simply have to play the part of Tannhäuser that way. Now be good, my child. I have only a few moments left. Let me use them in preparing for tomorrow.
#MISS COEURNE.
, I cannot imagine another girl acting like me.
#GERARDO.
Quite right, my child ...
#MISS COEURNE.
At least not - if ...
#GERARDO.
If my valet were not guarding the door downstairs.
#MISS COEURNE.
- if -
#GERARDO.
If she is as pretty and charmingly young as you.
#MISS COEURNE.
- if -
#GERARDO.
If she has heard me just once as Tannhäuser.
#MISS COEURNE.
If she is as respectable as I!
#GERARDO.
Now, before you leave, take a look at those flowers. Let it be a warning to you, if you should ever feel tempted again to fall in love with a singer. Do you see, how fresh they are, all of them! I just let them fade and go to waste or give them to the porter. Then look at these letters. I know none of the ladies who have written them; don't you worry. I leave them to their fate. What else can I do? But, you may believe me, every one of your charming young friends is among them.
#MISS COEURNE.
Well, I won't hide myself a second time. - I won't do it again ...
#GERARDO.
Really, my child, I haven't any more time. It's too bad, but I am about to leave town. I told you, did I not, that I am sorry for you? I really am, but my train is scheduled to leave in twenty - five minutes. So what more do you want? kiss.
#GERARDO.
From me?
#MISS COEURNE.
Yes.
#GERARDO.
You are desecrating art, my child. Do you really think it's for this that they are willing to pay my weight in gold? Get older first and learn to respect more highly the chaste goddess to whom I devote my life and labor. - You don't know whom I mean?
#MISS COEURNE.
No.
#GERARDO.
That's what I thought. Now, in order not to be inhuman, I will present you with my picture. Will you give me your word that after that you will leave me?
#MISS COEURNE.
Yes.
#GERARDO.
Very well, then. Why don't you try to interest yourself in the operas themselves rather than in the men on the stage? You may find it to be a higher enjoyment, after all.
#MISS COEURNE.
I am too young.
#GERARDO.
Sacrifice yourself to music! You are too young, but - may be you'll succeed in spite of that. Do not see in me the famous singer, but the unworthy tool in the hands of a master. Look around among the married women you know; all of them Wagnerians! Study his librettos, learn to feel each leitmotiv. That will keep you from committing indiscretions.
#MISS COEURNE.
I thank you.
#GERARDO.
Come in!
#VALET.
Yes, Sir? Your orders?
#GERARDO.
Are you standing at the door downstairs?
#VALET.
Not at present. Sir.
#GERARDO.
I can see as much - simpleton! But you won't let anybody come up here, will you?
#VALET.
There were three ladies inquiring about you.
#GERARDO.
Don't you dare admit anybody, whatever they tell you.
#VALET.
Then there's another batch of letters.
#GERARDO.
Yes, never mind. Don't you dare admit anybody!
#VALET.
Very well. Sir.
#GERARDO.
Not even, if they should offer you an annuity for life.
#VALET.
Very well, Sir.
#GERARDO.
"Isolde! Beloved! Art thou ..." I should think these women might get tired of me some time! But, then, the world holds so many of them! And I am only one. Well, everybody bears his yoke and has to bear it! "FAMOUS CONTEMPORARIES" Permission Albert Langen, Munich
#GERARDO.
What do you want?
#DÜHRING.
Mr. Gerardo, I - I have ...
#GERARDO.
How did you get in here?
#DÜHRING.
I've been watching my chance for two hours down on the sidewalk, Mr. Gerardo.
#GERARDO.
Let me see, you are ...
#DÜHRING.
For fully two hours I've been standing down on the sidewalk. What else was I to do?
#GERARDO.
But, my dear sir, I haven't the time.
#DÜHRING.
I don't mean to play the whole opera to you now.
#GERARDO.
I haven't the time left ...
#DÜHRING.
You haven't the time left! How about me! You are thirty. You have attained success in your art. You can continue following your bent through the whole long life that still is before you. I will ask you to listen only to your own part in my opera. You promised to do so when you came to town.
#GERARDO.
It's to no purpose, Sir. I am not my own master ...
#DÜHRING.
Please, Mr. Gerardo! Please, please! Look at me, here's an old man lying before you on his knees who has known only one thing in life: his art. I know what you would reply to me, you, a young man who has been carried aloft on the wings of angels, one might say. "If you would have the goddess of Fortune find you, don't hunt for her." Do you imagine, when one has cherished but a single hope for fifty years, one could possibly have overlooked any means whatsoever within human reach, to attain that hope? First one turns cynical and then serious again. One tries to get there by scheming, one is once more a light hearted child, and again an earnest seeker after one's artistic ideals - not for ambition's sake, not for conviction's sake, cannot help it, because it's a curse which has been laid on one by a cruel omnipotence to which the life - long agony of its creature is a pleasing offering! A pleasing offering, I say, for we whom art enthralls rebel against our lot as little as does the slave of a woman against his seductress, as little as does the dog against his master who whips him.
#GERARDO.
I am powerless ...
#DÜHRING.
Let me tell you, my dear Sir, the tyrants of antiquity who, as you know, would have their slaves tortured to death just for a pleasant pastime, they were mere children, they were harmless innocent little angels as compared with that divine providence which thought it was creating those tyrants in its own image.
#GERARDO.
While I quite comprehend you ...
#DÜHRING.
You do not comprehend me. You cannot comprehend me. How could you have had the time to comprehend me! Fifty years of fruitless labor, Sir, that is more than you can comprehend, if one has been a favorite child of fortune like you. But I'll try to make you realize it approximately, at least. You see, I am too old to take my own life. The proper time to do that is at twenty - five, and I have missed my opportunity. I must live out my life now, my hand has grown too unsteady. But would you know what an old man like me will do! You ask me how I got in here. You have put your valet on guard at the hotel entrance. I did not try to slip by him, I've known for fifty years what he will tell me: the gentleman is not in. But with my score here I stood at the corner of the building for two hours in the rain until he went up for a moment. Then I followed him, and while you were speaking to him in here, I concealed myself on the staircase - I need not tell you where. And then, when he had gone down again, I entered here. That's what a man of my years will do to reach one who might be his grandson. Please, Sir, please, let not this moment be without result for me even though it cost you a day, even though it cost you a whole week. It will be to your advantage as well as mine. A week ago, when you came to town on your starring tour, you promised me to let me play my opera to you; and since that time I've called every day. You either were rehearsing or had lady visitors. And now you are about to depart, which would mean that an old man like me in vain spent a whole week standing around in the street! And all it would cost you is a single word: "I will sing your Hermann." Then my opera will be performed. Then you will thank God for my intrusiveness, for - you sing "Siegfried," you sing "Florestan" - but you haven't in your repertory a more grateful part, one more adapted to a singer of your resources than that of "Hermann." Then with loud acclaim they will draw me out of my obscurity, and perhaps I'll have the opportunity of giving to the world at least a part of what I might have given, if it had not cast me out like a leper. But the great material gain resulting from my long struggle will not be mine, you alone will ...
#GERARDO.
Please, don't let this interrupt you!
#DÜHRING.
You see, there are performed ten new operas every year which become impossible after the second night, and every ten years a good one which lives. Now this opera of mine is a good one, it is well adapted for the stage, it is sure to be a financial success. If you let me, I'll show you letters from Liszt, from Wagner, from Rubinstein, in which these men look up to me as to a superior being. And why has it remained unperformed to the present day? Because I don't stand in the public market - place. I tell you, it's like what will happen to a young girl who for three years has been the reigning beauty at all dancing parties, but has forgotten to become engaged. One has to give way to another generation. Besides you know our court theatres. They are fortresses, I can assure you, compared with which the armor - plate of Metz and Rastadt is the merest tin. They would rather dig out ten corpses than admit a single living composer. And it's in getting over these ramparts that I ask you to lend me a hand. You are inside at thirty, I am outside at seventy. It would cost you just a word to let me in, while I am vainly battering my head against stone and steel. That's why I have come to you and if you are not absolutely inhuman, if your success has not killed off in you the very last trace of sympathy with striving fellow - artists, you cannot refuse my request.
#GERARDO.
I will let you know a week from now. I will play your opera through. Let me take it along.
#DÜHRING.
I am too old for that, Mr. Gerardo. Long before a week, as measured by your chronology, has elapsed, I shall lie beneath the sod. I've been put off that way too often. Hie Rhodus! Hie salta! It's five years ago now that I called on the manager of the Royal Theatre, Count Zedlitz: "What have you got for me, my dearest professor?" "An opera, your Excellency." "Indeed, you have written a new opera? Splendid!" "Your Excellency, I have not written a new opera. It's an old opera. I wrote it thirteen years ago." - It wasn't this one here, it was my Maria de Medicis. - "But why don't you let us have it then? Why, we are just hunting for new works. We simply cannot shuffle through any longer, turning the old ones over and over. My secretary is traveling from one theatre to another, without finding anything, and you, who live right here, withhold your production from us in proud disdain of the common crowd!" "Your Excellency," I replied, "I am not withholding anything from anybody. Heaven is my witness. I submitted this opera to your predecessor, Count Tornow, thirteen years ago and had to go to his office myself three years later to get it back. Nobody had as much as looked at it." "Now just leave it here, my dear professor. A week from now at the latest you'll have our answer." And in saying this he pulls the score from under my arm and claps it into the lowest drawer and that's where it is lying today! That's where it is lying today, Sir! But what would I do, child that I am in spite of my white hair, but go home and tell my Gretchen: they need a new opera here at our theatre. Mine is practically accepted now! A year later death took her away from me, - and she was the one friend left who had been with me when I began to work on it.
#GERARDO.
Sir, I cannot but feel the deepest sympathy for you ...
#DÜHRING.
That's where it is lying today.
#GERARDO.
May be you actually are a child in spite of your white hair. I must confess I doubt if I can help you.
#DÜHRING.
So you can endure the sight of an old man dragging himself along beside you on the same path on which your victorious flight carries you to the sun! Who knows but tomorrow you will lie on your knees before me and boast of knowing me, and today you see in the agonized groan of a creative artist nothing but a sad mistake and you cannot wring from your greed of gold the half hour it would take to rid me of the chains that are crushing me.
#GERARDO.
Sit down and play, sir! Come!
#DÜHRING.
No, that's not the way it reads. I have to get back into it first. That is the overture; I won't detain you with it. - Now here comes the first scene ... Here you stand at the deathbed of your father. Just a moment until I get my bearings ...
#GERARDO.
Perhaps all you say is quite true. But at any rate you misjudge my position.
#DÜHRING.
No, that's the chorus. I had thought of playing it to you because it's very good. Now comes your turn. Well? These anæmic, threadbare, plodding, would - be geniuses who are puffing themselves up today! Whose technique is so sublime, it makes them sterile, impotent at twenty! Meistersingers, philistines, that's what they are, whether they are starving or basking in the public favor. Fellows that go to the cookbook rather than to nature to satisfy their hunger. They think, indeed, they've learned her secret - naiveté! Ha - ha! - Tastes like plated brass! - They make art their starting - point rather than life! Write music for musicians rather than for yearning mankind! Blind, benighted ephemerons! Senile youths whom the sun of Wagner has dried and shriveled up! To judge a man's creative genius, do you know where I take hold of him first?
#GERARDO.
Well?
#DÜHRING.
This is where I take hold of him first of all. Do you see, right here! And if he hasn't anything here - please, let me go on playing. I won't go through the whole monologue. We shouldn't have the time anyway. Now here, scene three, end of the first act. That's where the farm laborer's child, who had grown up with you in the castle, suddenly enters. Now listen - after you have taken leave of your highly revered mother. Demon, who art thou? May one enter? Those words are hers, you understand. Barbette! Yes, it is I. Is your father dead? There he lies! Now isn't that music?
#GERARDO.
Possibly.
#DÜHRING.
Isn't that something more than the Trumpeter of Säkkingen? GERARDO, Your confidence compels me to be candid. I cannot imagine how I could use my influence with any benefit to you.
#DÜHRING.
In other words you mean to tell me that it is antiquated music.
#GERARDO.
I would much rather call it modern music.
#DÜHRING.
Or modern music. Pardon my slip of the tongue, Mr. Gerardo. It's what will happen when one gets old. You see, one manager will write me: We cannot use your opera, it is antiquated music - and another writes: We cannot use it because it is modern music. In plain language both mean the same: We don't want any opera of yours, because as a composer you don't count.
#GERARDO.
I am a Wagner singer, Sir, I am no critic. If you want to see your opera performed, you had better apply to those who are paid for knowing what is good and what is bad. My judgment in such matters, don't doubt that for a moment, Sir, counts the less, the more I am recognized and esteemed as a singer.
#DÜHRING.
My dear Mr. Gerardo, you may rest assured, I don't believe in your judgment either. What do I care for your judgment! I think I know what to expect of a tenor. I am playing this opera to you to make you say: I'll sing your Hermann! I'll sing your Hermann!
#GERARDO.
It won't avail you anything. I must do what I am asked to do; I am bound by my contracts. You can afford to stand down in the street for a week. A day more or less makes no difference to you. But if I do not leave here by the next train, my prospects in this world are ruined. May be, in another world they will engage singers who break their contracts! My chains are drawn more tightly than the harness of a carriage horse. If anybody, even an absolute stranger, asks me for material assistance lie will find I have an open hand, although the sacrifice of happiness my calling exacts of me is not paid for with five hundred thousand francs a year. But if you ask of me the slightest assertion of personal liberty, you are expecting too much of a slave such as I am. I can not sing your Hermann as long as you don't count as a composer.
#DÜHRING.
Please, Sir, let me continue. It will give you a desire for the part.
#GERARDO.
If you but knew, Sir, how often I have a desire for things which I must deny myself and how often I must assume burdens for which I have not the least desire! I have absolutely no choice in the matter. You have been a free man all your life. How can you complain of not being in the market? Why don't you go and put yourself in the market?
#DÜHRING.
Oh, the haggling - the shouting - the meanness you meet with! I have tried it a hundred times.
#GERARDO.
One must do what one is capable of doing and not what one is incapable of doing.
#DÜHRING.
Everything has to be learned first.
#GERARDO.
One must learn that which one is capable of learning. How am I to know if the case is not very much the same with your work as a composer.
#DÜHRING.
I am a composer, Mr. Gerardo.
#GERARDO.
You mean by that, you have devoted your whole strength to the writing of operas.
#DÜHRING.
Quite so.
#GERARDO.
And you hadn't any left to bring about a performance.
#DÜHRING.
Quite so.
#GERARDO.
The composers whom I know go about it just the other way. They slap their operas on paper the best way they know and keep their strength for bringing about a performance.
#DÜHRING.
They are a type of composer I don't envy.
#GERARDO.
They would reciprocate that feeling, Sir. These people do count. One must be something. Name me a single famous man who did not count! If one is not a composer, one is something else, that's all, and there's no need of being unhappy about it, either. I was something else myself before I became a Wagner singer - something, my efficiency at which nobody could doubt, and with which I was entirely satisfied. It is not for us to say what we are intended for in this world. If it were, any Tom, Dick, or Harry might come along! Do you know what I was before they discovered me? I was a paperhanger's apprentice. Do you know what that is like! I put paper on walls - with paste. I don't conceal my humble origin from anybody. Now just imagine, that as a paperhanger I should have taken it into my head to become a Wagner singer! Do you know what they would have done to me?
#DÜHRING.
They would have sent you to the madhouse.
#GERARDO.
Exactly, and rightly so. Whoever is dissatisfied with what he is will not get anywhere as long as he lives. A healthy man does that at which he is successful; if he fails, he chooses another calling. You spoke of the judgment of your friends. It does not take much to obtain expressions of approbation and admiration which do not cost those anything who utter them. Since my fifteenth year I have been paid for every labor I've performed and should have considered it a disgrace to be compelled to do something for nothing. Fifty years of fruitless struggling! Can anybody be so stubborn as not to have that convince him of the impossibility of his dreams! What did you get out of your life? You have sinfully wasted it! I have never striven for anything out of the ordinary; but, Sir, I can assure you of one thing: that since my earliest childhood days I have never had enough time left to stand out in the street for a whole week. And if I were to think that in my old days I might be compelled to do that very thing - Sir, I am speaking only for myself now - but I cannot imagine how I could still muster the courage to look people in the face.
#DÜHRING.
What? With such an opera in your hands! Remember, I am not doing it for my own sake; I am doing it for art's sake.
#GERARDO.
You overestimate art. Let me tell you that art is something quite different from what people make themselves believe about it.
#DÜHRING.
I know nothing higher on earth!
#GERARDO.
That's a view shared only by people like yourself to whose interest it is to make this view prevail generally. We artists are merely one of bourgeoisie's luxuries in paying for which they will outbid each other. If you were right, how would an opera like Walküre be possible which deals with things the exposure of which is absolutely abhorrent to the public. Yet when I sing the part of Siegmund, the most solicitous mothers will not hesitate to bring in their thirteen or fourteen year old daughters. And indeed, as I am standing on the stage, I know for certain that not one person in the audience any longer pays the slightest attention to the action itself. If they did they would get up and out. That's what they actually did when the opera was still new. Now they have accustomed themselves to ignoring it. They notice it as little as they notice the air separating them from the stage. That, you see, is the meaning of what you call art! To this you have sacrificed fifty years of your life! Our real duty as artists is to produce ourselves to the paying public night after night under one pretense or another. Nor is its interest limited to such exhibitions; it fastens itself as tenaciously upon our private life. One belongs to the public with every breath one draws; and because we submit to this for money, people never know which they had better do most, idolize us or despise us. Go and find out how many went to the theatre yesterday to hear me sing and how many came to gape at me as they would gape at the emperor of China if he were to come to town tomorrow. Do you know what the public is after in its pursuit of art? To shout bravos, to throw flowers and wreaths upon the stage, to have something to talk about, to be seen by others, to say Ah and Oh, once in a while to take a hand in unhitching a performer's horses - these are the public's real wants, and I satisfy them. If they pay me half a million, I in return furnish a living to a legion of cabmen, writers, milliners, florists, tavernkeepers. The money is made to circulate. People's blood is made to circulate. Young girls become engaged, old maids get married, wives fall victims to their husbands' friends, and grandmothers get no end of topics for gossip. Accidents and crimes are made to happen. At the ticket office a child is trampled to death, a lady is robbed of her pocketbook, a gentleman in the audience becomes insane during a performance. That creates business for physicians, lawyers ... And to think in this condition I am to sing Tristan tomorrow! - I am not telling you these things out of vanity but to cure you of your delusion. The standard by which to judge a man's importance in this world is the world itself and not some fixed conviction one may have acquired through years of brooding meditation. I did not put myself in the market either; they discovered me. There are no unappreciated, neglected geniuses. We are not the makers and masters of our own fate; man is born a slave!
#DÜHRING.
Please, before I go, let me play to you the first scene of the second act. It's laid in a park, you know, just like the famous picture: Embarquement pour Cythère ...
#GERARDO.
But I told you I haven't the time! Besides what am I to gather from a few detached scenes'?
#DÜHRING.
I am afraid, Mr. Gerardo, you are somewhat misjudging me. After all, I am not quite so unknown to the rest of the world as I am to you. My person and name are known. Wagner himself mentions me often enough in his writings. And let me tell you, if I die today, my works will be performed tomorrow. I am as sure of that as I know that my music will retain its value. My Berlin publisher writes me every day: All that's needed is for you to die. Why then in the world don't you?
#GERARDO.
All I can reply to you is this: that since Wagner's death there hasn't been a call for new operas anywhere. If you offer new music, you have all conservatories, all singers and the whole public against you from the start. If you want to see your works performed, write a music which does not differ the least from what is in vogue today; just copy; steal your opera in bits and scraps from the whole of Wagner's operas. Then you may count with considerable probability on having it accepted. My tremendous hit last night should prove to you that the old music is all that's needed for years to come. And my opinion is that of every other singer, of every manager and of the whole paying public. Why should I go out of my way to have a new music whipped into me when the old music has already cost me such inhuman whippings?
#DÜHRING.
I am sorry but I fear I'm too old to learn to steal. That's the kind of thing one has to begin young or one will never learn.
#GERARDO.
I hope I haven't offended you, Sir. - But, my dear Sir, - if you would permit me - the thought that life means a hard struggle to you - it so happens that I have received five hundred marks more than I ...
#DÜHRING.
Please, please, I beg of you, no! Don't finish what you meant to say. No, no, no! That is not what I came for. You know what a great sage has said: - They are all of them good - natured, but ...! - No, Mr. Gerardo, I did not ask you to listen to my opera in order to practise extortion on you. I love my child too much for that. No indeed, Mr. Gerardo ...
#GERARDO.
Oh please. Sir. - Happy to have known you, Sir.
#GERARDO.
For whom am I raking together so much money? - For my children I Yes, if I had any children! - For my old age? - Two more years will make a wreck of me! - Then it will be:
#HELEN.
I am just likely, am I not, to let that creature block my way! I suppose you placed him down there to prevent me from reaching you!
#GERARDO.
Helen!
#HELEN.
Why, you knew that I was coming, didn't you?
#VALET.
I did my very best, Sir, but the lady ... she ... she ...
#HELEN.
Boxed your ears!
#GERARDO.
Helen!
#HELEN.
Would you expect me to put up with such an insult?
#GERARDO.
You may go.
#HELEN.
I can no longer live without you. Either you will take me along or I shall kill myself.
#GERARDO.
Helen!
#HELEN.
I shall kill myself! You cut asunder my vital nerve if you insist on our separation. You leave me without either heart or brain. To live through another day like yesterday, a whole day without seeing you, - I simply cannot do it. I am not strong enough for it. I implore you, Oscar, take me along! I am pleading for my life!
#GERARDO.
It is impossible.
#HELEN.
Nothing is impossible if you are but willing! How can you say it is impossible? It is impossible for you to leave me without killing me. These are no empty words, I do not mean it as a threat; it is the simple truth! I am as certain of it as I can feel my own heart in here: not to have you means death to me. Therefore take me along. If not for my sake, do it for human mercy's sake! Let it be for only a short time, I don't care.
#GERARDO.
I give you my word of honor, Helen, I cannot do it. - I give you my word of honor.
#HELEN.
You must do it, Oscar! Whether you can or not, you must bear the consequences of your own acts. My life is dear to me, but you and my life are one. Take me with you, Oscar, unless you want to shed my blood!
#GERARDO.
Do you remember what I told you the very first day within these four walls?
#HELEN.
I do. But of what good is that to me now?
#GERARDO.
That there could be no thought of any real sentiment in our relations?
#HELEN.
Of what good is that to me now? Did I know you then? Why, I did not know what a man could be like until I knew you! You foresaw it would come to this or you would not have begun by exacting from me that promise not to make a scene at your departure. Besides do you think there is anything I should not have promised you if you had asked me to? That promise means my death. You will have cheated me out of my life if you go and leave me!
#GERARDO.
I cannot take you with me!
#HELEN.
Good Heavens, didn't I know that you would say that! Didn't I know before coming here! It's such a matter of course! You tell every one of them so. And why am I better than they! I am one of a hundred. There are a million women as good as I. I needn't be told, I know. - But I am ill, Oscar! I am sick unto death! I am love - sick! I am nearer to death than to life! That is your work, and you can save me without sacrificing anything, without assuming a burden. Tell me, why can you not?
#GERARDO.
Because my contract does not allow me either to marry or to travel in the company of ladies.
#HELEN.
What is to prevent you?
#GERARDO.
My contract.
#HELEN.
You are not allowed to ...?
#GERARDO.
I am not allowed to marry until my contract has expired.
#HELEN.
And you are not allowed to ...?
#GERARDO.
I am not allowed to travel in the company of ladies.
#HELEN.
That's incomprehensible to me. Whom in the world does it concern?
#GERARDO.
It concerns my manager.
#HELEN.
Your manager? - What business is it of his?
#GERARDO.
It is his business.
#HELEN.
Perhaps because it might affect your voice?
#GERARDO.
Yes.
#HELEN.
Why, that's childish! - Does it affect your voice?
#GERARDO.
It does not.
#HELEN.
Does your manager believe such nonsense?
#GERARDO.
No, he does not believe it.
#HELEN.
That's incomprehensible to me. I don't understand how a - respectable man can sign such a contract!
#GERARDO.
My rights as a man are only a secondary consideration. I am an artist in the first place.
#HELEN.
Yes, you are. A great artist! An eminent artist! Don't you comprehend how I must love you? Is that the only thing your great mind cannot comprehend? All that makes me appear contemptible now in my relation to you is due to just this, that I see in you the only man who has ever made me feel his superiority to me and whom it has been my sole thought to win. I have clenched my teeth to keep from betraying to you what you are to me for fear you might weary of me. But my experience of yesterday has left me in a state of mind which no woman can endure. If I did not love you so madly, Oscar, you would think more of me. That is so terrible in you that you must despise the woman whose whole world you are. Of what I formerly was to myself there is not a trace left. And now that your passion has left me a burned - out shell, would you leave me here? You are taking my life with you, Oscar! Then take with you as well this flesh and blood which has been yours, or it will perish!
#GERARDO.
Helen ...!
#HELEN.
Contracts! What are contracts to you! Why, there's not a contract made that one cannot get around in some way! What do people make contracts for? Don't use your contract as a weapon with which to murder me. I am not afraid of your contracts! Let me go with you, Oscar! We'll see if he as much as mentions a breach of contract. He won't do it or I am a poor judge of human nature. And if he does object, it will still be time for me to die.
#GERARDO.
But we have no right to possess each other, Helen! You are as little free to follow me as I am to assume such a responsibility. I do not belong to myself; I belong to my art ...
#HELEN.
Oh don't talk to me of your art! What do I care for your art. I've clung to your art merely to attract your attention. Did Heaven create a man like you to let you make a clown of yourself night after night? Are you not ashamed of boasting of it? You see that I am willing to overlook your being an artist. What wouldn't one overlook in a demigod like you? And if you were a convict, Oscar, I could not feel differently toward you. I have lost all control over myself! I should still lie in the dust before you as I am doing now! I should still implore your mercy as I am doing now! My own self would still be abandoned to you as it is now! I should still be facing death as I am now!
#GERARDO.
Why, Helen, you and facing death! Women so richly endowed for the enjoyment of life as you are do not kill themselves. You know the value of life better than I. You are too happily constituted to cast it away. That is left for others to do - for stunted and dwarfed creatures, the stepchildren of nature.
#HELEN.
Oscar, I did not say that I was going to shoot myself. When did I say that? How could I summon the courage? I say that I shall die if you do not take me with you just as one might die of any ailment because I can live only if I am with you! I can live without anything else - without home, without children, but not without you, Oscar! I can not live without you!
#GERARDO.
Helen - if you do not calm yourself now, you will force me to do something terrible! I have just ten minutes left. The scene you are making here won't be accepted as a legal excuse for my breaking my contract! No court would regard your excited state of mind as a sufficient justification. I have ten more minutes to give you. If by that time you have not calmed yourself, Helen - then I cannot leave you to yourself!
#HELEN.
Oh let the whole world see me lie here!
#GERARDO.
Consider what you will risk!
#HELEN.
As if I had anything left to risk!
#GERARDO.
You might lose your social position.
#HELEN.
All I can lose is you!
#GERARDO.
What about those to whom you belong?
#HELEN.
I can now belong to no one but you!
#GERARDO.
But I do not belong to you!
#HELEN.
I've nothing left to lose but life itself.
#GERARDO.
How about your children?
#HELEN.
Who took me away from them, Oscar! Who robbed my children of their mother!
#GERARDO.
Did I make advances to you?
#HELEN.
No, no! Don't think that for a moment! I just threw myself at you and should throw myself at you again today! No husband, no children could restrain me! If I die, I have at least tasted life! Through you, Oscar! I owe it to you that I have come to know myself! I have to thank you for it, Oscar!
#GERARDO.
Helen - now listen to me calmly ...
#HELEN.
Yes, yes - there are ten minutes left ...
#GERARDO.
Listen to me calmly ...
#HELEN.
I have to thank you for it ...
#GERARDO.
Helen -
#HELEN.
I don't ask you to love me. If I may but breathe the same air with you ...!
#GERARDO.
Helen - to a man like me the conventional rules of life cannot be applied. I have known society women in all the lands of Europe. They have made me scenes, too, when it was time for me to leave - but when it came to choosing, I always knew what I owed to my position. Never yet have I met with such an outburst of passion as yours. Helen - I am tempted every day to withdraw to some idyllic Arcadia with this or that woman. But one has his duty to perform; you as well as I; and duty is the highest law ...
#HELEN.
I think I know better by this time, Oscar, what is the highest law.
#GERARDO.
Well, what is it? Not your love, I hope? That's what every woman says! Whatever a woman wants to carry through she calls good, and if anybody refuses to yield to her then he is bad. That's what our fool playwrights have done for us. In order to draw full houses they put the world upside down and call it great - souled if a woman sacrifices her children and her family to indulge her senses. I should like to live like a turtledove, too. But as long as I have been in this world I have first obeyed my duty. If after that the opportunity offered, then, to be sure, I've enjoyed life to the full. But if one does not follow one's duty, one has no right to make the least claims on others.
#HELEN.
That will not bring the dead to life again ...
#GERARDO.
Why, Helen, don't you see, I want to give back your life to you! I want to give back to you what you have sacrificed to me. Take it, I implore you! Don't make more of it than it is! Helen, how can a woman so disgracefully humiliate herself! What has become of your pride? With what contempt would you have shown me my proper place if I had fallen in love with you, if it had occurred to me to be jealous! What am I in the eyes of the society in which you move! A man who makes a clown of himself! Would you fling away your life for a man whom a hundred women have loved before you, whom a hundred women will love after you without allowing it to cause them a moment of distress! Do you want your flowing blood to make you ridiculous in the sight of God and man?
#HELEN.
I know very well that I am asking an unheard - of thing of you but - what else can I do ...
#GERARDO.
I have given you all that's in my power to give. Even to a princess I could not be more than I have been to you. If there is one thing further our relations, if continued, might mean to you, it could only be the utter ruin of your life. Now release me, HELEN! I understand how hard you find it, but - one often fears one is going to die. I myself often tremble for my life - art as a profession is so likely to unstring one's nerves. It's astonishing how soon one will get over that kind of thing. Resign yourself to the fortuitousness of life. We did not seek one another because we loved each other; we loved each other because we happened to find one another! You say I must bear the consequences of my acts, Helen. Would you in all seriousness think ill of me now for not refusing you admittance when you came under the pretext of having me pass on your voice? I dare say you think too highly of your personal advantages for that; you know yourself too well; you are too proud of your beauty. Tell me, were you not absolutely certain of victory when you came?
#HELEN.
Oh, what was I a week ago! And what - what am I now!
#GERARDO.
Helen, ask yourself this question: what choice is left to a man in such a case? You are generally known as the most beautiful woman in this city. Now shall I, an artist, allow myself to acquire the reputation of an unsociable lout who shuts himself up in his four walls and denies himself to all visitors? The second possibility would be to receive you while at the same time pretending not to understand you. That would give me the wholly undeserved reputation of a simpleton. Third possibility - but this is extremely dangerous - I explain to you calmly and politely the very thing I am saying to you now. But that is very dangerous! For apart from your immediately giving me an insulting reply, calling me a vain conceited fool, it would, if it became known, make me appear in a most curious light. And what would at best be the result of my refusing the honor offered me? That you would make of me a contemptible helpless puppet, a target for your feminine wit, a booby whom you could tease and taunt as much as you liked, whom you could torment and put on the rack until you had driven him mad. Say yourself, Helen; what choice was left to me? In such a case I face just this alternative: - to make an enemy who despises me or - to make an enemy who at least respects me. And Helen! - one does not care to be despised by a woman of such universally recognized beauty. Now does your pride still permit you to ask me to take you with me?
#HELEN.
Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God ...
#GERARDO.
Your social position gave you the opportunity to make advances to me. You availed yourself of it. - I am the last person to think ill of you for that. But no more should you think ill of me for wishing to maintain my rights. No man could be franker with a woman than I have been with you. I told you that there could be no thought of any sentimentalities between you and me. I told you that my profession prevented me from binding myself. I told you that my engagement in this city would end today ...
#HELEN.
Oh how my head rings! It's just words, words, words I hear! But I am choking here and choking here! Oscar - matters are worse than you realize! A woman such as I am more or less in the world - I have given life to two children. What would you say, Oscar ... what would you say if tomorrow I should go and make another man as happy as you have been with me? What would you say then, Oscar? - Speak! - Speak!
#GERARDO.
What I should say? Just nothing. Helen ...
#HELEN.
Oscar! - I am imploring you for my life! For my life! It's the last time I shall ask you for it! Demand anything of me! But not that! Don't ask my life! You don't know what you are doing! You are mad! You are beside yourself! It's the last time! You detest me because I love you! Let not these minutes pass! - Save me! Save me!
#GERARDO.
Now listen to a kind word! - Listen to a - kind - word ...
#HELEN.
So it must be!
#GERARDO.
Helen - how old are your children?
#HELEN.
One is six and the other four.
#GERARDO.
Both girls?
#HELEN.
No.
#GERARDO.
The one four years old is a boy?
#HELEN.
Yes.
#GERARDO.
And the younger one a girl?
#HELEN.
No.
#GERARDO.
Both boys?
#HELEN.
Yes.
#GERARDO.
Have you no pity for them?
#HELEN.
No.
#GERARDO.
How happy I should be if they were mine! - Helen - would you give them to me?
#HELEN.
Yes.
#GERARDO.
Suppose I should be as unreasonable as you - taking it into my head that I am in love with some particular woman and can love no other! I cannot marry her. I cannot take her with me. Yet I must leave. Just what would that lead me to?
#HELEN.
Yes, yes. - Certainly. - I understand.
#GERARDO.
Believe me, Helen, there are any number of men in this world like me. The very way you and I have met ought to teach you something. You say you cannot live without me. How many men do you know? The more you will come to know the lower you will rate them. Then you won't think again of taking your life for a man's sake. You will have no higher opinion of them than I have of women.
#HELEN.
You think I am just like you. I am not.
#GERARDO.
I am quite serious, Helen. Nobody loves just one particular person unless he does not know any other. Everybody loves his own kind and can find it anywhere when he has once learned how to go about it.
#HELEN.
And when one has met one's kind, one is always sure of having one's love returned!
#GERARDO.
You have no right, Helen, to complain of your husband! Why did you not know yourself better! Every young girl is free to choose for herself. There is no power on earth that could compel a girl to belong to a man whom she doesn't like. No such violence can be done to woman's rights. That's a kind of nonsense those women would like to make the world believe who having sold themselves for some material advantage or other would prefer to escape their obligations.
#HELEN.
Which would be a breach of contract, I suppose.
#GERARDO.
If I sell myself, they are at least dealing with an honest man!
#HELEN.
Then one who loves is not honest!
#GERARDO.
No! - Love is a distinctly philistine virtue. Love is sought by those who do not venture out into the world, who fear a comparison with others, who haven't the courage to face a fair trial of strength. Love is sought by every miserable rhymester who cannot live without being idolized by some one. Love is sought by the peasant who yokes his wife together with his ox to his plow. Love is a refuge for molly - coddles and cowards! - In the great world in which I live everybody is recognized for what he is actually worth. If two join together, they know exactly what to think of one another and need no love for it.
#HELEN.
Will you not introduce me into that great world of yours!
#GERARDO.
Helen - would you sacrifice your own happiness and that of your family for a fleeting pleasure!
#HELEN.
No.
#GERARDO.
Do you promise me to return to your family without show of reluctance!
#HELEN.
Yes.
#GERARDO.
And that you will not die, not even as one might die of some ailment!
#HELEN.
Yes.
#GERARDO.
Do you really promise me!
#HELEN.
Yes.
#GERARDO.
That you will be true to your duties as a mother - and as a wife!
#HELEN.
Yes.
#GERARDO.
Helen!
#HELEN.
Yes! - What more do you want! - I promise you.
#GERARDO.
That I may leave town without fear!
#HELEN.
Yes.
#GERARDO.
Now shall we kiss each other once more!
#HELEN.
Yes - yes - yes - yes - yes - yes ...
#GERARDO.
A year from now, Helen, I shall sing again in this town. year from now! - Yes, to be sure.
#GERARDO.
Helen! Helen! Helen!
#ELEVATOR BOY.
Mr. - Mr. Gerardo!
#SCRUBWOMAN.
She's still alive.
#GERARDO.
Send for the police! I must be arrested! If I leave now, I am a brute and if I remain, I am ruined, for it would be a breach of contract. I still have a minute and ten seconds left. Quick! I must be arrested within that time!
#MÜLLER.
Fritz, get the nearest policeman!
#ELEVATOR BOY.
Yes, Sir!
#MÜLLER.
Run as fast as you can! Don't let it upset you, Mr. GERARDO. That kind of thing is an old story with us here.
#GERARDO.
Helen! She's still alive! She's still alive! If I am arrested, it counts as a legal excuse. How about my trunks? - Is the carriage at the door?
#MÜLLER.
Has been there the last twenty minutes, Sir.
#GERARDO.
Helen! - It can't hurt me professionally. Haven't you sent for a physician yet?
#MÜLLER.
The doctor has been 'phoned to at once. Will be here in just a minute, I am sure.
#GERARDO.
Helen! - Don't you recognize me, Helen? - Come now, the physician will be here in just a moment! - Your Oscar, Helen! - Helen!
#ELEVATOR BOY.
Can't find a policeman anywhere!
#GERARDO.
I must sing "Tristan" tomorrow!
