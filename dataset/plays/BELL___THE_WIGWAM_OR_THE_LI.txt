#ELSIE.
Isn't it delightful that Fanny is coming from London to spend the day with us.
#MARY.
Indeed it is. We must show her everything as soon as she comes.
#ELISE.
Yes, directly - and the first thing must be the wigwam.
#MARY.
Of course it must, and we will tell her all about it, and that it is our own hut in the garden that we have arranged ourselves.
#ELISE.
Or shall we make her guess who made it?
#MARY.
Oh yes! That would be lovely! We will take her there, and tell her to shut her eyes quite tight.
#ELISE.
Then she won't be able to see the wigwam.
#MARY.
No, that's true. Then she must have them shut all the way through the garden.
#ELISE.
And when she gets there, we will say: "Open your eyes, and guess whose wigwam this is".
#MARY.
And, when she has guessed that, we will say: "Now guess who painted it".
#ELISE.
And, when she has guessed that, we will say: "Now guess who furnished it".
#MARY.
And, when she has guessed that, we'll say: "Guess who papered it".
#ELISE.
She'll be rather stupid if she does not guess that time whose it is.
#MARY.
But, you know, little girls from London are very often stupid, when they come into the country.
#ELISE.
That's true. Do you remember when Amy came, she did not know the difference between a goose and a duck?
#MARY.
And she was afraid of the turkey - cock!
#ELISE.
And she looked at an oak, and said how very small the chestnuts were!
#MARY.
There's the door - bell. There they are! Now, mind, I am the eldest, so I shall say: "Now, I am going to show you the wigwam" as soon as she comes in.
#ELISE.
Before we shake hands?
#MARY.
No! no! After we shake hands.
#ELISE.
I think I ought to say it too, you know.
#MARY.
It would be absurd both saying it together, she won't understand.
#ELISE.
Oh, yes! she will, if we say it loud and slowly, like this, now then you say it with me : We - are - going - to - show - you - the - wigwam!!
#MARY.
Capital! There she is!
#ELISE.
and M. How do you do? How do you do?
#ELISE.
and M. We are going to show you the wigwam.
#FANNY.
Oh, how loudly you talk! One at a time, if you please. It makes me ill when you shout like that.
#ELISE.
We said we were going to show you the wigwam.
#FANNY.
What's that? I hate insects.
#MARY.
It isn't an insect! it's a hut in the garden.
#FANNY.
That's not so bad. Dear me! how tired I am.
#ELISE.
What has tired you so much?
#FANNY.
Why, we walked all the way from the station.
#MARY.
The station! Why, it's barely five minutes from here.
#FANNY.
I don't care how long it is, it tired me all the same.
#ELISE.
We'll go to the wigwam when you are rested.
#FANNY.
How far is it?
#MARY.
Just across the garden, on the other side of the lawn.
#FANNY.
If I walk across the grass I shall get my feet wet.
#ELISE.
Then we'll go by the gravel walk, it's only a few seconds longer.
#FANNY.
If I walk on the gravel I shall spoil my kid boots.
#MARY.
You ought to have strong boots like ours for the country.
#FANNY.
I can't bear those clumsy boots!
#ELISE.
Then how are you going to get to the wigwam?
#FANNY.
Why should we go there at all?
#MARY.
Because we wanted to show it to you.
#FANNY.
Why?
#MARY.
We want you to guess who furnished it.
#FANNY.
The carpenter, I suppose, or the upholsterer, or whoever does those things.
#MARY.
No, we did it.
#FANNY.
You!
#MARY.
We papered and painted it all ourselves.
#FANNY.
Oh how disgusting!
#ELISE.
Disgusting! it was delightful. We did it with paste and with Aspinall.
#MARY.
I love Aspinall.
#FANNY.
I don't. I hate having paint on my fingers.
#ELISE.
And the paste is quite clean - it's only flour and water.
#FANNY.
Flour and water! Ugh! I can't bear things that make one's fingers sticky.
#ELISE.
After all, it is very easy to wash off.
#FANNY.
I don't like to wash my hands too often, it spoils my skin.
#ELISE.
Besides, of course, you need not touch either the paste or the paint.
#FANNY.
What shall I do then?
#ELISE.
You shall sit down and look round you.
#FANNY.
Sit on what?
#ELISE.
On an old packing - case covered with chintz! You have no idea what a comfortable seat it makes. packing - case! I am sure there would be nails in it that would catch on my dress. I would rather sit in the house on a proper chair.
#ELISE.
But you surely don't want to stay in all day, when the sun is shining like this?
#FANNY.
That's just it, I don't like to sit in the sun. I shall get freckled.
#MARY.
Do you like to be out in the damp, then?
#FANNY.
Oh no, indeed! It takes the curl out of my hair.
#MARY.
What shall we do, then? It's so dull sitting in here.
#FANNY.
Very! but I knew before I came it would be dull.
#MARY.
Isn't she rude!
#ELISE.
Hush! I'll tell you what we will do. We'll go into the poultry - yard, it is shady there.
#FANNY.
Well, what is there to see in the poultry - yard?
#ELISE.
Oh, all sorts of things. We can look for eggs and bring in some for breakfast.
#FANNY.
I think the servants ought to do that.
#MARY.
Or we can feed the hens.
#FANNY.
I wouldn't for worlds! I hate things that come flapping and pecking round my feet.
#MARY.
Then let's go into the stable and we will show you our ponies.
#FANNY.
Oh, no! Stables are so smelly, I can't bear them.
#ELISE.
Well, is there anything you would like to do? What do you do in London?
#FANNY.
I like driving through the streets in an open carriage and looking at the shops.
#MARY.
In that case, you had better have remained in London, as there are no streets here and no shops.
#FANNY.
Very well! I shall go and tell my mother that I want to go back.
#MARY.
You had better! Come, Elsie, let us go to the wigwam.
