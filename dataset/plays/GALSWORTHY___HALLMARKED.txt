#LADY ELLA.
Don't bring Hannibal in till I know where she's put Edward!
#MAUD.
Bad dog! Bad dog!
#LADY ELLA.
Maud, do take him out! Tie him up. Here! No - something stronger! Poor darling Edward! You are a bad dog!
#MAUD.
Edward began it, Ella. Bad dog! Bad dog!
#LADY ELLA.
Tie him up outside. Here, take my scarf. Where is my poor treasure? Catch! His ear's torn; I saw it.
#MAUD.
Now! He smells horrible. Bad dog - getting into ponds to fight!
#LADY ELLA.
Tie him up, Maud. I must try in here.
#MAUD.
Smell him, Bertie! You might have that pond drained, Squire!
#HER VOICE.
All right! I've bound him up!
#LADY ELLA.
May I come in?
#HER VOICE.
Just a second! I've got nothing on.
#LADY ELLA.
Oh! There you are!
#THE RECTOR.
I was just going to wade in -
#LADY ELLA.
Hannibal would have killed him, if she hadn't rushed in!
#THE SQUIRE.
Done him good, little beast!
#LADY ELLA.
Why didn't you go in, Tommy?
#THE SQUIRE.
Well, I would - only she -
#LADY ELLA.
I can't think how she got Edward out of Hannibal's awful mouth!
#MAUD.
Bad dog!
#LADY ELLA.
We must simply thank her tremendously! I shall never forget the way she ran in, with her skirts up to her waist!
#THE SQUIRE.
By Jove! No. It was topping.
#LADY ELLA.
Her clothes must be ruined. That pond - ugh! Tommy, do have it drained.
#THE RECTOR.
I don't remember her face in church.
#THE SQUIRE.
Ah! Yes. Who is she? Pretty woman!
#LADY ELLA.
I must get the Vet. to Edward. Tommy, do exert yourself!
#THE SQUIRE.
All right! Here's a bell!
#HER VOICE.
The bleeding's stopped. Shall I send him in to you?
#LADY ELLA.
Oh, please! Poor darling!
#LADY ELLA.
Look! Hannibal's loose! Maud - Tommy.
#LADY ELLA.
Yes, I know - you'd like to! You SHALL bite him when it's safe. Oh! my darling, you DO - Have you tied him properly this time?
#MAUD.
With Bertie's braces.
#LADY ELLA.
Oh! but -
#MAUD.
It's all right; they're almost leather.
#LADY ELLA.
Rector, are you sure it's safe?
#THE RECTOR.
No, indeed, LADY Ella - I -
#LADY ELLA.
Tommy, do lend a hand!
#THE SQUIRE.
All right, Ella; all right! He doesn't mean what you mean!
#LADY ELLA.
Hold him, Tommy. He's sure to smell out Hannibal!
#THE SQUIRE.
Jove! Clever if he can smell anything but himself. Phew! She ought to have the Victoria Cross for goin' in that pond.
#SHE.
So very sorry - had to have a bath, and change, of course!
#LADY ELLA.
We're so awfully grateful to you. It was splendid.
#MAUD.
Quite.
#THE RECTOR.
Heroic! I was just myself about to -
#THE SQUIRE.
Little beast will fight - must apologise - you were too quick for me -
#SHE.
Poor dears! They thought they were so safe in that nice pond!
#LADY ELLA.
Is he very badly torn?
#SHE.
Rather nasty. There ought to be a stitch or two put in his ear.
#LADY ELLA.
I thought so. Tommy, do -
#THE SQUIRE.
All right. Am I to let him go?
#LADY ELLA.
No.
#MAUD.
The fly's outside. Bertie, run and tell Jarvis to drive in for the Vet.
#THE RECTOR.
Run? Well, Maud - I -
#SHE.
The doctor would sew it up. My maid can go round.
#LADY ELLA.
Look! Catch him! Rector!
#MAUD.
Bertie! Catch him!
#SHE.
Take this strop - he can't break that. And would these be any good to you?
#LADY ELLA.
Splendid, isn't she? I do admire her.
#THE SQUIRE.
She's all there.
#THE RECTOR.
Most kind.
#THE SQUIRE.
Eh?
#MAUD.
Yes.
#THE SQUIRE.
Ah!
#LADY ELLA.
Poor darling!
#THE SQUIRE.
Ella, the Rector wants to get up!
#THE RECTOR.
Perhaps - just for a moment -
#LADY ELLA.
Oh!
#THE SQUIRE.
So she's married!
#LADY ELLA.
Why?
#THE SQUIRE.
Braces.
#LADY ELLA.
Oh! Yes. We ought to ask them to dinner, Tommy.
#THE SQUIRE.
Ah! Yes. Wonder who they are?
#THE RECTOR.
Really very good of her to lend her husband's - I was - er - quite -
#MAUD.
That'll do, Bertie.
#HERSELF.
Caught the doctor just starting, So lucky!
#LADY ELLA.
Oh! Thank goodness!
#DR. BEVAN.
How do, Lady Ella? How do, Squire? - how do, Rector?
#LADY ELLA.
Oh! I!
#HERSELF.
D'you know, I think I'd better. It's so dreadful when it's your own, isn't it? Shall we go in here, doctor? Come along, pretty boy!
#LADY ELLA.
I dreaded it. She is splendid!
#THE SQUIRE.
Dogs take to her. That's a sure sign.
#THE RECTOR.
Little things - one can always tell.
#THE SQUIRE.
Something very attractive about her - what! Fine build of woman.
#MAUD.
I shall get hold of her for parish work.
#THE RECTOR.
Ah! Excellent - excellent! Do!
#THE SQUIRE.
Wonder if her husband shoots? She seems quite - er - quite -
#LADY ELLA.
Quite! Altogether charming; one of the nicest faces I ever saw. Oh! Doctor - have you? is it - ?
#DR. BEVAN.
Right as rain! She held him like an angel - he just licked her, and never made a sound.
#LADY ELLA.
Poor darling! Can I -
#DR. BEVAN.
Better leave 'em a minute. She's moppin' 'im off. Wonderful clever hands!
#THE SQUIRE.
I say - who is she?
#DR. BEVAN.
Who? Well - there you have me! All I know is she's a first - rate nurse - been helpin' me with a case in Ditch Lane. Nice woman, too - thorough good sort! Quite an acquisition here. H'm! Excuse me hurryin' off - very late. Good - bye, Rector. Good - bye, Lady Ella. Good - bye!
#THE SQUIRE.
H'm! I suppose we ought to be a bit careful.
#JARVIS.
Beg pardon, sir. Is the little dog all right?
#MAUD.
Yes.
#JARVIS.
Seein' you've missed your train, m'm, shall I wait, and take you 'ome again?
#MAUD.
No.
#JARVIS.
Cert'nly, m'm.
#LADY ELLA.
Oh, Jarvis - what's the name of the people here?
#JARVIS.
Challenger's the name I've driven 'em in, my lady.
#THE SQUIRE.
Challenger? Sounds like a hound. What's he like?
#JARVIS.
Wears a soft 'at, sir.
#THE SQUIRE.
H'm! Ah!
#JARVIS.
Very nice gentleman, very nice lady. 'Elped me with my old mare when she 'ad the 'ighsteria last week - couldn't 'a' been kinder if they'd 'a' been angels from 'eaven. Wonderful fond o' dumb animals, the two of 'em. I don't pay no attention to gossip, meself.
#MAUD.
Gossip? What gossip?
#JARVIS.
Did I make use of the word, m'm? You'll excuse me, I'm sure. There's always talk where there's newcomers. I takes people as I finds 'em.
#THE RECTOR.
Yes, yes, Jarvis - quite - quite right!
#JARVIS.
Yes, sir. I've - I've got a 'abit that way at my time o' life.
#MAUD.
How long have they been here, Jarvis?
#JARVIS.
Well - er - a matter of three weeks, m'm. Of course, in my profession I can't afford to take notice of whether there's the trifle of a ring between 'em, as the sayin' is. 'Tisn't 'ardly my business like.
#LADY ELLA.
Er - thank you, Jarvis; you needn't wait.
#JARVIS.
No, m'lady. Your service, sir - service, m'm.
#THE SQUIRE.
Three weeks? I say - er - wasn't there a book?
#THE RECTOR.
Three weeks - I certainly haven't seen them in church. trifle of a ring!
#LADY ELLA.
Oh, bother! I'm sure she's all right. And if she isn't, I don't care. She's been much too splendid.
#THE SQUIRE.
Must think of the village. Didn't quite like the doctor's way of puttin' us off.
#LADY ELLA.
The poor darling owes his life to her.
#THE SQUIRE.
H'm! Dash it! Yes! Can't forget the way she ran into that stinkin' pond.
#MAUD.
Had she a wedding - ring on?
#LADY ELLA.
Well, I'm not going to be ungrateful.
#THE SQUIRE.
It'd be dashed awkward - mustn't take a false step, Ella.
#THE RECTOR.
And I've got his braces!
#MAUD.
Bertie!
#THE SQUIRE.
That's all right, Rector - we're goin' to be perfectly polite, and - and - thank her, and all that.
#LADY ELLA.
We can see she's a good sort. What does it matter?
#MAUD.
My dear Ella! "What does it matter!" We've got to know.
#THE RECTOR.
We do want light.
#THE SQUIRE.
I'll ring the bell.
#LADY ELLA.
What did you ring for, Tommy?
#THE SQUIRE.
God knows!
#MAUD.
Somebody'll come.
#THE SQUIRE.
Rector - you - you've got to -
#MAUD.
Yes, Bertie.
#THE RECTOR.
Dear me! But - er - what - er - How?
#THE SQUIRE.
The whole thing's damn delicate.
#THE RECTOR.
Er - er - your master is not in?
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
No. 'E's gone up to London.
#THE RECTOR.
Er - Mr Challenger, I think?
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Yes.
#THE RECTOR.
Yes! Er - quite so
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
D'you want - Mrs Challenger?
#THE RECTOR.
Ah! Not precisely -
#THE SQUIRE.
Go on.
#THE RECTOR.
I asked because there was a - a - Mr. Challenger I used to know in the 'nineties, and I thought - you wouldn't happen to know how long they've been married? My friend marr -
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Three weeks.
#THE RECTOR.
Quite so - quite so! I shall hope it will turn out to be - Er - thank you - Ha!
#LADY ELLA.
Our dog has been fighting with the Rector's, and Mrs Challenger rescued him; she's bathing his ear. We're waiting to thank her. You needn't -
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
No.
#THE SQUIRE.
Phew! What a gorgon! I say, Rector, did you really know a Challenger in the 'nineties?
#THE RECTOR.
No.
#THE SQUIRE.
Ha! Jolly good!
#LADY ELLA.
Well, you see! - it's all right.
#THE RECTOR.
Yes, indeed. A great relief!
#LADY ELLA.
I must go in now.
#THE SQUIRE.
Hold on! You goin' to ask 'em to - to - anything?
#LADY ELLA.
Yes.
#MAUD.
I shouldn't.
#LADY ELLA.
Why not? We all like the look of her.
#THE RECTOR.
I think we should punish ourselves for entertaining that uncharitable thought.
#LADY ELLA.
Yes. It's horrible not having the courage to take people as they are.
#THE SQUIRE.
As they are? H'm! How can you till you know?
#LADY ELLA.
Trust our instincts, of course.
#THE SQUIRE.
And supposing she'd turned out not married - eh! ELLA! She'd still be herself, wouldn't she?
#MAUD.
Ella!
#THE SQUIRE.
H'm! Don't know about that.
#LADY ELLA.
Of course she would, Tommy.
#THE RECTOR.
Well! It's a great weight off my - !
#LADY ELLA.
There's the poor darling snuffling. I must go in.
#LADY ELLA.
Precious!
#LADY ELLA.
How perfectly sweet of you to make him that!
#SHE.
He's such a dear. And the other poor dog?
#MAUD.
Quite safe, thanks to your strop.
#MAUD.
Oh! There, he's broken it. Bertie!
#SHE.
Let me!
#THE SQUIRE.
We're really most tremendously obliged to you. Afraid we've been an awful nuisance.
#SHE.
Not a bit. I love dogs.
#THE SQUIRE.
Hope to make the acquaintance of Mr - of your husband.
#MAUD.
Is he behaving?
#SHE.
Oh! yes - he's a love.
#MAUD.
Bertie, take Hannibal. takes him.
#LADY ELLA.
I can't be too grateful for all you've done for my poor darling. This is where we live. Do come - and see -
#LADY ELLA.
That is - I'm - I -
#THE SQUIRE.
I don't know if your husband shoots, but if - - er - he - does - er - er -
#MAUD.
Look!
#THE RECTOR.
Hannibal!
#MAUD.
Don't squeeze him, Bertie!
#THE SQUIRE.
That dog'll be forgettin' himself in a minute.
#LADY ELLA.
You mustn't think, I - You mustn't think, we - Oh! I must just see they - don't let Edward get at Hannibal.
#SHE.
What is the matter with them?
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
You left this, m'm, in the bathroom.
#SHE.
Oh! I hadn't missed it. Thank you, Martha. Sue. Ah!
