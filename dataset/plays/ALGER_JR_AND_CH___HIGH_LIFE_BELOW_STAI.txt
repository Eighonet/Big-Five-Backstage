#KATY.
It is my private opinion that this blue dress is the purtiest of the lot, an’ as long as Miss Evelyn won’t wear it, there’s no reason why Katy Maguire shouldn’t. It won’t be long before it’ll be out of fashion; an’ it might as well be doin’ a little good to somebody, first.
#KATY.
There, Katy Maguire , you look like a lady born and bred. If your mistress should see you now, she wouldn’t need to ask if you was an experienced dressing - maid. There aint many that shows such fine taste in dressin’, or has enough jewelry to set off the dress with. What an ilegant trail it has, sure!
#MARY.
Well, Katy, who ever’d ha’ thought of this being you? What are you rigged up in Miss Evelyn’s finery for?
#KATY.
I am Miss Maguire, now, and I expect you’ll treat me like a lady, as I am. I shall give a reception this evenin’ in the drawin’ - room, an’ when you go downstairs, you can invite Miss Flaherty, Miss Maglone, an’ Mister Dunn to be present. An’ if Miss Flaherty thinks best, she might send in to the next house, an’ invite our friends there to come in.
#MARY.
What do you suppose Miss Evelyn will say?
#KATY.
If you feel anxious to know ye might ask her when she gets home. The entertainment’ll be over before that time. But yer better be goin’ down now to deliver the invitation, as it’s gitting late
#MARY.
I’ll be after goin’, thin, Miss Maguire.
#KATY.
It’s aisy to see that Mary is jealous of my good looks. But I pity the poor crathur, for she’s as homely as a sick duck. I must go downstairs now. It’s most time for James to be home from drivin’ Miss Evelyn to the party. He’s a nice lad, an’ I’ll be much surprised if he aint took wid my charms.
#MARY.
Well, I never seen sich doin’s before!
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
An’ what is it, Mary?
#PATRICK.
What’s the row upstairs? Anybody kilt?
#MARY.
Katy’s been up to Miss Evelyn’s chamber an’ rigged up in her clothes, an’ she says she’s goin’ to give a grand party in the drawin’ - room this avenin’, an’ invites all to be prisint.
#JAMES.
Ah! Katy’s a jew’l.
#ANN.
Av course we’ll all accept the invitation.
#MARY.
She says if ye thought best, he might sind in to the next house an’ invite the frinds there.
#BOYLER.
Sure an’ we do think best. Pat., jist run over to Mr. Bradley’s an’ ask the cook an’ all the rest to come over here an’ pass the avenin’. We’re going to have a grand party here. Tell ’em to come right away.
#POWERS.
I’ll bring ’em all in, in five minutes.
#MARY.
An’ what d’ye think Miss Evelyn will say?
#BOYLER.
Arrah now, Miss Evelyn will niver know anything about it. We’ll be all through with the party before she comes home.
#MRS. FADD.
Indade an’ ye may trust Katy to get through’t safely. She’s lived with the quality before now, an’ knows how things is done. She’s shrewd, Katy is.
#JACK.
That’s thrue for you. An’ how can Miss Evelyn come home till I go after her? She tould me to have the carriage there at half - past twelve o’clock, an’ it isn’t ulleven yit.
#MRS. FADD.
I’m thinkin’ we ought to have a trate before the party is over.
#BOYLER.
Av coorse we must have some refrishments.
#JACK.
I ixpect you ladies can manage that.
#MRS. FADD.
We’ve got plinty o’ presarves and cake an’ wine. But we’ll want some ice - crame.
#JACK.
I’ll furnish that same. I’ll sind Pat. for it whin he comes back.
#BOYLER.
Thin we’ll go upstairs now.
#MRS. FADD.
The rest of yez go, an’ I’ll lay the table all ready for the trate. It won’t be long before I’ll be wid yez.
#JACK.
This must be a very select party, when Miss Maguire didn’t invite more persons to be prisint.
#BOYLER.
Sure we don’t know how many invitations she has sint out. Fashionable people don’t come very airly. We’ll have more byme - by. They’re beginnin’ to arrive now.
#KATY.
Misther Dunn ye’ll oblige me by goin’ to the door, if ye plaze.
#JACK.
Miss Maguire, this is Miss Sweeny, Miss Griffin, and Misther Reilly.
#CORNY.
My respects to yez, Miss Maguire.
#JACK.
Miss Maguire, won’t ye favor us with a little illegant music?
#MARY.
It’s little enough of that kind ye’ll get.
#KATY.
If ye’ll esquort me to the pianner, I’ll play pervidin’ yez will all sing.
#MRS. FADD.
Av coorse we will.
#MARY.
I aint a - goin’ to sing anyway.
#KATY.
Yer vice won’t be missed, Miss Finnegan.
#JACK.
Allow me to lade yez to the pianner.
#KATY.
What can ye sing, ladies?
#JACK.
You choose the song for us.
#KATY.
Well, thin, it’s a midley I’ll play, an’ then ye can sing what ye plaze.
#POWERS.
Say, Katy, I’ve been down - town, an’ got some ice - crame. It’s downstairs now. We’re going to have a big trate byme - by.
#KATY.
Is that so, Pat.?
#POWERS.
Yis, an’ the things on the table looked so timptin’ that I stopped an’ refreshed mesilf wid a little cake an’ wine.
#JACK.
Look here, Pat.; what did ye meddle with that wine for? Ye spalpeen, I b’lave ye’re dhrunk.
#POWERS.
Sure, that’s where ye’re wrong, Misther Dunn. I jist took a wee dthrop to keep my sperits up.
#JACK.
It’s more like ye’ve put all the sperits down yer throat, yer thafe of the world!
#POWERS.
Owin’ to my partic’lar good nature, I shan’t notice that little insinivation o’ yours. But say, now, let’s have a dance. If you aint goin’ ter play, Katy, jest be my partner, will yer?
#JACK.
Miss Maguire’s engaged ter me.
#KATY.
Yis, I’m engaged to Misther Dunn.
#POWERS.
Whew! That’s the way the wind blows, thin. Well dunn, Jimmy!
#JACK.
Jist be a little more respectful to your betters, ye blackguard! Will you allow me, Miss Maguire?
#POWERS.
Say now, who’s goin’ to fiddle for us? Or is we goin’ ter dance widout any music?
#CINDERELLA.
Miss Sweeny plays on the pianner at our house.
#KATY.
Then perhaps Miss Sweeny will do us the favor ter play for us.
#POWERS.
Allow me, Miss Sweeny. , and all have taken their places. At the sound of the piano, they break into an Irish jig of the wildest sort.
#PATRICK.
cuts up the maddest capers. A bell rings outside, but in the uproar it is unheard by the dancers. A moment later, MISS EVELYN appears at the door, L. She stands for a moment, dumfounded at the scene before her. At first she is not seen by any of the company, but ELLEN, happening to look up, beholds her and clasps her hands in alarm. The dancers, not hearing the sound of the piano, look toward it to discover the cause. They observe the dismay pictured in ELLEN’S face, and, following the direction of her eyes, they behold MISS EVELYN. They stand with startled faces.)
#MISS EVELYN.
What does all this mean?
#MARY.
It’s all Katy’s doin’s, miss.
#KATY.
We were only indulgin’ in a little innocent amusement, ma’am. I hope you’re not offended.
#MISS EVELYN.
But who gave you leave to deck yourself in this manner?
#KATY.
Sure I was only airin’ the dress, ma’am, as it had hung so long in the closet.
#MISS EVELYN.
Well, I don’t approve of any such airs. Leave the room, every one of you! The idea of my drawing - room being the scene of a servants’ party! You will all receive your discharge to - morrow morning.
#POWERS.
An’ aint we goin’ to have our trate then?
#MRS. FADD.
Whist! Yis. Say nothin’. We’re goin’ to have it right away. Miss Evelyn never comes down below at this time o’ night.
#MISS EVELYN.
Was there ever any annoyance equal to that of keeping servants? Mine are a constant source of trouble. I have threatened to discharge them all to - morrow morning. But what shall I gain by it? I shall have another set who will perhaps try my patience even more than these have done. Servants understand their importance, and realize their power over their employers. It is becoming a species of tyranny. If I could only do without them I most assuredly would do so. What! haven’t they done yet? Probably they are gormandizing, downstairs, at my expense. I have heard some persons wish for wealth, so that they could afford to keep servants to wait on them. They do not realize the emptiness of their desires. person who has few wants, and can minister to them himself, is more independent than the wealthiest person living. Those who keep a multitude of servants are dependent on their whims, and should not be surprised at frequent outbursts of High Life Below Stairs.
