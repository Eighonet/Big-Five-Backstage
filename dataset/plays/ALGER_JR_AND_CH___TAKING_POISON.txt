#MR. FISHER.
How weak I am! I wonder what can be the matter? I think I’m a little feverish. And then this cough; I’m sure my lungs must be affected. But then that’s no wonder, for most of our family died of consumption, and I dare say I shall go in the same way. I wonder where Susan is; she’s always gone when I want her. Mary, where is Mrs. Fisher?
#MARY.
She went an hour ago, sir. Your sister, Miss Helen, came for her to go shopping, and the two of them went out then.
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
Did she say what time she would be back?
#MARY.
She did not, then. May be they won’t be home till dark.
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
I shall be sick in bed before that time.
#MARY.
Couldn’t I do something for you, sir?
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
No. Do you know where Mrs. Fisher keeps the cough drops?
#MARY.
I do not, sir.
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
Well, then, it’s no matter. I’ll wait till she comes.
#MARY.
Very well, sir.
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
It must be that Susan keeps the cough mixture in the closet. I’ll see. Yes, here it is. I will take a teaspoonful. I hope that will make me feel better. I don’t see what keeps Susan away so long. It always was a mystery to me how women could enjoy shopping as they do. I believe I’ll go into the dining - room and get some water.
#MARY.
So master’s gone out. It’ll do him good, I’m thinking. Sure I don’t see how missis gets along wid him, when he’s so fussy.
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
reappears, R., bearing a glass of water, which he places on the table. He continues to cough.)
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
The water does not remove the irritation in my throat. I must take some more of the drops. What’s this? Poison? And I’ve already taken a spoonful of it! That was what made me feel so strangely. Oh, I’m a doomed man!
#MARY.
Oh, lor sakes, what makes you look so pale, sir?
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
I’ve taken poison, Mary. I feel a pain in my side, already. Why doesn’t Mrs. Fisher come home? Oh, dear, what shall I do?
#MARY.
Can’t I get you something to take, sir?
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
Oh, no, no. I’ve taken too much already. Nothing would help me now. I feel the poison coursing through my veins already, and cold chills are passing over me. Bring a blanket to cover me, Mary. I hope I shan’t die before Susan comes.
#MARY.
Don’t you feel a little better now, sir?
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
Better! People don’t usually feel better when they are dying.
#MARY.
Mrs. Fisher is come.
#MRS. FISHER.
Why, Lewis, what’s the matter? Are you sick?
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
Yes, Susan; not merely sick, but dying.
#MRS. FACILE.
What can you mean, Lewis? You left home this morning apparently well, and, after an hour’s absence, I return to find you nervous and excited. You look sick, too. Do tell me what is the cause.
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
That I can very easily do. I was sick—quite feverish—and had a bad cough, so I thought I’d take some drops to relieve it.
#MRS. FACILE.
That was right.
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
I went to the closet, and took a spoonful, and thought they helped me. So, in half an hour, I went and got some more to take, when I noticed the label on the bottle, and found that, instead of cough - drops, I had been taking poison.
#MRS. FACILE.
O Lewis, how could you make such a mistake? What shall we do?
#HELEN.
Send for the doctor, I should say, if you haven’t both taken leave of your senses.
#MRS. FACILE.
Yes, send Mary for the doctor at once. Why didn’t we think of it sooner?
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
It will do no good. Nothing can be done now. I feel cold chills passing over me. I shall not probably be alive when he reaches here. It will only take up the little time there is left.
#HARRY.
I shall send Mary for the doctor, at all events.
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
Susan.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Well, Lewis.
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
You’ve been a good wife to me, Susan.
#MRS. FACILE.
I’ve tried to be, Lewis.
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
I’m glad you will be left in comfortable circumstances at my death. I’ve left my whole property to you. In my little black trunk you will find all my valuable papers. Here is the key.
#MRS. FACILE.
Don’t think of such things, Lewis. You must live—for me. I’m sure that the doctor can help you.
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
No, it’s too late—too late. I would like to have lived longer, but I must submit to my fate.
#DR. GIBBS.
Well, my friend, what’s the matter with you?
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
Poison!
#DR. GIBBS.
What! Got tired of living, hey?
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
Tell him about it, Susan.
#MRS. FACILE.
It was a terrible mistake, doctor. He intended to take some cough drops, but, instead, took some laudanum.
#DR. GIBBS.
How do you feel?
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
I feel cold chills passing over me, and it seems us if a thousand needles were pricking my flesh; and I have got a terrible headache.
#DR. GIBBS.
But those are not the symptoms of poison. How long is it since you took it?
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
More than an hour and a half ago.
#DR. GIBBS.
I don’t believe it was poison at all. I see no signs of it.
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
But I saw the label.
#DR. GIBBS.
Let me see the bottle.
#DR. GIBBS.
smells of the mixture, and then prepares to taste it.)
#MRS. FACILE.
Oh, don’t taste it, doctor. It may be the death of you too.
#DR. GIBBS.
This is not poison. It is cough - drops, as I expected. Moreover, it is some that I mixed myself, and I know there’s no poison in it. But how came that label on it?
#MRS. FACILE.
I prepared the label just before I went away, and told Mary to paste it on the bottle of laudanum. But it seems she must have pasted it on the wrong bottle.
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
And haven’t I swallowed poison, after all?
#DR. GIBBS.
Not unless you’ve taken it from some other bottle.
#MRS. FACILE.
How thankful I am that it was a mistake; aren’t you, Lewis?
#MR. FEZZIWIG.
Indeed I am. By the way, Susan, you might as well hand me back the key of the little black trunk.
