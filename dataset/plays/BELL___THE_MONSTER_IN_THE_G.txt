#JANET.
Come, I want to go into the garden.
#MABEL.
We must have Tiny with us.
#JANET.
Of course, where is he, I wonder? Tiny! Tiny!
#MARY.
Tiny! Tiny! Stupid little dog! He is always away when one wants him.
#JANET.
Perhaps he is in the garden already.
#MARY.
Perhaps he is. We'll go and see.
#JANET.
Ah! here is Jack, perhaps he has seen Tiny.
#MARY.
Have you seen Tiny?
#JACK.
Tiny? No, I haven't, indeed. Oh dear me! I am so frightened.
#JANET.
What's the matter?
#JACK.
I've seen the most terrible monster in the garden.
#MARY.
and Jan. A monster! monster, in the garden.
#JANET.
Oh, Mabel, hold my hand! Did you see him?
#JACK.
Well, I did not see him exactly, because he was inside that clump of laurels, but I certainly heard him growl.
#MARY.
Growl? Oh dear!
#JACK.
Then I believe I saw two great eyes looking at me.
#MARY.
Two great eyes?
#JACK.
Then I am certain I saw the point of a hairy ear, the sort of point that a great monster's ear would be sure to have.
#MARY.
Then, of course, now we won't go into the garden.
#JANET.
I've just thought of the most terrible thing!
#JACK.
What is it?
#MARY.
What is it?
#JANET.
That Tiny is in the garden!
#MARY.
And he will be eaten alive!
#JANET.
What shall we do? We can't leave him to die.
#JACK.
No, we can't. I will go and save him.
#MARY.
Oh, you brave boy! We'll come too.
#JACK.
Come, then! I've got my knife.
#JANET.
And I'll take my new scissors.
#MARY.
And what shall I have? Oh, I'll take two large hairpins to stab him with.
#JACK.
That's right. We'll stab him through the heart.
#AUNT MARY.
Why, my dear children! How warlike you look!
#JACK.
And well we may! We're going into the garden to kill the most terrible monster.
#AUNT MARY.
Oh, I see, you are pretending to be warriors.
#JANET.
No, indeed! We are not. It is a real monster in the garden. Jack has seen him - part of him, at least.
#AUNT MARY.
And what was he like?
#JACK.
He's an enormous animal, with great flaring eyes, and long hairy ears.
#JANET.
And probably horns and tusks, but we're not quite sure, because he was behind the bushes.
#MARY.
And we are so dreadfully afraid he will kill Tiny.
#AUNT MARY.
Oh no! He won't find Tiny - Tiny is hidden behind the laurels near the conservatory, eating a mouse which he has just caught.
#JACK.
Behind the laurels near the conservatory! Then he will certainly be killed! The monster is there too! That is where the growls came from!
#AUNT MARY.
Ha! ha! Now I see it all! Why, the monster that Jack saw and heard, is simply Tiny, who was growling because he feared his mouse would be taken away from him.
#JACK.
Are you sure?
#JANET.
Was the monster Tiny?
#AUNT MARY.
Evidently. I've just seen him there myself.
#MARY.
Oh, how delightful! let us go and tell Tiny there is no monster in the garden!
