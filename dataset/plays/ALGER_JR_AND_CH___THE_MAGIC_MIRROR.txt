#HARRY.
Hallo, Dick, what’s up?
#DICK.
Who says anything’s up?
#HARRY.
There is, I know there is; I can tell it by your looks. Come, tell us, like a good fellow.
#DOROTHEA.
You must have a very vivid imagination to suppose one of my dignity would descend to such trifles.
#TOM.
One of your dignity! That’s a good one. But come now, Dick, do tell us if anything is going on. It’s been the perfection of dulness here for the last three weeks. Any change would be welcome.
#DOROTHEA.
Does your last remark refer to your pockets, or some other part of your habiliments?
#TOM.
Apply it where you choose. But come, you’ve got some plan, I know. What is it?
#DOROTHEA.
You are right, boys, I have got a plan. But remember , it must be a profound secret with us.
#WALTER.
We are willing to make the most solemn protestations of secrecy. Who’s to be the victim?
#DOROTHEA.
Joe Sherman.
#HARRY.
Good! What’s the programme?
#DOROTHEA.
He is to have his fortune told.
#TOM.
How is it to be done?
#DOROTHEA.
Perhaps you have learned that Madame Devineresse, the fortune - teller, is stopping at the Everett House. It wouldn’t be very difficult for her to flatter Joe into the belief that he was born for some great and glorious end.
#WELBY.
He’s satisfied on that point, already.
#DOROTHEA.
But you don’t understand. We will give her some hints of what he will expect, and then can have the fun of listening to the whole performance, and be better prepared to enjoy his remarks about it afterward. I have had a little conversation with Madame Devineresse, and I feel sure she will consent to co - operate with us.
#TOM.
I’ll wager an inkstand that Dick’s already had his fortune told by madame.
#HARRY.
That’s nothing strange. He has had it told by every fortune - teller that’s visited the town for the last two years.
#DOROTHEA.
What difference does that make, when every one tells a different story? A fellow must have some excitement in a little country village like this. Of course I don’t believe a word said by any one of them. But Sherman would. He’s just one of that kind. If she told him anything he wished to believe, he would put implicit faith in it.
#WELBY.
I don’t know about that. Joe is pretty cunning. I wouldn’t be a bit surprised if he should discover the plot.
#DOROTHEA.
Trust me for that. I’ve got things arranged so it is impossible he could suspect anything.
#TOM.
When is it to come off?
#DOROTHEA.
This evening, at the rooms of Madame Devineresse. We are to be concealed in the ante - room, and hear all that is said. It will be rich, I assure you. Come to my room at seven o’clock, and we will be ready to follow him. He will be there by half - past seven.
#HARRY.
How do you know he is going at all?
#DOROTHEA.
I don’t expect he is thinking of it at present; but I must plan some way to induce him to go, and to be there at that hour. So I must leave you now. Don’t fail to be on hand at the appointed time.
#OLD JOE.
You are the fortune - teller, I presume, madame.
#MME. DEVINERESSE.
Yes; I am called so by those whom I serve. I unveil the secrets of the future to those who desire to know them. Do you wish to look into the magic mirror?
#JACK.
I should like to know something of the future.
#MME. DEVINERESSE.
You shall do so. Bring me the magic mirror, Faustina. Young man, approach. You wish to learn something of the future. You are permitted to look three times into this mirror, where you will see three scenes in your future life. Take it into your own hands. What do you see?
#JACK.
I see a school - room. There are many people present. It must be examination day.
#MME. DEVINERESSE.
Do you see yourself there?
#JACK.
Yes; the other scholars are all crowding about me, and seem to be congratulating me for some reason. The teacher has come forward, and presents me with a richly bound book.
#MME. DEVINERESSE.
That picture represents a scene in your life three years hence, when you will leave this school. You will graduate as first scholar in your class. You see yourself as having just delivered the valedictory. The other pupils are congratulating you, but many of them are envious at the distinction accorded you, and which you have so richly merited.
#MME. DEVINERESSE.
What see you now, young man? crowded court - room. A case has just been tried. I am the centre of a crowd of people, who are pressing up to shake hands with me. The opposing lawyer sits at a little distance, casting glances of bitterness toward me.
#MME. DEVINERESSE.
That picture represents a scene fifteen years hence. You have gained a famous law - suit, which has placed you, though young, in the front ranks of your profession. Envious persons have maligned you, and opponents assailed you; but, without deigning to notice them, you have steadily gone on, till you have attained a high position in the profession which you adorn.
#MME. DEVINERESSE.
The picture pleases you, then. What does the mirror disclose?
#JACK.
I see a beautiful house. On the balcony a gentleman is standing. He is addressing a throng of people who are assembled before the house. They wave their hats, and are full of enthusiasm. What does it mean?
#MME. DEVINERESSE.
Do you not recognize the gentleman?
#JACK.
It looks like myself, but cannot be, for it is too old.
#MME. DEVINERESSE.
It does look somewhat older, and more mature. But why should it not? It represents you as you will appear thirty years hence. You have steadily pressed onward, distancing all with whom you started at school. You have just been elected as member of Congress, and the people, wild with enthusiasm, are shouting your name, and calling for a speech. Are you satisfied with the glimpses of the future which I have given you?
#JACK.
Yes, my good woman, you have done very well.
#MME. DEVINERESSE.
There are few persons to whom such a brilliant future opens. Whenever the glass has mirrored such scenes as I have shown you, it loses power ever after to delineate scenes in common lives. I therefore present it to you, that, when depressed by the trials of life, you may gain courage by gazing at its magic surface. I will place it in a box, in which it must always be kept. Otherwise, it will lose all its power.
#JACK.
And this is to be the end of my career! No, not the end, for I may yet become President. I wonder what Harry, Dick, and Walter would say, if they knew what I do. They have always thought I put on airs; but they will, some time, realize that it was only my natural dignity, which could not fail to assert its superiority to the common herd around me.
#MME. DEVINERESSE.
Here is the precious mirror. Handle it carefully. When not in use, on no account leave it out of the box. It is capable of producing other scenes in your life than those which I have shown you. Whenever you wish to test it, you have but to wipe its surface carefully, wave your hand over it three times, and it will produce your image and surroundings more faithfully than they have yet been shown you.
#JACK.
Thank you, madame, for your great, your inestimable gift. I will guard it sacredly, and, when I become famous and powerful, I will reward you as you deserve.
#JACK.
I thought I should find a dictionary here. Dick told me this morning I was the most “stultiloquent orator” he ever listened to. I never heard the word before, but it has quite a grand sound, and I mean to use it the first chance I get, but I want to know its meaning. Hallo, what’s this? A letter to Tim Bellamy. How I’d like to read it! But then it wouldn’t be just the thing. What’s this? “Now I tell you how we duped Joe Sherman.” Why, that’s me. I must find out about that. “You know Joe is one of the most conceited boys in school. Well, some of us fellows thought we’d have a little fun at his expense through this failing. I heard, one evening, that a fortune - teller had arrived at the hotel. You know I always had a weakness for having my fortune told. So I went to see her, and finding her very pleasant and obliging, I arranged with her to tell Joe’s fortune in a way that would tickle his vanity. As I agreed to pay her for it, she was nothing loth to do her part, and she did it well. Several of us fellows were in the next room, and heard all that was said. She flattered him with glimpses of the future which raised his opinion of himself so much that, since then, he carries his head like a peer of the realm. By the way, these glimpses of the future were had by looking into a seven - by - nine mirror, which reflected pictures hung up behind Joe, and which we changed each time he looked into it. We enjoyed, hugely, listening to the interview, as I think we ought, for it took three of us several hours to draw the three pictures. It was also quite a tax on the imagination, which had to be stretched to the utmost to make Joe satisfied with his fortune. But we were successful. I can’t help laughing when I think how carefully he carried that little mirror home, promising to guard it sacredly. The fortune - teller told him that when next he looked in it it would reflect his image even more faithfully than it had yet done. I wonder what he thought when he did look in it and saw nothing but his own homely countenance just as it was?”
#JACK.
Well, that’s the meanest thing I ever knew Dick to do. I wonder who were with him; Harry and Tom most likely. But Dick was the ringleader. He always is. The idea of my being made such a laughing stock! It was the climax of meanness. But I’ll turn the table on them. I guess Nat and I are capable of planning something which will pay up old scores. We’ll have a consultation to - night, for I want it done before Dick sends his letter, so he can not only tell the story of his exploit, but also give the sequel. Ah, somebody’s coming; I mustn’t be seen here.
#DOROTHEA.
I don’t see who could have sent me this notice. The handwriting is evidently that of a lady. Possibly it is that of Mme. Marie herself. But the puzzle is, how she happened to send it to me. I suppose, though, some one informed her that I liked to have my fortune told occasionally. “Madame Marie, the veiled prophetess of the East, respectfully gives notice that she has taken up her residence at Number 27 Osborne Street, where she will remain for seven days only, during which time she is willing to unfold the future of those who may wish to become acquainted with its secrets. Madame Marie will disclose the mysteries of the past, as well as the hidden events of the future. As her stay is of limited duration, those wishing to consult her will do well to call at once.” I received this note only an hour ago, and hastened to call upon her. But although I have been here full fifteen minutes, I have as yet seen no one. Where is Madame Marie?
#MME. MARIE.
She is here. What would you have? Shall I tell you the past, or only the future?
#DOROTHEA.
I would hear something of the past as well as of the future, if you please, madam.
#MME. MARIE.
That is well. I will consult the oracles, and give you their testimony. Ah, yes, the events of our past life come crowding up before me. I see that you are credulous, impulsive, and somewhat superstitious.
#DOROTHEA.
Credulous and superstitious! Oh, no.
#MME. MARIE.
Silence. It is not meet that you interrupt the disclosures of the oracles. Superstition signifies a fondness for the unknown and mysterious; therefore you are superstitious. You are also credulous; for did you not believe the revelations of Madame Devineresse, who came here a short time ago, and who is an arrant impostor? You were the means of bringing to her a young man who wished to look into the magic mirror.
#DOROTHEA.
Yes, and he went away with higher aspirations, and a feeling of inward pleasure which cannot be described. I think praise rather than blame is due me for this deed.
#MME. MARIE.
I need not tell you of the deception which you practised on him. Even now circumstances are at work which will bring to you direful consequences on account of that deed.
#DOROTHEA.
What do you mean? Has he discovered the trick?
#MME. MARIE.
I see the young man standing before a tall, stern - looking person. The young man is talking earnestly, but I cannot hear his words. The tall man listens attentively, and soon the young man goes out. The tall man seems angry. Hark! he speaks: “So this is the way the boys spend the hours they should be employed in study. No wonder recitations are poor. But it is fortunate that I have discovered the cause in such good time. I will make an example of this case, and will inflict on the chief offender such a severe punishment that it will strike terror into the hearts of the remainder of the school. What shall it be? Ha! I have it. John, bring me a strong rope, and a couple of good willow switches. Then call together the scholars.”
#DOROTHEA.
Is there no way of avoiding this punishment?
#MME. MARIE.
I see the scholars crowding into the room, but there is one of them who cannot be found. No one knows where he is gone. Now a note is handed to the tall man. He nods approvingly, and tells all the scholars to follow him. Ha, they come this way! They are at the door! They enter!
#NAT.
Hooray for the great fortune - teller, Madame Marie!
#JACK.
Is your fortune satisfactory, Dick?
#DOROTHEA.
I don’t know. Let me see. Yes, very much so. It’s turned out far different from what I expected, a moment ago. I anticipated a more tragic and striking close. We’re quits now, Joe. I give you credit for turning the tables on me completely. But henceforth I shall keep clear of fortune - tellers. They are great humbugs, as I have had ample opportunity to know. Besides, it would be far more sensible for us boys to plan our future ourselves, and then try to live up to it, than to listen to the idle talk of those who care for nothing but the money of their victims. Now, Joe, I challenge you to enter the list with me, to gain the prize offered for the greatest number of perfect recitations during this term. What do you say?
#JACK.
I’ll do it, Dick. I’ll try for the prize, anyway.
#DOROTHEA.
That’s it, old fellow. And whichever is successful, the progress we have made will stimulate us to strive for still higher honors. And who knows but we may yet gain as great distinction as was pictured to you by Madame Devineresse, in the Magic Mirror?
