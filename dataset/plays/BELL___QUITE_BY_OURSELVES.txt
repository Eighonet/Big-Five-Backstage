#MRS. VERNON.
What a long time it is since the children have been into the room! It must be nearly five minutes! They don't seem to be having as many "good ideas" to - day as they generally do. So I may as well do my accounts. Ah! there they come.
#JANET.
Mammy! Mammy!
#RALPH CHENEY.
We have such a good idea.
#MOTHER.
What is it?
#JACK.
We're going to surprise you very much.
#MARY.
Are you? How delightful!
#RALPH.
We're going to invite you to a tea party of our very own!
#JACK.
We are going to get it ready and arrange it quite by ourselves!
#RALPH.
Isn't that a lovely idea?
#MARY.
It is, indeed.
#JACK.
And the surprise is going to be that you are going to receive an invitation from us, just like the real invitations you get from your friends.
#MARY.
I see!
#RALPH.
But the thing that will surprise you most will be that we are going to do it ourselves, won't it?
#MARY.
Yes, I must say that will be the most surprising thing of all.
#RALPH.
Then, first, here's the invitation.
#MARY.
Oh, this is most exciting. "Ralph and Janet request the pleasure of your company at their very own tea - party on Wednesday afternoon."
#RALPH.
Isn't that a surprise for you, Mammy?
#MARY.
It is, indeed, most astonishing. Now I must answer this, I suppose?
#JACK.
Of course you must, just as if you were writing to strangers, you must end it "your loving Mrs. Vernon," or something stiff of that sort.
#RALPH.
Of course you mustn't put "your affectionate Mother," as you do when you really write to us, you know.
#MARY.
Not for worlds! Now, then, I had better write the letter, and then do my accounts, while you get the tea ready.
#RALPH.
Oh, yes, that will be delightful.
#RALPH.
We had better ask Mammy, I think.
#JACK.
Much better.
#RALPH.
Mammy, there is just one thing we want to ask you.
#MARY.
Yes? What is it?
#JACK.
Where do you think we had better have tea?
#MARY.
Wherever you like. What do you say to the dining - room?
#RALPH.
The dining - room is so common.
#MARY.
You may have it in here if you like.
#JACK.
Oh, that would be the very thing!
#RALPH.
What table shall we have it on?
#MARY.
Let me see - would that one do?
#RALPH.
Oh, beautifully. Thank you so much, Mammy.
#JACK.
Now, what next?
#RALPH.
The cloth, of course.
#JACK.
I wonder where we can get one.
#RALPH.
Mammy!
#MARY.
Well?
#RALPH.
What about a table - cloth?
#MARY.
Hadn't you better ask Susan for one of the dining - room ones?
#RALPH.
Susan is always cross when we ask her for that kind of thing, she seems to think we make jam and cocoa stains on the table - cloths.
#MARY.
Dear me, I wonder what can make her think that?
#RALPH.
I think it must be because Janet always spills the jam at breakfast.
#JACK.
You needn't talk, for once you dropped a whole cutlet on to your knicker - bockers.
#RALPH.
But as we are not going to have cutlets, you needn't talk about it now.
#MARY.
I don't think people ought to quarrel when they're giving a tea - party.
#RALPH.
No, we'll quarrel after tea, we're too busy now.
#JACK.
Much!
#RALPH.
Well, what about the table - cloth, then?
#MARY.
If you don't want to ask Susan I might lend you that embroidered five o'clock tea - cloth which I bought at the bazaar the other day.
#RALPH.
Oh, that would be the very thing! May we have it?
#MARY.
Yes, if you like, it is in that drawer.
#RALPH.
Which drawer?
#MARY.
The bottom one.
#RALPH.
Mammy, we can't find it.
#MARY.
Are you quite sure you are looking in the right drawer?
#RALPH.
Quite. You said the top drawer, didn't you?
#MARY.
No. I said the bottom drawer.
#RALPH.
Oh, I thought you said the top drawer. I wonder where it can be! Mammy, I am so very sorry - we can't find it.
#MARY.
How very odd. I saw it there yesterday. Why, there it is just at the top, you little noodles!
#RALPH.
Oh, so it is, I hadn't seen it.
#JACK.
Nor had I.
#RALPH.
Thank you so much, Mammy. Now, we must have our own cups and saucers out of the toy cupboard.
#MARY.
My dear children, is that how you are laying the table?
#RALPH.
Oh, Mammy, I am so sorry! I forgot we were getting out our cups and saucers. Here they are, three cups and three saucers.
#JACK.
Now I'm Susan!
#RALPH.
You stupid girl, that is not how they ought to be arranged. Susan always put them quite apart from each other, and the tea - pot at one end of the table like this.
#JACK.
Do let me have the tea - pot in front of me.
#RALPH.
Certainly not, it must be in front of me.
#JACK.
Mammy, don't you think I ought to have the tea - pot in front of me? because I am a girl.
#RALPH.
No, I'll have it in front of me, because I am a boy.
#MARY.
Suppose you put it in the middle of the table where you can both reach it. I shall sit at the side like a guest, and you can take turns.
#RALPH.
That will be delightful. We will put the tea - pot here, then.
#JACK.
Where is the tea - pot?
#RALPH.
That's true, yes, we haven't got one of our own. Mammy, what tea - pot are we to have?
#MARY.
Won't you have the one we always have at tea?
#RALPH.
No, it's too common. It won't seem like our own tea - party, then.
#JACK.
I suppose we mightn't have one of the beautiful little tea - pots out of the china cupboard, just for once?
#MARY.
Just for once, you may, if you take care of it.
#RALPH.
I am afraid I am not tall enough to reach the cupboard.
#JACK.
You don't think, I suppose, you could come into the next room and get it for us?
#MARY.
I daresay I might.
#JACK.
You see it is not our fault if we are not as tall as you, is it?
#MARY.
Not quite, I daresay.
#RALPH.
Isn't Mammy tall when she stands on a foot - stool!
#JACK.
I mean to be just the same size as Mammy is when I grow up.
#RALPH.
That's just like a girl, to say that sort of stupid thing. You don't know in the least how tall you will be when you grow up.
#JACK.
Well, if girls are stupid, they are not so rude as boys.
#RALPH.
Girls are rude sometimes. It was very rude of you to talk about my dropping the cutlet into my lap.
#MARY.
You don't mean to say you are still discussing that cutlet! Now, which of the tea - pots is it to be?
#RALPH.
Oh, Mammy, I have such a good idea! Let's have them both, one at each end, and then we can both pour out tea.
#MARY.
Very well.
#RALPH.
Oh, this is capital. Now, we must get the things to eat. We shall want milk and sugar.
#JACK.
And bread and butter and biscuits.
#RALPH.
And jam and cakes, perhaps - because, as it is our own tea - party, it ought to be a grand one.
#JACK.
Of course.
#RALPH.
I've got some sugar that I put in my pocket this morning for the raven.
#JACK.
Four lumps, will that be enough?
#RALPH.
I wonder how many Mammy will want. Mammy, do you like your tea very, very sweet?
#MARY.
No, I don't like sugar in it at all.
#RALPH.
Oh, that's capital. Now, Janet, we can have two lumps each, one in each cup of tea. You can't have more. It's horrid to be greedy, you know.
#JACK.
Well, I suppose that will have to do.
#RALPH.
Now, there's the milk, we'll ask the cook for that.
#JACK.
And we shall want some spoons and knives.
#RALPH.
Susan will get out those.
#JACK.
I should like to have some toast, too.
#RALPH.
We'll ask nurse to make that, they make such nice toast in the nursery.
#JACK.
And then the biscuits.
#RALPH.
And the jam. We must ask Mammy what we may have. Mammy!
#MARY.
What is it now?
#RALPH.
We may have some biscuits and some cakes, as well as bread and butter, mayn't we?
#MARY.
Oh yes, you may look in the dining - room cupboard for what you want, if you don't take too much.
#RALPH.
Oh, how delightful! Come, Janet.
#MARY.
Perhaps in the meantime I shall be able to add up my accounts!
#RALPH.
Oh, Mammy, there are such a lot of things in the dining - room cupboard, we don't know which to choose.
#JACK.
I wish you would come and help us.
#RALPH.
I suppose you're too busy, aren't you?
#MARY.
Oh, I daresay I can manage it.
#RALPH.
You know really, Mammy, the best thing would be that you should look into the dining - room cupboard, while Janet and I finish the table; we are so very busy, you see.
#MARY.
I will go and look in the cupboard and see what I can find.
#RALPH.
Now, this is getting on splendidly, isn't it Janet? Let me see, have we remembered everything?
#JACK.
I think so. The cook is making the tea and getting the milk.
#RALPH.
Susan is cutting the bread and butter.
#JACK.
Nurse is making the toast.
#RALPH.
Mammy is choosing the cakes and the jam. I must say I do feel proud of doing it all by ourselves, without giving anybody extra trouble.
#JACK.
Yes, it makes me feel as if we were such good children.
#RALPH.
So it does me.
#JACK.
I should like to feel like this every day.
#RALPH.
Oh, I think one would soon get tired of it, you know. Oh, here comes Mammy! Well, Mammy, well?
#MARY.
Well, you had better go into the dining - room and see if you approve of my choice.
#RALPH.
Oh, thank you. Now we must have some plates to put the cakes upon.
#JACK.
Mammy, may we just for once have those beautiful little plates out of the china cupboard?
#MARY.
Just for once then, if you take good care of them.
#RALPH.
Then, Mammy, I think you had better get them out for fear we should break them.
#MARY.
Very well, let's go and get them.
#JACK.
Oh, are you not pleased with us for arranging our tea - party all by ourselves!
