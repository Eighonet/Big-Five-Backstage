#MISS CALCIUM.
Well, this place is well named. It’s the Quiet Hotel, all right. It ought to be a fine rest cure for my tired nerves. Hello! My, just hear that echo! Hello! Hello! No answer. I never before saw a house so completely full of emptiness. Landlord! Clerk! Bell - boy! Telephone operator! Waiter! Chambermaid!
#SUSAN.
Oh, good - morning! Er - were you looking for any one?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Looking for - Say, is this really a hotel?
#SUSAN.
Certainly. A little less noise, please. We’re not used to it.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Oh, indeed. And who are you, please?
#SUSAN.
Who, me? Oh, I’m it.
#MISS CALCIUM.
It?
#SUSAN.
Sure. The main squeeze, the high guy, the whole works; in fact, I’m the hotel.
#MISS CALCIUM.
I don’t understand. You -
#SUSAN.
Why, I’m understudy for the landlord, that’s all, and incidentally I’m clerk, bookkeeper, chambermaid, manicure, stenographer, head cook and bottle washer. In fact, I’m the whole force, except the porter.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Oh, except the porter. I see. So you are in full charge of the hotel?
#SUSAN.
Am I! If I quit the place it will have to close up and move to
#MISS CALCIUM.
You must be a very important person in this hotel.
#SUSAN.
I am. I own it.
#MISS CALCIUM.
You own it?
#SUSAN.
Yes. You see they owed me so much in wages it was cheaper to just give me the hotel than to pay up in cash.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Well, you’re lucky. It looks like a fine place.
#SUSAN.
Best in the country. You get three meals a day here, and at each meal four kinds of meat - ram, lamb, sheep and mutton.
#MISS CALCIUM.
But I don’t like mutton.
#SUSAN.
Now don’t tell me what you like or what you don’t like. You like meals, don’t you?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Certainly, but -
#SUSAN.
Well, that’s what you get here - meals, just plain meals.
#MISS CALCIUM.
I don’t think I’ll like it here. When is the next train?
#SUSAN.
The next train just left.
#MISS CALCIUM.
What were you doing when I came in?
#SUSAN.
Oh, just sweeping down the halls and stairs, making the beds, checking up the accounts, doing up my hair, shifting two bureaus, setting the dining - room tables, and making an apple pie.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Oh, is that all?
#SUSAN.
Yep - nothing to do till to - morrow. This is a very quiet, restful place.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Well, I guess I’ll try it. The doctor has ordered me to take a rest for a week. week, eh? I suppose you have lots of money?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Well, no. You see, I’m an actress, and I’ve just closed one engagement and am waiting now for another.
#SUSAN.
Humph! Then you’re out of a job?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Er - yes, temporarily. What are your rates? Won’t you call the porter and have him take my bag to a room?
#SUSAN.
Well, I - What have you got in the bag?
#MISS CALCIUM.
That bag contains my wardrobe.
#SUSAN.
Well, I guess you can stay one day on that baggage if you pay in advance. Porter! Porter! Ain’t the help something awful nowadays? You can’t never depend on them. Porter!
#RUBBER-NECK.
Yas’m, yas’m. Here I is.
#SUSAN.
Where were you? What do you mean by keeping this lady waiting?
#RUBBER-NECK.
Well, I was jest out to the gay - rage, fixin’ up the limousine, an’ -
#SUSAN.
Well, you know I prefer the electric runabout in the afternoons. Show the lady up to Room 948.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Yas’m. You said Room 948?
#SUSAN.
Yes, and be quick about it.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Yas’m. Excuse me - but is that de back room or de front room?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Oh, any room will suit me. We actresses have to get used to all sorts of accommodations.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Oh, is you an actress?
#SUSAN.
Certainly she’s an actress. She’s played in Uncle Tom’s Cabin, haven’t you, Miss - Miss -
#MISS CALCIUM.
Miss Calcium. I’d better sign the register. Yes, I’ve played Topsy and Little Eva. And I’ve supported John Drew.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Oh, my, oh, my, she supported John Drew. I’m goin’ to tell his wife.
#SUSAN.
She means on the stage, stupid. You’re a blockhead.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Guess I is. Every time I brush my hair I gets my fingers full of splinters. So you is an actress?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Certainly.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Well, I’m certainly pleased to meet you. I was on the stage once.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Oh, were you? Then we are fellow Thespians.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Yas’m, I guess so. What secret society is dat?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Thespians - actors, you know. How long were you on the stage?
#RUBBER-NECK.
About twelve hours a day.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Twelve hours a day! You ought to belong to the Actors’ Union. Where was it?
#RUBBER-NECK.
Oh, right heah, right heah. I drove the stage from heah to
#MISS CALCIUM.
Oh, I see.
#RUBBER-NECK.
My, it’s certainly been de dream of my life to meet an actress. I’ve always thought I’d be an actor.
#SUSAN.
You’d be a bad actor. You couldn’t do it. You need talent to be an actor.
#RUBBER-NECK.
No, all you need is cheek. I got lots of cheek. And then, look at my shape. I’m goin’ to join a show de first chance I get.
#SUSAN.
No you don’t, Rubber; no you don’t. I need you right here in the hotel.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Well, I made up my mind I’m goin’ to do it.
#SUSAN.
Well, then, I’ll have to confess. I’m an actress myself. I’ve been taking a course in the Theatrical Correspondence School.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Oh, dear! What could you do on the stage?
#SUSAN.
Walk on and make a bluff at it - the way I see lots of them do at
#RUBBER-NECK.
And put on lots of paint.
#MISS CALCIUM.
I never paint.
#SUSAN.
Neither do I. I belong to the Kalsominers’ Union. If you paint you can’t fool a woman for half a minute, but you can fool almost any man for nearly two minutes.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Well, I’m thankful to say there’s nothing false about me.
#SUSAN.
Is that your own hair?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Yes, every curl and puff.
#SUSAN.
How much did you pay for it?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Nature gave it to me. I have only to pull out a few hairpins and it falls down to my knees.
#RUBBER-NECK.
If you’d pull ’em all out it would fall down to the floor.
#MISS CALCIUM.
You’re a rude person. But we actresses have to meet all kinds.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Oh, my! I guess I better apologize. If I said anything I should be sorry for I’m glad of it.
#SUSAN.
You must excuse him. He never had any bringing up. Where was your father born?
#RUBBER-NECK.
In San Francisco.
#SUSAN.
And your mother?
#RUBBER-NECK.
In Boston.
#SUSAN.
Well, that accounts for it.
#RUBBER-NECK.
For what?
#SUSAN.
Your Chicago accent.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Now, don’t go springing jokes like that on me.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Oh, you’ll hear jokes a good deal worse than that when you get on the stage. So you both want to act, do you?
#SUSAN.
I’m crazy about it.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Just try me, dat’s all. I’m willin’ to play anythin’ from Hamlet to pinochle.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Well, I have been thinking lately of forming a little vaudeville company.
#SUSAN.
Yes, yes - go on.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Uh - huh! Go on, gal, I’m a - listenin’.
#MISS CALCIUM.
And you’re sure you’d like acting?
#SUSAN.
}
#RUBBER-NECK.
}
#MISS CALCIUM.
Ah, ha! There he stands - the man who murdered my father -
#RUBBER-NECK.
Go ’way, woman, I don’t know your father.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Then forced open the safe and took the jewels and the money.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Now listen at dat woman lyin’ about me. You can’t prove it.
#MISS CALCIUM.
And you - you helped him in his dastardly work. You poisoned the child - muh - muh poor little che - ild.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Go on away. Don’t you touch me. You poisoned a kid. I always knew you was that kind of a woman. My, ain’t you ashamed of yourself?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Then you destroyed the will and set fire to the house.
#SUSAN.
The woman’s crazy!
#RUBBER-NECK.
Oh, let me out of here! Police! Fire! Murder!
#MISS CALCIUM.
Villain! Your time has come. Scoundrel - you cannot escape me.
#SUSAN.
Oh, dear, I’m sorry I let her stay.
#RUBBER-NECK.
She’s crazy as a June - bug - that’s what she is. She’s sufferin’ with the heat.
#MISS CALCIUM.
I have tracked you at last. I am that old man’s daughter.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Say, lady, all the money I got’s in the pocket of my other pants out in the stable. Won’t you take it and leave here?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Money! What do I care for money now! The law could not reach you - but I will.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Honest, lady, I never done it.
#SUSAN.
Oh, please go - please go.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Well, how do you like acting now?
#RUBBER-NECK.
Was that acting?
#SUSAN.
You don’t mean it?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Certainly. That is a scene from my great part in “A Woman’s Secret; or, Foiled by Fate.”
#SUSAN.
And people paid real money to see that?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Of course. We played to capacity houses for weeks.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Gee!
#SUSAN.
Well, if people are as easy as that I guess I can get their money. What do you have to learn first?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Well, the first thing is the voice. You must have a good, strong voice to be an actor.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Train - goin’ west! Buffalo - Cleveland - Chicago - Omaha - Denver - Salt Lake - Yellowstone Park - Seattle - Tacoma - Alaska - and all way stations! - Train - goin’ - west! Al - l - l - l aboard!
#MISS CALCIUM.
Mercy, his voice is strong enough.
#RUBBER-NECK.
I can do it louder. Train goin’ - east - Chicago -
#MISS CALCIUM.
That will do! I thought this was a quiet hotel.
#SUSAN.
Cut it out. We know you can do it.
#MISS CALCIUM.
So you liked that acting, did you?
#SUSAN.
Show us how to do it and you can board here for nothing.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Well, that’s very bad acting. I’m not going to do any more of it.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Not on me, you won’t.
#MISS CALCIUM.
But I’ll show you how to do the real thing. When you’ve once begun, stick to it, and you’ll win. Persistent effort - that’s the key to success.
#RUBBER-NECK.
That’s me. Hard work’s my middle name. Yas’m, I kin stick to it all right.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Very well. I see - I see you both have talent, and can stand hard knocks. We’ll go into vaudeville. You and I will do a sister act.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Oh, won’t you let me be a sister to you?
#MISS CALCIUM.
I’ll think about it. I’ll arrange a part for you in a melodramatic sketch I have written. I call it “The Special Train.”
#RUBBER-NECK.
Train - goin’ - north! Nottingham - Newbury - Newport - Noblestown - Norwood - Nux Vomica, and New York! All - l - l aboard!
#MISS CALCIUM.
Don’t do that again; do you hear?
#RUBBER-NECK.
Yes’m. Tell me about dis “Special Train.”
#MISS CALCIUM.
All the managers are crazy about it.
#RUBBER-NECK.
If you stay here much longer I’ll be as crazy as they are.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Now this sketch is very simple and easily rehearsed. Here are the railroad tracks.
#RUBBER-NECK.
She’s seeing things again!
#MISS CALCIUM.
There is the ticket office!
#SUSAN.
That’s the barber shop.
#MISS CALCIUM.
And I am - the villain!
#RUBBER-NECK.
We know that.
#MISS CALCIUM.
I take you and tie you to the railroad track.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Good - night!
#MISS CALCIUM.
Wait a moment!
#RUBBER-NECK.
No, ma’am! You are too dangerous for me.
#MISS CALCIUM.
But no harm comes to you; for as the special train comes dashing along -
#RUBBER-NECK.
Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Maybe dat train don’t stop at dis station - then it’s good - bye nigger for me!
#SUSAN.
Don’t be a coward! You can die but once.
#RUBBER-NECK.
Well - once is enough for me! I don’t know how to die. I ain’t had no practice.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Then I will not call upon you to lie upon the track - I will lie there myself.
#SUSAN.
And I will save you.
#RUBBER-NECK.
And I’ll get the reward.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Now, then, to business. I am tied to the track. You’ll be the train. You go and get a locomotive!
#RUBBER-NECK.
Say! I done told you that woman ain’t right. Where am I going to steal a locomotive?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Oh, get a train of cars! Now don’t stand there talking. Do as I tell you. Get the train! Get the special train!
#SUSAN.
Get the train - get the special train. Ask Willie for a train of cars.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Go on. Get the train. Get the special train!
#SUSAN.
The idea! He doesn’t know where to steal a little thing like a locomotive!
#MISS CALCIUM.
Now to business! I lie here upon the tracks. When I scream for help, you come and pull me off the tracks. Remember your cue.
#SUSAN.
All right! What’s my cue?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Save me - some one - save me!
#SUSAN.
All right. Save me - some one - save me!
#MISS CALCIUM.
Ah! The train is coming at the rate of sixty miles a second.
#SUSAN.
Save me - some one - save me!
#MISS CALCIUM.
Wait until I say it. The special train is coming at the rate of sixty miles a second. Save me! Save me! Who will save me?
#MISS CALCIUM.
repeats the cue several times, and then shouts over the din.) Come on and save me! That’s your cue!
#MISS CALCIUM.
from the supposed tracks RUBBER prances on from L. 2 E., with a small tin or toy locomotive and cars to which a string is attached. He is ringing a dinner - bell and blowing a whistle, which he holds between his teeth. He goes across the stage making a detour to avoid running over the others. At R. he pauses and looks back at them, still ringing bell. MISS C. rises.) Oh, dramatic art! What crimes are committed in thy name! Stop ringing that bell. Stop that whistling!
#RUBBER-NECK.
Didn’t you done tole me to stick to it, when I once begun?
#SUSAN.
Certainly she did.
#MISS CALCIUM.
Yes, I did, but -
#RUBBER-NECK.
Well, I’m a - stickin’. And you said this is the special train, didn’t you?
#MISS CALCIUM.
Yes, but this is a quiet hotel, and -
#RUBBER-NECK.
It’s goin’ to be still quieter. If you’re goin’ you better git on. Al - l - l aboard - special way train for the subway, the Great White Way and Broadway. Al - l - l aboard!
#SUSAN.
That’s it - that’s the way I’m going. No more hotel for mine! It’s me for the footlights.
#MISS CALCIUM.
You’re both all right. Hereafter we’re the Calcium Comedy Company, Unlimited! We’ll take the Quiet Hotel to Broadway and make a noise with it they can hear half - way to San Francisco! - All - l - l aboard!
