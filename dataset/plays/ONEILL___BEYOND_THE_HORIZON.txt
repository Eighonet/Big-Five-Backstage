#ANDREW.
Hey there! Gosh, you do take the prize for daydreaming! And I see you’ve toted one of the old books along with you. What is it this time - poetry, I’ll bet. Let me see.
#ROBERT.
Look out you don’t get it full of dirt.
#ANDREW.
That isn’t dirt - it’s good clean earth. Hump! “I have loved wind and light and the bright sea. But holy and most sacred night, not as I love and have loved thee.” Here! Take it and bury it. I suppose it’s that year in college gave you a liking for that kind of stuff. I’m darn glad I stopped at High School, or maybe I’d been crazy too. Imagine me reading poetry and plowing at the same time! The team’d run away, I’ll bet.
#ROBERT.
Or picture me plowing.
#ANDREW.
You should have gone back to college last fall, like I know you wanted to. You’re fitted for that sort of thing - just as I ain’t.
#ROBERT.
You know why I didn’t go back, Andy. Pa didn’t like the idea, even if he didn’t say so; and I know he wanted the money to use improving the farm. And besides, I’m not keen on being a student, just because you see me reading books all the time. What I want to do now is keep on moving so that I won’t take root in any one place.
#ANDREW.
Well, the trip you’re leaving on tomorrow will keep you moving all right. Uncle says you’ll be gone three years.
#ROBERT.
About that, he figures.
#ANDREW.
That’s a long time.
#ROBERT.
Not so long when you come to consider it. You know the Sunda sails around the Horn for Yokohama first, and that’s a long voyage on a sailing ship; and if we go to any of the other places Uncle Dick mentions - India, or Australia, or South Africa, or South America - they’ll be long voyages, too.
#ANDREW.
You can have all those foreign parts for all of me. Ma’s going to miss you a lot, Rob.
#ROBERT.
Yes - and I’ll miss her.
#ANDREW.
And Pa ain’t feeling none too happy to have you go - though he’s been trying not to show it.
#ROBERT.
I can see how he feels.
#ANDREW.
And you can bet that I’m not giving any cheers about it.
#ROBERT.
I know that, too, Andy.
#ANDREW.
I’ll miss you as much as anybody, I guess. You see, you and I ain’t like most brothers - always fighting and separated a lot of the time, while we’ve always been together - just the two of us. It’s different with us. That’s why it hits so hard, I guess.
#ROBERT.
It’s just as hard for me, Andy - believe that! I hate to leave you and the old folks - but - I feel I’ve got to. There’s something calling me - Oh, I can’t just explain it to you, Andy.
#ANDREW.
No need to, Rob. Hell! You want to go - that’s all there is to it; and I wouldn’t have you miss this chance for the world.
#ROBERT.
It’s fine of you to feel that way, Andy.
#ANDREW.
Huh! I’d be a nice son - of - a - gun if I didn’t, wouldn’t I? When I know how you need this sea trip to make a new man of you - in the body, I mean - and give you your full health back.
#ROBERT.
All of you seem to keep harping on my health. You were so used to seeing me lying around the house in the old days that you never will get over the notion that I’m a chronic invalid. You don’t realize how I’ve bucked up in the past few years. If I had no other excuse for going on Uncle Dick’s ship but just my health, I’d stay right here and start in plowing.
#ANDREW.
Can’t be done. Farming ain’t your nature. There’s all the difference shown in just the way us two feel about the farm. You - well, you like the home part of it, I expect; but as a place to work and grow things, you hate it. Ain’t that right?
#ROBERT.
Yes, I suppose it is. For you it’s different. You’re a Mayo through and through. You’re wedded to the soil. You’re as much a product of it as an ear of corn is, or a tree. Father is the same. This farm is his life - work, and he’s happy in knowing that another Mayo, inspired by the same love, will take up the work where he leaves off. I can understand your attitude, and Pa’s; and I think it’s wonderful and sincere. But I - well, I’m not made that way.
#ANDREW.
No, you ain’t; but when it comes to understanding, I guess I realize that you’ve got your own angle of looking at things.
#ROBERT.
I wonder if you do, really.
#ANDREW.
Sure I do. You’ve seen a bit of the world, enough to make the farm seem small, and you’ve got the itch to see it all.
#ROBERT.
It’s more than that, Andy.
#ANDREW.
Oh, of course. I know you’re going to learn navigation, and all about a ship, so’s you can be an officer. That’s natural, too. There’s fair pay in it, I expect, when you consider that you’ve always got a home and grub thrown in; and if you’re set on traveling, you can go anywhere you’re a mind to without paying fare.
#ROBERT.
It’s more than that, Andy.
#ANDREW.
Sure it is. There’s always a chance of a good thing coming your way in some of those foreign ports or other. I’ve heard there are great opportunities for a young fellow with his eyes open in some of those new countries that are just being opened up. I’ll bet that’s what you’ve been turning over in your mind under all your quietness! Well, if you get to be a millionaire all of a sudden, call ’round once in a while and I’ll pass the plate to you. We could use a lot of money right here on the farm without hurting it any.
#ROBERT.
I’ve never considered that practical side of it for a minute, Andy.
#ANDREW.
Well, you ought to.
#ROBERT.
No, I oughtn’t. Supposing I was to tell you that it’s just Beauty that’s calling me, the beauty of the far off and unknown, the mystery and spell of the East which lures me in the books I’ve read, the need of the freedom of great wide spaces, the joy of wandering on and on - in quest of the secret which is hidden over there, beyond the horizon? Suppose I told you that was the one and only reason for my going?
#ANDREW.
I should say you were nutty.
#ROBERT.
Don’t, Andy. I’m serious.
#ANDREW.
Then you might as well stay here, because we’ve got all you’re looking for right on this farm. There’s wide space enough, Lord knows; and you can have all the sea you want by walking a mile down to the beach; and there’s plenty of horizon to look at, and beauty enough for anyone, except in the winter. As for the mystery and spell, I haven’t met ’em yet, but they’re probably lying around somewheres. I’ll have you understand this is a first class farm with all the fixings.
#ROBERT.
It’s no use talking to you, you chump!
#ANDREW.
You’d better not say anything to Uncle Dick about spells and things when you’re on the ship. He’ll likely chuck you overboard for a Jonah. I’d better run along. I’ve got to wash up some as long as Ruth’s Ma is coming over for supper.
#ROBERT.
And Ruth.
#ANDREW.
Yes, Ruth’ll be staying too. Well, I better hustle, I guess, and -
#ROBERT.
Wait a minute, Andy! There is something I want to -
#ANDREW.
Yes?
#ROBERT.
No - never mind - it doesn’t matter, it was nothing.
#ANDREW.
Maybe I can guess - what you were going to say - but I guess you’re right not to talk about it. We can’t help those things, Rob. You’ll be coming along shortly, won’t you?
#ROBERT.
Yes.
#ANDREW.
See you later, then.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Hello, Rob!
#ROBERT.
Hello, Ruth!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I was looking for you.
#ROBERT.
Andy just left here.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I know. I met him on the road a second ago. He told me you were here. I wasn’t looking for Andy, Smarty, if that’s what you mean. I was looking for you.
#ROBERT.
Because I’m going away tomorrow?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Because your mother was anxious to have you come home and asked me to look for you. I just wheeled Ma over to your house.
#ROBERT.
How is your mother?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
She’s about the same. She never seems to get any better or any worse. Oh, Rob, I do wish she’d try to make the best of things that can’t be helped.
#ROBERT.
Has she been nagging at you again?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
She never stops nagging. No matter what I do for her she finds fault. If only Pa was still living - I suppose I shouldn’t complain this way. Poor Ma, Lord knows it’s hard enough for her. I suppose it’s natural to be cross when you’re not able ever to walk a step. Oh, I’d like to be going away some place - like you!
#ROBERT.
It’s hard to stay - and equally hard to go, sometimes.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
There! If I’m not the stupid body! I swore I wasn’t going to speak about your trip - until after you’d gone; and there I go, first thing!
#ROBERT.
Why didn’t you want to speak of it?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Because I didn’t want to spoil this last night you’re here. Oh, Rob, I’m going to - we’re all going to miss you so awfully. Your mother is going around looking as if she’d burst out crying any minute. You ought to know how I feel. Andy and you and I - why it seems as if we’d always been together.
#ROBERT.
You and Andy will still have each other. It’ll be harder for me without anyone.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But you’ll have new sights and new people to take your mind off; while we’ll be here with the old, familiar place to remind us every minute of the day. It’s a shame you’re going - just at this time, in spring, when everything is getting so nice. I oughtn’t to talk that way when I know going’s the best thing for you. You’re bound to find all sorts of opportunities to get on, your father says.
#ROBERT.
I don’t give a damn about that! I wouldn’t take a voyage across the road for the best opportunity in the world of the kind Pa thinks of. Excuse me, Ruth, for getting worked up over it; but Andy gave me an overdose of the practical considerations.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Well, then, if it isn’t - Oh, Rob, why do you want to go?
#ROBERT.
Why do you ask that, Ruth?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Because - It seems such a shame.
#ROBERT.
Why?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, because - everything.
#ROBERT.
I could hardly back out now, even if I wanted to. And I’ll be forgotten before you know it.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You won’t! I’ll never forget -
#ROBERT.
Will you promise me that?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Of course. It’s mean of you to think that any of us would forget so easily.
#ROBERT.
Oh!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But you haven’t told me your reason for leaving yet?
#ROBERT.
I doubt if you’ll understand. It’s difficult to explain, even to myself. Either you feel it, or you don’t. I can remember being conscious of it first when I was only a kid - you haven’t forgotten what a sickly specimen I was then, in those days, have you?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Let’s not think about them.
#ROBERT.
You’ll have to, to understand. Well, in those days, when Ma was fixing meals, she used to get me out of the way by pushing my chair to the west window and telling me to look out and be quiet. That wasn’t hard. I guess I was always quiet.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, you always were - and you suffering so much, too!
#ROBERT.
So I used to stare out over the fields to the hills, out there - and somehow after a time I’d forget any pain I was in, and start dreaming. I knew the sea was over beyond those hills, - the folks had told me - and I used to wonder what the sea was like, and try to form a picture of it in my mind. There was all the mystery in the world to me then about that - far - off sea - and there still is! It called to me then just as it does now. And other times my eyes would follow this road, winding off into the distance, toward the hills, as if it, too, was searching for the sea. And I’d promise myself that when I grew up and was strong, I’d follow that road, and it and I would find the sea together. You see, my making this trip is only keeping that promise of long ago.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, I see.
#ROBERT.
Those were the only happy moments of my life then, dreaming there at the window. I liked to be all alone - those times. I got to know all the different kinds of sunsets by heart. And all those sunsets took place over there - beyond the horizon. So gradually I came to believe that all the wonders of the world happened on the other side of those hills. There was the home of the good fairies who performed beautiful miracles. I believed in fairies then. Perhaps I still do believe in them. Anyway, in those days they were real enough, and sometimes I could actually hear them calling to me to come out and play with them, dance with them down the road in the dusk in a game of hide - and - seek to find out where the sun was hiding himself. They sang their little songs to me, songs that told of all the wonderful things they had in their home on the other side of the hills; and they promised to show me all of them, if I’d only come, come! But I couldn’t come then, and I used to cry sometimes and Ma would think I was in pain. That’s why I’m going now, I suppose. For I can still hear them calling. But the horizon is as far away and as luring as ever. Do you understand now, Ruth?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes.
#ROBERT.
You feel it then?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, yes, I do! Oh, Rob, how could I help feeling it? You tell things so beautifully!
#ROBERT.
So now you know why I’m going. It’s for that reason - that and one other.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You’ve another? Then you must tell me that, too.
#ROBERT.
I wonder if I ought to! You’ll promise not to be angry - whatever it is?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, I promise.
#ROBERT.
I love you. That’s the other reason.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, Rob!
#ROBERT.
I wasn’t going to tell you, but I feel I have to. It can’t matter now that I’m going so far away, and for so long - perhaps forever. I’ve loved you all these years, but the realization never came ’til I agreed to go away with Uncle Dick. Then I thought of leaving you, and the pain of that thought revealed to me in a flash - that I loved you, had loved you as long as I could remember. You mustn’t mind my telling you this, Ruth. I realize how impossible it all is - and I understand; for the revelation of my own love seemed to open my eyes to the love of others. I saw Andy’s love for you - and I knew that you must love him.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I don’t! I don’t love Andy! I don’t! Whatever - put such a fool notion into - into your head? Oh, Rob! Don’t go away! Please! You mustn’t, now! You can’t! I won’t let you! It’d break my - my heart!
#ROBERT.
Do you mean that - that you love me?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, yes - of course I do - what d’you s’pose? You stupid thing! I’ve loved you right along.
#ROBERT.
But you and Andy were always together!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Because you never seemed to want to go any place with me. You were always reading an old book, and not paying any attention to me. I was too proud to let you see I cared because I thought the year you had away to college had made you stuck - up, and you thought yourself too educated to waste any time on me.
#ROBERT.
And I was thinking - What fools we’ve both been!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You won’t go away on the trip, will you, Rob? You’ll tell them you can’t go on account of me, won’t you? You can’t go now! You can’t!
#ROBERT.
Perhaps - you can come too.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, Rob, don’t be so foolish. You know I can’t. Who’d take care of ma? Don’t you see I couldn’t go - on her account? Please don’t go - not now. Tell them you’ve decided not to. They won’t mind. I know your mother and father’ll be glad. They’ll all be. They don’t want you to go so far away from them. Please, Rob! We’ll be so happy here together where it’s natural and we know things. Please tell me you won’t go!
#ROBERT.
But - Ruth - I - Uncle Dick -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He won’t mind when he knows it’s for your happiness to stay. How could he? Oh, Rob! And you said - you loved me!
#ROBERT.
I won’t go, Ruth. I promise you. There! Don’t cry! Perhaps after all Andy was right - righter than he knew - when he said I could find all the things I was seeking for here, at home on the farm. I think love must have been the secret - the secret that called to me from over the world’s rim - the secret beyond every horizon; and when I did not come, it came to me. Oh, Ruth, our love is sweeter than any distant dream!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
My, but you’re strong!
#ROBERT.
Come! We’ll go and tell them at once.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, no, don’t, Rob, not ’til after I’ve gone. There’d be bound to be such a scene with them all together.
#ROBERT.
As you like - Little Miss Common Sense!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Let’s go, then.
#ROBERT.
See! The first star. Our star!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. Our very own star. Come, Rob, let’s go. We’ll be late for supper, Rob.
#ROBERT.
All right. We’ll run then. Come on!
#THE CAPTAIN.
And that mission woman, she hails me on the dock as I was acomin’ ashore, and she says - with her silly face all screwed up serious as judgment - “Captain,” she says, “would you be so kind as to tell me where the sea - gulls sleeps at nights?” Blow me if them warn’t her exact words! Ain’t that just like a fool woman’s question? And I looks at her serious as I could, “Ma’m,” says I, “I couldn’t rightly answer that question. I ain’t never seed a sea - gull in his bunk yet. The next time I hears one snorin’,” I says, “I’ll make a note of where he’s turned in, and write you a letter ’bout it.” And then she calls me a fool real spiteful and tacks away from me quick. So I got rid of her that way.
#MRS. MAYO.
But when it comes to that, where do sea - gulls sleep, Dick?
#SCOTT.
Ho! Ho! Listen to her, James. ’Nother one! Well, if that don’t beat all hell - ’scuse me for cussin’, Kate.
#MAYO.
They unhitch their wings, Katey, and spreads ’em out on a wave for a bed.
#SCOTT.
And then they tells the fish to whistle to ’em when it’s time to turn out. Ho! Ho!
#MRS. MAYO.
You men folks are too smart to live, aren’t you?
#SCOTT.
: You folks look as if you was settin’ up with a corpse. God A’mighty, there ain’t anyone dead, be there?
#MAYO.
Don’t play the dunce, Dick! You know as well as we do there ain’t no great cause to be feelin’ chipper.
#SCOTT.
And there ain’t no cause to be wearin’ mourning, either, I can make out.
#MRS. MAYO.
How can you talk that way, Dick Scott, when you’re taking our Robbie away from us, in the middle of the night, you might say, just to get on that old boat of yours on time! I think you might wait until morning when he’s had his breakfast.
#SCOTT.
Ain’t that a woman’s way o’ seein’ things for you? God A’mighty, Kate, I can’t give orders to the tide that it’s got to be high just when it suits me to have it. I ain’t gettin’ no fun out o’ missin’ sleep and leavin’ here at six bells myself. And the Sunda ain’t an old ship - leastways, not very old - and she’s good’s she ever was.
#MRS. MAYO.
I wish Robbie weren’t going.
#MAYO.
There, Katey!
#MRS. MAYO.
Well, I do wish he wasn’t!
#SCOTT.
You shouldn’t be taking it so hard, ’s far as I kin see. This vige’ll make a man of him. I’ll see to it he learns how to navigate, ’n’ study for a mate’s c’tificate right off - and it’ll give him a trade for the rest of his life, if he wants to travel.
#MRS. MAYO.
But I don’t want him to travel all his life. You’ve got to see he comes home when this trip is over. Then he’ll be all well, and he’ll want to - to marry - and settle down right here. I never realized how hard it was going to be for me to have Robbie go - or I wouldn’t have considered it a minute.
#SCOTT.
It ain’t no good goin’ on that way, Kate, now it’s all settled.
#MRS. MAYO.
It’s all right for you to talk. You’ve never had any children. You don’t know what it means to be parted from them - and Robbie my youngest, too.
#ANDREW.
There’s one thing none of you seem to take into consideration - that Rob wants to go. He’s dead set on it. He’s been dreaming over this trip ever since it was first talked about. It wouldn’t be fair to him not to have him go. At least, not if he still feels the same way about it he did when he was talking to me this evening.
#MAYO.
Andy’s right, Katey. That ends all argyment, you can see that. Wonder what’s happened to Robert? He’s been gone long enough to wheel the widder to home, certain. He can’t be out dreamin’ at the stars his last night.
#MRS. MAYO.
Why didn’t you wheel Mrs. Atkins back tonight, Andy? You usually do when she and Ruth come over.
#ANDREW.
I thought maybe Robert wanted to tonight. He offered to go right away when they were leaving.
#MRS. MAYO.
He only wanted to be polite.
#ANDREW.
Well, he’ll be right back, I guess. Guess I’ll go take a look at the black cow, Pa - see if she’s ailing any.
#MAYO.
Yes - better had, son.
#SCOTT.
There’s the boy that would make a good, strong sea - farin’ man - if he’d a mind to.
#MAYO.
Don’t you put no such fool notions in Andy’s head, Dick - or you ’n’ me’s goin’ to fall out. You couldn’t tempt him, no ways. Andy’s a Mayo bred in the bone, and he’s a born farmer, and a damn good one, too. He’ll live and die right here on this farm, like I expect to. And he’ll make this one of the slickest, best - payin’ farms in the state, too, afore he gits through!
#SCOTT.
Seems to me it’s a pretty slick place right now.
#MAYO.
It’s too small. We need more land to make it amount to much, and we ain’t got the capital to buy it.
#ANDREW.
Anything else you can think of to be done, Pa?
#MAYO.
No, nothin’ I know of.
#MRS. MAYO.
What’s come over Andy tonight, I wonder? He acts so strange.
#MAYO.
He does seem sort o’ glum and out of sorts. It’s ’count o’ Robert leavin’, I s’pose. Dick, you wouldn’t believe how them boys o’ mine sticks together. They ain’t like most brothers. They’ve been thick as thieves all their lives, with nary a quarrel I kin remember.
#SCOTT.
No need to tell me that. I can see how they take to each other.
#MRS. MAYO.
Did you notice, James, how queer everyone was at supper? Robert seemed stirred up about something; and Ruth was so flustered and giggly; and Andy sat there dumb, looking as if he’d lost his best friend; and all of them only nibbled at their food.
#MAYO.
Guess they was all thinkin’ about tomorrow, same as us.
#MRS. MAYO.
No. I’m afraid somethin’s happened - somethin’ else.
#MAYO.
You mean - ’bout Ruth?
#MRS. MAYO.
Yes.
#MAYO.
I hope her and Andy ain’t had a serious fallin’ - out. I always sorter hoped they’d hitch up together sooner or later. What d’you say, Dick? Don’t you think them two’d pair up well?
#SCOTT.
A sweet, wholesome couple they’d make.
#MAYO.
It’d be a good thing for Andy in more ways than one. I ain’t what you’d call calculatin’ generally, and I b’lieve in lettin’ young folks run their affairs to suit themselves; but there’s advantages for both o’ them in this match you can’t overlook in reason. The Atkins farm is right next to ourn. Jined together they’d make a jim - dandy of a place, with plenty o’ room to work in. And bein’ a widder with only a daughter, and laid up all the time to boot, Mrs. Atkins can’t do nothin’ with the place as it ought to be done. She needs a man, a first - class farmer, to take hold o’ things; and Andy’s just the one.
#MRS. MAYO.
I don’t think Ruth loves Andy.
#MAYO.
You don’t? Well, maybe a woman’s eyes is sharper in such things, but - they’re always together. And if she don’t love him now, she’ll likely come around to it in time. You seem mighty fixed in your opinion, Katey. How d’you know?
#MRS. MAYO.
It’s just - what I feel.
#MAYO.
You don’t mean to say - Shucks! I’m losin’ my respect for your eyesight, Katey. Why, Robert ain’t got no time for Ruth, ’cept as a friend!
#MRS. MAYO.
Sss - h - h!
#MAYO.
So here you be at last! What have you been doin’ all this time - countin’ the stars to see if they all come out right and proper?
#ROBERT.
There’s only one I’ll ever look for any more, Pa.
#MAYO.
You might’ve even not wasted time lookin’ for that one - your last night.
#MRS. MAYO.
You ought to have worn your coat a sharp night like this, Robbie.
#SCOTT.
God A’mighty, Kate, you treat Robert as if he was one year old!
#MRS. MAYO.
You look all worked up over something, Robbie. What is it?
#ROBERT.
Yes, there is something - something I must tell you - all of you. Something I discovered only this evening - very beautiful and wonderful - something I did not take into consideration previously because I hadn’t dared to hope that such happiness could ever come to me. You must all remember that fact, won’t you?
#MAYO.
Let’s get to the point, son.
#ROBERT.
Well, the point is this, Pa: I’m not going - I mean - I can’t go tomorrow with Uncle Dick - or at any future time, either.
#MRS. MAYO.
Oh, Robbie, I’m so glad!
#MAYO.
You ain’t serious, be you, Robert? Seems to me it’s a pretty late hour in the day for you to be upsettin’ all your plans so sudden!
#ROBERT.
I asked you to remember that until this evening I didn’t know myself. I had never dared to dream -
#MAYO.
What is this foolishness you’re talkin’ of?
#ROBERT.
Ruth told me this evening that - she loved me. It was after I’d confessed I loved her. I told her I hadn’t been conscious of my love until after the trip had been arranged, and I realized it would mean - leaving her. That was the truth. I didn’t know until then. I hadn’t intended telling her anything but - suddenly - I felt I must. I didn’t think it would matter, because I was going away. And I thought she loved - someone else. And then she cried and said it was I she’d loved all the time, but I hadn’t seen it.
#MRS. MAYO.
I knew it! I was just telling your father when you came in - and, Oh, Robbie, I’m so happy you’re not going!
#ROBERT.
I knew you’d be glad, Ma.
#MAYO.
Well, I’ll be damned! You do beat all for gettin’ folks’ minds all tangled up, Robert. And Ruth too! Whatever got into her of a sudden? Why, I was thinkin’ -
#MRS. MAYO.
Never mind what you were thinking, James. It wouldn’t be any use telling us that now. And what you were hoping for turns out just the same almost, doesn’t it?
#MAYO.
Yes; I suppose you’re right, Katey. But how it ever come about! It do beat anything ever I heard. We’re glad you ain’t goin’, your Ma and I, for we’d have missed you terrible, that’s certain and sure; and we’re glad you’ve found happiness. Ruth’s a fine girl and’ll make a good wife to you.
#ROBERT.
Thank you, Pa.
#ANDREW.
I guess it’s my turn to offer congratulations, isn’t it?
#ROBERT.
Andy! Why - I - I didn’t see you. Were you here when -
#ANDREW.
I heard everything you said; and here’s wishing you every happiness, you and Ruth. You both deserve the best there is.
#ROBERT.
Thanks, Andy, it’s fine of you to -
#ANDREW.
Good luck to you both!
#MRS. MAYO.
What’s the matter, Dick? Aren’t you going to congratulate Robbie?
#SCOTT.
Of course I be! Luck to you, boy.
#ROBERT.
Thanks, Uncle Dick.
#SCOTT.
So you’re not acomin’ on the Sunda with me?
#ROBERT.
I can’t, Uncle - not now. I wouldn’t miss it for anything else in the world under any other circumstances. But you see I’ve found - a bigger dream. I want you all to understand one thing - I’m not going to be a loafer on your hands any longer. This means the beginning of a new life for me in every way. I’m going to settle right down and take a real interest in the farm, and do my share. I’ll prove to you, Pa, that I’m as good a Mayo as you are - or Andy, when I want to be.
#MAYO.
That’s the right spirit, Robert. Ain’t none of us doubts your willin’ness, but you ain’t never learned -
#ROBERT.
Then I’m going to start learning right away, and you’ll teach me, won’t you?
#MAYO.
Of course I will, boy, and be glad to, only you’d best go easy at first.
#SCOTT.
You don’t mean to tell me you’re goin’ to let him stay, do you, James?
#MAYO.
Why, things bein’ as they be, Robert’s free to do as he’s a mind to.
#MRS. MAYO.
Let him! The very idea!
#SCOTT.
Then all I got to say is, you’re a soft, weak - willed critter to be permittin’ a boy - and women, too - to be layin’ your course for you wherever they damn pleases.
#MAYO.
It’s just the same with me as ’twas with you, Dick. You can’t order the tides on the seas to suit you, and I ain’t pretendin’ I can reg’late love for young folks.
#SCOTT.
Love! They ain’t old enough to know love when they sight it! Love! I’m ashamed of you, Robert, to go lettin’ a little huggin’ and kissin’ in the dark spile your chances to make a man out o’ yourself. It ain’t common sense - no siree, it ain’t - not by a hell of a sight!
#MRS. MAYO.
A fine one you are to be talking about love, Dick - an old cranky bachelor like you. Goodness sakes!
#SCOTT.
I’ve never been a damn fool like most, if that’s what you’re steerin’ at.
#MRS. MAYO.
Sour grapes, aren’t they, Dick? Good gracious, Dick, you do act silly, flying into a temper over nothing.
#SCOTT.
Nothin’! You talk as if I wasn’t concerned nohow in this here business. Seems to me I’ve got a right to have my say. Ain’t I made all arrangements with the owners and stocked up with some special grub all on Robert’s account?
#ROBERT.
You’ve been fine, Uncle Dick; and I appreciate it. Truly.
#MAYO.
’Course; we all does, Dick.
#SCOTT.
I’ve been countin’ sure on havin’ Robert for company on this vige - to sorta talk to and show things to, and teach, kinda, and I got my mind so set on havin’ him I’m goin’ to be double lonesome this vige. Darn all this silly lovin’ business, anyway. But all this talk ain’t tellin’ me what I’m to do with that sta’b’d cabin I fixed up. It’s all painted white, an’ a bran new mattress on the bunk, ’n’ new sheets ’n’ blankets ’n’ things. And Chips built in a book - case so’s Robert could take his books along - with a slidin’ bar fixed across’t it, mind, so’s they couldn’t fall out no matter how she rolled. What d’you suppose my officers is goin’ to think when there’s no one comes aboard to occupy that sta’b’d cabin? And the men what did the work on it - what’ll they think? They’re liable as not to suspicion it was a woman I’d planned to ship along, and that she gave me the go - by at the last moment! Gawd A’mighty! They’re only lookin’ to have the laugh on me for something like that. They’re liable to b’lieve anything, those fellers is!
#MAYO.
Then there’s nothing to it but for you to get right out and hunt up a wife somewheres for that spick ’n’ span cabin. She’ll have to be a pretty one, too, to match it. You ain’t got much time to find her, Dick.
#SCOTT.
You kin go to thunder, Jim Mayo!
#ANDREW.
You needn’t worry about that spare cabin, Uncle Dick, if you’ve a mind to take me in Robert’s place.
#ROBERT.
Andy! Andy, you mustn’t!
#ANDREW.
You’ve made your decision, Rob, and now I’ve made mine. You’re out of this, remember.
#ROBERT.
But Andy -
#ANDREW.
Don’t interfere, Rob - that’s all I ask. You haven’t answered my question, Uncle Dick.
#SCOTT.
O’ course, I’d be glad to have you, Andy.
#ANDREW.
It’s settled then. I can pack the little I want to take in a few minutes.
#MRS. MAYO.
Don’t be a fool, Dick. Andy’s only joking you.
#SCOTT.
It’s hard to tell who’s jokin’ and who’s not in this house.
#ANDREW.
I’m not joking, Uncle Dick. You needn’t be afraid I’ll go back on my word.
#ROBERT.
Andy! That isn’t fair!
#MAYO.
Seems to me this ain’t no subject to joke over - not for Andy.
#ANDREW.
I agree with you, Pa, and I tell you again, once and for all, that I’ve made up my mind to go.
#MAYO.
But why, son? Why?
#ANDREW.
I’ve always wanted to go.
#ROBERT.
Andy!
#ANDREW.
You shut up, Rob! I didn’t ever mention it because as long as Rob was going I knew it was no use; but now Rob’s staying on here, there isn’t any reason for me not to go.
#MAYO.
No reason? Can you stand there and say that to me, Andrew?
#MRS. MAYO.
He doesn’t mean a word of it, James.
#MAYO.
Let me talk, Katey. What’s come over you so sudden, Andy? You know’s well as I do that it wouldn’t be fair o’ you to run off at a moment’s notice right now when we’re up to our necks in hard work.
#ANDREW.
Rob’ll hold his end up as soon as he learns.
#MAYO.
Robert was never cut out for a farmer, and you was.
#ANDREW.
You can easily get a man to do my work.
#MAYO.
It sounds strange to hear you, Andy, that I always thought had good sense, talkin’ crazy like that. Get a man to take your place! You ain’t been workin’ here for no hire, Andy, that you kin give me your notice to quit like you’ve done. The farm is your’n as well as mine. You’ve always worked on it with that understanding; and what you’re sayin’ you intend doin’ is just skulkin’ out o’ your rightful responsibility.
#ANDREW.
I’m sorry, Pa. It’s no use talking any more about it.
#MRS. MAYO.
There! I knew Andy’d come to his senses!
#ANDREW.
Don’t get the wrong idea, Ma. I’m not backing out.
#MAYO.
You mean you’re goin’ in spite of - everythin’?
#ANDREW.
Yes. I’m going. I’ve got to. I feel I oughn’t to miss this chance to go out into the world and see things, and - I want to go.
#MAYO.
So - you want to go out into the world and see thin’s! I never thought I’d live to see the day when a son o’ mine ’d look me in the face and tell a bare - faced lie! You’re a liar, Andy Mayo, and a mean one to boot!
#MRS. MAYO.
James!
#ROBERT.
Pa!
#SCOTT.
Steady there, Jim!
#MAYO.
He is and he knows it.
#ANDREW.
I won’t argue with you, Pa. You can think as badly of me as you like.
#MAYO.
You know I’m speakin’ truth - that’s why you’re afraid to argy! You lie when you say you want to go ’way - and see thin’s! You ain’t got no likin’ in the world to go. I’ve watched you grow up, and I know your ways, and they’re my ways. You’re runnin’ against your own nature, and you’re goin’ to be a’mighty sorry for it if you do. ’S if I didn’t know your real reason for runnin’ away! And runnin’ away’s the only words to fit it. You’re runnin’ away ’cause you’re put out and riled ’cause your own brother’s got Ruth ’stead o’ you, and -
#ANDREW.
Stop, Pa! I won’t stand hearing that - not even from you!
#MRS. MAYO.
Don’t mind him, Andy dear. He don’t mean a word he’s saying!
#MAYO.
It’s the truth, Andy Mayo! And you ought to be bowed in shame to think of it!
#ROBERT.
Pa!
#MRS. MAYO.
Won’t you be still, James? Please won’t you?
#MAYO.
The truth - God’s truth!
#MRS. MAYO.
Sh - h - h!
#ANDREW.
You’re wrong, Pa, it isn’t truth. I don’t love Ruth. I never loved her, and the thought of such a thing never entered my head.
#MAYO.
Hump! You’re pilin’ lie on lie!
#ANDREW.
I suppose it’d be hard for you to explain anyone’s wanting to leave this blessed farm except for some outside reason like that. But I’m sick and tired of it - whether you want to believe me or not - and that’s why I’m glad to get a chance to move on.
#ROBERT.
Andy! Don’t! You’re only making it worse.
#ANDREW.
I don’t care. I’ve done my share of work here. I’ve earned my right to quit when I want to. I’m sick and tired of the whole damn business. I hate the farm and every inch of ground in it. I’m sick of digging in the dirt and sweating in the sun like a slave without getting a word of thanks for it. I’m through, through for good and all; and if Uncle Dick won’t take me on his ship, I’ll find another. I’ll get away somewhere, somehow.
#MRS. MAYO.
Don’t you answer him, James. He doesn’t know what he’s saying. Don’t say a word to him ’til he’s in his right senses again. Please James, don’t -
#MAYO.
You dare to - you dare to speak like that to me? You talk like that ’bout this farm - the Mayo farm - where you was born - you - you - You damned whelp!
#MRS. MAYO.
James!
#SCOTT.
Easy there, Jim!
#ROBERT.
Stop! Are you mad?
#MAYO.
Yes - go! - go! - You’re no son o’ mine - no son o’ mine! You can go to hell if you want to! Don’t let me find you here - in the mornin’ - or - or - I’ll throw you out!
#ROBERT.
Pa! For God’s sake!
#MAYO.
You go - tomorrow mornin’ - and by God - don’t come back - don’t dare come back - by God, not while I’m livin’ - or I’ll - I’ll -
#MRS. MAYO.
James! James! Where are you going?
#MAYO.
I’m goin’ - to bed, Katey. It’s late, Katey - it’s late.
#MRS. MAYO.
James! Take back what you’ve said to Andy. James!
#SCOTT.
Well, if he ain’t the devil himself when he’s roused! You oughtn’t to have talked to him that way, Andy ’bout the damn farm, knowin’ how touchy he is about it. Well, you won’t mind what he’s said in anger. He’ll be sorry for it when he’s calmed down a bit.
#ANDREW.
You don’t know him. What’s said is said and can’t be unsaid; and I’ve chosen.
#ROBERT.
Andy! You can’t go! This is all so stupid - and terrible!
#ANDREW.
I’ll talk to you in a minute, Rob.
#SCOTT.
I’m damned glad you’re shippin’ on, Andy. I like your spirit, and the way you spoke up to him. The sea’s the place for a young feller like you that isn’t half dead ’n’ alive. You ’n’ me’ll get along like twins, see if we don’t. I’m goin’ aloft to turn in. Don’t forget to pack your dunnage. And git some sleep, if you kin. We’ll want to sneak out extra early b’fore they’re up. It’ll do away with more argyments. Robert can drive us down to the town, and bring back the team. Well, good night.
#ANDREW.
Good night. Buck up, Rob. It ain’t any use crying over spilt milk; and it’ll all turn out for the best - let’s hope. It couldn’t be helped - what’s happened.
#ROBERT.
But it’s a lie, Andy, a lie!
#ANDREW.
Of course it’s a lie. You know it and I know it, - but that’s all ought to know it.
#ROBERT.
Pa’ll never forgive you. Oh, the whole affair is so senseless - and tragic. Why did you think you must go away?
#ANDREW.
You know better than to ask that. You know why. I can wish you and Ruth all the good luck in the world, and I do, and I mean it; but you can’t expect me to stay around here and watch you two together, day after day - and me alone. I couldn’t stand it - not after all the plans I’d made to happen on this place thinking - thinking she cared for me.
#ROBERT.
God! It’s horrible! I feel so guilty - to think that I should be the cause of your suffering, after we’ve been such pals all our lives. If I could have foreseen what’d happen, I swear to you I’d have never said a word to Ruth. I swear I wouldn’t have, Andy!
#ANDREW.
I know you wouldn’t; and that would’ve been worse, for Ruth would’ve suffered then. It’s best as it is. It had to be, and I’ve got to stand the gaff, that’s all. Pa’ll see how I felt - after a time. - and if he don’t - well, it can’t be helped.
#ROBERT.
But think of Ma! God, Andy, you can’t go! You can’t!
#ANDREW.
I’ve got to go - to get away! I’ve got to, I tell you. I’d go crazy here, bein’ reminded every second of the day what a fool I’d made of myself. I’ve got to get away and try and forget, if I can. And I’d hate the farm if I stayed, hate it for bringin’ things back. I couldn’t take interest in the work any more, work with no purpose in sight. Can’t you see what a hell it’d be? You love her too, Rob. Put yourself in my place, and remember I haven’t stopped loving her, and couldn’t if I was to stay. Would that be fair to you or to her? Put yourself in my place. What’d you do then? Tell me the truth! You love her. What’d you do?
#ROBERT.
I’d - I’d go, Andy! God!
#ANDREW.
Then you know why I got to go; and there’s nothing more to be said.
#ROBERT.
Why did this have to happen to us? It’s damnable!
#ANDREW.
It’s no use fussing any more, Rob. It’s done. I guess Ruth’s got a right to have who she likes. She made a good choice - and God bless her for it!
#ROBERT.
Andy! Oh, I wish I could tell you half I feel of how fine you are!
#ANDREW.
Shut up! Let’s go to bed. I’ve got to be up long before sun - up. You, too, if you’re going to drive us down.
#ROBERT.
Yes. Yes.
#ANDREW.
And I’ve got to pack yet. I’m as tired as if I’d been plowing twenty - four hours at a stretch. I feel - dead. I’m going to douse the light. Come on. Don’t sit there mourning, Rob. It’ll all come out in the wash. Come on and get some sleep. Everything’ll turn out all right in the end.
#MRS. ATKINS.
Robert’s late for his dinner again, as usual. I don’t see why Ruth puts up with it, and I’ve told her so. Many’s the time I’ve said to her “It’s about time you put a stop to his nonsense. Does he suppose you’re runnin’ a hotel - with no one to help with things?” But she don’t pay no attention. She’s as bad as he is, a’most - thinks she knows better than an old, sick body like me.
#MRS. MAYO.
Robbie’s always late for things. He can’t help it, Sarah.
#MRS. ATKINS.
Can’t help it! How you do go on, Kate, findin’ excuses for him! Anybody can help anything they’ve a mind to - as long as they’ve got health, and ain’t rendered helpless like me - through the will of God.
#MRS. MAYO.
Robbie can’t.
#MRS. ATKINS.
Can’t! It do make me mad, Kate Mayo, to see folks that God gave all the use of their limbs to potterin’ round and wastin’ time doin’ everything the wrong way - and me powerless to help and at their mercy, you might say. And it ain’t that I haven’t pointed the right way to ’em. I’ve talked to Robert thousands of times and told him how things ought to be done. You know that, Kate Mayo. But d’you s’pose he takes any notice of what I say? Or Ruth, either - my own daughter? No, they think I’m a crazy, cranky old woman, half dead a’ready, and the sooner I’m in the grave and out o’ their way the better it’d suit them.
#MRS. MAYO.
You mustn’t talk that way, Sarah. They’re not as wicked as that. And you’ve got years and years before you.
#MRS. ATKINS.
You’re like the rest, Kate. You don’t know how near the end I am. Well, at least I can go to my eternal rest with a clear conscience. I’ve done all a body could do to avert ruin from this house. On their heads be it!
#MRS. MAYO.
Things might be worse. Robert never had any experience in farming. You can’t expect him to learn in a day.
#MRS. ATKINS.
He’s had three years to learn, and he’s gettin’ worse ’stead of better. Not on’y your place but mine too is driftin’ to rack and ruin, and I can’t do nothin’ to prevent.
#MRS. MAYO.
You can’t say but Robbie works hard, Sarah.
#MRS. ATKINS.
What good’s workin’ hard if it don’t accomplish anythin’, I’d like to know?
#MRS. MAYO.
Robbie’s had bad luck against him.
#MRS. ATKINS.
Say what you’ve a mind to, Kate, the proof of the puddin’s in the eatin’; and you can’t deny that things have been goin’ from bad to worse ever since your husband died two years back.
#MRS. MAYO.
It was God’s will that he should be taken.
#MRS. ATKINS.
It was God’s punishment on James Mayo for the blasphemin’ and denyin’ of God he done all his sinful life! There, Kate, I shouldn’t be remindin’ you, I know. He’s at peace, poor man, and forgiven, let’s pray.
#MRS. MAYO.
James was a good man.
#MRS. ATKINS.
What I was sayin’ was that since Robert’s been in charge things’ve been goin’ down hill steady. You don’t know how bad they are. Robert don’t let on to you what’s happenin’; and you’d never see it yourself if ’twas under your nose. But, thank the Lord, Ruth still comes to me once in a while for advice when she’s worried near out of her senses by his goin’s - on. Do you know what she told me last night? But I forgot, she said not to tell you - still I think you’ve got a right to know, and it’s my duty not to let such things go on behind your back.
#MRS. MAYO.
You can tell me if you want to.
#MRS. ATKINS.
Ruth was almost crazy about it. Robert told her he’d have to mortgage the farm - said he didn’t know how he’d pull through ’til harvest without it, and he can’t get money any other way. Now what do you think of your Robert?
#MRS. MAYO.
If it has to be -
#MRS. ATKINS.
You don’t mean to say you’re goin’ to sign away your farm, Kate Mayo - after me warnin’ you?
#MRS.
MAYO. - I’ll do what Robbie says is needful.
#MRS. ATKINS.
Well, of all the foolishness! - well, it’s your farm, not mine, and I’ve nothin’ more to say.
#MRS. MAYO.
Maybe Robbie’ll manage till Andy gets back and sees to things. It can’t be long now.
#MRS. ATKINS.
Ruth says Andy ought to turn up any day. When does Robert figger he’ll get here?
#MRS. MAYO.
He says he can’t calculate exactly on account o’ the Sunda being a sail boat. Last letter he got was from England, the day they were sailing for home. That was over a month ago, and Robbie thinks they’re overdue now.
#MRS. ATKINS.
We can give praise to God then that he’ll be back in the nick o’ time. He ought to be tired of travelin’ and anxious to get home and settle down to work again.
#MRS. MAYO.
Andy has been working. He’s head officer on Dick’s boat, he wrote Robbie. You know that.
#MRS. ATKINS.
That foolin’ on ships is all right for a spell, but he must be right sick of it by this.
#MRS. MAYO.
I wonder if he’s changed much. He used to be so fine - looking and strong. Three years! It seems more like three hundred. Oh, if James could only have lived ’til he came back - and forgiven him!
#MRS. ATKINS.
He never would have - not James Mayo! Didn’t he keep his heart hardened against him till the last in spite of all you and Robert did to soften him?
#MRS. MAYO.
Don’t you dare say that! Oh, I know deep down in his heart he forgave Andy, though he was too stubborn ever to own up to it. It was that brought on his death - breaking his heart just on account of his stubborn pride.
#MRS. ATKINS.
It was the will of God. Drat that young one! Seems as if she cries all the time on purpose to set a body’s nerves on edge.
#MRS. MAYO.
It’s the heat upsets her. Mary doesn’t feel any too well these days, poor little child!
#MRS. ATKINS.
She gets it right from her Pa - bein’ sickly all the time. You can’t deny Robert was always ailin’ as a child. It was a crazy mistake for them two to get married. I argyed against it at the time, but Ruth was so spelled with Robert’s wild poetry notions she wouldn’t listen to sense. Andy was the one would have been the match for her.
#MRS. MAYO.
I’ve often thought since it might have been better the other way. But Ruth and Robbie seem happy enough together.
#MRS. ATKINS.
At any rate it was God’s work - and His will be done.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Land sakes, if this isn’t a scorcher! That kitchen’s like a furnace. Phew!
#MRS. MAYO.
Why didn’t you call me to help with the dishes?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
No. The heat in there’d kill you.
#MARY.
Dolly, Mama! Dolly!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It’s time for your nap. You can’t play with Dolly now.
#MARY.
Dolly!
#MRS. ATKINS.
Can’t you keep that child still? Her racket’s enough to split a body’s ears. Put her down and let her play with the doll if it’ll quiet her.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
There! I hope you’ll be satisfied and keep still. It’s a wonder Rob wouldn’t try to get to meals on time once in a while.
#MRS. MAYO.
Something must have gone wrong again.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I s’pose so. Something’s always going wrong these days, it looks like.
#MRS. ATKINS.
It wouldn’t if you possessed a bit of spunk. The idea of you permittin’ him to come in to meals at all hours - and you doin’ the work! I never heard of such a thin’. You’re too easy goin’, that’s the trouble.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Do stop your nagging at me, Ma! I’m sick of hearing you. I’ll do as I please about it; and thank you for not interfering. Phew! It’s too hot to argue. Let’s talk of something pleasant. Didn’t I hear you speaking about Andy a while ago?
#MRS. MAYO.
We were wondering when he’d get home.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Rob says any day now he’s liable to drop in and surprise us - him and the Captain. It’ll certainly look natural to see him around the farm again.
#MRS. ATKINS.
Let’s hope the farm’ll look more natural, too, when he’s had a hand at it. The way thin’s are now!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Will you stop harping on that, Ma? We all know things aren’t as they might be. What’s the good of your complaining all the time?
#MRS. ATKINS.
There, Kate Mayo! Ain’t that just what I told you? I can’t say a word of advice to my own daughter even, she’s that stubborn and self - willed.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
For goodness sakes, Ma!
#MRS. MAYO.
Never mind. Andy’ll fix everything when he comes.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, yes, I know he will. He always did know just the right thing ought to be done. It’s a shame for him to come home and have to start in with things in such a topsy - turvy.
#MRS. MAYO.
Andy’ll manage.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I s’pose it isn’t Rob’s fault things go wrong with him.
#MRS. ATKINS.
Hump! Land o’ Goshen, but it’s bakin’ in here! Let’s go out in under the trees in back where there’s a breath of fresh air. Come, Kate. You better come too, Ruth. It’ll do you good. Learn him a lesson and let him get his own dinner. Don’t be such a fool.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He wouldn’t mind. He doesn’t eat much. But I can’t go anyway. I’ve got to put baby to bed.
#MRS. ATKINS.
Let’s go, Kate. I’m boilin’ in here.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Come and let me take off your shoes and stockings, Mary, that’s a good girl. You’ve got to take your nap now.
#ROBERT.
Phew! The sun’s hot today!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Why don’t you shave? You look awful.
#ROBERT.
I forgot - and it’s too much trouble this weather.
#MARY.
Dada! Dada!
#ROBERT.
And how’s this little girl of mine this hot day, eh?
#MARY.
Dada! Dada!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Don’t do that to her! You know it’s time for her nap and you’ll get her all waked up; then I’ll be the one that’ll have to sit beside her till she falls asleep.
#ROBERT.
You needn’t bother. I’ll put her to bed.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You’ve got to get back to your work, I s’pose.
#ROBERT.
Yes, I was forgetting. Reading Andy’s letter again? I should think you’d know it by heart by this time.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I’ve got a right to read it, haven’t I? He says it’s meant for all of us.
#ROBERT.
Right? Don’t be so silly. There’s no question of right. I was only saying that you must know all that’s in it after so many readings.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Well, I don’t. I s’pose you’ll be wanting your dinner now.
#ROBERT.
I don’t care. I’m not hungry.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And here I been keeping it hot for you!
#ROBERT.
Oh, all right then. Bring it in and I’ll try to eat.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I’ve got to get her to bed first. Come, dear. It’s after time and you can hardly keep your eyes open now.
#MARY.
No, no! Dada! No!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
There! Now see what you’ve done! I told you not to -
#ROBERT.
Let her alone, then. She’s all right where she is. She’ll fall asleep on my lap in a minute if you’ll stop bothering her.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
She’ll not do any such thing! She’s got to learn to mind me! You naughty child! Will you come with Mama when she tells you for your own good?
#MARY.
No, Dada!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
A good spanking’s what you need, my young lady - and you’ll get one from me if you don’t mind better, d’you hear?
#ROBERT.
Leave her alone! How often have I told you not to threaten her with whipping? I won’t have it. There! There, little girl! Baby mustn’t cry. Dada won’t like you if you do. Dada’ll hold you and you must promise to go to sleep like a good little girl. Will you when Dada asks you?
#MARY.
Yes, Dada.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
A fine one you are to be telling folks how to do things! All right, take care of her then, if you think it’s so easy.
#ROBERT.
We’ll show Mama you’re a good little girl, won’t we?
#MARY.
Dada, Dada.
#ROBERT.
Let’s see: Does your mother take off your shoes and stockings before your nap?
#MARY.
Yes, Dada.
#ROBERT.
We’ll show Mama we know how to do those things, won’t we? There’s one old shoe off - and there’s the other old shoe - and here’s one old stocking - and there’s the other old stocking. There we are, all nice and cool and comfy. And now will you promise to go right to sleep if Dada takes you to bed? That’s the good little girl.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
For heaven’s sakes, put down that old book! Don’t you see your dinner’s getting cold?
#ROBERT.
Excuse me, Ruth. I didn’t notice.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I should think you might have some feeling for me, Rob, and not always be late for meals. If you think it’s fun sweltering in that oven of a kitchen to keep things warm for you, you’re mistaken.
#ROBERT.
I’m sorry, Ruth, really I am. Something crops up every day to delay me. I mean to be here on time.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Mean - tos don’t count.
#ROBERT.
Then punish me, Ruth. Let the food get cold and don’t bother about me.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I’d have to wait just the same to wash up after you.
#ROBERT.
But I can wash up. nice mess there’d be then!
#ROBERT.
The food is lucky to be able to get cold this weather.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And besides, you’ve got your own work that’s got to be done.
#ROBERT.
Yes, of course.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Work you’ll never get done by reading books all the time.
#ROBERT.
Why do you persist in nagging at me for getting pleasure out of reading? Is it because -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Because I’m too stupid to understand them, I s’pose you were going to say.
#ROBERT.
No - no. Why do you goad me into saying things I don’t mean? Haven’t I got my share of troubles trying to work this cursed farm without your adding to them? You know how hard I’ve tried to keep things going in spite of bad luck -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Bad luck!
#ROBERT.
And my own very apparent unfitness for the job, I was going to add; but you can’t deny there’s been bad luck to it, too. Why don’t you take things into consideration? Why can’t we pull together? We used to. I know it’s hard on you also. Then why can’t we help each other instead of hindering?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I do the best I know how.
#ROBERT.
I know you do. But let’s both of us try to do better. We can both improve. Say a word of encouragement once in a while when things go wrong, even if it is my fault. You know the odds I’ve been up against since Pa died. I’m not a farmer. I’ve never claimed to be one. But there’s nothing else I can do under the circumstances, and I’ve got to pull things through somehow. With your help, I can do it. With you against me - So you promise that; and I’ll promise to be here when the clock strikes - and anything else you tell me to. Is it a bargain?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I s’pose so. There’s someone at the kitchen door. It’s Ben.
#ROBERT.
What’s the trouble now, I wonder? Come on in here, Ben. Well, Ben, what’s the matter?
#BEN.
The mowin’ machine’s bust.
#ROBERT.
Why, that can’t be. The man fixed it only last week.
#BEN.
It’s bust just the same.
#ROBERT.
And can’t you fix it?
#BEN.
No. Don’t know what’s the matter with the goll - darned thing. ’Twon’t work, anyhow.
#ROBERT.
Wait a minute and I’ll go look it over. There can’t be much the matter with it.
#BEN.
Don’t make no diff’rence t’ me whether there be or not. I’m quittin’.
#ROBERT.
You don’t mean you’re throwing up your job here?
#BEN.
That’s what! My month’s up today and I want what’s owin’ t’ me.
#ROBERT.
But why are you quitting now, Ben, when you know I’ve so much work on hand? I’ll have a hard time getting another man at such short notice.
#BEN.
That’s for you to figger. I’m quittin’.
#ROBERT.
But what’s your reason? You haven’t any complaint to make about the way you’ve been treated, have you?
#BEN.
No. ’Tain’t that. Look - a - here. I’m sick o’ being made fun at, that’s what; an’ I got a job up to Timms’ place; an’ I’m quittin’ here.
#ROBERT.
Being made fun of? I don’t understand you. Who’s making fun of you?
#BEN.
They all do. When I drive down with the milk in the mornin’ they all laughs and jokes at me - that boy up to Harris’ and the new feller up to Slocum’s, and Bill Evans down to Meade’s, and all the rest on ’em.
#ROBERT.
That’s a queer reason for leaving me flat. Won’t they laugh at you just the same when you’re working for Timms?
#BEN.
They wouldn’t dare to. Timms is the best farm hereabouts. They was laughin’ at me for workin’ for you, that’s what! “How’re things up to the Mayo place?” they hollers every mornin’. “What’s Robert doin’ now - pasturin’ the cattle in the cornlot? Is he seasonin’ his hay with rain this year, same as last?” they shouts. “Or is he inventin’ some ’lectrical milkin’ engine to fool them dry cows o’ his into givin’ hard cider?” That’s like they talks; and I ain’t goin’ to put up with it no longer. Everyone’s always knowed me as a first - class hand hereabouts, and I ain’t wantin’ ’em to get no different notion. So I’m quittin’ you. And I wants what’s comin’ to me.
#ROBERT.
Oh, if that’s the case, you can go to the devil. You’ll get your money tomorrow when I get back from town - not before!
#BEN.
That suits me. And see that I do get it, or there’ll be trouble.
#ROBERT.
The stupid damn fool! And now what about the haying? That’s an example of what I’m up against. No one can say I’m responsible for that.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He wouldn’t dare act that way with anyone else! It’s lucky Andy’s coming back.
#ROBERT.
Yes, Andy’ll see the right thing to do in a jiffy. I wonder if the old chump’s changed much? He doesn’t seem to from his letters, does he? But just the same I doubt if he’ll want to settle down to a hum - drum farm life, after all he’s been through.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Andy’s not like you. He likes the farm.
#ROBERT.
Gad, the things he’s seen and experienced! Think of the places he’s been! All the wonderful far places I used to dream about! God, how I envy him! What a trip!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I s’pose you’re sorry now you didn’t go?
#ROBERT.
Oh, those cursed hills out there that I used to think promised me so much! How I’ve grown to hate the sight of them! They’re like the walls of a narrow prison yard shutting me in from all the freedom and wonder of life! Sometimes I think if it wasn’t for you, Ruth, and - little Mary, I’d chuck everything up and walk down the road with just one desire in my heart - to put the whole rim of the world between me and those hills, and be able to breathe freely once more! There I go dreaming again - my old fool dreams.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You’re not the only one!
#ROBERT.
And Andy, who’s had the chance - what has he got out of it? His letters read like the diary of a - of a farmer! “We’re in Singapore now. It’s a dirty hole of a place and hotter than hell. Two of the crew are down with fever and we’re short - handed on the work. I’ll be damn glad when we sail again, although tacking back and forth in these blistering seas is a rotten job too!” That’s about the way he summed up his impressions of the East.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You needn’t make fun of Andy.
#ROBERT.
When I think - but what’s the use? You know I wasn’t making fun of Andy personally, but his attitude toward things is -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You was too making fun of him! And I ain’t going to stand for it! You ought to be ashamed of yourself! A fine one to talk about anyone else - after the way you’ve ruined everything with your lazy loafing! - and the stupid way you do things!
#ROBERT.
Stop that kind of talk, do you hear?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You findin’ fault - with your own brother who’s ten times the man you ever was or ever will be! You’re jealous, that’s what! Jealous because he’s made a man of himself, while you’re nothing but a - but a -
#ROBERT.
Ruth! Ruth! You’ll be sorry for talking like that.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I won’t! I won’t never be sorry! I’m only saying what I’ve been thinking for years.
#ROBERT.
Ruth! You can’t mean that!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
What do you think - living with a man like you - having to suffer all the time because you’ve never been man enough to work and do things like other people. But no! You never own up to that. You think you’re so much better than other folks, with your college education, where you never learned a thing, and always reading your stupid books instead of working. I s’pose you think I ought to be proud to be your wife - a poor, ignorant thing like me! But I’m not. I hate it! I hate the sight of you. Oh, if I’d only known! If I hadn’t been such a fool to listen to your cheap, silly, poetry talk that you learned out of books! If I could have seen how you were in your true self - like you are now - I’d have killed myself before I’d have married you! I was sorry for it before we’d been together a month. I knew what you were really like - when it was too late.
#ROBERT.
And now - I’m finding out what you’re really like - what a - a creature I’ve been living with. God! It wasn’t that I haven’t guessed how mean and small you are - but I’ve kept on telling myself that I must be wrong - like a fool! - like a damned fool!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You were saying you’d go out on the road if it wasn’t for me. Well, you can go, and the sooner the better! I don’t care! I’ll be glad to get rid of you! The farm’ll be better off too. There’s been a curse on it ever since you took hold. So go! Go and be a tramp like you’ve always wanted. It’s all you’re good for. I can get along without you, don’t you worry. Andy’s coming back, don’t forget that! He’ll attend to things like they should be. He’ll show what a man can do! I don’t need you. Andy’s coming!
#ROBERT.
What do you mean? What are you thinking of? What’s in your evil mind, you - you -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes I do mean it! I’d say it if you was to kill me! I do love Andy. I do! I do! I always loved him. And he loves me! He loves me! I know he does. He always did! And you know he did, too! So go! Go if you want to!
#ROBERT.
You - you slut!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Andy! Andy!
#ROBERT.
Stop! I’ll meet Andy. You better go in to Mary, Ruth.
#ANDY’S VOICE.
Ahoy there, Rob!
#ROBERT.
Hello, Andy!
#MARY.
Dada sick?
#ROBERT.
No, dear. Why?
#MARY.
Play wif Mary.
#ROBERT.
No, dear, not today. Dada doesn’t feel like playing today.
#MARY.
Yes, Dada!
#ROBERT.
No, dear. Dada does feel sick - a little. He’s got a bad headache.
#MARY.
Mary see. Bad head.
#ROBERT.
There! It’s better now, dear, thank you. Would you like Dada to go away? - far, far away?
#MARY.
No! No! No, Dada, no!
#ROBERT.
Don’t you like Uncle Andy - the man that came yesterday - not the old man with the white mustache - the other?
#MARY.
Mary loves Dada.
#ROBERT.
He won’t go away, baby. He was only joking. He couldn’t leave his little Mary.
#MARY.
Oh! Hurt!
#ROBERT.
I’m sorry, little girl. Go play with Dolly, that’s a good girl; and be careful to keep in the shade.
#MARY.
Mans, Dada.
#ROBERT.
It’s your Uncle Andy.
#ANDREW.
Here you are, eh?
#ROBERT.
Hello, Andy.
#ANDREW.
And who’s this young lady I find you all alone with, eh? Who’s this pretty young lady? Upsy - daisy! And there you are! Ruth told me I’d probably find you up top - side here; but I’d have guessed it, anyway. Still up to your old tricks, you old beggar! I can remember how you used to come up here to mope and dream in the old days.
#ROBERT.
I come up here now because it’s the coolest place on the farm. I’ve given up dreaming.
#ANDREW.
I don’t believe it. You can’t have changed that much. Say, it sure brings back old times to be up here with you having a chin all by our lonesomes again. I feel great being back home.
#ROBERT.
It’s great for us to have you back.
#ANDREW.
I’ve been looking over the old place with Ruth. Things don’t seem to be -
#ROBERT.
Never mind the damn farm! Let’s talk about something interesting. This is the first chance I’ve had to have a word with you alone. Tell me about your trip.
#ANDREW.
Why, I thought I told you everything in my letters.
#ROBERT.
Your letters were - sketchy, to say the least.
#ANDREW.
Oh, I know I’m no author. You needn’t be afraid of hurting my feelings. I’d rather go through a typhoon again than write a letter.
#ROBERT.
Then you were through a typhoon?
#ANDREW.
Yes - in the China sea. Had to run before it under bare poles for two days. I thought we were bound down for Davy Jones, sure. Never dreamed waves could get so big or the wind blow so hard. If it hadn’t been for Uncle Dick being such a good skipper we’d have gone to the sharks, all of us. As it was we came out minus a main top - mast and had to beat back to Hong - Kong for repairs. But I must have written you all this.
#ROBERT.
You never mentioned it.
#ANDREW.
Well, there was so much dirty work getting things ship - shape again I must have forgotten about it.
#ROBERT.
Forget a typhoon? You’re a strange combination, Andy. And is what you’ve told me all you remember about it?
#ANDREW.
Oh, I could give you your bellyful of details if I wanted to turn loose on you. It was all - wool - and - a - yard - wide - Hell, I’ll tell you. You ought to have been there. I remember thinking about you at the worst of it, and saying to myself: “This’d cure Rob of them ideas of his about the beautiful sea, if he could see it.” And it would have too, you bet!
#ROBERT.
The sea doesn’t seem to have impressed you very favorably.
#ANDREW.
I should say it didn’t! I’ll never set foot on a ship again if I can help it - except to carry me some place I can’t get to by train.
#ROBERT.
But you studied to become an officer!
#ANDREW.
Had to do something or I’d gone mad. The days were like years. And as for the East you used to rave about - well, you ought to see it, and smell it! One walk down one of their filthy narrow streets with the tropic sun beating on it would sicken you for life with the “wonder and mystery” you used to dream of.
#ROBERT.
So all you found in the East was a stench?
#ANDREW.
A stench! Ten thousand of them!
#ROBERT.
But you did like some of the places, judging from your letters - Sydney, Buenos Aires -
#ANDREW.
Yes, Sydney’s a good town. But Buenos Aires - there’s the place for you. Argentine’s a country where a fellow has a chance to make good. You’re right I like it. And I’ll tell you, Rob, that’s right where I’m going just as soon as I’ve seen you folks a while and can get a ship. I can get a berth as second officer, and I’ll jump the ship when I get there. I’ll need every cent of the wages Uncle’s paid me to get a start at something in B. A.
#ROBERT.
So you’re not going to stay on the farm?
#ANDREW.
Why sure not! Did you think I was? There wouldn’t be any sense. One of us is enough to run this little place.
#ROBERT.
I suppose it does seem small to you now.
#ANDREW.
You’ve no idea, Rob, what a splendid place Argentine is. I had a letter from a marine insurance chap that I’d made friends with in Hong - Kong to his brother, who’s in the grain business in Buenos Aires. He took quite a fancy to me, and what’s more important, he offered me a job if I’d come back there. I’d have taken it on the spot, only I couldn’t leave Uncle Dick in the lurch, and I’d promised you folks to come home. But I’m going back there, you bet, and then you watch me get on! But don’t you think it’s a big chance, Rob?
#ROBERT.
It’s fine - for you, Andy.
#ANDREW.
We call this a farm - but you ought to hear about the farms down there - ten square miles where we’ve got an acre. It’s a new country where big things are opening up - and I want to get in on something big before I die. I’m no fool when it comes to farming, and I know something about grain. I’ve been reading up a lot on it, too, lately. Wake up, you old poetry book worm, you! I know my talking about business makes you want to choke me, doesn’t it?
#ROBERT.
No, Andy, I - I just happened to think of something else. There’ve been lots of times lately that I’ve wished I had some of your faculty for business.
#ANDREW.
There’s something I want to talk about, Rob, - the farm. You don’t mind, do you?
#ROBERT.
No.
#ANDREW.
I walked over it this morning with Ruth - and she told me about things - I could see the place had run down; but you mustn’t blame yourself. When luck’s against anyone -
#ROBERT.
Don’t, Andy! It is my fault. You know it as well as I do. The best I’ve ever done was to make ends meet.
#ANDREW.
I’ve got over a thousand saved, and you can have that.
#ROBERT.
No. You need that for your start in Buenos Aires.
#ANDREW.
I don’t. I can -
#ROBERT.
No, Andy! Once and for all, no! I won’t hear of it!
#ANDREW.
You obstinate old son of a gun!
#ROBERT.
Oh, everything’ll be on a sound footing after harvest. Don’t worry about it.
#ANDREW.
Maybe. It’s too bad Pa couldn’t have lived to see things through. It cut me up a lot - hearing he was dead. He never - softened up, did he - about me, I mean?
#ROBERT.
He never understood, that’s a kinder way of putting it. He does now.
#ANDREW.
You’ve forgotten all about what - caused me to go, haven’t you, Rob? I was a slushier damn fool in those days than you were. But it was an act of Providence I did go. It opened my eyes to how I’d been fooling myself. Why, I’d forgotten all about - that - before I’d been at sea six months.
#ROBERT.
You’re speaking of - Ruth?
#ANDREW.
Yes. I didn’t want you to get false notions in your head, or I wouldn’t say anything. I’m telling you the truth when I say I’d forgotten long ago. It don’t sound well for me, getting over things so easy, but I guess it never really amounted to more than a kid idea I was letting rule me. I’m certain now I never was in love - I was getting fun out of thinking I was - and being a hero to myself. There! Gosh, I’m glad that’s off my chest. I’ve been feeling sort of awkward ever since I’ve been home, thinking of what you two might think. You’ve got it all straight now, haven’t you, Rob?
#ROBERT.
Yes, Andy.
#ANDREW.
And I’ll tell Ruth, too, if I can get up the nerve. She must feel kind of funny having me round - after what used to be - and not knowing how I feel about it.
#ROBERT.
Perhaps - for her sake - you’d better not tell her.
#ANDREW.
For her sake? Oh, you mean she wouldn’t want to be reminded of my foolishness? Still, I think it’d be worse if -
#ROBERT.
Do as you please, Andy; but for God’s sake, let’s not talk about it! Excuse me, Andy. This rotten headache has my nerves shot to pieces.
#ANDREW.
It’s all right, Rob - long as you’re not sore at me.
#ROBERT.
Where did Uncle Dick disappear to this morning?
#ANDREW.
He went down to the port to see to things on the Sunda. He said he didn’t know exactly when he’d be back. I’ll have to go down and tend to the ship when he comes. That’s why I dressed up in these togs.
#MARY.
See! Mama! Mama!
#MARY.
Mama!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Hello, dear! Jake wants to see you about something. He finished working where he was. He’s waiting for you at the road.
#ROBERT.
I’ll go down right away.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And take Mary with you, please. Go with Dada, that’s a good girl. Grandma has your dinner most ready for you.
#ROBERT.
Come, Mary!
#MARY.
Dada! Dada! I’m going to sit down. Come on, Andy. It’ll be like old times. It’s so fine and cool up here after the house.
#ANDREW.
Yes. It’s great.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I’ve taken a holiday in honor of your arrival. I feel so free I’d like to have wings and fly over the sea. You’re a man. You can’t know how awful and stupid it is - cooking and washing dishes all the time.
#ANDREW.
I can guess.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Besides, your mother just insisted on getting your first dinner to home, she’s that happy at having you back. You’d think I was planning to poison you the flurried way she shooed me out of the kitchen.
#ANDREW.
That’s just like Ma, bless her!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
She’s missed you terrible. We all have. And you can’t deny the farm has, after what I showed you and told you when we was looking over the place this morning.
#ANDREW.
Things are run down, that’s a fact! It’s too darn hard on poor old Rob.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It’s his own fault. He never takes any interest in things.
#ANDREW.
You can’t blame him. He wasn’t born for it; but I know he’s done his best for your sake and the old folks and the little girl.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, I suppose he has. But thank the Lord, all those days are over now. The “hard luck” Rob’s always blaming won’t last long when you take hold, Andy. All the farm’s ever needed was someone with the knack of looking ahead and preparing for what’s going to happen.
#ANDREW.
Yes, Rob hasn’t got that. He’s frank to own up to that himself. I’m going to try and hire a good man for him - an experienced farmer - to work the place on a salary and percentage. That’ll take it off of Rob’s hands, and he needn’t be worrying himself to death any more. He looks all worn out, Ruth. He ought to be careful.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, I s’pose. Why do you want to hire a man to oversee things? Seems as if now that you’re back it wouldn’t be needful.
#ANDREW.
Oh, of course I’ll attend to everything while I’m here. I mean after I’m gone.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Gone!
#ANDREW.
Yes. When I leave for the Argentine again.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You’re going away to sea!
#ANDREW.
Not to sea, no; I’m through with the sea for good as a job. I’m going down to Buenos Aires to get in the grain business.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But - that’s far off - isn’t it?
#ANDREW.
Six thousand miles more or less. It’s quite a trip. I’ve got a peach of a chance down there, Ruth. Ask Rob if I haven’t. I’ve just been telling him all about it.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And didn’t he try to stop you from going?
#ANDREW.
No, of course not. Why?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
That’s just like him - not to.
#ANDREW.
Rob’s too good a chum to try and stop me when he knows I’m set on a thing. And he could see just as soon’s I told him what a good chance it was.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And you’re bound on going?
#ANDREW.
Sure thing. Oh, I don’t mean right off. I’ll have to wait for a ship sailing there for quite a while, likely. Anyway, I want to stay to home and visit with you folks a spell before I go.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I s’pose. Oh, Andy, you can’t go! You can’t. Why we’ve all thought - we’ve all been hoping and praying you was coming home to stay, to settle down on the farm and see to things. You mustn’t go! Think of how your Ma’ll take on if you go - and how the farm’ll be ruined if you leave it to Rob to look after. You can see that.
#ANDREW.
Rob hasn’t done so bad. When I get a man to direct things the farm’ll be safe enough.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But your Ma - think of her.
#ANDREW.
She’s used to me being away. She won’t object when she knows it’s best for her and all of us for me to go. You ask Rob. In a couple of years down there I’ll make my pile, see if I don’t; and then I’ll come back and settle down and turn this farm into the crackiest place in the whole state. In the meantime, I can help you both from down there. I tell you, Ruth, I’m going to make good right from the minute I land, if working hard and a determination to get on can do it; and I know they can! I tell you, I feel ripe for bigger things than settling down here. The trip did that for me, anyway. It showed me the world is a larger proposition than ever I thought it was in the old days. I couldn’t be content any more stuck here like a fly in molasses. It all seems trifling, somehow. You ought to be able to understand what I feel.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes - I s’pose I ought. What did Rob tell you - about me?
#ANDREW.
Tell? About you? Why, nothing.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Are you telling me the truth, Andy Mayo? Didn’t he say - I -
#ANDREW.
No, he didn’t mention you, I can remember. Why? What made you think he did?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, I wish I could tell if you’re lying or not!
#ANDREW.
What’re you talking about? I didn’t used to lie to you, did I? And what in the name of God is there to lie for?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Are you sure - will you swear - it isn’t the reason - The same reason that made you go last time that’s driving you away again? ’Cause if it is - I was going to say - you mustn’t go - on that account.
#ANDREW.
Oh, is that what you’re driving at? Well, you needn’t worry about that no more - I don’t blame you, Ruth, feeling embarrassed having me around again, after the way I played the dumb fool about going away last time.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, Andy!
#ANDREW.
I know I oughtn’t to talk about such foolishness to you. Still I figure it’s better to get it out of my system so’s we three can be together same’s years ago, and not be worried thinking one of us might have the wrong notion.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Andy! Please! Don’t!
#ANDREW.
Let me finish now that I’ve started. It’ll help clear things up. I don’t want you to think once a fool always a fool, and be upset all the time I’m here on my fool account. I want you to believe I put all that silly nonsense back of me a long time ago - and now - it seems - well - as if you’d always been my sister, that’s what, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
For God’s sake, Andy - won’t you please stop talking!
#ANDREW.
Seem’s if I put my foot in it whenever I open my mouth today. Rob shut me up with almost the same words when I tried speaking to him about it.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You told him - what you’ve told me?
#ANDREW.
Why sure! Why not?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, my God!
#ANDREW.
Why? Shouldn’t I have?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, I don’t care what you do! I don’t care! Leave me alone!
#ANDREW.
Hello! Here they come back - and the Captain’s with them. How’d he come to get back so soon, I wonder? That means I’ve got to hustle down to the port and get on board. Rob’s got the baby with him. Gosh, I never saw a father so tied up in a kid as Rob is! He just watches every move she makes. And I don’t blame him. You both got a right to feel proud of her. She’s surely a little winner. I can see the likeness to Rob standing out all over her, can’t you? But there’s no denying she’s your young one, either. There’s something about her eyes -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, Andy, I’ve a headache! I don’t want to talk! Leave me alone, won’t you please?
#ANDREW.
: Everybody hereabouts seems to be on edge today. I begin to feel as if I’m not wanted around.
#MARY.
Mama! Mama!
#SCOTT.
Phew! I got great news for you, Andy. Let me get my wind first. Phew! God A’mighty, mountin’ this damned hill is worser’n goin’ aloft to the skys’l yard in a blow. I got to lay to a while.
#ANDREW.
I didn’t look for you this soon, Uncle.
#SCOTT.
I didn’t figger it, neither; but I run across a bit o’ news down to the Seamen’s Home made me ’bout ship and set all sail back here to find you.
#ANDREW.
What is it, Uncle?
#SCOTT.
Passin’ by the Home I thought I’d drop in an’ let ’em know I’d be lackin’ a mate next trip count o’ your leavin’. Their man in charge o’ the shippin’ asked after you ’special curious. “Do you think he’d consider a berth as Second on a steamer, Captain?” he asks. I was goin’ to say no when I thinks o’ you wantin’ to get back down south to the Plate agen; so I asks him: “What is she and where’s she bound?” “She’s the El Paso, a brand new tramp,” he says, “and she’s bound for Buenos Aires.”
#ANDREW.
Gosh, that is luck! When does she sail?
#SCOTT.
Tomorrow mornin’. I didn’t know if you’d want to ship away agen so quick an’ I told him so. “Tell him I’ll hold the berth open for him until late this afternoon,” he says. So there you be, an’ you can make your own choice.
#ANDREW.
I’d like to take it. There may not be another ship for Buenos Aires with a vacancy in months. Still - damn it all - tomorrow morning is soon. I wish she wasn’t leaving for a week or so. That’d give me a chance - it seems hard to go right away again when I’ve just got home. And yet it’s a chance in a thousand - What do you think, Rob? What would you do?
#ROBERT.
He who hesitates, you know. It’s a piece of good luck thrown in your way - and - I think you owe it to yourself to jump at it. But don’t ask me to decide for you.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, go, Andy!
#ANDREW.
Yes, I guess I will. It’ll be the best thing for all of us in the end, don’t you think so, Rob?
#SCOTT.
Then, that’s settled.
#ANDREW.
Yes, I’ll take the berth. The sooner I go the sooner I’ll be back, that’s a certainty; and I won’t come back with empty hands next time. You bet I won’t!
#SCOTT.
You ain’t got so much time, Andy. To make sure you’d best leave here soon’s you kin. I got to get right back aboard. You’d best come with me.
#ANDREW.
I’ll go to the house and repack my bag right away.
#ROBERT.
You’ll both be here for dinner, won’t you?
#ANDREW.
I don’t know. Will there be time? What time is it now, I wonder?
#ROBERT.
Ma’s been getting dinner especially for you, Andy.
#ANDREW.
Hell! And I was forgetting! Of course I’ll stay for dinner if I missed every damned ship in the world. Come on, Uncle. Walk down with me to the house and you can tell me more about this berth on the way. I’ve got to pack before dinner. You’re coming soon, aren’t you, Rob?
#ROBERT.
Yes. I’ll be right down.
#MARY.
Dada, Mama’s cryin’, Dada.
#ROBERT.
No, she isn’t, little girl. The sun hurts her eyes, that’s all. Aren’t you beginning to feel hungry, Mary?
#MARY.
Yes, Dada.
#ROBERT.
It must be your dinner time now.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I’m coming, Mary. Come on and I’ll get your dinner for you.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
S - s - s - h - ! Ma’s asleep.
#ROBERT.
I won’t wake her.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You better come near the fire where it’s warm.
#ROBERT.
No. I’m burning up now.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
That’s the fever. You know the doctor told you not to get up and move round.
#ROBERT.
That old fossil! He doesn’t know anything. Go to bed and stay there - that’s his only prescription.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
How are you feeling now?
#ROBERT.
Better! Much better than I’ve felt in ages. Really I’m fine now - only very weak. It’s the turning point, I guess. From now on I’ll pick up so quick I’ll surprise you - and no thanks to that old fool of a country quack, either.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He’s always tended to us.
#ROBERT.
Always helped us to die, you mean! He “tended” to Pa and Ma and - and to - Mary.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He did the best he knew, I s’pose. Well, Andy’s bringing a specialist with him when he comes. That ought to suit you.
#ROBERT.
Is that why you’re waiting up all night?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes.
#ROBERT.
For Andy?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Somebody had got to. It’s only right for someone to meet him after he’s been gone five years.
#ROBERT.
Five years! It’s a long time.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes.
#ROBERT.
To wait!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It’s past now.
#ROBERT.
Yes, it’s past. Have you got his two telegrams with you? Let me see them, will you? My head was so full of fever when they came I couldn’t make head or tail to them. But I’m feeling fine now. Let me read them again.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Here. The first one’s on top.
#ROBERT.
New York. “Just landed from steamer. Have important business to wind up here. Will be home as soon as deal is completed.” Business first was always Andy’s motto “Hope you are all well. Andy.” “Hope you are all well!”
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He couldn’t know you’d been took sick till I answered that and told him.
#ROBERT.
Of course he couldn’t. I’m a fool. I’m touchy about nothing lately. Just what did you say in your reply?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I had to send it collect.
#ROBERT.
What did you say was the matter with me?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I wrote you had lung trouble.
#ROBERT.
You are a fool! How often have I explained to you that it’s pleurisy is the matter with me. You can’t seem to get it in your head that the pleura is outside the lungs, not in them!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I only wrote what Doctor Smith told me.
#ROBERT.
He’s a damned ignoramus!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Makes no difference. I had to tell Andy something, didn’t I?
#ROBERT.
He sent this last evening. Let’s see. “Leave for home on midnight train. Just received your wire. Am bringing specialist to see Rob. Will motor to farm from Port.” What time is it now?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Round six, must be.
#ROBERT.
He ought to be here soon. I’m glad he’s bringing a doctor who knows something. A specialist will tell you in a second that there’s nothing the matter with my lungs.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You’ve been coughing an awful lot lately.
#ROBERT.
What nonsense! For God’s sake, haven’t you ever had a bad cold yourself? Your mother is lucky to be able to sleep so soundly.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Ma’s tired. She’s been sitting up with me most of the night.
#ROBERT.
Is she waiting for Andy, too? I couldn’t get to sleep to save my soul. I counted ten million sheep if I counted one. No use! I gave up trying finally and just laid there in the dark thinking. I was thinking about you, Ruth - of how hard these last years must have been for you. I’m sorry, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I don’t know. They’re past now. They were hard on all of us.
#ROBERT.
Yes; on all of us but Andy. Andy’s made a big success of himself - the kind he wanted. And now he’s coming home to let us admire his greatness. What am I talking about? My brain must be sick, too. Yes, these years have been terrible for both of us. Especially the last eight months since Mary - died. Our last hope of happiness! I could curse God from the bottom of my soul - if there was a God!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Mary’s better off - being dead.
#ROBERT.
We’d all be better off for that matter. You tell that mother of yours she’s got to stop saying that Mary’s death was due to a weak constitution inherited from me. It’s got to stop, I tell you!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
S - h - h! You’ll wake her; and then she’ll nag at me - not you.
#ROBERT.
It’s all because your mother’s down on me for not begging Andy for help.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You might have. He’s got plenty.
#ROBERT.
How can you of all people think of taking money from him?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I don’t see the harm. He’s your own brother.
#ROBERT.
What’s the use of talking to you? Well, I couldn’t. And I’ve managed to keep things going, thank God. You can’t deny that without help I’ve succeeded in - My God, what am I boasting of? Debts to this one and that, taxes, interest unpaid! I’m a fool! I’ll be frank, Ruth. I’ve been an utter failure, and I’ve dragged you with me. I couldn’t blame you in all justice - for hating me.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I don’t hate you. It’s been my fault too, I s’pose.
#ROBERT.
No. You couldn’t help loving - Andy.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I don’t love anyone.
#ROBERT.
You needn’t deny it. It doesn’t matter. Do you know Ruth, what I’ve been dreaming back there in the dark? I was planning our future when I get well. After all, why shouldn’t we have a future? We’re young yet. If we can only shake off the curse of this farm! It’s the farm that’s ruined our lives, damn it! And now that Andy’s coming back - I’m going to sink my foolish pride, Ruth! I’ll borrow the money from him to give us a good start in the city. We’ll go where people live instead of stagnating, and start all over again. I won’t be the failure there that I’ve been here, Ruth. You won’t need to be ashamed of me there. I’ll prove to you the reading I’ve done can be put to some use. I’ll write, or something of that sort. I’ve always wanted to write. You’ll want to do that, won’t you, Ruth?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
There’s Ma.
#ROBERT.
She can come with us.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
She wouldn’t.
#ROBERT.
So that’s your answer! You’re lying, Ruth! Your mother’s just an excuse. You want to stay here. You think that because Andy’s coming back that -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
What’s the matter? I’ll go with you, Rob. Stop that coughing for goodness’ sake! It’s awful bad for you. I’ll go with you to the city - soon’s you’re well again. Honest I will, Rob, I promise! Do you feel better now?
#ROBERT.
Yes. Then you will go, Ruth?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes.
#ROBERT.
We’ll make a new start, Ruth - just you and I. Life owes us some happiness after what we’ve been through. It must! Otherwise our suffering would be meaningless - and that is unthinkable.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, yes, of course, Rob, but you mustn’t -
#ROBERT.
Oh, don’t be afraid. I feel completely well, really I do - now that I can hope again. Oh if you knew how glorious it feels to have something to look forward to! Can’t you feel the thrill of it, too - the vision of a new life opening up after all the horrible years?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, yes, but do be -
#ROBERT.
Nonsense! I won’t be careful. I’m getting back all my strength. See! I feel light as a feather. One kiss - the first in years, isn’t it? - to greet the dawn of a new life together.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Sit down, Rob, for goodness’ sake!
#ROBERT.
I won’t sit down. You’re silly to worry. Listen. All our suffering has been a test through which we had to pass to prove ourselves worthy of a finer realization. And we did pass through it! It hasn’t broken us! And now the dream is to come true! Don’t you see?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, Rob, I see; but won’t you go back to bed now and rest?
#ROBERT.
No. I’m going to see the sun rise. It’s an augury of good fortune. No sun yet. It isn’t time. All I can see is the black rim of the damned hills outlined against a creeping grayness. That’s not a very happy augury, is it? But the sun’ll come - soon.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Please go to bed, won’t you, Rob? You don’t want to be all wore out when the specialist comes, do you?
#ROBERT.
No. That’s right. He mustn’t think I’m sicker than I am. And I feel as if I could sleep now - a good, sound, restful sleep.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
That’s what you need most. I’ll shut this door so’s you’ll be quiet. Ma! Ma! Wake up!
#MRS. ATKINS.
Glory be! What’s the matter with you?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It was Rob. He’s just been talking to me out here. I put him back to bed. He acted - funny; and his eyes looked so - so wild like.
#MRS. ATKINS.
And is that all you woke me out of a sound sleep for, and scared me near out of my wits?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I was afraid. He talked so crazy. I couldn’t quiet him. I didn’t want to be alone with him that way. Lord knows what he might do.
#MRS. ATKINS.
Humph! A help I’d be to you and me not able to move a step! Why didn’t you run and get Jake?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Jake isn’t here. He quit last night. He hasn’t been paid in three months.
#MRS. ATKINS.
I can’t blame him. What decent person’d want to work on a place like this? Oh, I wish you’d never married that man!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You oughtn’t to talk about him now when he’s sick in his bed.
#MRS. ATKINS.
You know very well, Ruth Mayo, if it wasn’t for me helpin’ you on the sly out of my savin’s, you’d both been in the poor house - and all ’count of his pigheaded pride in not lettin’ Andy know the state thin’s were in. A nice thin’ for me to have to support him out of what I’d saved for my last days - and me an invalid with no one to look to!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Andy’ll pay you back, Ma. I can tell him so’s Rob’ll never know.
#MRS. ATKINS.
What’d Rob think you and him was livin’ on, I’d like to know?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He didn’t think about it, I s’pose. He said he’d made up his mind to ask Andy for help when he comes. Six o’clock. Andy ought to get here directly.
#MRS. ATKINS.
D’you think this special doctor’ll do Rob any good?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I don’t know.
#MRS. ATKINS.
For goodness’ sake put some wood on that fire. I’m most freezin’!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Don’t talk so loud. Let him sleep if he can. This is the last of the wood. I don’t know who’ll cut more now that Jake’s left. It’s getting gray out. Looks like it’d be a nice day. Must’ve been a heavy frost last night. We’re paying for the spell of warm weather we’ve been having.
#MRS. ATKINS.
S - h - h! Listen! Ain’t that an auto I hear?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. It’s Andy, I s’pose.
#MRS. ATKINS.
Don’t sit there like a silly goose. Look at the state of this room! What’ll this strange doctor think of us? Look at that lamp chimney all smoke! Gracious sakes, Ruth -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I’ve got a lamp all cleaned up in the kitchen.
#MRS. ATKINS.
Wheel me in there this minute. I don’t want him to see me looking a sight. I’ll lay down in the room the other side. You don’t need me now and I’m dead for sleep.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Hello, Andy! I’ve been waiting -
#ANDREW.
I got here as soon as I could. My sister - in - law, Mrs. Mayo - Doctor Fawcett. Where’s Rob?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
In there.
#ANDREW.
I’ll take your coat and hat, Doctor. Is he very bad, Ruth?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He’s been getting weaker.
#ANDREW.
Damn! This way, Doctor. Bring the lamp, Ruth.
#ANDREW.
How long has this been going on?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You mean - how long has he been sick?
#ANDREW.
Of course! What else?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It was last summer he had a bad spell first, but he’s been ailin’ ever since Mary died - eight months ago.
#ANDREW.
Why didn’t you let me know - cable me? Do you want him to die, all of you? I’m damned if it doesn’t look that way! Poor old chap! To be sick in this out - of - the - way hole without anyone to attend to him but a country quack! It’s a damned shame!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I wanted to send you word once, but he only got mad when I told him. He was too proud to ask anything, he said.
#ANDREW.
Proud? To ask me? I can’t understand the way you’ve acted. Didn’t you see how sick he was getting? Couldn’t you realize - why, I nearly dropped in my tracks when I saw him! He looks - terrible! I suppose you’re so used to the idea of his being delicate that you took his sickness as a matter of course. God, if I’d only known!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
A letter takes so long to get where you were - and we couldn’t afford to telegraph. We owed everyone already, and I couldn’t ask Ma. She’d been giving me money out of her savings till she hadn’t much left. Don’t say anything to Rob about it. I never told him. He’d only be mad at me if he knew. But I had to, because - God knows how we’d have got on if I hadn’t.
#ANDREW.
You mean to say - You sent that telegram to me collect. Was it because - Good God! And all this time I’ve been - why I’ve had everything! But - I can’t get it through my head. Why? Why? What has happened? How did it ever come about? Tell me!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
There’s nothing much to tell. Things kept getting worse, that’s all - and Rob didn’t seem to care. He never took any interest since way back when your Ma died. After that he got men to take charge, and they nearly all cheated him - he couldn’t tell - and left one after another. Then after Mary died he didn’t pay no heed to anything any more - just stayed indoors and took to reading books again. So I had to ask Ma if she wouldn’t help us some.
#ANDREW.
Why, damn it, this is frightful! Rob must be mad not to have let me know. Too proud to ask help of me! What’s the matter with him in God’s name? Ruth! Tell me the truth. His mind hasn’t gone back on him, has it?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I don’t know. Mary’s dying broke him up terrible - but he’s used to her being gone by this, I s’pose.
#ANDREW.
Do you mean to say you’re used to it?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
There’s a time comes - when you don’t mind any more - anything.
#ANDREW.
I’m sorry, Ruth - if I seemed to blame you. I didn’t realize - The sight of Rob lying in bed there, so gone to pieces - it made me furious at everyone. Forgive me, Ruth.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
There’s nothing to forgive. It doesn’t matter.
#ANDREW.
Thank God I came back before it was too late. This doctor will know exactly what to do. That’s the first thing to think of. When Rob’s on his feet again we can get the farm working on a sound basis once more. I’ll see to that - before I leave.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You’re going away again?
#ANDREW.
I’ve got to.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You wrote Rob you was coming back to stay this time.
#ANDREW.
I expected to - until I got to New York. Then I learned certain facts that make it necessary. To be candid, Ruth, I’m not the rich man you’ve probably been led to believe by my letters - not now. I was when I wrote them. I made money hand over fist as long as I stuck to legitimate trading; but I wasn’t content with that. I wanted it to come easier, so like all the rest of the idiots, I tried speculation. Oh, I won all right! Several times I’ve been almost a millionaire - on paper - and then come down to earth again with a bump. Finally the strain was too much. I got disgusted with myself and made up my mind to get out and come home and forget it and really live again. And now comes the funny part. The day before the steamer sailed I saw what I thought was a chance to become a millionaire again. That easy! I plunged. Then, before things broke, I left - I was so confident I couldn’t be wrong. But when I landed in New York - I wired you I had business to wind up, didn’t Well, it was the business that wound me up!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You found - you’d lost everything?
#ANDREW.
Practically. Oh, I don’t mean I’m dead broke. I’ve saved ten thousand from the wreckage, maybe twenty. But that’s a poor showing for five years’ hard work. That’s why I’ll have to go back. I can make it up in a year or so down there - and I don’t need but a shoestring to start with. I wish I didn’t have to. I’m sick of it all.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It’s too bad - things seem to go wrong so.
#ANDREW.
They might be much worse. There’s enough left to fix the farm O. K. before I go. I won’t leave ’til Rob’s on his feet again. In the meantime I’ll make things fly around here. I need a rest, and the kind of rest I need is hard work in the open - just like I used to do in the old days. Not a word to Rob about my losing money! Remember that, Ruth! You can see why. If he’s grown so touchy he’d never accept a cent if he thought I was hard up; see?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, Andy.
#ANDREW.
Ah, Doctor! Won’t you have a chair?
#FAWCETT.
I must catch the nine o’clock back to the city. It’s imperative. I have only a moment. The case of your brother, Mr. Mayo, is - Perhaps it would be better if you and I -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I know what you mean, Doctor. Don’t be afraid I can’t stand it. I’m used to bearing trouble by this; and I can guess what you’ve found out. Rob’s going to die.
#ANDREW.
Ruth!
#FAWCETT.
I am afraid my diagnosis of your brother’s condition forces me to the same conclusion as Mrs. Mayo’s.
#ANDREW.
But, Doctor, surely -
#FAWCETT.
Your brother hasn’t long to live - perhaps a few days, perhaps only a few hours. It’s a marvel that he’s alive at this moment. My examination revealed that both of his lungs are terribly affected.
#ANDREW.
Good God!
#FAWCETT.
I am sorry I have to tell you this. If there was anything that could be done -
#ANDREW.
There isn’t anything?
#FAWCETT.
It’s too late. Six months ago there might have -
#ANDREW.
But if we were to take him to the mountains - or to Arizona - or -
#FAWCETT.
That might have prolonged his life six months ago. But now -
#ANDREW.
Good heavens, you haven’t told him this, have you, Doctor?
#FAWCETT.
No. I lied to him. I said a change of climate - I must leave you.
#ANDREW.
But there must still be some chance -
#FAWCETT.
There is always that last chance - the miracle. Good - by, Mrs. Mayo.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Good - by.
#ANDREW.
I’ll walk to the car with you, Doctor. Ruth! Hadn’t we better go in and see him? God! I’m afraid to! I know he’ll read it in my face. It can’t be, Ruth. It can’t be as hopeless as he said. There’s always a fighting chance. We’ll take Rob to Arizona. He’s got to get well. There must be a chance!
#ROBERT.
Why must there, Andy?
#ANDREW.
Rob! What are you doing out of bed? Get right back now and obey the Doc, or you’re going to get a licking from me!
#ROBERT.
Help me over to the chair, please, Andy.
#ANDREW.
Like hell I will! You’re going right back to bed, that’s where you’re going, and stay there!
#ROBERT.
Stay there ’til I die, eh, Andy? Don’t behave like a child. I’m sick of lying down. I’ll be more rested sitting up. I swear I’ll get out of bed every time you put me there. You’ll have to sit on my chest, and that wouldn’t help my health any. Come on, Andy. Don’t play the fool. I want to talk to you, and I’m going to. A dying man has some rights, hasn’t he?
#ANDREW.
Don’t talk that way, for God’s sake! I’ll only let you sit down if you’ll promise that. Remember. Easy now! There you are! Wait, and I’ll get a pillow for you. How’s that?
#ROBERT.
Fine! Thank you! Listen, Andy. You’ve asked me not to talk - and I won’t after I’ve made my position clear. In the first place I know I’m dying.
#ANDREW.
Rob! That isn’t so!
#ROBERT.
It is so! Don’t lie to me. After Ruth put me to bed before you came, I saw it clearly for the first time. I’d been making plans for our future - Ruth’s and mine - so it came hard at first - the realization. Then when the doctor examined me, I knew - although he tried to lie about it. And then to make sure I listened at the door to what he told you. So don’t mock me with fairy tales about Arizona, or any such rot as that. Because I’m dying is no reason you should treat me as an imbecile or a coward. Now that I’m sure what’s happening I can say Kismet to it with all my heart. It was only the silly uncertainty that hurt.
#ANDREW.
It isn’t foolish. You have got a chance. If you heard all the Doctor said that ought to prove it to you.
#ROBERT.
Oh, you mean when he spoke of the miracle? I don’t believe in miracles - in my case. Besides, I know more than any doctor on earth could know - because I feel what’s coming. But we’ve agreed not to talk of it. Tell me about yourself, Andy. That’s what I’m interested in. Your letters were too brief and far apart to be illuminating.
#ANDREW.
I meant to write oftener.
#ROBERT.
I judge from them you’ve accomplished all you set out to do five years ago?
#ANDREW.
That isn’t much to boast of.
#ROBERT.
Have you really, honestly reached that conclusion?
#ANDREW.
Well, it doesn’t seem to amount to much now.
#ROBERT.
But you’re rich, aren’t you?
#ANDREW.
Yes, I s’pose so.
#ROBERT.
I’m glad. You can do to the farm all I’ve undone. But what did you do down there? Tell me. You went in the grain business with that friend of yours?
#ANDREW.
Yes. After two years I had a share in it. I sold out last year.
#ROBERT.
And then?
#ANDREW.
I went in on my own.
#ROBERT.
Still in grain?
#ANDREW.
Yes.
#ROBERT.
What’s the matter? You look as if I were accusing you of something.
#ANDREW.
I’m proud enough of the first four years. It’s after that I’m not boasting of. I took to speculating.
#ROBERT.
In wheat?
#ANDREW.
Yes.
#ROBERT.
And you made money - gambling?
#ANDREW.
Yes.
#ROBERT.
I’ve been wondering what the great change was in you. You - a farmer - to gamble in a wheat pit with scraps of paper. There’s a spiritual significance in that picture, Andy. I’m a failure, and Ruth’s another - but we can both justly lay some of the blame for our stumbling on God. But you’re the deepest - dyed failure of the three, Andy. You’ve spent eight years running away from yourself. Do you see what I mean? You used to be a creator when you loved the farm. You and life were in harmonious partnership. And now - My brain is muddled. But part of what I mean is that your gambling with the thing you used to love to create proves how far astray - So you’ll be punished. You’ll have to suffer to win back - It’s no use. I can’t say it.
#ANDREW.
I think I know what you’re driving at, Rob - and it’s true, I guess.
#ROBERT.
I want you to promise me to do one thing, Andy, after -
#ANDREW.
I’ll promise anything, as God is my Judge!
#ROBERT.
Remember, Andy, Ruth has suffered double her share. Only through contact with suffering, Andy, will you - awaken. Listen. You must marry Ruth - afterwards.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Rob!
#ANDREW.
You’re tired out, Rob. You better lie down and rest a while, don’t you think? We can talk later on.
#ROBERT.
Later on! You always were an optimist, Andy! Yes, I’ll go and rest a while. It must be near sunrise, isn’t it?
#ANDREW.
It’s after six.
#ROBERT.
Shut the door, Andy. I want to be alone.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He’s out of his mind now, isn’t he?
#ANDREW.
He may be a little delirious. The fever would do that. God, what a shame! And there’s nothing we can do but sit and - wait!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He was talking - wild - like he used to - only this time it sounded - unnatural, don’t you think?
#ANDREW.
I don’t know. The things he said to me had truth in them - even if he did talk them way up in the air, like he always sees things. Still - Why do you suppose he wanted us to promise we’d - You know what he said.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
His mind was wandering, I s’pose.
#ANDREW.
No - there was something back of it.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He wanted to make sure I’d be all right - after he’d gone, I expect.
#ANDREW.
No, it wasn’t that. He knows very well I’d naturally look after you without - anything like that.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He might be thinking of - something happened five years back, the time you came home from the trip.
#ANDREW.
What happened? What do you mean?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
We had a fight. fight? What has that to do with me?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It was about you - in a way.
#ANDREW.
About me?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, mostly. You see I’d found out I’d made a mistake about Rob soon after we were married - when it was too late.
#ANDREW.
Mistake? You mean - you found out you didn’t love Rob?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes.
#ANDREW.
Good God!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And then I thought that when Mary came it’d be different, and I’d love him; but it didn’t happen that way. And I couldn’t bear with his blundering and book - reading - and I grew to hate him, almost.
#ANDREW.
Ruth!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I couldn’t help it. No woman could. It had to be because I loved someone else, I’d found out. It can’t do no harm to tell you now - when it’s all past and gone - and dead. You were the one I really loved - only I didn’t come to the knowledge of it ’til too late.
#ANDREW.
Ruth! Do you know what you’re saying?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It was true - then. How could I help it? No woman could.
#ANDREW.
Then - you loved me - that time I came home?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I’d known your real reason for leaving home the first time - everybody knew it - and for three years I’d been thinking -
#ANDREW.
That I loved you?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. Then that day on the hill you laughed about what a fool you’d been for loving me once - and I knew it was all over.
#ANDREW.
Good God, but I never thought - And did Rob -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
That was what I’d started to tell. We’d had a fight just before you came and I got crazy mad - and I told him all I’ve told you.
#ANDREW.
You told Rob - you loved me?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes.
#ANDREW.
You - you - you mad fool, you! How could you do such a thing?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I couldn’t help it. I’d got to the end of bearing things - without talking.
#ANDREW.
Then Rob must have known every moment I stayed here! And yet he never said or showed - God, how he must have suffered! Didn’t you know how much he loved you?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes. I knew he liked me.
#ANDREW.
Liked you! What kind of a woman are you? Couldn’t you have kept silent? Did you have to torture him? No wonder he’s dying! And you’ve lived together for five years with this between you?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
We’ve lived in the same house.
#ANDREW.
Does he still think -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I don’t know. We’ve never spoke a word about it since that day. Maybe, from the way he went on, he s’poses I care for you yet.
#ANDREW.
But you don’t. It’s outrageous. It’s stupid! You don’t love me!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I wouldn’t know how to feel love, even if I tried, any more.
#ANDREW.
And I don’t love you, that’s sure! It’s damnable such a thing should be between Rob and me. Why, I love Rob better’n anybody in the world and always did. There isn’t a thing on God’s green earth I wouldn’t have done to keep trouble away from him. And I have to be the very one - it’s damnable! How am I going to face him again? What can I say to him now? He asked me to promise - what am I going to do?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You can promise - so’s it’ll ease his mind - and not mean anything.
#ANDREW.
What? Lie to him now - when he’s dying? No! It’s you who’ll have to do the lying, since it must be done. You’ve got a chance now to undo some of all the suffering you’ve brought on Rob. Go in to him! Tell him you never loved me - it was all a mistake. Tell him you only said so because you were mad and didn’t know what you were saying! Tell him something, anything, that’ll bring him peace!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He wouldn’t believe me.
#ANDREW.
You’ve got to make him believe you, do you hear? You’ve got to - now - hurry - you never know when it may be too late. For God’s sake, Ruth! Don’t you see you owe it to him? You’ll never forgive yourself if you don’t.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I’ll go. But it won’t do any good. Rob! Where are you? Andy! Andy! He’s gone!
#ANDREW.
He’s not -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He’s gone! The bed’s empty. The window’s wide open. He must have crawled out into the yard!
#ANDREW.
Come! He can’t have gone far! Come on! Let’s hope to God -
#ANDREW.
There he is! I knew it! I knew we’d find him here.
#ROBERT.
I thought I’d given you the slip.
#ANDREW.
Well you didn’t, you old scoundrel, and we’re going to take you right back where you belong - in bed.
#ROBERT.
Don’t, Andy. Don’t, I tell you!
#ANDREW.
You’re in pain?
#ROBERT.
No. I’m dying. I couldn’t stand it back there in the room. It seemed as if all my life - I’d been cooped in a room. So I thought I’d try to end as I might have - if I’d had the courage - alone - in a ditch by the open road - watching the sun rise.
#ANDREW.
Rob! Don’t talk. You’re wasting your strength. Rest a while and then we’ll carry you -
#ROBERT.
Still hoping, Andy? Don’t. I know. The sun comes so slowly. The doctor told me to go to the far - off places - and I’d be cured. He was right. That was always the cure for me. It’s too late - for this life - but -
#ANDREW.
Rob! God! God!
#ROBERT.
You mustn’t feel sorry for me. Don’t you see I’m happy at last - free - free! - freed from the farm - free to wander on and on - eternally! Look! Isn’t it beautiful beyond the hills? I can hear the old voices calling me to come - And this time I’m going! It isn’t the end. It’s a free beginning - the start of my voyage! I’ve won to my trip - the right of release - beyond the horizon! Oh, you ought to be glad - glad - for my sake! Andy! Remember Ruth -
#ANDREW.
I’ll take care of her, I swear to you, Rob!
#ROBERT.
Ruth has suffered - remember, Andy - only through sacrifice - the secret beyond there - The sun! Remember!
#ANDREW.
He’s dead. God damn you, you never told him!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He was so happy without my lying to him.
#ANDREW.
This is your doing, you damn woman, you coward, you murderess!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Don’t, Andy! I couldn’t help it - and he knew how I’d suffered, too. He told you - to remember.
#ANDREW.
Forgive me, Ruth - for his sake - and I’ll remember - I - you - we’ve both made a mess of things! We must try to help each other - and - in time - we’ll come to know what’s right - And perhaps we -
