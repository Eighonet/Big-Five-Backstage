#LIGE.
I know you kin and that’s de reason I ain’t going to tempt you. But youse gettin’ old in lots of ways—look at dat bald - head—just as clean as my hand.
#HAMBO.
Don’t keer if it tis—I don’t want nothin’—not even hair—between me and God.
#HANK.

#MRS. MOSELY.
Whoo - ee … somebody calling me?
#MRS. ROBERTS.
Never mind now—you couldn’t come when I called you. I don’t want yo’ lil ole weasley turnip greens.
#MATT BRAZZLE.
Sister Roberts is en town agin! If she was mine, I’ll be hen - fired if I wouldn’t break her down in de lines —good as dat man is to her!
#HAMBO.
I wish she was mine jes’ one day—de first time she open her mouf to beg anybody, I’d lam her wid lightning.
#JOE CLARK.

#MRS. ROBERTS.

#MRS. ROBERTS.
Ow! Mist’ Clark! Don’t you cut dat lil tee - ninchy piece of meat for me and my chillun! I ain’t a going to tetch it!
#JOE CLARK.

#MRS. ROBERTS.
Well, hand it chear den. Lawd, me and my chillun is so hongry…. Jake don’t fee - eed me. Lawd, me and my poor chillun is so hongry … and some folks has everything and they’s so stingy and gripin’…. Lawd knows, Jake don’t fee - eed me!
#HAMBO.
Poor Jak…. I’m really sorry for dat man. If she was mine I’d beat her till her ears hung down like a Georgy mule.
#WALTER THOMAS.
I’d beat her till she smell like onions.
#LIGE.
I’d romp on her till she slack like lime.
#NIXON.
I’d stomp her till she rope like okra.
#MRS. ROBERTS.
Lawd, Miz Lewis, you goin’ give me dat lil han’ful of greens for me and my chillun. Why dat ain’t a eye - full. I ought not to take ’em … but me and my chillun is so hongry…. Some folks is so stingy and gripin’! Lawd knows, Tony don’t feed me!
#HAMBO.
Well, did you git any partridges, Joe?
#OLD JOE.
Nope, but I made de feathers fly.
#HAMBO.
I don’t see no birds.
#OLD JOE.
Oh, the feathers flew off on de birds.
#LIGE.
I don’t see nothin’ but dat bone. Look lak you done kilt a cow and et ’im raw out in de woods.
#OLD JOE.
Don’t y’all know dat hock - bone?
#WALTER.
How you reckon we gointer know every hock - bone in Orange County sight unseen?
#OLD JOE.
Dis is a hock - bone of Brazzle’s ole yaller mule.
#BRAZZLE.
Well, sir! If ’tain’t my ole mule! This sho was one hell of a mule, too. He’d fight every inch in front of de plow … he’d turn over de mowing machine … run away wid de wagon … and you better not look like you wanter ride ’im!
#LINDSAY.
Yeah, I ’member seein’ you comin’ down de road just so … one day.
#BRAZZLE.
Dis mule was so evil he used to try to bite and kick when I’d go in de stable to feed ’im.
#WALTER.
He was too mean to git fat. He was so skinny you could do a week’s washing on his ribs for a washboard and hang ’em up on his hip - bones to dry.
#LIGE.
I ’member one day, Brazzle, you sent yo’ boy to Winter Park after some groceries wid a basket. So here he went down de road ridin’ dis mule wid dis basket on his arm…. Whut you reckon dat ole contrary mule done when he got to dat crooked place in de road going round Park Lake? He turnt right round and went through de handle of dat basket … wid de boy still up on his back.
#BRAZZLE.
Yeah, he up and died one Sat’day just for spite … but he was too contrary to lay down on his side like a mule orter and die decent. Naw, he made out to lay down on his narrer contracted back and die wid his feets sticking straight up in de air just so. We drug him out to de swamp wid ’im dat way, didn’t we, Hambo?
#JOE CLARK.
I God, Brazzle, we all seen it. Didn’t we all go to de draggin’ out? More folks went to yo’ mule’s draggin’ out than went to last school closing…. Bet there ain’t been a thing right in mule - hell for four years.
#HAMBO.
Been dat long since he been dead?
#JOE CLARK.
I God, yes. He died de week after I started to cutting’ dat new ground.
#HANK.
Senator! Senator!! Oh, you Senator?
#BOY.
Aw, shux. Ma’m?
#HANK.
If you don’t come here you better!
#SENATOR.
Yes ma’am. Soon as we men git to doing something dese wimmen….
#LIGE.
Them girls done turned out to be right good - looking.
#WALTER.
Teet ain’t as pretty now as she was a few years back. She used to be fat as a butter ball wid legs just like two whiskey - kegs. She’s too skinny since she got her growth.
#CODY.
Ain’t none of ’em pretty as dat Miss Daisy. God! She’s pretty as a speckled pup.
#LIGE.
But she was sho nuff ugly when she was little … little ole hard black knot. She sho has changed since she been away up North. If she ain’t pretty now, there ain’t a hound dog in Georgy.
#SENATOR.
Mist’ Clark….
#HAMBO.
Ain’t you got no manners? We all didn’t sleep wid you last night.
#SENATOR.
Good evening, everybody.
#ALL THE MEN.
Good evening, son, boy, Senator, etc.
#SENATOR.
Mist’ Clark, mama said is Daisy been here dis evenin’?
#JOE CLARK.
Ain’t laid my eyes on her. Ain’t she working over in Maitland?
#SENATOR.
Yessuh … but she’s off today and mama sent her down here to get de groceries.
#JOE CLARK.
Well, tell yo’ ma I ain’t seen her.
#SENATOR.
Well, she say to tell you when she come, to tell her ma say she better git home and dat quick.
#JOE CLARK.
I will.
#LIGE.
Bet she’s off somewhere wid Dave or Jim.
#WALTER.
I don’t bet it … I know it. She’s got them two in de go - long.
#WALTER.
Whut’s dat you got, Teet … letter from Dave?
#TEET.
Naw indeed! It’s a letter from my B - I - T - sweetie!
#WALTER.
Well, ain’t Dave yo’ B - I - T - sweetie? I thought y’all was ’bout to git married. Everywhere I looked dis summer ’twas you and Dave, Bootsie and Jim. I thought all of y’all would’ve done jumped over de broomstick by now.
#TEET.
Don’t tell it to me … tell it to the ever - loving Mr. Albert Johnson way over in Apopka.
#BOOTSIE.
Oh, tell ’em ’bout the ever - loving Mr. Jimmy Cox from Altamont. Oh, I can’t stand to see my baby lose.
#HAMBO.
It’s lucky y’all girls done got some more fellers, cause look like Daisy done treed both Jim and Dave at once, or they done treed here one.
#TEET.
Let her have ’em … nobody don’t keer. They don’t handle de “In God we trust” lak my Johnson. He’s head bellman at de hotel.
#BOOTSIE.
Mr. Cox got money’s grandma and old grandpa change.
#LINDSAY.
You oughtn’t tease dem gals lak dat.
#HAMBO.
Oh, I laks to see gals all mad. But dem boys is crazy sho nuff. Before Daisy come back here they both had a good - looking gal a piece. Now they ’bout to fall out and fight over half a gal a piece. Neither one won’t give over and let de other one have her.
#LIGE.
And she ain’t thinking too much ’bout no one man. Here she come now. God! She got a mean walk on her!
#WALTER.
Yeah, man. She handles a lot of traffic! Oh, mama, throw it in de river … papa’ll come git it!
#LINDSAY.
Aw, shut up, you married men!
#LIGE.
Man don’t go blind cause he gits married, do he?
#DAISY.
Good evening, everybody.
#ALL THE MEN.
Good evening, Miss Daisy.
#DAISY.
Mama sent me after some meal and flour and some bacon and sausage oil.
#JOE CLARK.
Senator been here long time ago hunting you.
#DAISY.
Did he? Oo … Mist’ Clark, hurry up and fix it for me.
#LINDSAY.
You better wait here, Daisy. It’s powerful hot in dat store. Lemme run fetch ’em out to you.
#LIGE.
Run! Joe Lindsay, you ain’t been able to run since de big bell rung. Look at dat gray beard.
#LINDSAY.
Thank God, I ain’t gray all over. I’m just as good a man right now as any of you young ’uns.
#WALTER.
Daisy, where’s yo’ two body guards? It don’t look natural to see you thout nary one of ’em.
#DAISY.
I ain’t got no body guards. I don’t know what you talkin’ about.
#LIGE.
Aw, don’ try to come dat over us, Daisy. You know who we talkin’ ’bout all right … but if you want me to come out flat footed … where’s Jim and Dave?
#DAISY.
Ain’t they playin’ somewhere for de white folks?
#LIGE.
Will you listen at dis gal, Walter? When I ain’t been long seen you and Dave going down to de Lake.
#DAISY.
Don’t y’all run tell mama where I been.
#WALTER.
Well, you tell us which one you laks de best and we’ll wipe our mouf and say nothin’. Dem boys been de best of friends all they life, till both of ’em took after you … then good - bye, Katy bar de door!
#DAISY.
Ain’t they still playin’ and dancin’ together?
#LIGE.
Yeah, but that’s ’bout all they do ’gree on these days. That’s de way it is wid men, young and old…. I don’t keer how long they been friends and how thick they been … a woman kin come between ’em. David and Jonather never would have been friends so long if Jonather had of been any great hand wid de wimmen. You ain’t never seen no two roosters that likes one another.
#DAISY.
I ain’t tried to break ’em up.
#WALTER.
Course you ain’t. You don’t have to. All two boys need to do is to git stuck on de same girl and they done broke up … right now! Wimmen is something can’t be divided equal.
#LIGE.
Want some of us … me … to go long and tote yo’ things for you?
#DAISY.
Naw, mama is riding her high horse today. Long as I been gone it wouldn’t do for me to come walking up wid nobody.
#JOE CLARK.
I God, know whut Daisy puts me in de mind of?
#HAMBO.
No, what?
#JOE CLARK.
I God, a great big mango … a sweet smell, you know, Th a strong flavor, but not something you could mash up like a strawberry. Something with a body to it.
#HAMBO.
Joe Clark! I didn’t know you had it in you!
#JOE CLARK.
Now whut do you want? I God, the minute I set down, here you come….
#MRS. CLARK.
Somebody want a stamp, Jody. You know you don’t ’low me to bove wid de post office.
#BRAZZLE.
Say, Hambo, I didn’t see you at our Sunday School picnic.
#HAMBO.
Nope, wan’t there dis time.
#WALTER.
Looka here, Hambo. Y’all Baptist carry dis close - communion business too far. If a person ain’t half drownded in de lake and half et up by alligators, y’all think he ain’t baptized, so you can’t take communion wid him. Now I reckon you can’t even drink lemonade and eat chicken perlow wid us.
#HAMBO.
My Lord, boy, youse just full of words. Now, in de first place, if this year’s picnic was lak de one y’all had last year … you ain’t had no lemonade for us Baptists to turn down. You had a big ole barrel of rain water wid about a pound of sugar in it and one lemon cut up over de top of it.
#LIGE.
Man, you sho kin mold ’em!
#WALTER.
Well, I went to de Baptist picnic wid my mouf all set to eat chicken, when lo and behold y’all had chitlings! Do Jesus!
#LINDSAY.
Hold on there a minute. There was plenty chicken at dat picnic, which I do know is right.
#WALTER.
Only chicken I seen was half a chicken yo’ pastor musta tried to swaller whole cause he was choked stiff as a board when I come long … wid de whole deacon’s board beating him in de back, trying to knock it out his throat.
#LIGE.
Say, dat puts me in de mind of a Baptist brother that was crazy ’bout de preachers and de preacher was crazy ’bout feeding his face. So his son got tired of trying to beat dese stump - knockers to de grub on the table, so one day he throwed out some slams ’bout dese preachers. Dat made his old man mad, so he tole his son to git out. He boy ast him “Where must I go, papa?” He says, “Go on to hell I reckon … I don’t keer where you go.” So de boy left and was gone seven years. He come back one cold, windy night and rapped on de door. “Who dat?” de old man ast him “It’s me, Jack.” De old man opened de door, so glad to see his son agin, and tole Jack to come in. He did and looked all round de place. Seven or eight preachers was sitting round de fire eatin’ and drinkin’. “Where you been all dis time, Jack?” de old man ast him. “I been to hell,” Jack tole him. “Tell us how it is down there, Jack.” “Well,” he says, “It’s just like it is here … you cain’t git to de fire for de preachers.”
#HAMBO.
Boy, you kin lie just like de cross - ties from Jacksonville to Key West. De presidin’ elder must come round on his circuit teaching y’all how to tell ’em, cause you couldn’t lie dat good just natural.
#WALTER.
Can’t nobody beat Baptist folks lying … and I ain’t never found out how come you think youse so important.
#LINDSAY.
Ain’t we got de finest and de biggest church? Macedonia Baptist will hold more folks than any two buildings in town.
#LIGE.
Thass right, y’all got a heap more church than you got members to go in it.
#HAMBO.
Thass all right … y’all ain’t got neither de church nor de members. Everything that’s had in this town got to be held in our church.
#JOE CLARK.
What you - all talkin’?
#HAMBO.
Come on out, Tush Hawg, lemme beat you some checkers. I’m tired of fending and proving wid dese boys ain’t got no hair on they chest yet.
#JOE CLARK.
I God, you mean you gointer get beat. You can’t handle me … I’m a tush hawg.
#HAMBO.
Well, I’m going to draw dem tushes right now. Here you chilluns, let de Mayor and me have that board. Go on out an’ play an’ give us grown folks a little peace.
#SMALL BOY.

#LOUNGERS.
Ol’ Deacon’s got you now.
#ANOTHER VOICE.
Don’t see how he can beat the Mayor like that.
#ANOTHER VOICE.

#JOE CLARK.
Get on ’way from here, you limbs of Satan, making all that racket so a man can’t hear his ears. Go on, go on! Lum Boger, whyn’t you git these kids away from here! What kind of a marshall is you? All this passle of young’uns around here under grown people’s feet, creatin’ disorder in front of my store.
#LUM BOGER.

#MATILDA.

#LUM BOGER.
You impudent little huzzy, you! You must smell yourself … youse so fresh.
#MATILDA.

#LUM BOGER.
Don’t make me have to grab you and take you down a buttonhole lower.
#MATILDA.
Go ahead on and grab me. You sho can’t kill me, and if you kill me, you sho can’t eat me.
#SENATOR.
Ol’ dumb Lum! Hey! Hey!
#HAMBO.
You ain’t got but one move … go ahead on and make it. What’s de matter, Mayor?
#JOE CLARK.

#HANK.
Oh, ha! Done got the ol’ tush hog.
#ANOTHER VOICE.

#JOE CLARK.
Oh, I coulda beat you if I didn’t have this store on my mind. Saturday afternoon and I got work to do. Lum, ain’t I told you to keep them kids from playin’ right in front of this store?
#ANOTHER VOICE.
Eh, heh…. Hambo done run him on his store … done run the ol’ coon in his hole.
#ANOTHER VOICE.
That ain’t good politics, Hambo, beatin’ the Mayor.
#ANOTHER VOICE.
Well, Hambo, you don’t got to be so hard at checkers, come on let’s see what you can do with de cards. Lum Boger there got his hands full nursin’ the chilluns.
#ANOTHER VOICE.
We ain’t playin’ for money, nohow, Deacon. We just playin’ a little Florida Flip.
#HAMBO.
Ya all can’t play no Florida Flip. When I was a sinner there wasn’t a man in this state could beat me playin’ that game. But I’m a deacon in Macedonia Baptist now and I don’t bother with the cards no more.
#VOICE AT CARD TABLE.
All right, then, come on here Tony let me catch your jack.
#TAYLOR.
I don’t reckon I got time. I guess my wife gonna get through buying out that store some time or other and want to go home.
#OLD MAN.
I bet my wife would know better than expect me to sit around and wait for her with a basket. Whyn’t you tell her to tote it on home herself?
#TAYLOR.
Eh, Lawd!
#VOICE AT CARD TABLE.
Look like we can’t get nobody to come into this game. Seem like everybody’s scared a us. Come on back here, Lum, and take your hand.
#LUM BOGER.

#MOTHER.
You mean since she started runnin’ after them, the young hussy.

#WALTER.
Nope, I never cut green timber.
#FRANK.
Hearts, boys.
#LUM BOGER.

#WALTER.
Yeah, they done carried the cub to us, partner.
#LIGE.
Oh, he didn’t do no such a thing. That ace was turned fair. We jus’ too hard for you … we eats our dinner out a the blacksmith shop.
#WALTER.
Aw, you all cheatin’. You know it wasn’t fair.
#FRANK.

#LIGE.

#LIGE.
Scared to play you? Get back down to this table, let me spread my mess.
#LOUNGER.
Yonder comes Elder Simms. You all better squat that rabbit. They’ll be having you all up in the church for playin’ cards.
#ELDER SIMMS.
How do, children. Right warm for this time in November, ain’t it?
#HANK.
Yes sir, Reverend, sho is. How’s Sister Simms?
#SIMMS.
She’s feelin’ kinda po’ly today.
#HANK.
Don’t see how that great big ole powerful woman could be sick. Look like she could go bear huntin’ with her fist.
#ANOTHER VOICE.
She look jus’ as good as you - all’s Baptist pastor’s wife. Pshaw, you ain’t seen no big woman, nohow, man. I seen one once so big she went to whip her little boy and he run up under her belly and hid six months ’fore she could find him.
#ANOTHER VOICE.
Well, I knowed a woman so little that she had to get up on a soap box to look over a grain of sand.
#SIMMS.
Run on home to your mother and don’t get dirty on the way.
#SIMMS’S CHILD.
Papa, papa. Nunkie’s trying to lick my candy.
#SIMMS.
I told you to go on and leave them other children alone.
#VOICE ON PORCH.
Lum, whyn’t you tend to your business.
#LUM BOGER.
You all varmints leave them nice chillun alone.
#LIGE.
Well, you all done seen so much, but I bet you ain’t never seen a snake as big as the one I saw when I was a boy up in middle Georgia. He was so big couldn’t hardly move his self. He laid in one spot so long he growed moss on him and everybody thought he was a log, till one day I set down on him and went to sleep, and when I woke up that snake done crawled to Florida.
#FRANK.
Layin’ all jokes aside though now, you all remember that rattlesnake I killed last year was almost as big as that Georgia snake.
#HANK.
How big, you say it was, Frank?
#FRANK.
Maybe not quite as big as that, but jus’ about fourteen feet.
#HANK.
Gimme that lyin’ snake. That snake wasn’t but four foot long when you killed him last year and you done growed him ten feet in a year.
#ANOTHER VOICE.
Well, I don’t know about that. Some of the snakes around here is powerful long. I went out in my front yard yesterday right after the rain and killed a great big ol’ cottonmouth.
#SIMMS.
This sho is a snake town. I certainly can’t raise no chickens for ’em. They kill my little biddies jus’ as fast as they hatch out. And yes … if I hadn’t cut them weeds out of the street in front of my parsonage, me or some of my folks woulda been snake - bit right at our front door. Whyn’t you all cut down these weeds and clean up these streets?
#HAMBO.
Well, the Mayor ain’t said nothin’ ’bout it.
#SIMMS.
When the folks misbehaves in this town I think they oughta lock ’em up in a jail and make ’em work their fine out on the streets, then these weeds would be cut down.
#HANK.
How we gonna do that when we ain’t got no jail?
#SIMMS.
Well, you sho needs a jail … you - all needs a whole lot of improvements round this town. I ain’t never pastored no town so way - back as this one here.
#JOE CLARK.
What’s that you say ’bout this town?
#SIMMS.
I say we needs some improvements here in this town … that’s what.
#JOE CLARK.
And what improvements you figgers we needs? whole heap. Now, for one thing we really does need a jail, Mayor. We oughta stop runnin’ these people out of town that misbehaves, and lock ’em up. Others towns has jails, everytown I ever pastored had a jail. Don’t see how come we can’t have one.
#JOE CLARK.
Now, wait a minute, Simms. Don’t you reckon the man who knows how to start a town knows how to run it? I paid two hundred dollars out of this right hand for this land and walked out here and started this town befo’ you was born. I ain’t like some of you new niggers, come here when grapes’ ripe. I was here to cut new ground, and I been Mayor ever since.
#SIMMS.
Well, there ain’t no sense in no one man stayin’ Mayor all the time.
#JOE CLARK.
Well, it’s my town and I can be mayor jus’ as long as I want to. It was me that put this town on the map.
#SIMMS.
What map you put it on, Joe Clark? I ain’t seen it on no map.
#JOE CLARK.
I God! Listen here, Elder Simms. If you don’t like the way I run this town, just’ take your flat feets right on out and git yonder crost the woods. You ain’t been here long enough to say nothin’ nohow.
#HAMBO.
Yeah, you Methodist niggers always telling people how to run things.
#TAYLOR.
We do so know how to run things, don’t we? Ain’t Brother Mayor a Methodist, and ain’t the school - teacher a …?
#SIMMS.
No, we don’t like the way you’re runnin’ things. Now looka here, You got that lazy Lum Boger here for marshall and he ain’t old enough to be dry behind his ears yet … and all these able - bodied means in this town! You won’t ’low nobody else to run a store ’ceptin’ you. And looka yonder only street lamp in town, you got in front of your place. We pay the taxes and you got the lamp.
#VILLAGER.
Don’t you - all fuss now. How come you two always yam - yamming at each other?
#JOE CLARK.
How come this fly - by - night Methodist preacher over here … ain’t been here three months … tries to stand up on my store porch and tries to tell me how to run my town? Ain’t no man gonna tell me how to run my town. I God, I ’lected myself in and I’m gonna run it. I God, Mattie, git on back in there and wait on that store!
#MATTIE CLARK.
Jody, somebody else wantin’ stamps.
#JOE CLARK.
I God, woman, what good is you? Gwan, git in. Look like between women and preachers a man can’t have no peace.
#SIMMS.
Now, when I pastored in Jacksonville you oughta see what kinda jails they got there….
#LOUNGER.
White folks needs jails. We colored folks don’t need no jail.
#ANOTHER VILLAGER.
Yes, we do, too. Elder Simms is right….
#TAYLOR.
Now, I tell you a jail….
#MRS. TAYLOR.
Yeah, and if you don’t shut up and git these rations home I’m gonna be worse on you than a jail and six judges. Pickup that basket and let’s go.
#WALTER.
Hey, there, bums, how’s tricks?
#LIGE.
What yo’ sayin’, boys?
#HAMBO.
Good evenin’ sons.
#LIGE.
How did you - all make out this evenin’, boys?
#JIM.
Oh, them white folks at the party shelled out right well. Kept Dave busy pickin’ it up. How much did we make today, Dave?
#DAVE.
I don’t know, boy, but feels right heavy here. Kept me pickin’ up money just like this…. We count it after while. Woulda divided up with you already if you hadn’t left me when you seen Daisy comin’ by. Let’s sit down on the porch and rest now.
#LIGE.
She sho is lookin’ stylish and pretty since she come back with her white folks from up North. Wearin’ the swellest clothes. And that coal - black hair of hers jus’ won’t quit.
#MATTIE CLARK.
I don’t see what the mens always hanging after Daisy Taylor for.
#JOE CLARK.
I God, you back here again. Who’s tendin’ that store?
#DAVE.
Well, she always did look like new money to me when she was here before.
#JIM.
Well, that’s all you ever did get was a look.
#DAVE.
That’s all you know! I bet I get more than that now.
#JIM.
You might git it but I’m the man to use it. I’m a bottom fish.
#DAVE.
Aw, man. You musta been walking round here fast asleep when Daisy was in this county last. You ain’t seen de go I had with her.
#JIM.
No, I ain’t seen it. Bet you didn’t have no letter from her while she been away.
#DAVE.
Bet you didn’t neither.
#JIM.
Well, it’s just cause she can’t write. If she knew how to scratch with a pencil I’d had a ton of ’em.
#DAVE.
Shaw, man! I’d had a post office full of ’em.
#OLD WOMAN.
You - all ought to be shame, carrying on over a brazen heifer like Daisy Taylor. Jus’ cause she’s been up North and come back, I reckon you cutting de fool sho ’nough now. She ain’t studying none of you - all nohow. All she wants is what you got in your pocket.
#JIM.
I likes her but she won’t git nothin’ outa me. She never did. I wouldn’t give a poor consumpted cripple crab a crutch to cross the River Jurdon.
#DAVE.
I know I ain’t gonna give no woman nothin’. I wouldn’t give a dog a doughnut if he treed a terrapin.
#LIGE.
Youse a cottontail dispute … both of you. You’d give her anything you got. You’d give her Georgia with a fence ’round it.
#OLD MAN.
Yeah, and she’d take it, too.
#LINDSAY.
Don’t distriminate the woman like that. That ain’t nothing but hogism. Ain’t nothin’ the matter with Daisy, she’s all right.
#BOOTSIE.
Is you seen my mama?
#OLD WOMAN.
You know you ain’t lookin’ for no mama. Jus’ come back down here to show your shape and fan around awhile. & TEETS. No, we ain’t. We’se come to get our mail.
#OLD WOMAN.
Why don’t you all keep up some attention to these nice girls here, Bootsie and Teets. They wants to marry.
#DAVE.
Aw, who thinkin’ ’bout marryin’ now? They better stay home and eat their own pa’s rations. I gotta buy myself some shoes.
#JIM.
The woman I’m gonna marry ain’t born yet and her maw is dead.
#JOE CLARK.
Two of the finest gals that ever lived and friendly jus’ like you - all is. You two boys better take ’em back and stop them shiftless ways.
#HAMBO.
Yeah, hurry up and do somethin’! I wants to taste a piece yo’ weddin’ cake.
#JIM.
Whut you trying to rush me up so fast?… Look at Will Cody here he been promising to bring his already wife down for two months … and nair one of us ain’t seen her yet.
#DAVE.
Yeah, how you speck me to haul in a brand new wife when he can’t lead a wagon - broke wife eighteen miles? Me, I’m going git one soon’s Cody show me his’n.
#WALTER.
Thass right, Cody. I been intending to tell you…. I know where you kin buy a ready - built house for you and yo’ wife. Hey, Clark, cime on out here and tell Cody ’bout dat Bradley house. I know you wants to git a place of yo’ own so you kin settle down.
#HAMBO.
He done moved so much since he been here till every time he walk out in his back yeard his chickens lay down and cross they legs.
#LINDSAY.
Cody, I thought you tole us you was going up to Sanford to bring dat ’oman down here last Sat’day.
#LIGE.
That ain’t de way he tole me ’bout it. Look, fellers, Where you reckon I’ll be next Sat’day night?… Sittin’ up side of Miz Cody.
#SYKES JONES.
Know what de folks tole me in Sanford? Dat was another man’s wife.
#CODY.
Aw, you don’t know whut you talkin’ bout.
#JONES.
Naw, I don’t know, but de folks in Sanford does. Dey tell me when dat lady’s husband come home Sat’day night, ole Cody jumped out de window. De man grabbed his old repeater and run out in de yard to head him off. When Cody seen him come round de corner de house he flopped his wings and flew up on de fence. De man thowed dat shotgun dead on him. Den, man! Cody flopped his wings lak a buzzard and sailed on off. De man dropped to his knees lak dis Die! die! die! Cody just flew right on off and lit on a hill two miles off. Then, man! In ten minutes he was back here in Eatonville and in he bed.
#WALTER.
I passed there and seen his house shakin’, but I didn’t know how come.
#HAMBO.
Aw, leave de boy alone…. If you don’t look out some of y’all going to have to break his record.
#LIGE.
I’m prepared to break it now.
#JIM.
Well, anyhow, I don’t want to marry and leave Dave … yet awhile.
#DAVE.
And I ain’t gonna leave Jim. We been palling around together ever since we hollered titty mama, ain’t we, boy?
#JIM.
Sho is. Rabbit on the log. I ain’t got no dog. How am I gonna git him? God knows. Rabbit on the log. Ain’t got no dog. Shoot him with my rifle Bam! Bam!

#VOICES IN THE CROWD.
Ha! Ha! Ol’ Dave’s gittin’jealous when she speaks o’ Jim.
#JIM.

#DAVE.
My singin’is a whole lot better’n your playin’. You jus’ go along and fram. The reason why the white folks gives us money is cause I’m singin’.
#JIM.

#DAVE.
And you can’t dance.
#VOICE IN THE CROWD.
You oughta dance. Big as your feet is, Dave.
#DAISY.
Both of you all is wonderful and I would like to see Dave dance a little.
#DAVE.
There now, I told you. What did I tell you. Stop woofing and pick a little tune there so that I can show Daisy somethin’.
#JIM.
Pick a tune? I bet if you fool with me I’ll pick your bones jus’ like a buzzard did the rabbit. You can’t sing and now you wants to dance.
#DAVE.

#JIM.

#DAVE.
What’s the matter, buddy?
#JIM.
Oh, nigger, I’m tired of seein’you cut the fool. ’Sides that, I been playin’all afternoon for the white folks.
#DAISY.
But I though you was playin’for me now, Jim.
#JIM.
Yeah, I’d play all night long for you, but I’m gettin’sick of Dave round here showin’off. Let him git somethin’and play for himself if he can.
#DAISY.
Well, honey, play some more for me, then, and don’t mind Dave. I reckon he done danced enough. Play me “Shake That Thing”.
#OLD MAN WITH LANTERN.

#JIM.

#DAVE.
Old nigger’s eveil but he sho can play.
#DAISY.
Look here, baby, at this new step I learned up North.
#DAVE.
You can show me anything, sugar lump.
#DAISY.
Hold me tight now.
#VOICES IN THE CROWD.
Aw, come on, Jim…. You must be jealous….
#JIM.
No, I ain’t jealous. I jus’ get tired of seein’that ol’ nigger clownin’all the time.
#DAVE.
Look at that mad baby. Take that lip up off the ground. Got your mouth stuck out jus’ because some one is enjoying themselves.
#JIM.
You better go head and let me alone. Come here, Daisy!
#LIGE.
That’s just what I say. Niggers can’t have no fun without someone getting mad … specially over a woman.
#JIM.
I ain’t mad…. Daisy, ’scuse me, honey, but that fool, Dave….
#DAVE.
I ain’t mad neither…. Jim always tryin’to throw off on me. But you can’t joke him.
#DAISY.
Aw, now, now!
#JIM.
You ain’t jokin’. You means that, nigger. And if you tryin’to get hot, first thing, you can pull of my blue shirt you put on this morning.
#DAVE.
Youse a got that wrong. I ain’t got on no shirt of yours.
#JIM.
Yes, you is got on my shirt, too. Don’t tell me you ain’t got on my shirt.
#DAVE.
Well, even if I is, you can just lift your big plantations out of my shoes. You can just foot it home barefooted.
#JIM.
You try to take any shoes offa me!
#LIGE.
Aw, there ain’t no use of all that. What you all want to start this quarreling for over a little jokin’.
#JIM.
Nobody’s quarreling…. I’m just playin’a little for Daisy and Dave’s out there clownin’with her.
#JOE CLARK.
I ain’t gonna have no fussin’round my store, no way. Shut up, you all.
#JIM.
Well, Mayor Clark, I ain’t mad with him. We’se been friends all our lives. He’s slept in my bed and wore my clothes and et my grub….
#DAVE.
I et your grub? And many time as you done laid down with your belly full of my grandma’s collard greens. You done et my meat and bread a whole lot more times than I et your stewed fish - heads.
#JIM.
I’d rather eat stewed fish - heads than steal out of other folkses houses so much till you went to sleep on the roost and fell down one night and broke up the settin’hen.
#DAVE.
Youse a liar if you say I stole anybody’s chickens. I didn’t have to. But you … ’fore you started goin’around with me, playin’ that little box of yours, you was so hungry you had the white mouth. If it wasn’t for these white folks throwin’me money for my dancin’, you would be thin as a whisper right now.
#JIM.
Your dancin’! You been leapin’around here like a tailless monkey in a wash pot for a long time and nobody was payin’no ’tention to you, till I come along playing.
#LINDSAY.
Boys, boys, that ain’t no way for friends to carry on.
#DAISY.
Well, if you all gonna keep up this quarrelin’and carryin’on I’m goin’home. ’Bout time for me to be gittin’back to my white folks anyhow. It’s dark now. I’m goin’, even if I have to go by myself. I shouldn’t a stopped by here nohow.
#JIM.
You ain’t gonna go home by yourself. I’m goin’with you.
#DAVE.
It may be so, I don’t know. But it sounds to me Like a lie.
#WALTER.
Dave ain’t’ got as much rabbit blood as folks thought.
#DAVE.
Tell ’em ’bout me. Won’t you choose a treat on me, Miss Daisy, ’fore we go?
#DAISY.
Yessir, thank you. I wants a drink of soda water.
#LIGE.
Ol’ fast Dave jus’ runnin’the hog right over you, Jim.
#WALTER.
Thought you was such a hot man.
#LUM BOGER.
Want me to go in there and put Daisy under arrest and bring her to you?
#JIM.
Aw, I’ll get her when I want her. Let him treat her, but see who struts around that lake and down the railroad with her by and by.
#JIM.
Stay off my foot, you big ox.
#DAVE.
Well, you don’t have to wet me all up, do you, and me in company? Why don’t you put your damn foot in your pocket?
#DAISY.
Aw, ain’t that too bad.
#JIM.
Well, who’s shirt did I wet? It’s mine, anyhow, ain’t it?
#DAVE.
Well, if it’s your shirt, then you come take it off me. I’m tired of your lip.
#JIM.
Well, I will.
#DAVE.
Well, put your fist where you lip is.
#DAISY.
I want to go home. Now, don’t you all boys fight.
#LITTLE BOY.
Fight, fight, you’re no kin. Kill one another, won’t be no sin. Fight, fight, you’re no kin.
#DAISY.
Aw, my Lawd! I want to go home.
#OLD WOMAN.
Lawdy, is he kilt?
#HANK.
Run down to the pump and get a dipper o’ water.
#JOE CLARK.
Mattie, come out of that store with a bottle of witch hazely oil quick as you can. Jim Weston, I’m gonna arrest you for this. You Lum Boger. Where is that marshall? Lum Boger! Arrest Jim.
#LUM BOGER.
Now I got him arrested, what’s I going to do with him?
#JOE CLARK.
Lock him up back yonder in my barn till Monday when we’ll have the trial in de Baptist Church.
#LINDSAY.
Yeah, just like all the rest of them Methodists … always tryin’to take undercurrents on people.
#WALTER.
Ain’t no worse then some of you Baptists, nohow. You all don’t run this town. We got jus’ as much to say as you have.
#JOE CLARK.
Shut up! Done had enough arguing in front of my place. Take that boy on and lock him up in my barn. And save that mule bone for evidence.
#DAISY.
Now, who’s gonna take me home? :::: CURTAIN::::
#SISTER THOMAS.
Evenin’, Sis Taylor.
#SISTER TAYLOR.
Evenin’.
#SISTER THOMAS.
Whut you doin’? Readin’dat notice Joe Clark put up ’bout de meeting?
#SISTER TAYLOR.
Is dat whut it says? I ain’t much on readin’since I had my teeth pulled out. You know if you pull out dem eye teeth you ruins’ yo’ eye sight. Whut it say?
#SISTER THOMAS.
“The trial of Jim Weston for assault and battery on Dave Carter wid a dangerous weapon will be held at Macedonia Baptist Church on Monday, November 10, at three o’clock. All are welcome. By order of J. Clark, Mayor of Eatonville, Florida.” Hit’s makin’on to three now.
#SISTER TAYLOR.
You mean it’s right now. Lemme go git ready to be at de trial ’cause I’m sho goin’to be there an’ I ain’t goin’to bite my tongue neither.
#SISTER THOMAS.
I done went an’ crapped a mess of collard greens for supper. I better go put ’em on ’cause Lawd knows when we goin’to git outa there an’ my husband is one of them dat’s gointer eat don’t keer whut happen. I bet if judgment day was to happen tomorrow he’d speck I orter fix him a bucket to carry long.
#SISTER TAYLOR.
All men favors they guts, chile. But what you think of all dis mess they got goin’on round here?
#SISTER THOMAS.
I just think it’s a sin an’ a shame befo’ de livin’ justice de way dese Baptis’ niggers is runnin’round here carryin’on.
#SISTER TAYLOR.
Oh, they been puttin’out the brags ever since Sat’day night ’bout whut they gointer do to Jim. They thinks they runs this town. They tell me Rev. CHILDERS preached a sermon on it yistiddy.
#SISTER THOMAS.
Lawd help us! He can’t preach an’ he look like 10 cents worth of have - mercy let lone gittin’up dere tryin’to throw slams at us. Now all Elder Simms done wuz to explain to us our rights … whut you think ’bout Joe Clarke runnin’round here takin’up for these ole Baptist niggers?
#SISTER TAYLOR.
De puzzle - gut rascal … we oughter have him up in conference an’ put him out de Methdis’ faith. He don’t b’long in there—wanter tun dat boy outa town for nothin’.
#SISTER THOMAS.
But we all know how come he so hot to law Jim outa town—hit’s to dig de foundation out from under Elder Simms.
#SISTER TAYLOR.
Whut he wants do dat for?
#SISTER THOMAS.
’Cause he wants to be a God - know - it - all an’ a God - do - it - all an’ Simms is de onliest one in this town whut will buck up to him.
#SISTER JONES.
Hello, Hoyt, hello, Lucy.

Naw, I reckon—don’t make such difference to me which way de drop fall…. ’Tain’t neither one of ’em much good.
#SISTER TAYLOR.
I know it. I know it, Ida. But dat ain’t de point. De crow we wants to pick is: Is we gointer set still an’ let dese Baptist tell us when to plant an’ when to pluck up?
#SISTER JONES.
Dat is something to think about when you come to think ’bout it. Guess I better go ahead—see y’all later an tell you straighter.
#SIMMS.

#SISTER TAYLOR.
Brother Mayor, I ain’t one of these folks dat bite my tongue an’ bust my gall—whut’s inside got to come out! I can’t see to my rest why you cloakin’in wid dese Baptist buzzards ’ginst yo’ own church.
#MAYOR CLARK.
I ain’t cloakin’in wid none. I’m de Mayor of dis whole town I stands for de right an’ ginst de wrong—I don’t keer who it kill or cure.
#SISTER THOMAS.
You think it’s right to be runnin’dat boy off for nothin’?
#JOE CLARK.
I God! You call knockin’a man in de head wid a mule bone nothin’? ’Nother thin; I done missed nine of my best - layin’hens. I ain’t sayin’Jim got ’em, but different people has tole me he burries a powerful lot of feathers in his back yard. I God, I’m a ruint man! I God, Lum, I been lookin’for you all day. It’s almost three o’clock. Take dis key an’ go fetch Jim Weston on to de church.
#LUM BOGER.

#LUM BOGER.

#SISTER THOMAS.
I better go put dese greens on. My husband will kill me if he don’t find no supper ready. Here come Mrs. Blunt. She oughter feel like a penny’s worth of have - mercy wid all dis stink behind her daughter.
#SISTER TAYLOR.
Chile, some folks don’t keer. They don’t raise they chillun; they drags ’em up. God knows if dat Daisy wuz mine, I’d throw her down an’ put a hundred lashes on her back wid a plow - line. Here she come in de store Sat’day night a wringing and a twisting!
#MRS. BLUNT.
How y’all sisters?
#SISTER THOMAS.
Very well, Miz Blunt, how you?
#MRS. BLUNT.
Oh, so - so.
#MRS. TAYLOR.
I’m kickin’, but not high.
#MRS. BLUNT.
Well, thank God you still on prayin’ground an’ in a Bible country. Me, I ain’t so many today. De niggers got my Daisy’s name all mixed up in dis mess.
#MRS. TAYLOR.
You musn’t mind dat, Sister Blunt. People jus’ will talk. They’s talkin’in New York an’ they’s talkin’in Georgy an’ they’s talkin’in Italy.
#SISTER THOMAS.
Chile, if you talk folkses talk, they’ll have you in de graveyard or in Chattahoochee one. You can’t pay no ’tention to talk.
#MRS. BLUNT.
Well, I know one thing. De man or women, chick or child, grizzly or gray, that tells me to my face anything wrong ’bout my chile, I’m goin’to take my fist and knock they teeth down they throat. ’Case y’all know I raised my Daisy right round my feet till I let her go up north last year wid them white folks. I’d ruther her to be in de white folks’ kitchen than walkin’de streets like some of dese girls round here. If I do say so, I done raised a lady. She can’t help it if all dese mens get stuck on her.
#MRS. TAYLOR.
You’se tellin’de truth, Sister Blunt. That’s whut I always say: Don’t confidence dese niggers. Do, they’ll sho put you in de street.
#MRS. THOMAS.
Naw indeed, never syndicate wid niggers. Do, they will distriminate you. They’ll be an anybody. You goin’to de trial, ain’t you?
#MRS. BLUNT.
Just as sho as you snore. An’ they better leave Daisy’s name outa dis, too. I done told her and told her to come straight home from her work. Naw, she had to stop by dat store and skin her gums back wid dem trashy niggers. She better not leave them white folks today to come traipsin’over here scornin’her name all up wid dis nigger mess. Do, I’ll kill her. No daughter of mine ain’t goin’to do as she please, long as she live under de sound of my voice.
#MRS. THOMAS.
That’s right, Sister Blunt. I glory in yo’ spunk. Lord, I better go put on my supper.
#CHILDERS.
Good evenin’, folks.

#DAISY.
Oh, hello, Jim.

#JIM.
You don’t have to go way over there to find dat out ... you and Dave done got me run outa town for nothin’.
#DAISY.
Dey didn’t run you outa town, did dey?
#JIM.
Whut you reckon I’m countin’ Mr. Railroad’s ties for ... just to find out how many ties between here and Orlando?
#DAISY.

#JIM.
Take yo’ hands off me, Daisy! How come they cain’t run me off wid you and Dave an’ ... everybody ’ginst me?
#DAISY.

#JIM.
Aw, go ’head on. You figgered I was gone too long to talk about. You was haulin’ it over to town to see Dave ... dat’s whut you was doin’ ... after gittin’ me all messed up.
#DAISY.
I wasn’t studyin’ ’bout no Dave.
#JIM.
Aw, don’t tell me. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, show me a woman that a man can trust.
#JIM.
What you crying for? You know you love Dave. I’m yo’ monkey - man. He always could do more wid you that I could.
#DAISY.
Naw, you ain’t no monkey - man neither. I don’t want you to leave town. I didn’t want y’all to be fightin’ over me, nohow.
#JIM.
Aw, rock on down de road wid dat stuff. A two - timin’ cloaker like you don’t keer whut come off. Me and Dave been good friends ever since we was born till you had to go flouncing yourself around.
#DAISY.
What did I do? All I did was to come over town to see you and git a mouf - ful of gum. Next thing I know y’all is fighting and carrying on. JrM: Did you come over there Sat’ - day night to see me sho nuff, sugar babe?
#DAISY.
Everybody could see dat but you.
#JIM.
Just like I told you, Daisy, before you ever left from round here and went up North. I could kiss you every day ... just as regular as pig - tracks.
#DAISY.
And I tole you I could stand it too—just as regular as you could.
#JIM.
Set down, here, Daisy. Less talk some chat. You want me sho nuff? Hones’ to God?
#DAISY.

#DAISY.

#JIM.

#JIM.

#DAISY.

#DAVE.
Whut y’all jumpin’ up for? I .
#JIM.

#DAVE.

#JIM.
Oh, yeah, Mr. Do - Dirty! You figgered you had done run me on off so you could git Daisy all by yo’self. You was headin’ right for her work - place.
#DAVE.
I wasn’t no such a thing.
#JIM.
You was. Didn’t I hear you coming down de track all whistling and everything?
#DAVE.
Youse a big ole Georgy - something - ain’t - so! I done got my belly full of Daisy Sat’day night. She can’t snore in my ear no more.
#DAISY.
Whut you come here low - ratin’ me for, Dave Carter? I ain’t done nothin’ to you but treat you white. Who come rubbed yo’ ole head for you yestiddy if it wasn’t me?
#DAVE.
Yeah, you rubbed my head all right, and I lakted dat. But everybody say you done toted a pan to Joe Clarke’s barn for Jim before I seen you.
#DAISY.
Think I was going to let Jim lay there ’thout nothing fitten for a dog to eat?
#DAVE.
That’s all right, Daisy. If you want to pay Jim for knockin’ me in de head, all right. But I’m a man in a class ... in a class to myself and nobody knows my name.
#JIM.
Was you over to Dave’s house yestiddy rubbing his ole head and cloaking wid him to run me outa town ... and me looked up in dat barn wid de cows and mules?
#DAISY.
All both of y’all hollerin’ at me an’ fussin’ me just cause I tries to be nice... and neither one of y’all don’t keer nothin’ bout me.
#DAISY.
Leave me go! Take yo’ rusty pams offen me. I’m going on back to my work - place. I just got off to see bout y’all and look how y’all treat me.
#JIM.
Wait a minute, Daisy. I love you like God loves Gabriel ... and dat’s His best angel.
#DAVE.
Daisy, I love you harder than de thunder can bump a sump ... if I don’t ... God’s a gopher.
#DAISY.
Dat’s de first time you ever said so. & JIM. Who?
#JIM.
Whut you hollering “Who” for? Yo’ fat don’t fit no limb.
#DAVE.
Speak when you spoken to ... come when you called, next fall you’ll be my coon houn’ dog.
#JIM.
Table dat discussion. You ain’t never give me no chance to talk wid you right. made me feel like you was trying to put de Ned book on me all de time. Do you love me sho nuff, Daisy?
#DAISY.
Aw, y’all better stop dat. You know you don’t mean it.
#DAVE.
Who don’t mean it? Lemme tell you something, mama, if you was mine I wouldn’t have you counting no ties wid yo’ pretty lil toes. Know whut I’d do?
#DAISY.
Naw, whut would you do?
#DAVE.
I’d buy you a whole passenger train ... and hire some mens to run it for you.
#DAISY.
Oo - ooh, Dave.
#JIM.
De wind may blow, de doorway slam Dat shut you shootin’ ain’t worth a dam. I’d buy you a great big ole ship ... and then, baby, I’d buy you a ocean to sail yo’ ship on. Daisy: Oo - ooh, Jim.
#DAVE.
Miss Daisy, know what I’d do for you?
#DAISY.
Naw, whut?
#DAVE.
I’d come down de river riding a mud cat and loading a minnow.
#DAISY.
Lawd, Dave, you sho is propaganda.
#JIM.
Naw he ain’t ... he’s just lying ... he’s a noble liar. Know whut I’d do if you was mine?
#DAISY.
Naw, Jim.
#JIM.
I’d make a panther wash yl’ dishes and a ’gater chop yo’ wood for you.
#DAVE.
Daisy, how come you let Jim lie lak dat? He’s as big as a liar as he is a man. But sho nuff now, laying all sides to jokes, Jim there don’t even know how to answer you. If you don’t b’lieve it ... ast him something.
#DAISY.
You like me much, Jim?
#JIM.
Yeah, Daisy I sho do.
#DAVE.
See dat! I tole you he didn’t know how to answer nobody like you. If he was talking to some of them ol’ funny looking gals over town he’d be answering ’em just right. But he got to learn how to answer you. Now you ast me something and see how I answer you.
#DAISY.
Do you like me, Dave?
#DAVE.
Yes ma’am! Dat’s de way to answer swell folks like you. Furthermore, less we prove which one of us love you do best right now. Jim, how much time would you do on de chain - gang for dis ’oman?
#JIM.
Twenty years and like it.
#DAVE.
See dat, Daisy? Dat nigger ain’t willin’ to do no time for you. I’d beg de judge to gimme life.
#DAISY.
Y’all doin’ all dis bookooin’ out here on de railroad track but I bet y’all crazy ’bout Bootsie and Teets and a whole heap of other gals.
#JIM.
Cross my feet and hope to die! I’d ruther see all de other wimmen folks in de worl’ dead than for you to have de toothache.
#DAVE.
If I was dead and any other woman come near my coffin de undertaker would have to do his job all over ... ’cause I’d git right up and walk off. Furthermore, Miss Daisy, ma’am, also ma’am, which would you ruther be a lark a flying or a dove a settin’ ... ma’am, also ma’am?
#DAISY.
’Course I’d ruther be a dove.
#JIM.
Miss Daisy, ma’am, also ma’am ... if you marry dis nigger over my head, I’m going to git me a green hickory club and season it over yo’ head.
#DAVE.
Don’t you be skeered, baby ... papa kin take keer a you. Countin’ from de finger back to de thumb ... start anything I got you some.
#JIM.
Aw, I don’t want no more fight wid you, Dave.
#DAVE.
Who said anything about fighting? We just provin’ who love Daisy de best. Now, which one of us you think love you de best?
#DAISY.
Deed I don’t know, Dave.
#DAVE.
Baby, I’d walk de water for you ... and tote a mountain on my head while I’m walkin’.
#JIM.
Know what I’d do, honey babe? If you was a thousand miles from home and you didn’t have no ready - made money and you had to walk all de way, walkin’ till ye’ feet start to rolling, just like a wheel, and I was riding way up in de sky, I’d step backwards offa dat aryplane just to walk home wid you.
#DAISY.
Jim, when you talk to me like dat I just can’t stand it. Less us git married right now.
#JIM.
Now you talkin’ like a blue - back speller. Less go!
#DAVE.
You gointer leave me lak dis, Daisy?
#DAISY.
I likes you, too, Dave, I sho do. But I can’t marry both of y’all at de same time.
#JIM.
Aw, come on, Daisy ... sun’s gettin’ low. Whut’s I’m gointer do?
#JIM.
Gwan back and dance ... you make out you don’t need me to play none.
#DAVE.
Aw, Jim, shucks! Where y’all going? Daisy: That’s right, honey. Where is we goin’ sho nuff?
#JIM.
Deed I don’t know, baby. They just sentenced me to go ... they didn’t say where and I don’t know.
#DAISY.
How we goin’ nohow to go when we don’t know where we goin’?
#DAISY.
Jim! Wait a minute! Whut we gointer do when we git there?
#JIM.
Where?
#DAISY.
Where we goin’?
#JIM.
I done tole you I don’t know where it is.
#DAISY.
But how we gointer git something to eat and a place to stay?
#JIM.
Play and dance ... just like I been doin’.
#DAISY.
You can’t dance and Dave ain’t gointer be ther.
#JIM.
Well, I can’t help dat, can I?
#DAISY.
I tell you whut, Jim! Less us don’t go nowhere. They sentenced you to leave Eatonville and youse more than a mile from de city limits already. Youse in Maitland now. Supposin’ you come live on de white folks’ place wid me after we git married. Eatonville ain’t got nothin’ to do wid you livin’ in Maitland.
#JIM.
Dat’a a good idea, Daisy.
#DAISY.
And listen, honey, you don’t have to be beholden to Dave nor nobody else. You can throw dat ole box away if you want to. I know ehre you can get a swell job.
#JIM.
Doin’ whut?
#DAISY.
Yard man. All you have to do is wash windows, and sweep de sidewalk, and scrub off de steps and porch and hoe up de weeds and rake up de leaves and dig a few holes now and then with a spade ... to plant some trees and things like that. It’s a good steady job.
#JIM.
You see, Daisy, de Mayor and corporation told me to go on off and I oughter go.
#DAISY.
Well, I’m not going tippin’ down no railroad track like a Maltese cat. I wasn’t brought up knockin’ round from here to yonder.
#JIM.
Well, I wasn’t brought up wid no spade in my hand ... and ain’t going to start it now.
#DAISY.
But sweetheart, we got to live, ain’t we? We got to git hold of money before we kin do anything. I don’t mean to stay in de white folks’ kitchen all my days.
#JIM.
Yeah, all dat’s true, but you couldn’t buy a flea a waltzing jacket wid de money I’m going to make wid a hoe and spade.
#DAISY.
You don’t want me. You don’t love me.
#JIM.
Yes, I do, darling, I love you. Youse de one letting a spade come between us. I loves you and you only. You don’t see me dragging a whole gang of farming tools into us business, do you?
#DAISY.
Well, I ain’t going to marry no man that ain’t going to work and take care of me.
#JIM.
I don’t mind working if de job ain’t too heavy for me. I ain’t going to bother wid nothin’ in my hands heavier than dis box ... and I totes it round my neck ’most of de time.
#DAISY.
Well, I reckon you loves me the best anyhow. You wouldn’t talk to me like Jim did, would you, Dave?
#DAVE.
Naw, I wouldn’t say what he said a - tall.
#DAISY.
Whut would you say, honey?
#DAVE.
I’d say dat box was too heavy for me to fool wid. I wouldn’t tote nothing heavier than my hat and I feel like I’m ’busing myself sometime totin’ dat.
#DAISY.
Don’t you mean to work none?
#DAVE.
Wouldn’t hit a lick at a snake.
#DAISY.
I don’t blame you, Dave cause toting dem feet of yourn is enough to break down your constitution.
#JIM.
That’s all right ... dem foots done put plenty bread in our moufs.
#DAVE.
Not by they selves though ... wid de help of dat box, Jim. When you gits having fits on dat box, boy, my foots has hysterics. Daisy, you marry Jim cause I don’t want to come between y’all. He’s my buddy.
#JIM.
Come to think of it, Dave, she was yourn first. You take and handle dat spade for her.
#DAVE.
You heard her say it is all I can do to lift up dese feets and put ’em down. Where I’m going to git any time to wrassle wid any hoes and shovels? You kin git round better’n me. You done won Daisy ... I give in. I ain’t going to bite no fren’ of mine in de back.
#DAISY.
Both of you niggers can git yo’ hat an’ yo’ heads and git on down de road. Neither one of y’all don’t have to have me. I got a good job and plenty men beggin for yo’ chance.
#JIM.
Dat’s right, Daisy, you go git you one them mens whut don’t mind smelling mules ... and beating de white folks to de barn every morning. I don’t wanta be bothered wid nothin’ but dis box.
#DAVE.
And I can’t strain wid nothin’ but my feets.
#DAVE.
Guess I better be gittin’ on back ... it’s most dark. Where you goin’ Jim?
#JIM.
I don’t know, Dave. Down de road, I reckon.
#DAVE.
Whyncher come on back to town. ’Tain’t no use you proguein’ up and down de railroad track when you got a home.
#JIM.
They done lawed me way from it for hittin’ you wid dat bone.
#DAVE.
Dat ain’t nothin’. It was my head you hit. An’ if I don’t keer whut dem old ugly - rump niggers got to do wid it?
#JIM.
They might not let me come in town.
#DAVE.
They better! Look here, Jim, if they try to keep you out dat town we’ll go out to dat swamp and git us a mule bone a piece and come into town and boil dat stew down to a low gravy.
#JIM.
You mean dat, Dave? Us wasn’t mad wid one ’nother nohow. Come on, less go back to town. Dem mallet - heads better leave me be, too. I wish Lum would come tellin’ me ’bout de law when I got all dis law in my hands. And de rest o’ dem gator - faced jigs, if they ain’t got a whole sto’ o’ mule bones and a good determination, they better not bring no mess up. Come on, boy.
