#FRANÇOIS.
Who has called me? I hear you, Monsieur Emil, I am here. Who is calling me? No one here. They say I am deaf. But I heard some one calling me twice: "François!" "François!" No, perhaps it is my blood, making a noise in my ears. I can still hear some one calling me: "François!" Very well; here is François, and if anyone needs me he may call me again. I shall not run. I can't hear the chirping of the birds; the birds have long since become silent for me. What nonsense - these birds! Very well, I am deaf - does anyone think I am going to cry over it? And my eyes? That is another matter. My eyes! Why are you forever silent, François? Why should I speak if I do not hear your foolish answer? It is all nonsense - to talk and to listen. I can see more than you can hear. Yes, I see this. This does not talk either, but bend down to it and you will learn more than Solomon ever knew. That is what the Bible says - Solomon. To you the earth is noise and prattle, while to me it is like a Madonna in colors upon a picture. Like a Madonna in colors.
#MAURICE.
François, what is the matter with you? I am calling you. I am calling you. Haven't you seen papa?
#FRANÇOIS.
Did you call me, Maurice? I heard your call long ago.
#MAURICE.
You heard me, but did not respond. How obstinate you are! Haven't you seen papa? I am looking for him everywhere. Quick! Where is papa?
#FRANÇOIS.
Papa?
#MAURICE.
Where is papa? Haven't you seen him? Silvina says he went to the hothouse. Do you hear?
#FRANÇOIS.
He is not there. I spoke to Monsieur this morning, but since then I have not seen him. No.
#MAURICE.
What is to be done? How they are tolling! François, what is to be done - do you hear them tolling?
#FRANÇOIS.
Ah! I hear. Will you take some roses, my boy?
#MAURICE.
You don't understand anything - you are beyond endurance! They are running in the streets, they are all running there, and papa is not here. I will run over there, too, at once. Perhaps he is there. What a day!
#FRANÇOIS.
Who is running?
#MAURICE.
You don't understand anything! They have entered Belgium!
#FRANÇOIS.
Who has entered Belgium?
#MAURICE.
They - the Prussians. Can't you understand? It's war! War! Imagine what will happen. Pierre will have to go, and so will I go. I will not stay here under any circumstances.
#FRANÇOIS.
War? What nonsense, my boy! Who has entered Belgium?
#MAURICE.
They - the Prussians. Pierre will go now, and I will go - I will not stay away under any circumstances, understand? What will become of Belgium now? - it is hard to conceive it. They entered Belgium yesterday - do you understand - what scoundrels!
#MAURICE.
François!
#FRANÇOIS.
That's all nonsense! What are you prating, my boy? There is no war - that is impossible.
#MAURICE.
You are a foolish old man, yourself! They have entered Belgium - do you understand - they are here already.
#FRANÇOIS.
That's not true.
#MAURICE.
Why isn't it true?
#FRANÇOIS.
Because that is impossible. The newspapers print nonsense, and they have all gone mad. Fools, and nothing more - madmen. What Prussians? Young man, you have no right to make sport of me like this.
#MAURICE.
But listen -
#FRANÇOIS.
Prussians! What Prussians? I don't know any Prussians, and I don't want to know them.
#MAURICE.
But understand, old man, they are already bombarding Liège!
#FRANÇOIS.
No!
#MAURICE.
They have killed many people. What a strange man you are! Don't you hear the tolling of the bells? The people are on the square. They are all running. The women are crying. What is that?
#FRANÇOIS.
You are stepping on the flower bed. Get off!
#MAURICE.
Don't bother me! Why are they shouting so loudly? Something has happened there.
#MAURICE.
Now they are quiet.... What does it mean?
#FRANÇOIS.
Nonsense, nonsense! You are stepping on the flower bed again. Get off! You have all lost your reason! Go, go! The Prussians!...
#MAURICE.
You have lost your reason!
#FRANÇOIS.
I am seventy years old, and you tell me about the Prussians. Go!
#SILVINA.
Please, come into the house. Madame Jeanne is calling you. Madame is going away. Please, come.
#MAURICE.
And papa?
#SILVINA.
He isn't here yet. Come!
#MAURICE.
You don't understand, Silvina. He does not believe that there is a war.
#SILVINA.
It is very dreadful, Monsieur Maurice. I am afraid -
#FRANÇOIS.
Madmen! I am seventy years old. I am seventy years old, and they want me to believe a story about Prussians. Nonsense, they are crazy! Prussians! But it is true that I don't hear anything. No, not a sound. Or do I hear something? Oh, the devil take it! I can't hear a sound. Impossible! No, no, impossible! But what is that? How could I believe that in this calm sky - in this calm sky - I hear it. No. No. Now I don't hear a sound. Oh, God, give me the power to hear! My God! They are tolling! They are crying! War! What war? What war? Eh, who is there - who is shouting "War!"?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
What are you shouting, François? Where is Maurice? No one is in the house.
#FRANÇOIS.
Is it war?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, yes, it is war. The Prussians have entered Belgium. But you don't hear anything.
#FRANÇOIS.
I hear, I hear; are they killing?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, they are killing. The Prussians have entered Belgium. Where is Maurice?
#FRANÇOIS.
But, Monsieur Emil - but, Monsieur, what Prussians? Pardon me; I am seventy years old, and I lost my sense of hearing long ago. Is it really a war?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, it is a real war. I can't understand it either. But the fighting has already commenced. I can't realize it myself, but it is war, old man.
#FRANÇOIS.
Tell me, Monsieur. Tell me about it. I believe you as I believe God. Tell me. I can hear you. Are they killing?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
It is war! What horror, François. It is very hard to understand it - yes, very hard.
#FRANÇOIS.
And the flowers? Our flowers?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Our flowers? Don't cry, François - ah, what is that?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Our people are expecting the King there - he is on his way to Liège! Yes, yes -
#EMIL GRELIEU.
How many kilometers?
#PIERRE.
Twenty - five or thirty kilometers to Tirlemont - and here -
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Seventy - four or five -
#PIERRE.
Seventy - five - yes, about a hundred kilometers. It's not far, father.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Not far. It seemed to me that I heard cannonading. I heard it last night.
#PIERRE.
No, it's hardly possible.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, I was mistaken. But the rays of the searchlights could be seen. They must be very powerful searchlights. Mamma saw them too.
#PIERRE.
Really? You are suffering from insomnia again, father?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I sleep well. A hundred kilometers - a hundred kilometers -
#PIERRE.
Father!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Well? It's too early for you, Pierre - you have three hours yet before your train starts. I am watching the time.
#PIERRE.
I know, father. No, I am thinking of something else - Father, tell me, have you still any hopes? I am hesitating, I feel somewhat embarrassed to speak to you - you are so much wiser, so far above me, father.... Yes, yes, it's nonsense, of course, but that which I have learned in the army during these days gives me very little hope. They are coming in such a compact mass of people, of iron, machines, arms and horses, that there is no possibility of stopping them. It seems to me that seismographs must indicate the place over which they pass - they press the ground with such force. And we are so few in number!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, we are very few in number.
#PIERRE.
Very, very few, father! Dreadfully few! Even if we were invulnerable and deathless, even if we kept killing them off day and night, day and night, we would drop from fatigue and exhaustion before we stopped them. But we are mortal - and they have terrible guns, father! You are silent? You are thinking of our Maurice - I have caused you pain?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
There is little of the human in their movements. Do not think of Maurice - he will live. A human being has a face, Pierre. Every human being has his own face, but they have no faces. When I try to picture them to myself, I see only the lights, projectors, automobiles - those terrible guns - and something walking, walking. And those vulgar mustaches of Wilhelm - but that is a mask, an immobile mask, which has stood over Europe for a quarter of a century - what is behind it? Those vulgar mustaches - and suddenly so much misery, so much bloodshed and destruction! It is a mask!
#PIERRE.
If there were only not so many of them, not so many - Father, I believe that Maurice will live. He is a lucky boy. But what does mamma think about it?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
What mamma thinks? And what does he think? Look at him.
#PIERRE.
He can hardly hear anything. François!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I don't know whether he hears anything or not. But there was a time when he did hear. He is silent, Pierre, and he furiously denies war. He denies it by work - he works alone in the garden as if nothing had happened. Our house is full of refugees. Mamma and everyone else in the house are busy, feeding them, washing the children - mamma is washing them - but he does not seem to notice anything. He denies war! Now he is bursting from anxiety to hear or guess what we are saying, but do you see the expression of his face? If you start to talk to him he will go away.
#PIERRE.
François!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Don't bother him. He wants to be crafty. Perhaps he hears us. You ask me what mother is thinking of. Do I know? Who can tell? You see that she is not here, and yet these are your last hours at home. Yes, in this house - I am speaking of the house. She is young and resolute as ever, she walks just as lightly and is just as clear - headed, but she is not here. She is simply not here, Pierre.
#PIERRE.
Is she concealing something?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
No, she is not concealing anything, but she has gone into the depths of her own self, where all is silence and mystery. She is living through her motherhood again, from the very beginning - do you understand? when you and Maurice were not yet born - but in this she is crafty, like François. Sometimes I see clearly that she is suffering unbearably, that she is terrified by the war - But she smiles in answer and then I see something else - I see how there has suddenly awakened in her the prehistoric woman - the woman who handed her husband the fighting club - Wait, the soldiers are coming again!
#PIERRE.
Yes, according to the assignment, it is the Ninth Regiment.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Let us hear it, Pierre. I hear this music several times a day. There it starts on the right, and there it dies down. Always there. But they are brave fellows!
#PIERRE.
Yes.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yesterday they played the "Marseillaise." But they are brave fellows!
#JEANNE.
Do you hear it? How beautiful! Even our refugees smiled when they heard it. Emil, I have brought you some telegrams, here. I have read them.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
What is it? Let me have them!
#PIERRE.
What is it, father?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Read!
#PIERRE.
Do you see?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes.
#PIERRE.
Do you see?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes! Yes!
#JEANNE.
Emil, was that an interesting library which they have destroyed? I don't know.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, very. But what are you asking me, Jeanne? How can you speak?
#JEANNE.
Oh, I speak only of those books! Tell me, were there many books there?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, many, many!
#JEANNE.
And they've burned them? "Only the halo of the arts crowns law, liberty, and the King! - Law - "
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Books, books.
#JEANNE.
And there was also a Cathedral there. Oh, I remember it! Isn't it true, Emil, that it was a beautiful structure? "Law, liberty, and the King - "
#PIERRE.
Father! What?
#JEANNE.
Pierre, it will soon be time for you to leave. I'll give you something to eat at once. Pierre, do you think it is true that they are killing women and children? I don't know.
#PIERRE.
It is true, mother.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
How can you say it, Jeanne? You don't know?
#JEANNE.
I say this on account of the children. Yes, there they write that they are killing children, so they write there. And all this was crowded upon that little slip of paper - and the children, as well as the fire -
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Where are you going, Jeanne?
#JEANNE.
Nowhere in particular. François, do you hear? They are murdering our women and children. François! François!
#PIERRE.
Mamma!
#JEANNE.
I will return directly.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
What shall I call them? What can I call them? My dear Pierre, my boy, what shall I call them?
#PIERRE.
You are greatly agitated, father.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I have always thought, I have always been convinced that words were at my command, but here I stand before this monstrous, inexplicable - I don't know, I don't know what to call them. My heart is crying out, I hear its voice, but the word! Pierre, you are a student, you are young, your words are direct and pure - Pierre, find the word!
#PIERRE.
You want me to find it, father? Yes, I was a student, and I knew certain words: Peace, Right, Humanity. But now you see! My heart is crying too, but I do not know what to call these scoundrels. Scoundrels? That is not sufficient. Not sufficient.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
That is not strong enough. Pierre, I have decided -
#PIERRE.
Decided?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, I am going.
#PIERRE.
You, father?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I decided to do it several days ago - even then, at the very beginning. And I really don't know why I - Oh, yes, I had to overcome within me - my love for flowers. Yes, Pierre, my love for flowers. Oh, my boy, it is so hard to change from flowers to iron and blood!
#PIERRE.
Father, I dare not contradict you.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
No, no, you dare not. It is not necessary. Listen, Pierre, you must examine me as a physician.
#PIERRE.
I am only a student, father.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, but you know enough to say - You see, Pierre, I must not burden our little army with a single superfluous sick or weak man. Isn't that so? I must bring with me strength and power, not shattered health. Isn't that so? And I am asking you, Pierre, to examine me, simply as a physician, as a young physician. But I feel somewhat embarrassed with you - Must I take this off, or can you do it without removing this?
#PIERRE.
It can be done this way.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I think so, too. And - must I tell you everything, or - ? At any rate, I will tell you that I have not had any serious ailments, and for my years I am a rather strong, healthy man. You know what a life I am leading.
#PIERRE.
That is unnecessary, father.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
It is necessary. You are a physician. I want to say that in my life there were none of those unwholesome - and bad excesses. Oh, the devil take it, how hard it is to speak of it.
#PIERRE.
Papa, I know all this.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
But it is necessary to take my pulse, Pierre, I beg of you.
#PIERRE.
It isn't necessary to do even that. As a physician, I can tell you that you are healthy, but - you are unfit for war, you are unfit for war, father! I am listening to you and I feel like crying, father.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, yes. But perhaps it is not necessary to cry. Do you think, Pierre, that I should not kill? Pierre, you think, that I, Emil Grelieu, must not kill under any circumstances and at any time?
#PIERRE.
I dare not touch upon your conscience, father.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, that is a terrible question for a man. I must kill, Pierre. Of course, I could take your gun, but not to fire - no, that would have been disgusting, a sacrilegious deception! When my humble people are condemned to kill, who am I that I should keep my hands clean? That would be disgusting cleanliness, obnoxious saintliness. My humble nation did not desire to kill, but it was forced, and it has become a murderer. So I, too, must become a murderer, together with my nation. Upon whose shoulders will I place the sin - upon the shoulders of our youths and children? No, Pierre. And if ever the Higher Conscience of the world will call my dear people to the terrible accounting, if it will call you and Maurice, my children, and will say to you: "What have you done? You have murdered!" I will come forward and will say: "First you must judge me; I have also murdered - and you know that I am an honest man!"
#PIERRE.
But you must not die! You have no right!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Oh, death!
#JEANNE.
Emil, she is here again.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes? She is here again. Where has she been the last two nights?
#JEANNE.
She does not know herself. Emil, her dress and her hands were in blood.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
She is wounded?
#JEANNE.
No, it is not her own blood, and by the color I could not tell whose blood it is.
#PIERRE.
Who is that, mother? girl. Just a girl. She's insane. I have combed her hair and put a clean dress on her. She has beautiful hair. Emil, I have heard something - I understand that you want to go - ?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes.
#JEANNE.
Together with your children, Emil?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes. Pierre has examined me and finds that I am fit to enter the ranks.
#JEANNE.
You intend to go tomorrow?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes.
#JEANNE.
You cannot manage it today. Pierre, you have only an hour and a half left.
#PIERRE.
Mamma! Tell him that he must not - Forgive me, father! - that he should not go. Isn't that true, mother? Tell him! He has given to the nation his two sons - what more should he give? He has no right to give more.
#JEANNE.
More, Pierre?
#PIERRE.
Yes, - his life. You love him; you, yourself, would die if he were killed - tell him that, mother!
#JEANNE.
Yes, I love him. I love you, too.
#PIERRE.
Oh, what are we, Maurice and I? But he! Just as they have no right to destroy temples in war or to bum libraries, just as they have no right to touch the eternal, so he - he - has no right to die. I am speaking not as your son, no; but to kill Emil Grelieu - that would be worse than to bum books. Listen to me! You have brought me into this world. Listen to me! - although I am young and should be silent - Listen to me! They have already robbed us. They have deprived us of our land and of the air; they have destroyed our treasures which have been created by the genius of our people, and now we would cast our best men into their jaws! What does that mean? What will remain of us? Let them kill us all, let our land be turned into a waste desert, let all living creatures be burned to death, but as long as he lives, Belgium is alive! What is Belgium without him? Oh, do not be silent, mother! Tell him!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Calm yourself, Pierre!
#JEANNE.
Yesterday I - no, Pierre, that isn't what I was going to say - I don't know anything about it. How could I know? But yesterday I - it is hard to get vegetables, and even bread, here - so I went to town, and for some reason we did not go in that direction, but nearer the field of battle - How strange it is that we found ourselves there! And there I saw them coming -
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Whom?
#JEANNE.
Our soldiers. They were coming from there - where the battle raged for four days. There were not many of them - about a hundred or two hundred. But we all - there were so many people in the streets - we all stepped back to the wall in order to make way for them. Emil, just think of it; how strange! They did not see us, and we would have been in their way! They were black from smoke, from mud, from dried blood, and they were swaying from fatigue. They were all thin - as consumptives. But that is nothing, that is all nothing. Their eyes - what was it, Emil? They did not see their surroundings, they still reflected that which they had seen there - fire and smoke and death - and what else? Some one said: "Here are people returning from hell." We all bowed to them, we bowed to them, but they did not see that either. Is that possible, Emil?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, Jeanne, that is possible.
#PIERRE.
And he will go to that inferno?
#JEANNE.
Forgive me; there is something else I must say -
#PIERRE.
Mamma! Mamma!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
You have a headache? Jeanne, my dearest, what ails you?
#JEANNE.
What is it? What? Don't trouble, Emil! My head? No, no! My foot slipped - you know, the one that pained me. You see, I can walk now. glass of water, Pierre.
#JEANNE.
What for? How absurd!
#JEANNE.
What an excitable youth - your Pierre! Did you hear what he said?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Jeanne!
#JEANNE.
What? No, no - why do you look at me this way? No - I am telling you.
#JEANNE.
Thank you, Pierre, but I don't want it. How fragrant the flowers are. Pierre, please give me that rose - yes, that one. Thank you. How fresh it is, Emil, and what a fine fragrance - come over here, Emil!
#JEANNE.
No; I have asked for this flower simply because its fragrance seems to me immortal - it is always the same - as the sky. How strange it is, always the same. And when you bring it close to your face, and close to your eyes, it seems to you that there is nothing except this red rose and the blue sky. Nothing but the red rose and the distant, pale - very pale - blue sky....
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Pierre! Listen to me, my boy! People speak of this only at night, when they are alone with their souls - and she knows it, but you do not know it yet. Don't you know it, Jeanne?
#JEANNE.
Yes, I know, Emil.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
The life of the poet does not belong to him. The roof over the heads of people, which shelters them - all that is a phantom for me, and my life does not belong to me. I am always far away, not here - I am always where I am not. You think of finding me among the living, while I am dead; you are afraid of finding me in death, mute, cold, doomed to decay, while I live and sing aloud from my grave. Death which makes people mute, which leaves the imprint of silence upon the bravest lips, restores the voice to the poet. Dead, I speak more loudly than alive. Dead, I am alive! Am I - just think of it, Pierre, my boy, - am I to fear death when in my most persistent searches I could not find the boundary between life and death, when in my feelings I mix life and death into one - as two strong, rare kinds of wine? Just think of it, my boy!
#PIERRE.
Forgive me, father!
#JEANNE.
Take this rose, Pierre, and when it fades and falls apart tear down another rose - it will have the same fragrance as this one. You are a foolish little boy, Pierre, but I am also foolish, although Emil is so kind that he thinks differently. Will you be in the same regiment, Emil?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
No, hardly, Jeanne.
#PIERRE.
Father, it is better that we be in the same regiment. I will arrange it, father - will you permit me? And I will teach you how to march - You know, I am going to be your superior officer.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Very well.
#JEANNE.
"Only the halo of the arts is crowning - law, liberty, and the King." Who is that? Ah, you! Look, Pierre, here is the girl you wished to see. Come in, come in, my dear child! Don't be afraid, come in! You know him. That's my husband. He is a very good man and will do you no harm. And this is my son, Pierre. Give him your hand.
#MARY.
Oh, that is a soldier! Be so kind, soldier, tell me how to go to Lonua. I have lost my way.
#PIERRE.
I do not know, Mademoiselle.
#MARY.
Who knows? It is time for me to go.
#JEANNE.
Sit down, child, take a rest, my dear, give your poor feet a rest. Pierre, her feet are wounded, yet she wants to walk all the time.
#ELDERLY WOMAN.
I wanted to stop her, Monsieur Pierre, but it is impossible to stop her. If we close the door before her the poor girl beats her head against the walls, like a bird in a cage. Poor girl!
#MARY.
It is time for me to go.
#JEANNE.
Rest yourself, here, my child! Why should you leave? At night it is so terrible on the roads. There, in the dark air, bullets are buzzing instead of our dear bees; there wicked people, vicious beasts are roaming. And there is no one who can tell you, for there is no one who knows how to go to Lonua.
#MARY.
Don't you know how I could find my way to Lonua?
#PIERRE.
What is she asking? Emil GRELIEU Oh, you may speak louder; she can hear as little as François. She is asking about the village which the Prussians have set on fire. Her home used to be there - now there are only ruins and corpses there. There is no road that leads to Lonua!
#MARY.
Don't you know it, either? No one knows. I have asked everybody, and no one can tell me how to find my way to Lonua. I must hurry. They are waiting for me there. Tell me; you are kindhearted! Don't you know the way to Lonua?
#JEANNE.
Sit down, little girl. He does not know.
#MARY.
I am asking, and they are silent.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I suppose she is also asking the bodies of the dead that lie in the fields and in the ditches how to go to Lonua.
#JEANNE.
Her hands and her dress were bloodstained. She was walking all night. Take a rest, my little one! I will hold you in my arms, and you will feel better and more comfortable, my little child.
#MARY.
Tell me, how can I find my way to Lonua?
#JEANNE.
Yes, yes, come! Emil, I will go with her to my room. There she will feel more comfortable. Come along, my dear. I'll hold you. Come!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Lonua! A quiet little village which no one ever noticed before - houses, trees, and flowers. Where is it now? Who knows the way to that little village? Pierre, the soul of our people is roaming about in the watches of the night, asking the dead how to find the way to Lonua! Pierre, I cannot endure it any longer! I am suffocating from hatred and anger! Oh, weep, you German Nation - bitter will be the fate of your children, terrible will be your disgrace before the judgment of the free nations!
#HENRIETTE.
My God, my God! How terrible it is! It is burning and burning, and there is no end to the fire!
#SECOND WOMAN.
Yesterday it was burning further away, and tonight the fire is nearer. It is growing nearer. O Lord!
#HENRIETTE.
It is burning and burning, there is no end to the fire! Today the sun was covered in a mist.
#SECOND WOMAN.
It is forever burning, and the sun is growing ever darker! Now it is lighter at night than in the daytime!
#SILVINA.
I am afraid!
#HENRIETTE.
Be silent, Silvina, be silent!
#SECOND WOMAN.
I can't hear a sound. What is binning there? If I close my eyes it seems to me that nothing is going on there. It is so quiet! Even the dogs are not barking!
#HENRIETTE.
I can see all that is going on there even with my eyes closed. Look; it seems the fire is spreading!
#SILVINA.
Oh, I am afraid!
#SECOND WOMAN.
Where is it burning?
#HENRIETTE.
I don't know. It is burning and burning, and there is no end to the fire! It may be that they have all perished by this time. It may be that something terrible is going on there, and we are looking on and know nothing.
#FOURTH WOMAN.
Good evening!
#SILVINA.
Oh!
#HENRIETTE.
Oh, you have frightened us! Good evening, neighbor!
#FOURTH WOMAN.
Good evening, Madame Henrietta! Never mind my coming here - it is terrible to stay in the house! I guessed that you were not sleeping, but here, watching. You can see well from this spot. Don't you know where the fire is?
#SECOND WOMAN.
No. And we can't hear a sound - how quiet!
#HENRIETTE.
It is burning and burning. Haven't you heard anything about your husband?
#FOURTH WOMAN.
No, nothing. I have already stopped weeping.
#HENRIETTE.
And with whom are your children just now?
#FOURTH WOMAN.
Alone. They are asleep. Is it true that Monsieur Pierre was killed? I've heard about it.
#HENRIETTE.
Just imagine! I don't know! I simply cannot understand what is going on! You see, there is no one in the house now, and we are afraid to sleep there -
#SECOND WOMAN.
The three of us sleep here, in the gatekeeper's house.
#HENRIETTE.
I am afraid to look into that house even in the daytime - the house is so large and so empty! And there are no men there, not a soul -
#FOURTH WOMAN.
Is it true that François has gone to shoot the Prussians? I have heard about it.
#HENRIETTE.
Maybe. Everybody is talking about it, but we don't know. He disappeared quietly, like a mouse.
#FOURTH WOMAN.
He will be hanged - the Prussians hang such people!
#HENRIETTE.
Wait, wait! Today, while I was in the garden, I heard the telephone ringing in the house; it was ringing for a long time. I was frightened, but I went in after all - and, just think of it! Some one said: "Monsieur Pierre was killed!"
#SECOND WOMAN.
And nothing more?
#HENRIETTE.
Nothing more; not a word! All grew quiet again. I felt so bad and was so frightened that I could hardly run out. Now I will not enter that house for anything!
#FOURTH WOMAN.
Whose voice was it?
#SECOND WOMAN.
Madame Henrietta says it was an unfamiliar voice.
#HENRIETTE.
Yes, an unfamiliar voice.
#FOURTH WOMAN.
Look! There seems to be a light in the windows of the house - somebody is there!
#SILVINA.
Oh, I am afraid! I can't bear it!
#HENRIETTE.
Oh, what are you saying; what are you saying? There is no one there!
#SECOND WOMAN.
That's from the redness of the sky!
#FOURTH WOMAN.
What if some one is ringing there again?
#HENRIETTE.
How is that possible? At night?
#SECOND WOMAN.
What will become of us? They are coming this way, and there is nothing that can stop them!
#FOURTH WOMAN.
I wish I might die now! When you are dead, you don't hear or see anything.
#HENRIETTE.
It keeps on all night like this - it is burning and burning! And in the daytime it will again be hard to see things on account of the smoke; and the bread will smell of burning! What is going on there?
#FOURTH WOMAN.
They have killed Monsieur Pierre.
#SECOND WOMAN.
They have killed him? Killed him?
#SILVINA.
You must not speak of it! My God, whither should I go! I cannot bear this. I cannot understand it!
#FOURTH WOMAN.
They say there are twenty millions of them, and they have already set Paris on fire. They say they have cannon which can hit a hundred kilometers away.
#HENRIETTE.
My God, my God! And all that is coming upon us!
#SECOND WOMAN.
Merciful God, have pity on us!
#FOURTH WOMAN.
And they are flying and they are hurling bombs from airships - terrible bombs, which destroy entire cities!
#HENRIETTE.
My God! What have they done with the sky! Before this You were alone in the sky, and now those base Prussians are there too!
#SECOND WOMAN.
Before this, when my soul wanted rest and joy I looked at the sky, but now there is no place where a poor soul can find rest and joy!
#FOURTH WOMAN.
They have taken everything away from our Belgium - even the sky! I wish I could die at once! There is no air to breathe now! Listen! Don't you think that now my husband, my husband -
#HENRIETTE.
No, no!
#FOURTH WOMAN.
Why is the sky so red? What is it that is burning there?
#SECOND WOMAN.
Have mercy on us, O God! The fire seems to be moving toward us!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Jeanne!
#JEANNE.
Shall I give you some water?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
No. You are tired.
#JEANNE.
Oh, no, not at all. I was dozing all night. Can't you fall asleep, Emil?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
What time is it?
#JEANNE.
It is still early. Perhaps you will try to fall asleep, Emil? It seems to me that you have been suffering great pain; you have been groaning all night.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
No, I am feeling better. How is the weather this morning?
#JEANNE.
Nasty weather, Emil; you can't see the sun. Try to sleep.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Is the boy getting on well?
#JEANNE.
Don't worry, Emil. He only said a few words in his sleep.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
He has done it several times tonight.
#JEANNE.
I am afraid that he is disturbing you. We can have him removed to another room and Henrietta will stay with him. The boy's blood is in good condition. In another week, I believe, we shall be able to remove the bandage from his arm.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
No, let him stay here, Jeanne.
#JEANNE.
What is it, my dear?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Jeanne!
#JEANNE.
I think your fever has gone down, my dear.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
You are my love, Jeanne.
#JEANNE.
Do not speak, do not speak. Don't agitate yourself.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
It is so hard to breathe here, the air -
#JEANNE.
The window has been open all night, my dear. There is not a breeze outside.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
There is smoke.
#JEANNE.
Yes.
#MAURICE.
- Stop, stop, stop! It is burning, it is burning! Oh! Who is going to the battery, who is going to the battery -
#EMIL GRELIEU.
What painful dreams!
#JEANNE.
That's nothing; the boy always used to talk in his sleep. Yesterday he looked so well.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Jeanne!
#JEANNE.
What is it, my dear?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Sit down.
#JEANNE.
Very well.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Jeanne.... Are you thinking about Pierre?
#JEANNE.
Don't speak of him.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
You are right. Death is not so terrible. Isn't that true, Jeanne?
#JEANNE.
That's true.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
We shall follow him later. He will not come here, but we shall go to him. I was thinking of it at night. It is so clear. Do you remember the red rose which you gave him? I remember it.
#JEANNE.
Yes.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
It is so clear. Jeanne, lean over me. You are the best woman in the world.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
It is so hard to breathe.
#JEANNE.
My dear -
#EMIL GRELIEU.
No, that's nothing. The night is tormenting me. Jeanne, was I dreaming, or have I really heard cannonading?
#JEANNE.
You really heard it, at about five o'clock. But very far away, Emil - it was hardly audible. Close your eyes, my dear, rest yourself.
#MAURICE.
Mamma!
#JEANNE.
Are you awake?
#MAURICE.
Yes. I have slept enough. How is father?
#JEANNE.
He is awake.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Good morning, Maurice.
#MAURICE.
Good morning, papa. How do you feel? I am feeling well.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I, too, am feeling well. Jeanne, you may draw the curtain aside. I can't sleep any longer.
#JEANNE.
Very well. What a nasty day! Still it will be easier for you to breathe when it is light.
#JEANNE.
What are you doing, Maurice?
#MAURICE.
My coat - Never mind, I'll fix it myself. No, mamma, you had better help me.
#JEANNE.
What a foolish boy you are, Maurice. Be careful, be careful, that's the way. Don't hurry, be careful.
#MAURICE.
Pin this for me right here, as you did yesterday. That's very good.
#JEANNE.
Of course. Wait, you'll kiss me later - Well? That's the way.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Good morning, good morning, my dear boy.
#MAURICE.
Papa, look!
#JEANNE.
I am through now. Maurice, come to the bathroom. I'll wash you.
#MAURICE.
Oh, no; under no circumstances. I'll wash myself today. Last night I washed myself with my left hand and it was very fine. How nasty it is. These scoundrels have spoiled the day. Still, it is warm and there is the smell of flowers. It's good, papa; it is very fine.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, it is pleasant.
#MAURICE.
Well, I am going.
#JEANNE.
Clean your teeth; you didn't do it yesterday, Maurice.
#MAURICE.
What's the use of it now? Very well, I'll do it. Papa, do you know, well have good news today; I feel it.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I feel better.
#JEANNE.
I'll let you have your coffee directly. You are looking much better today, much better.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
What is this?
#JEANNE.
Perfume, with water. I'll bathe your face with it That's the way. Now I again have little children to wash. You see how pleasant it feels.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes. What did he say about good news?
#JEANNE.
He didn't mean anything. He is very happy because he is a hero.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Do you know any news?
#JEANNE.
Nothing. What news could there be?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Tell me, Jeanne; you were firmer before. Tell me my dear.
#JEANNE.
Was I firmer? Perhaps.... I have grown accustomed to talk to you softly at night. Well - how shall I tell it to you? They are coming.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Coming?
#JEANNE.
Yes. You know their numbers and ours. Don't be excited, but I think that it will be necessary for us to leave for Antwerp today.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Are they near?
#JEANNE.
Yes, they are near. Very near. "Le Roi, la Loi, la Liberté." Very near. I have not told you that the King inquired yesterday about your health. I answered that you were feeling better and that you will be able to leave today.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Of course I am able to leave today. And what did he say about them?
#JEANNE.
What did the King say? He said that their numbers were too great.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
What else did he say? What else, Jeanne?
#JEANNE.
What else? He said that there was a God and there was righteousness. That's what I believe I heard him say - that there was still a God and that righteousness was still in existence. How old these words are, Emil! But it is so good that they still exist.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, in the daytime you are so different. Where do you get so much strength, Jeanne?
#JEANNE.
Where?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I am forever looking at your hair. I am wondering why it hasn't turned gray.
#JEANNE.
I dye it at night, Emil. I'll bring in some more flowers. Now it is very cozy here. Oh, yes, I haven't told you yet - some one will be here to see you today - Secretary Lagard and some one else by the name of Count Clairmont.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Count Clairmont? I don't know him.
#JEANNE.
It is not necessary that you should know him. He is simply known as Count Clairmont, Count Clairmont - That's a good name for a very good man.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I know a very good man in Belgium -
#JEANNE.
Tsh! You must not know anything. You must only remember - Count Clairmont. They have some important matters to discuss with you, I believe. And they'll send you an automobile, to take you to Antwerp.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Count Clairmont?
#JEANNE.
Yes. You are loved by everybody, but if I were a King, I would have sent you an aeroplane. Ah, how good it would be now to rise from the ground and fly - and fly for a long, long time.
#MAURICE.
I am ready now, I have cleaned my teeth. I've even taken a walk in the garden. But I have never before noticed that we have such a beautiful garden! Papa, our garden is wonderfully beautiful!
#JEANNE.
Coffee will be ready directly. If he disturbs you with his talk, call me, Emil.
#MAURICE.
Oh, I did not mean to disturb you. Forgive me, papa. I'll not disturb you any more.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
You may speak, speak. I am feeling quite well, quite well.
#JEANNE.
But you must save your strength, don't forget that, Emil.
#MAURICE.
Perhaps I really ought not to speak, papa?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Can you be silent?
#MAURICE.
No, father, I cannot just now. I suppose I seem to you very young.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
And what do you think of it yourself?
#MAURICE.
I am no longer as young as I was three weeks ago. Yes, only three weeks ago - I remember the tolling of the bells in our church, I remember how I teased François. How strange that François has been lost and no one knows where he is. What does it mean that a human being is lost and no one knows where he is? Before, one could see everything on earth.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes.
#MAURICE.
Papa! Why do they hang such people as François? That is cruel and stupid. Forgive me for speaking so harshly. But need an old man love his fatherland less than I love it, for instance? The old people love it even more intensely. Let everyone fight as he can. I am not tiring you, am I? An old man came to us, he was very feeble, he asked for bullets - well, let them hang me too - I gave him bullets. A few of our regiment made sport of him, but he said: "If only one Prussian bullet will strike me, it means that the Prussians will have one bullet less." That appealed to me.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, that appeals to me, too. Have you heard the cannonading at dawn?
#MAURICE.
No. Why, was there any cannonading?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes. I heard cannonading. Did mamma tell you that they are coming nearer and nearer? They are approaching.
#MAURICE.
Really? Impossible!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
They are coming, and we must leave for Antwerp today.
#MAURICE.
Yes.
#MAURICE.
Father, tell me: What do you think of the present state of affairs?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Mamma says there is a God and there is righteousness.
#MAURICE.
Mamma says - Let God bless mamma! I don't know - I - Very well, very well. We shall see; we shall see!
#MAURICE.
I still owe them something for Pierre. Forgive me, father; I don't know whether I have a right to say this or not, but I am altogether different from you. It is wicked but I can't help it. I was looking this morning at your flowers in the garden and I felt so sorry - sorry for you, because you had grown them. Those rascals!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Maurice!
#MAURICE.
The scoundrels! I don't want to consider them human beings, and I shall not consider them human beings.
#JEANNE.
What is it, Maurice? That isn't right.
#MAURICE.
Very well.
#JEANNE.
You had better sit down. It is dangerous for your health to walk around this way.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Sit down, Maurice.
#SILVINA.
Good morning, Monsieur Emil.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Good morning, Silvina.
#JEANNE.
Go and have your breakfast, Maurice.
#MAURICE.
I don't want any breakfast. Mamma, I'll take off my bandage tomorrow.
#JEANNE.
Soldier, is it possible that you are capricious?
#JEANNE.
That's the way. Is it convenient for you this way, or do you want to drink it with a spoon?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Oh, my poor head, it is so weak -
#MAURICE.
Forgive me, father, I'll not do it any more. I was foolishly excited, but do you know I could not endure it. May I have a cup, mamma?
#JEANNE.
Yes, this is yours. You feel better now?
#MAURICE.
Yes, I do.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I am feeling perfectly well today, Jeanne. When is the bandage to be changed?
#JEANNE.
Later. Count Clairmont will bring his surgeon along with him.
#MAURICE.
Who is that, mamma? Have I seen him?
#JEANNE.
You'll see him. But, please, Maurice, when you see him, don't open your mouth so wide. You have a habit - you open your mouth and then you forget about it.
#MAURICE.
You are both looking at me and smiling. But I have time yet to grow. I have time yet to grow.
#JEANNE.
I think they are here. Maurice, this is only Count Clairmont, don't forget. I'll be back directly. They will speak with you about a very, very important matter, Emil, but you must not be agitated.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes, I know.
#JEANNE.
I am going.
#MAURICE.
Who is it, Silvina?
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
I have come to shake hands with you, my dear master. Oh, but do not make a single unnecessary movement, not a single one, otherwise I shall be very unhappy!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I am deeply moved, I am happy.
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
No, no, don't speak that way. Here stands before you only a man who has learned to think from your books. But see what they have done to you - look, Lagard!
#LAGARD.
How are you, Grelieu? I, too, want to shake your hand. Today I am a Secretary by the will of Fate, but yesterday I was only a physician, and I may congratulate you - you have a kind hand. Let me feel your pulse.
#GENERAL.
Allow me, too, in the name of this entire army of ours to express to you our admiration, Monsieur Grelieu!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I thank you. I am feeling perfectly well, Lagard.
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
But perhaps it is necessary to have a surgeon?
#JEANNE.
He can listen and talk, Count. He is smiling - he can listen.
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
Oh! who is this? Please put down your hand - you are wounded.
#MAURICE.
I am so happy, Count.
#JEANNE.
This is our second son. Our first son, Pierre, was killed at Liège -
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
I dare not console you, Madame Grelieu. Give me your hand, Maurice.
#MAURICE.
Oh, Count! I am only a soldier. I dare not -
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
My dear young man, I, too, am nothing but a soldier now. Your hand, comrade. That's the way. Master! My children and my wife have sent you flowers - but where are they? Oh! how absentminded I am.
#JEANNE.
Here they are, Count.
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
Thank you. But I did not know that your flowers were better than mine, for my flowers smell of smoke.
#LAGARD.
Like all Belgium. His pulse is good. Grelieu, we have come to you not only to express our sympathy. Through me all the working people of Belgium are shaking your hand.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I am proud of it, Lagard.
#LAGARD.
But we are just as proud. Yes; there is something we must discuss with you. Count Clairmont did not wish to disturb you, but I said: "Let him die, but before that we must speak to him." Isn't that so, comrade?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I am not dying. Maurice, I think you had better go out.
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
Oh, no, no. He is your son, Grelieu, and he should be present to hear what his father will say. Oh, I should have been proud to have such a father.
#LAGARD.
Our Count is a very fine young man - Pardon me, Count, I have again upset our -
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
That's nothing, I have already grown accustomed to it. Master, it is necessary for you and your family to leave for Antwerp today.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Are our affairs in such a critical condition?
#LAGARD.
What is there to tell? Things are in bad shape, very bad. That horde of Huns is coming upon us like the tide of the sea. Today they are still there, but tomorrow they will flood your house, Grelieu. They are coming toward Antwerp. To what can we resort in our defence? On this side are they, and there is the sea. Only very little is left of Belgium, Grelieu. Very soon there will be no room even for my beard here. Isn't that so, Count?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Is that a battle?
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
No, that is only the beginning. But tomorrow they will carry their devilish weapons past your house. Do you know they are real iron monsters, under whose weight our earth is quaking and groaning. They are moving slowly, like amphibia that have crawled out at night from the abyss - but they are moving! Another few days will pass, and they will crawl over to Antwerp, they will turn their jaws to the city, to the churches - Woe to Belgium, master! Woe to Belgium!
#LAGARD.
Yes, it is very bad. We are an honest and peaceful people despising bloodshed, for war is such a stupid affair! And we should not have had a single soldier long ago were it not for this accursed neighbor, this den of murderers.
#GENERAL.
And what would we have done without any soldiers, Monsieur Lagard?
#LAGARD.
And what can we do with soldiers, Monsieur General?
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
You are wrong, Lagard. With our little army there is still one possibility - to die as freemen die. But without an army we would have been bootblacks, Lagard!
#LAGARD.
Well, I would not clean anybody's boots. Things are in bad shape, Grelieu, in very bad shape. And there is but one remedy left for us - True, it is a terrible remedy.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I know.
#LAGARD.
Yes? What is it?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
The dam.
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
You shuddered, you are shuddering, madame. But what am I to do, what are we to do, we who dare not shudder?
#JEANNE.
Oh, I simply thought of a girl who was trying to find her way to Lonua. She will never find her way to Lonua.
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
But what is to be done? What is to be done?
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
I am a peaceful man, but I can understand why people take up arms. Arms! That means a sword, a gun, explosive contrivances. That is fire. Fire is killing people, but at the same time it also gives light. Fire cleanses. There is something of the ancient sacrifice in it. But water! cold, dark, silent, covering with mire, causing bodies to swell - water, which was the beginning of chaos; water, which is guarding the earth by day and night in order to rush upon it. My friend, believe me, I am quite a daring man, but I am afraid of water! Lagard, what would you say to that?
#LAGARD.
We Belgians have too long been struggling against the water not to have learned to fear it. I am also afraid of water.
#JEANNE.
But what is more terrible, the Prussians or water?
#GENERAL.
Madame is right. The Prussians are not more terrible, but they are worse.
#LAGARD.
Yes. We have no other choice. It is terrible to release water from captivity, the beast from its den, nevertheless it is a better friend to us than the Prussians. I would prefer to see the whole of Belgium covered with water rather than extend a hand of reconciliation to a scoundrel! Neither they nor we shall live to see that, even if the entire Atlantic Ocean rush over our heads.
#GENERAL.
But I hope that we shall not come to that. Meanwhile it is necessary for us to flood only part of our territory. That is not so terrible.
#JEANNE.
And what is to be done with those who could not abandon their homes, who are deaf, who are sick and alone? What will become of our children?
#JEANNE.
There in the fields and in the ditches are the wounded. There the shadows of people are wandering about, but in their veins there is still warm blood. What will become of them? Oh, don't look at me like that, Emil; you had better not listen to what I am saying. I have spoken so only because my heart is wrung with pain - it isn't necessary to listen to me at all, Count.
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
My dear and honored master! We would not have dared to take from you even a drop of your health, if - if it were not for the assurance that serving your people may give new strength to your heroic soul! Yesterday, it was resolved at our council to break the dams and flood part of our kingdom, but I could not, I dared not, give my full consent before I knew what you had to say to this plan. I did not sleep all night long, thinking - oh, how terrible, how inexpressibly sad my thoughts were! We are the body, we are the hands, we are the head - while you, Grelieu, you are the conscience of our people. Blinded by the war, we may unwillingly, unwittingly, altogether against our will, violate man - made laws. Let your noble heart tell us the truth. My friend! We are driven to despair, we have no Belgium any longer, it is trampled by our enemies, but in your breast, Emil Grelieu, the heart of all Belgium is beating - and your answer will be the answer of our tormented, blood - stained, unfortunate land!
#LAGARD.
Bravo, Belgium!
#JEANNE.
Sit down, Maurice, it is hard for you to stand.
#MAURICE.
Oh, mamma! I am so happy to stand here now -
#LAGARD.
Now I shall add a few words. As you know, Grelieu, I am a man of the people. I know the price the people pay for their hard work. I know the cost of all these gardens, orchards and factories which we shall bury under the water. They have cost us sweat and health and tears, Grelieu. These are our sufferings which will be transformed into joy for our children. But as a nation that loves and respects liberty above its sweat and blood and tears - as a nation, I say, I would prefer that sea waves should seethe here over our heads rather than that we should have to black the boots of the Prussians. And if nothing but islands remain of Belgium they will be known as "honest islands," and the islanders will be Belgians as before.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
And what do the engineers say?
#GENERAL.
Monsieur Grelieu, they say this can be done in two hours.
#LAGARD.
In two hours! In two hours! How many years have we been building it!
#GENERAL.
The engineers were crying when they said it, Monsieur.
#LAGARD.
The engineers were crying? But how could they help crying? Think of it, Grelieu!
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
We are awaiting your answer impatiently, Grelieu. You are charged with a grave responsibility to your fatherland - to lift your hand against your own fatherland. Have we no other defence?
#LAGARD.
No.
#GENERAL.
No.
#JEANNE.
No.
#COUNT CLAIRMONT.
We must gain time, Grelieu. By the power of all our lives, thrown in the fields, we cannot stop them. Time, time! We must steal from fate a small part of eternity - a few days, a week! They are hastening to us. The Russians are coming to us from the East. The German steel has already penetrated to the heart of the French land - and infuriated with pain, the French eagle is rising over the Germans' bayonets and is coming toward us! The noble knights of the sea - the British - are already rushing toward us, and to Belgium are their powerful arms stretched out over the abyss. But, time, time! Give us time, Grelieu. Belgium is praying for a few days, for a few hours! You have already given to Belgium your blood, Grelieu, and you have the right to lift your hand against your blood - stained fatherland!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
We must break the dams.
#VON RITZAU.
Do you feel sleepy, von Stein?
#VON STEIN.
I don't feel sleepy, but I feel like smoking. bad habit! But you may smoke near the window.
#VON STEIN.
But what if he should come in? Thank you, von Ritzau. What a stifling night! Not a breath of pure air enters the lungs. The air is poisoned with the smell of smoke. We must invent something against this obnoxious odor. Take it up, Ritzau.
#VON RITZAU.
I am not an inventor. First of all it is necessary to wring out the air as they wring the clothes they wash, and dry it in the sun. It is so moist, I feel as though I were diving in it. Do you know whether he is in a good mood today?
#VON STEIN.
Why, is he subject to moods, good or bad?
#VON RITZAU.
Great self - restraint!
#VON STEIN.
Have you ever seen him undressed - or half - dressed? Or have you ever seen his hair in disorder? He is a wonderful old man!
#VON RITZAU.
He speaks so devilishly little, Stein.
#VON STEIN.
He prefers to have his cannon speak. It is quite a powerful voice, isn't it, Ritzau? Blumenfeld! Any news? He is malting his career!
#VON RITZAU.
He is a good fellow. I can't bear it, Stein. I am suffocating here.
#VON STEIN.
Would you rather be in Paris?
#VON RITZAU.
I would prefer any less unbearable country to this. How dull it must be here in the winter time.
#VON STEIN.
But we have saved them from dullness for a long time to come. Were you ever in the Montmartre cafés, Ritzau?
#VON RITZAU.
Of course!
#VON STEIN.
Doesn't one find there a wonderful refinement, culture and innate elegance? Unfortunately, our Berlin people are far different.
#VON RITZAU.
Oh, of course. Great! How are things?
#VON RITZAU.
Very well. We were talking of Paris.
#VON STEIN.
Then I am going to smoke too.
#BLUMENFELD.
You may smoke. He is not coming out Do you want to hear important news?
#VON STEIN.
Well? He laughed just now I
#VON STEIN.
Really!
#BLUMENFELD.
Upon my word of honor! And he touched my shoulder with two fingers - do you understand?
#VON STEIN.
Of course! I suppose you brought him good news, Blumenfeld? radiogram, Lieutenant!
#BLUMENFELD.
Let me have it.
#VON STEIN.
He's a lucky fellow. You may say what you please about luck, but it exists. Who is this Blumenfeld? Von? - Did you know his father? Or his grandfather?
#VON RITZAU.
I have reason to believe that he had no grandfather at all. But he is a good comrade.
#VON STEIN.
Another military secret?
#BLUMENFELD.
Of course. Everything that is said and done here is a military secret. But I may tell you about it. The information we have received concerns our new siege guns - they are advancing successfully.
#VON STEIN.
Oho!
#BLUMENFELD.
Yes, successfully. They have just passed the most difficult part of the road - you know where the swamps are -
#VON STEIN.
Oh, yes.
#VON RITZAU.
Great!
#BLUMENFELD.
The road could not support the heavy weight and caved in. Our commander was very uneasy. He ordered a report about the movement at each and every kilometer.
#VON STEIN.
Now he will sleep in peace.
#BLUMENFELD.
He never sleeps, von Stein.
#VON STEIN.
That's true.
#BLUMENFELD.
He never sleeps, von Stein! When he is not listening to reports or issuing commands, he is thinking. As the personal correspondent of his Highness I have the honor to know many things which others are not allowed to know - Oh, gentlemen, he has a wonderful mind!
#VON RITZAU.
Great!
#BLUMENFELD.
Sit down, von Schauss. I am talking about our Commander.
#SCHAUSS.
Oh!
#BLUMENFELD.
He has a German philosophical mind which manages guns as Leibnitz managed ideas. Everything is preconceived, everything is prearranged, the movement of our millions of people has been elaborated into such a remarkable system that Kant himself would have been proud of it. Gentlemen, we are led forward by indomitable logic and by an iron will. We are inexorable as Fate.
#BLUMENFELD.
How can he sleep, if the movement of our armies is but the movement of parts of his brains! And what is the use of sleep in general? I sleep very little myself, and I advise you, gentlemen, not to indulge in foolish sleep.
#VON RITZAU.
But our human organism requires sleep.
#BLUMENFELD.
Nonsense! Organism - that is something invented by the doctors who are looking for practice among the fools. I know of no organism. I know only my desires and my will, which says: "Gerhardt, do this! Gerhardt, go there! Gerhardt, take this!" And I take it!
#VON RITZAU.
Great!
#SCHAUSS.
Will you permit me to take down your words in my notebook?
#BLUMENFELD.
Please, Schauss. What is it you want, Zigler?
#ZIGLER.
I really don't know, but something strange has happened. It seems that we are being interfered with, I can't understand anything.
#BLUMENFELD.
What is it? What is the matter?
#ZIGLER.
We can make out one word, "Water" - but after that all is incomprehensible. And then again, "Water" -
#BLUMENFELD.
What water? You are intoxicated, Zigler. That must be wine, not water. Is the engineer there?
#ZIGLER.
He is also surprised and cannot understand.
#BLUMENFELD.
You are a donkey, Zigler! We'll have to call out -
#COMMANDER.
Blumenfeld! What is this?
#BLUMENFELD.
I have not yet investigated it, your Highness. Zigler is reporting -
#COMMANDER.
What is it, Zigler?
#ZIGLER.
Your Highness, we are being interfered with. I don't know what it is, but I can't understand anything. We have been able to make out only one word - "Water." Then again - "Water."
#COMMANDER.
See what it is, Blumenfeld, and report to me -
#ENGINEER.
Where is Blumenfeld? I beg your pardon, your Highness!
#COMMANDER.
What has happened there, Kloetz?
#ENGINEER.
They don't respond to our calls, your Highness. They are silent like the dead. Something has happened there.
#COMMANDER.
You think something serious has happened?
#ENGINEER.
I dare not think so, your Highness, but I am alarmed. Silence is the only answer to our most energetic calls. But Greitzer wishes to say something. ... Well? What is it, Greitzer?
#GREITZER.
They are silent, your Highness.
#COMMANDER.
Please investigate this, Lieutenant. What is that?
#SERGEANT.
I want to see his Highness. I want to see his Highness!
#BLUMENFELD.
You are insane!
#COMMANDER.
Calm yourself, officer.
#SERGEANT.
Your Highness! I have the honor to report to you that the Belgians have burst the dams, and our armies are flooded. Water! We must hurry, your Highness!
#COMMANDER.
Hurry! I ask you to calm yourself, officer. What about our guns?
#SERGEANT.
They are flooded, your Highness.
#COMMANDER.
Compose yourself, you are not behaving properly! I am asking you about our field guns -
#SERGEANT.
They are flooded, your Highness. The water is coming this way. We must hurry, your Highness, we are in a valley. This place is very low. They have broken the dams; and the water is rushing this way violently. It is only five kilometers away from here - and we can hardly - I beg your pardon, your Highness!
#COMMANDER.
But this is - Absurd!
#BLUMENFELD.
They have gone mad!
#SERGEANT.
They are firing! It is an attack!
#VON STEIN.
But that can't be the Belgians!
#VON RITZAU.
They may have availed themselves -
#BLUMENFELD.
Aren't you ashamed, Stein? Aren't you ashamed, gentlemen? Silence! I beg of you -
#COMMANDER.
Who has commanded to retreat? Who dares command when I am here? What a disgrace, Blumenfeld! Order them to return!
#COMMANDER.
This is not the German Army! You are unworthy of being called soldiers! Shame! I am ashamed to call myself your general! Cowards!
#BLUMENFELD.
Your Highness!
#SERGEANT.
Eh! We are not fishes to swim in the water!
#BLUMENFELD.
Your Highness! We ask you - Your life is in danger - your Highness.
#BLUMENFELD.
Your Highness! I implore you. Your life - I am afraid that another minute, and it will be too late! Oh, your Highness!
#COMMANDER.
But this is - But this is absurd, Blumenfeld!
#DR. BEVAN.
Well? How is it?
#CHAUFFEUR.
I don't know yet.
#DR. BEVAN.
Is it a serious break?
#CHAUFFEUR.
No - I don't know.
#MAURICE.
What is it, Doctor? Can't we start?
#CHAUFFEUR.
We'll start!
#DR. BEVAN.
I don't know. Something is out of order. He says it isn't serious.
#MAURICE.
Shall we stay here long?
#DR. BEVAN.
Shall we stay here long?
#CHAUFFEUR.
How do I know? About ten minutes I think. Please hold the light for me.
#MAURICE.
Then I will come out.
#JEANNE.
You had better stay here, Maurice. You may hurt your arm.
#MAURICE.
No, mother, I am careful. Where is the step? How inconvenient. Why don't they throw the flashlight here?
#MAURICE.
How unfortunate that we are stuck here!
#CHAUFFEUR.
bridge! How can anybody drive across such a bridge?
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes, it is unfortunate. We should have started out earlier.
#MAURICE.
Father did not want to leave. How could we start? Mamina, do you think our people are already in Antwerp?
#JEANNE.
Yes, I think so. Emil, aren't you cold?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
No. It is very pleasant to breathe the fresh air. I feel stronger.
#DR. BEVAN.
I think we are still in the region which -
#MAURICE.
Yes. What time is it, Doctor?
#DR. BEVAN.
Twenty - a quarter of ten.
#MAURICE.
Then it is a quarter of an hour since the bursting of the dams. Yes! Mamma, do you hear, it is a quarter of ten now!
#JEANNE.
Yes, I hear.
#MAURICE.
But it is strange that we haven't heard any explosions.
#DR. BEVAN.
How can you say that, Monsieur Maurice? It is very far away.
#MAURICE.
I thought that such explosions would be heard a hundred kilometers away. My God, how strange it is! Our house and our garden will soon be flooded! I wonder how high the water will rise. Do you think it will reach up to the second story?
#DR. BEVAN.
Possibly. Well, how are things moving?
#CHAUFFEUR.
I am working.
#MAURICE.
Look, look! Mamma, see how the searchlights are working. They seem to be frightened. Father, do you see them?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Jeanne, lift me a little.
#JEANNE.
My dear, I don't know whether I am allowed to do it.
#DR. BEVAN.
You may lift him a little, if it isn't very painful. The bandage is tight.
#JEANNE.
Do you feel any pain?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
No. They are frightened.
#MAURICE.
Father, they are flashing the searchlights across the sky like madmen. Look, look!
#MAURICE.
Right into my eyes! Does that come from an elevation, father?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
I suppose so. Either they have been warned, or the water is reaching them by this time.
#JEANNE.
Do you think so, Emil?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Yes. It seems to me that I hear the sound of the water from that side.
#DR. BEVAN.
How unpleasant this is! We should have started out sooner. We are too late.
#MAURICE.
Father, it seems to me I hear voices. Listen - it sounds as though they are crying there. Many, many people. Father, the Prussians are crying. It is they!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
It is they.
#DR. BEVAN.
If we don't start in a quarter of an hour -
#EMIL GRELIEU.
In half an hour, Doctor.
#MAURICE.
Father, how beautiful and how terrible it is! Give me your hand, mother.
#JEANNE.
What is it?
#MAURICE.
I want to kiss it. Mother, you have no gloves on!
#JEANNE.
What a foolish little boy you are, Maurice.
#MAURICE.
Monsieur Langloi said that in three days from now I may remove my bandage. Just think of it, in three days I shall be able to take up my gun again!... Oh, who is that? Look, who is that?
#MAURICE.
Who is there?
#PEASANT.
Our own, our own. And who are you? Are you going to the city?
#MAURICE.
Yes, we're going to the city. Our car has broken down, we're repairing it. What are you doing here?
#PEASANT.
What am I doing here?
#CHAUFFEUR.
Give me the light!
#PEASANT.
Are you carrying a wounded man? I am also wounded, in my leg. I cannot walk, it is very hard. I must lean on my cane. Are you going to the city? I lay there in the ditch and when I heard you speak French I crawled out. My name is Jaqular.
#DR. BEVAN.
How were you wounded?
#PEASANT.
I was walking in the field and they shot me. They must have thought I was a rabbit. They must have thought I was a rabbit. What is the news, gentlemen? Is our Belgium lost? Eh? Is our Belgium lost?
#MAURICE.
Don't you know?
#PEASANT.
What can I know? I lay there and looked at the sky - that's all I know. Did you see the sky? Just look at it, I have been watching it all the time. What is that I see in the sky, eh? How would you explain it?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Sit down near us.
#MAURICE.
Listen, sit down here. It seems you haven't heard anything. You must get away from here. Do you know that the dams are broken? Do you understand? The dams!
#PEASANT.
The dams?
#MAURICE.
Yes. Don't you hear the cries over there? Listen! They are crying there - the Prussians!
#PEASANT.
Water?
#MAURICE.
Water. It must be reaching them now. They must have learned of it by this time. Listen, it is so far, and yet we can hear!
#MAURICE.
Sit down, right here, the automobile is large. Doctor, help him. I will hold the lantern.
#CHAUFFEUR.
Sit down, sit down! Eh!
#DR. BEVAN.
What is it? Bad? Chauffeur, be quick! We can't stay here! The water is coming. We should have started out earlier.
#MAURICE.
What an unfortunate mishap!
#JEANNE.
They shot you like a rabbit? Do you hear, Emil - they thought a rabbit was running! Did you resemble a rabbit so closely?
#PEASANT.
I look like a rabbit! Exactly like a rabbit.
#JEANNE.
Do you hear, Emil? He says he looks exactly like a rabbit!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Jeanne!
#MAURICE.
Mamma!
#JEANNE.
It makes me laugh - it seems so comical to me that they mistake us for rabbits. And now, what are we now - water rats? Emil, just picture to yourself, water rats in an automobile!
#MAURICE.
Mamma!
#JEANNE.
No, no, I am not laughing any more, Maurice! And what else are we? Moles? Must we hide in the ground?
#PEASANT.
And now we must hide in the ground -
#JEANNE.
And they will remain on the ground? Emil, do you hear?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
My dear! My dear!
#MAURICE.
Listen, you must do something. Haven't you anything? Listen! Mamma, we are starting directly, my dear!
#JEANNE.
No, never mind, I am not laughing any more. How foolish you are. Maurice, I simply felt like talking. I was silent too long. I was forever silent, but just now I felt like chattering. Emil, I am not disturbing you with my talk, am I? Why is the water so quiet, Emil? It was the King who said, "The water is silent," was it not? But I should like to see it roar, crash like thunder.... No, I cannot, I cannot bear this silence! Ah, why is it so quiet - I cannot bear it!
#MAURICE.
My dear fellow, please hurry up!
#CHAUFFEUR.
Yes, yes! I'm working, I'm working. We'll start soon.
#JEANNE.
But I cannot bear it! I cannot! I cannot!
#MAURICE.
Mamma!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
All will end well, Jeanne. All will end well. I know. I also feel as you do. But all will end well, Jeanne!
#JEANNE.
I cannot bear it!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
All will end well, Jeanne! Belgium will live! The sun will shine! I am suffering, but I know this, Jeanne!
#MAURICE.
Quicker! Quicker!
#CHAUFFEUR.
In a moment, in a moment. Now it is fixed, in a moment.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Jeanne!
#JEANNE.
Yes, yes, I know.... Forgive me, forgive me, I will soon -
#MARY.
Tell me how I can find my way to Lonua!
#MAURICE.
Who is that?
#JEANNE.
Emil, it is that girl! She is also like a rabbit!
#DR. BEVAN.
What is it, what is it - Who?
#PEASANT.
She is here again?
#CHAUFFEUR.
Let me have the light!
#DR. BEVAN.
Very well!
#MARY.
How can I find my way to Lonua?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Maurice, you must stop her! My child, my child! Doctor, you -
#CHAUFFEUR.
Put down the lantern! The devil take this!
#MARY.
Hands off! No, no, you will not dare -
#MAURICE.
You can't catch her -
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Doctor, you must catch her! She will perish here, quick -
#PEASANT.
She asked me, too, how to go to Lonua. How am I to know? Lonua!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
You must catch her! What is it? You must!
#MAURICE.
But how, father?
#MAURICE.
Now he is gone! Oh, my God!
#CHAUFFEUR.
Take your seats! Ready!
#MAURICE.
But the doctor isn't here. Oh, my God! Father, what shall we do now?
#CHAUFFEUR.
Let us call him. Eh!
#CHAUFFEUR.
I must deliver Monsieur Grelieu, and I will deliver him. Take your seats!
#MAURICE.
Langloi! Come! Doctor!
#PEASANT.
He did not catch her. You cannot catch her. She asked me, too, about the road to Lonua. She is insane. There are many like her now.
#EMIL GRELIEU.
Jeanne!
#JEANNE.
But I cannot, Emil. What is it? I cannot understand. What is it? Where are we? My God, I don't understand anything. I used to understand, I used to understand, but now - Where is Pierre? Where is Pierre?
#MAURICE.
Oh, will he be here soon? Mother dear, we'll start in a moment!
#JEANNE.
Yes, yes, we'll start in a moment! But I don't understand anything. Where are we? Why such a dream, why such a dream? I can't understand! Who has come? My head is aching. Who has come? Why has it happened?
#JEANNE.
Who is shouting? What a strange dream, what a terrible, terrible, terrible dream. Where is Pierre?
#MAURICE.
Mother!
#JEANNE.
I cannot! I cannot - why are you torturing me? Where is Pierre?
#EMIL GRELIEU.
He is dead, Jeanne!
#JEANNE.
No!!!
#EMIL GRELIEU.
He is dead, Jeanne. But I swear to you by God, Jeanne! - Belgium will live. Weep, sob, you are a mother. I too am crying with you - But I swear by God: Belgium will live! God has given me the light to see, and I can see. Songs will resound here. Jeanne! new Spring will come here, the trees will be covered with blossoms - I swear to you, Jeanne, they will be covered with blossoms! And mothers will caress their children, and the sun will shine upon their heads, upon their golden - haired little heads! Jeanne! There will be no more bloodshed. I see a new world, Jeanne! I see my nation: Here it is advancing with palm leaves to meet God who has come to earth again. Weep, Jeanne, you are a mother! Weep, unfortunate mother - God weeps with you. But there will be happy mothers here again - I see a new world, Jeanne, I see a new life!
