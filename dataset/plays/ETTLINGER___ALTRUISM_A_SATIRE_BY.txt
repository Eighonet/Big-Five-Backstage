#BEGGAR.
: Kind sir, have pity while you can,
#WAITER.
Shut up!
#BEGGAR.
Don't get fresh! I was once a head waiter!
#WAITER.
That must have been a fine place.
#BEGGAR.
It was too. I traveled all around the world as a waiter. I saw better days before I became a beggar.
#YOUNG MAN.
Indeed if I were a millionaire - my word of honor I would buy you an automobile. Nothing would be too dear for you.
#COCOTTE.
My darling Kangaroo. How liberal you are. I am sure I am your first love.
#YOUNG MAN.
Yes - you are - that is if I don't count the cook who has been at our house for five years - yes, on my word of honor.
#BEGGAR.
: Yes, yes, one goes down. Life is a tight rope dance - before you look around you've lost your balance, and are lying in the dirt.
#WAITER.
You ought to go to work. That would do you more good than talking.
#BEGGAR.
I've tried working too. But work for our kind is the surest way to remain poor. And, do you know, begging is no pleasure either. To get the money centime by centime and no rest from the police - well, well, if I'm born into this world again I will become a government official. The rich man in his banquet hall, The poor man gets the scraps that fall; Kind sir, have pity while you can - Do you see? he doesn't give me anything!
#YOUNG MAN.
I would buy you a flying machine too, but you shouldn't fly alone in it - Ah, to soar with you a thousand meters above the earth - and far and wide nothing - only you and our love -
#COCOTTE.
What a wonderful boy you are.
#BEGGAR.
How often have I wanted to commit suicide. But why should I gratify my fellow man by doing that? - suicide is the one sin I can see nothing funny in. I always say to myself, so long as there's a jail one can never starve.
#WAITER.
You have no dignity.
#BEGGAR.
No. My dignity was taken away from me ten years ago by the law. But I'm not so sure I want it back.
#WAITER.
I ought to call the cops and have them drive you away from here.
#BEGGAR.
You wouldn't do that. Only yesterday I paid my colleagues 20 francs for this place. Here is a receipt. I won't go away from here unless the police carry me away in their arms. The police seem to be the only people who make a fuss over me these days.
#WAITER.
Disgusting old beggar. Why on earth such people -
#TOWNSWOMAN.
That is all I have to say, just let me come to that. Just let me come to it. On the spot I'll get a divorce.
#TOWNSMAN.
Give me your word of honor on it.
#TOWNSMAN.
Now I know what they mean when they say that all men were polygamists.
#TOWNSMAN.
Calm yourself, old woman. It's all theoretical that married women are good cooks and married men are polygamists.
#BEGGAR.
The rich man in his banquet hall The poor....
#TOWNSMAN.
Let him banquet in peace.
#CHILD.
I want to give the poor man something. Papa! Money! Papa! Money!
#TOWNSMAN.
A heart of gold has my little Phillip. A disposition like butter. He gets that from me.
#TOWNSMAN.
What? Asking for money or the oleo margerine disposition?
#CHILD.
When I give the poor man something he makes a funny face and I have to laugh. Papa, money!
#TOWNSMAN.
Since I've been married I make all kinds of faces, but no one gives me anything. Too bad, I've nothing smaller than a centime piece.
#TOWNSMAN.
Of course, you'd rather bring up our Phillip to have a heart of stone. Children should be taught to love people. They must be brought up in that way - to have regard and respect for the most unfortunate fellow beings - How that woman is perfumed. Women like that shouldn't be permitted in the city.
#YOUNG MAN.
I would buy you two beautiful air ships, a half moon for week days and a star for Sundays. All my millions I would lay at your feet. Waiter - another glass of water, please.
#COCOTTE.
I'd like to kiss you, my little wild horse.
#WAITER.
What can I bring you?
#TOWNSMAN.
For the child, a glass of milk, but be sure it's well cooked. A little glass of good ninni for my darling, a glass of ninni from the big moo cow.
#TOWNSMAN.
And for me a glass of red wine - a little glass of good red wine for the big moo - ox.
#TOWNSWOMAN.
That's just like you. Begrudge a glass of milk to your own child - naturally - so long as you have your cigar and your wine -
#TOWNSMAN.
My dear, I hereby give little Phillip permission to drink three cows dry. And of my next week's wages, you may buy him a whole herd of cows.
#CHILD.
I want chocolate! Chocolate, mama!
#TOWNSMAN.
You shall have it. As much as you want. Wouldn't you perhaps like to have a glass of champagne, little Phillip, and a Henry Clay cigar and a salad made of a big moo - chicken?
#YOUNG MAN.
Sir! Sir! This is unheard of. You've been drawing this lady all the time. She is a respectable lady, do you understand? For all you know she may be my wife.
#ARTIST.
More than that - for all I know she may be your mother.
#YOUNG MAN.
My dear sir - I must call you to account - what do you mean by -
#ARTIST.
Why are you so excited? Isn't it a good likeness?
#YOUNG MAN.
Of course, it's a good likeness, that is - I ask you, sir, how dare you to draw a picture of my bride?
#TOWNSMAN.
These young people are quarreling. You always bring me to places like this. We can never go out together but there's a scandal.
#COCOTTE.
I like that. I'd like to own the drawing.
#ARTIST.
My dear lady, if it would give you any pleasure....
#COCOTTE.
I couldn't think of taking it. Buy me the picture. Sweetheart, will you buy it for me?
#YOUNG MAN.
I don't think much of it. You are far, far prettier.
#COCOTTE.
You won't refuse me this one little request. How much do you ask for the picture?
#ARTIST.
I hadn't thought of selling it - but because it is such a good likeness of you, ten francs. But you must promise that in return you will sit for me again - perhaps at my studio. To - morrow at noon?
#COCOTTE.
Gladly! Very gladly! Would you care to sit down and have something with us?
#ARTIST.
If your fiancé doesn't object?
#YOUNG MAN.
Charmed!
#CHILD.
The chocolate is no good. I want some moo milk.
#TOWNSMAN.
In a minute, I'll take my moo stick and tan your moo hide.
#BEGGAR.
The rich man his banquet hall The poor man gets the crumbs that fall, Kind sir, have pity while you can, Remember the old beggar man, The poor beggar man.
#AMERICAN.
Are you through? Waiter, put a muzzle on this man.
#TOWNSWOMAN.
That is what I call an elegant man. I have always wanted you to have a suit made like that. Ask him where he got it and what it cost.
#TOWNSMAN.
I couldn't ask an utter stranger what his clothes cost.
#TOWNSWOMAN.
Of course not, but if it was a woman you would have been over there long ago.
#CHILD.
Mama, the bow - wow dog is biting me.
#TOWNSMAN.
My dear sir, your dog is biting my son.
#AMERICAN.
You're mistaken, madame. My dog has been carefully trained to eat none other than boiled meat.
#ARTIST.
Pardon me for asking - but is the lady your wife or your fiancé?
#AMERICAN.
Waiter! Garçon! Bring me a quart of Cliquot, and bring my dog a menu card.
#CHILD.
The bow - wow dog is making faces at me.
#TOWNSMAN.
Look here, sir, your dog is certainly about to bite my child.
#AMERICAN.
How much does your child cost?
#TOWNSMAN.
Cost! My child! Did you ever hear of such a thing? I want you to understand that my child p -
#AMERICAN.
Waiter! Tell this woman not to shout so! - How much does your child cost?
#TOWNSMAN.
My child costs - nothing! Do you understand?
#AMERICAN.
Well, your child costs nothing - my dog costs eight dollars. Think that over - is your son a thoroughbred? My dog is of the purest breed - think that over - if your son hurts my dog I'll hold you responsible. Think that over.
#COCOTTE.
What do you think that man to be, little mouse? full blooded American.
#ARTIST.
I should say he's a German who has spent two weeks in New York.
#TOWNSMAN.
Aristide, are you going to sit there and permit your defenseless wife to be insulted like that?
#TOWNSMAN.
As long as you have your tongue, my dear, you are not defenseless.
#TOWNSWOMAN.
It is your business to talk to him. My poor little Phillip! Your father is no man.
#TOWNSMAN.
I was before I got married. Sir, my name is Aristide Beaurepard.
#AMERICAN.
Is that my fault?
#TOWNSMAN.
I am the father of a family.
#AMERICAN.
I am very sorry for you, indeed.
#TOWNSMAN.
I have a wife and children -
#AMERICAN.
You have only yourself to blame.
#TOWNSMAN.
Your dog -
#AMERICAN.
I have no desire to discuss dogs with you. I don't believe you know anything about thoroughbred dogs. Waiter, sit this man down in his place.
#TOWNSMAN.
This is I must say, this is -
#WAITER.
Monsieur, you must not make a racket around you. This is a first class establishment. A real prince once dined here, I would have you understand. Come on now, if you please.
#TOWNSMAN.
Not a centime tip will that fellow get from me. Not a centime.
#AMERICAN.
Waiter, Waiter, bring my dog a portion of liver, and not too fat. And a roast potato.
#BEGGAR.
I can't stand any more. For eight days I have not had a warm morsel of food in my stomach. I am not a human being any more. I'll kill myself.
#TOWNSWOMAN.
For God's sake he has thrown himself into the Seine. Oh, God! Oh, God!
#WORKINGMAN.
He's in the river!
#AMERICAN.
What a noisy place this is.
#TOWNSWOMAN.
Aristide, remember you have a wife and children.
#TOWNSMAN.
That is why I want to do it.
#TOWNSWOMAN.
Aristide, I'll jump in after you - as true as I live I'll jump in after you.
#TOWNSMAN.
Then I won't do it.
#A VOICE.
Get the life buoy.
#ANOTHER VOICE.
Let that life buoy alone. Don't you see the sign "Do not touch"?
#A MAN.
The buoy is no good. It will not work.
#ANOTHER MAN.
Of course not. It's city property.
#COCOTTE.
I can't look at it.
#A WOMAN.
Look! He's come up! Over there!
#CHILD.
I can't see.
#TOWNSWOMAN.
My little heart of gold Why don't you lift him up? Don't you hear that the child can't see?
#YOUNG MAN.
These people are utterly heartless. It is revolting.
#AMERICAN.
I'll bet twenty dollars he drowns. Who'll take the bet? Twenty dollars.
#YOUNG MAN.
Are you a man or a beast?
#AMERICAN.
Young man, better shut your mouth.
#YOUNG MAN.
Does no one hear know the meaning of Altruism?
#ARTIST.
Altruism! Ha, ha! Love of one's neighbor. God preserve mankind from Altruism!
#COCOTTE.
What do you mean? You are not in earnest?
#ARTIST.
In dead earnest.
#AMERICAN.
I'll bet twenty - five dollars that he doesn't drown - thirty dollars! Tightwads!
#ARTIST.
Life is like that. One man's success is another man's failure. He who sacrifices himself for an idea is a hero. He who sacrifices himself for a fellow man is a fool.
#YOUNG MAN.
No, it is the highest, the noblest of instincts. That is why my heart bleeds when I see all these people stand indifferently by while a fellow man is drowning. No one jumps in after him -
#AMERICAN.
Jump in yourself, young man, jump in yourself.
#YOUNG MAN.
It is different with me, I am with a lady - it wouldn't be right.
#AMERICAN.
Nobody will bet. This is a hell of a bunch. They ought to see one of our nigger lynchings. Poor Molly! She is so nervous. Things like this get her all excited.
#FIRST POLICEMAN.
Look at the mob. Something is liable to happen there.
#SECOND POLICEMAN.
Isn't it forbidden for such a mob to gather on the dock?
#FIRST POLICEMAN.
Sure, it's against the law. Why shouldn't it be?
#SECOND POLICEMAN.
This is no place for us.
#ARTIST.
Does it begin to dawn on you that true love of one's neighbor would not only be monotonous but unbearable as well.
#YOUNG MAN.
Out there a man is drowning - and you stand there moralizing.
#ARTIST.
Why not? We read a dozen suicides every day. Yet we go home and eat our dinner with undiminished relish. Why then sentimentalize over a drowning beggar? I wouldn't rescue a man who had fallen into the water much less one who had jumped in.
#YOUNG MAN.
Sir - I despise you!
#ARTIST.
Love of one's neighbor is a mask. A mask that people wear to hide from themselves their real faces.
#AMERICAN.
No, I don't agree with you. I am strong for love of one's neighbor. Indeed, the Bible tells us to love our neighbor as ourselves. Oh, I am very strong for it. I go to Church on Sundays in the U. S. A. I never touch a drop - in the U. S. A.
#HANK.
The life buoy is sinking.
#ANOTHER VOICE.
That's why they call it a life buoy.
#COCOTTE.
How interestingly you talk. I love Americans.
#AMERICAN.
We have two kinds of neighborly love back home. Neighborly love that makes for entertaining and dancing, and neighborly love that you read about next day in the newspapers.
#WORKINGMAN.
What's the matter here? Make way there! Let me through!
#YOUNG MAN.
A hero! A hero!
#AMERICAN.
I'll bet sixty dollars that both of them drown! - Seventy! Seventy - five! I can't get a bet around here. I'm going back to America.
#COCOTTE.
Going back so soon?
#AMERICAN.
As soon as I have seen Paris. Wouldn't you like to show me the town? I'll meet you to - morrow at four in front of the Opera House.
#COCOTTE.
I'll be there. I like Americans.
#THE MOB.
He's got him! Hurrah!
#AMERICAN.
I'd like to know how much longer that waiter means to keep my dog waiting for her order of liver.
#YOUNG MAN.
He is saved; thank God he is saved. Weren't you sorry at all when that poor wretch jumped into the river?
#AMERICAN.
Young man, is it my river?
#THE MOB.
Hurrah!
#WORKINGMAN.
That was no easy job.
#A WOMAN.
Take care what you are doing. You are wetting my whole dress.
#BEGGAR.
Oh! - Oh! - Oh! -
#YOUNG MAN.
You are a noble fellow. I saw how brave you were.
#WORKINGMAN.
Did you? Then give me your name and address.
#YOUNG MAN.
Jules Leboeof, Rue d'Hauteville.
#WORKINGMAN.
Who else saw it?
#BEGGAR.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
#WORKINGMAN.
Shut your mouth. Your turn comes next. Who else saw me save him?
#TOWNSMAN.
Aristide Beaurepard, Rue de Lagny, a14.
#TOWNSMAN.
Must you mix in everything? This is nothing to you. Do you want to get in trouble? You didn't see a thing. Why you just want to get in trouble? You didn't see a thing. Why you just this moment came. What do you want the address for, eh?
#WORKINGMAN.
Do you think I am taking cold baths for my health? I want to get a medal for life saving.
#A MAN.
You have a chance to get an award from the Carnegie fund for life saving.
#WORKINGMAN.
Don't I know it. I read all about it in "Humanitie" yesterday. Do you think I'd have jumped in the water otherwise?
#BEGGAR.
O God! O God! I'm soaking wet.
#AMERICAN.
Isn't that surprising?
#BEGGAR.
I am freezing. I am freezing to death.
#COCOTTE.
Waiter, bring him a glass of brandy and charge it to me.
#CHILD.
I am freezing too, Mama, I'm cold.
#TOWNSWOMAN.
My poor little Phillip. You never think of bringing a coat for the child. There, my darling, you shall have a cup of hot coffee right away.
#CHILD.
Coffee is pfui. I want brandy!
#TOWNSMAN.
Brandy is not for children. You'll drink coffee.
#TOWNSWOMAN.
Who says brandy is not for children? You get the most foolish ideas in your head. Hush, hush, my baby, you shall have some brandy.
#AMERICAN.
They ought to offer a medal for the murder of certain kinds of wives.
#BEGGAR.
Oh! Oh, what a life I lead! What a life!
#BEGGAR.
I wish I were dead. Why did they pull me out? I want to die. What does life mean to me? What joy is there in life for me?
#ARTIST.
There will be less joy for you in death.
#BEGGAR.
If I were only young. If I only had my two strong arms again. I never dreamed I would come to this. I never would have believed it - Forty years ago I was a workingman, yes, forty years until an accident -
#WORKINGMAN.
Were you a Union man, brother?
#BEGGAR.
Certainly - certainly. That is, I wasn't exactly a Union man but -
#WORKINGMAN.
What! Not a Union man.
#TOWNSMAN.
What do you want to do to that poor man?
#WORKINGMAN.
Throw him back in the river.
#BEGGAR.
Forty years I worked at the machine - and now I have nothing to show for it but diseased lungs.
#TOWNSWOMAN.
Aristide, we are going home. Tuberculosis is contagious.
#WORKINGMAN.
That's capital for you. The capitalist sucks the workingman dry and then turns him out on the streets to starve. But we, the people, shall have our day. When first the uprising of the masses -
#AMERICAN.
Oh, don't make a speech.
#BEGGAR.
And my military medal is gone. I must have lost it in the water. You can still see the saber wound on my arm.
#YOUNG MAN.
Thus the Fatherland repays its valiant sons.
#BEGGAR.
Nobody knows what I suffered for France. Twenty years I served in the foreign legion.
#AMERICAN.
This fellow ought to be celebrating his two hundredth birthday soon.
#BEGGAR.
O God - my poor wife - my poor children - the youngest is just four months old -
#COCOTTE.
Poor soul, here are two francs for you.
#BEGGAR.
God bless you mademoiselle.
#BEGGAR.
The rich man in his banquet hall, The poor man gets the crumbs that fall, That's what I sing this song for.
#AMERICAN.
My dog! My Molly! She has jumped into the river! She will drown! There she is - swimming. Oh, my Molly! She cost me eighty dollars. A hundred dollars to the man that saves my dog. A hundred dollars.
#A MAN.
Do you mean that?
#AMERICAN.
A hundred dollars. Here, I'll put it up with the Waiter - a hundred dollars for my poor dog. hundred dollars! Five hundred francs!
#AMERICAN.
My poor Molly! She loved me like a son! Where is that pole?
#A VOICE.
Hey! Oh! My head!
#AMERICAN.
There - over there - the poor dog never had a swimming lesson. What are you standing there for? You with your precious neighborly love! A hundred and fifty dollars for my dog! Jump in! Here is a deposit.
#YOUNG MAN.
No! For a dog? Never!
#AMERICAN.
It was a thoroughbred dog. Jump! I'll give you two hundred - I'll take you back to the U. S. A. with me - I'll pay for your musical education - anything - if you save my dog.
#YOUNG MAN.
Will you really pay for my musical education if I save your dog?
#AMERICAN.
Every instrument there is - piano, piccolo, cornet, bass drum - only jump! - jump!
#YOUNG MAN.
With God!
#AMERICAN.
Poor Molly! I'll endow a home for poor Parisians if she is brought back to me alive. Oh, dear lady, I don't know whether I shall be able to meet you to - morrow at the Avenue de l'Opera. I have had a bereavement. I must telephone to the lifeguard station. Poor Molly! All the insurance I carried on her is three thousand dollars.
#BEGGAR.
Damn his heart; the dog tender! I hope he drowns himself. Just as I was doing the best business in weeks that damn dog had to spoil everything. The scabby beast.
#COCOTTE.
How often have I asked you not to use those vulgar expressions.
#BEGGAR.
What! Is that how a daughter should speak to her father? You shameless wench! I'll teach you. I'll be lame again hereafter. For when I am lame I carry a stick and a stick is a good thing to have in your hand to teach a daughter respect. Ten francs; you know for the picture. That suicide trick is getting played out anyhow - hardly 50 francs - and I had to pay 20 for the place. Come my daughter, we will go home. Waiter - Waiter!
#COCOTTE.
He doesn't hear you, papa - Waiter if you don't come at once we shall go without paying.
#BEGGAR.
Waiter, call a taxicab.
