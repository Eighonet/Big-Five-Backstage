#MADDEN.
Oh!
#MRS. MADDEN.
How long y' been home? Yer pretty late f'r Sat'rdy.
#MADDEN.
The head bookkeeper kept me, checkin' up the mill pay roll. I been here just seven minutes.
#MRS. MADDEN.
Thanks. Yer s' darn acc'rate, Jim. I didn' really wanta know.
#MRS. MADDEN.
Jim. Look up an' glimpse yer wifey in 'r new boots.
#MADDEN.
Oh, Florrie!
#MRS. MADDEN.
W'at's a matter? Don'choo like 'em?
#MADDEN.
You didn't need another pair, Florrie.
#MRS. MADDEN.
Y' wouldn' have me look worse 'n one o' these furriners, would y'? There's Mrs. Montanio nex' door; she's jus' got a pair o' mahogany ones an' a pair o' lemon colored ones. An' her husban's on'y a "slasher."
#MADDEN.
Slashers get a big sight more pay than under bookkeepers these days, Florrie.
#MRS. MADDEN.
Got 'em at a bargain, anyways. Jus' think, Jim. On'y twelve, an' they was sixteen. W'at's a news down town?
#MADDEN.
Florrie - Nothin' much. Comin' home by Market Wharf I saw 'em pull a woman out o' the river.
#MRS. MADDEN.
Y' don' say, Jim. Was she dead?
#MADDEN.
I ... I don't know. I didn't stop. You know, Florrie, I hate things like that!
#MRS. MADDEN.
Well - y' poor boob! Not t' find out if she was dead!
#MRS. MADDEN.
Jim. Say, Jim. I'm awful tired o' cookin'. There ain't a thing t' eat in th' house. Le's go down t' Horseman's f'r a lobster supper t'night, an' then take in a real show. Mrs. Montanio's tol' me -
#MADDEN.
Florrie.
#MRS. MADDEN.
There's an awful comical show down t' th' Hyperion. Regal'r scream, they say. Mrs. Montanio -
#MADDEN.
Florrie, there's somethin' I got to say to you.
#MRS. MADDEN.
I got lots I'd like t' say t' you. On'y I ain't sayin' it.
#MADDEN.
I wasn't goin' to say it now ... not 'till I finished goin' through these. But when I saw your new shoes, an' specially when you spoke o' goin' out to - night....
#MRS. MADDEN.
Well, why shouldn' I? I got t' have some fun.
#MADDEN.
Look here, Florrie. D'you know what I was doin' when you came in?
#MRS. MADDEN.
I didn't notice. Figgerin' somethin', I s'pose. Y' always are.
#MADDEN.
This mornin' at the office I got called to the phone. The Excelsior Shoe Comp'ny said you cashed a check there yesterday for fifteen dollars. Said you bought a pair o' shoes ... those, I suppose ... an' had some money left over. Check came back to 'em this mornin' from the bank. - "No funds."
#MRS. MADDEN.
How'd I know there wasn't no money in th' bank?
#MADDEN.
If you kept your check book up to date you'd know.
#MRS. MADDEN.
W'at right they got not t' cash my check?
#MADDEN.
The bank don't let you overdraw any more. D'you know, I'm wonderin' why you didn't charge those boots.
#MRS. MADDEN.
I ain't got any account at th' Excelsior.
#MADDEN.
I guess it's the only place in town you haven't got one. - You don't seem to remember what salary I get.
#MRS. MADDEN.
Sure - I know. Ninety - five a month. Y' know mighty well I'm ashamed o' you f'r not gettin' more. Mrs. Montanio's husban' -
#MADDEN.
Hang the Montanios! Don't you see what I'm gettin' at? Here it is the twelfth o' December; you know my pay don't come in till the end o' the month; an' here you go an' draw all our money out o' the bank ... an' more. An' look at these bills!
#MRS. MADDEN.
James Madden, I like t' know w'at right you got t' talk t' me like that.
#MADDEN.
I've always argued it's the woman's job to run the house. It's no use! - I don't just see how we're goin' to get out of this mess; but I do know one thing. After this I'm goin' to spend our money, even if I have to buy your dresses.
#MRS. MADDEN.
If you say I've been extrav'gant, James Madden, yer a plain liar!
#MADDEN.
Easy, Florrie! - I know you don't mean that, or -
#MRS. MADDEN.
I do!
#MADDEN.
Look here, Florrie. We got to work this out together. There's no use gettin' mad. Prob'ly you aren't extravagant - really. Just considerin' the size o' my salary. pig couldn' live decent on your salary!
#MADDEN.
Other folks seem to get on, even in these times. What would you do if we had kids?
#MRS. MADDEN.
Thank the Lord we ain't got them t' think about.
#MADDEN.
Florence!
#MRS. MADDEN.
Well, I guess anybody'd be glad not t' have kids with you f'r a husban'. Y' don't earn enough money t' keep a cat - let alone kids! An' jus' t' think they'd be like you!
#MADDEN.
Florence - you're talking like a street woman.
#MRS. MADDEN.
Oh, I am, am I? Well, I guess you treat me like a street woman. Y' don' deserve t' have a wife.
#MADDEN.
Well, I don't guess I do. Not one like you!
#MRS. MADDEN.
That's right! That's right! You don' know how t' treat a lady.
#MADDEN.
Look here, Florrie. Don't let's get all het up over this.
#MRS. MADDEN.
Who's gettin' het up? I wish t' God you was a gen'leman!
#MADDEN.
Florrie - don't!
#MRS. MADDEN.
W'y don't y' go out an' dig in th' ditch? Y'd earn a damn sight more money th'n -
#MADDEN.
You know I'm not strong enough.
#MRS. MADDEN.
Bony little shrimp! Not even pep enough t' have kids!
#MADDEN.
Florence! I'm goin' to tell you some things I never thought I would. You're just a plain, common, selfish, vulgar woman! You don't care one penny for anybody except yourself. You an' your clothes an' your movies an' your sodas an' your candy! Look at the way you been leavin' this house lately. The four years I've lived with you would drive a saint to Hell! I wish I'd never seen you!
#MRS. MADDEN.
D' y' think I'm goin' t' stay in this house t' be talked to like that? D' y' think I'm goin' t' stand that kind of a thing? I guess ... you'll be ... pretty sorry when I've ... gone. If ... if I did somethin' ... if somethin' ... happened t' me ... I guess you ... you wouldn't never ... f'give yerself!
#MADDEN.
I don't worry about you. You wouldn't do anything like that. You're too yellow!
#MRS. MADDEN.
You'll ... see!
#MADDEN.
Ugh!
#MIX.
H'llo, James. Where's the sister?
#MADDEN.
She's gone out.
#MIX.
W'at's a matter with you? Tryin' t' freeze me out?
#MADDEN.
Did you want to see Florence?
#MIX.
Sure. Nothin' important, though. Just about a little party she said you an' she was goin' t' take me on t'night.
#MADDEN.
Sorry. I don't know anythin' about it.
#MIX.
Jim - ever get a piece runnin' in yer head so y' can't get it out? I s'pose I been w'istlin' that tune steady f'r three whole weeks. Like it? P'raps Florrie's got th' record f'r that on th' phornograph. Has she, Jim? It ain't been out long.
#MADDEN.
Oh, I don't know, Ed.
#MIX.
I see some girl fell in the river.
#MADDEN.
What?
#MIX.
Yep. They was tryin' t' make her come to. No use. She was a goner all right.
#MADDEN.
Where was this?
#MIX.
Oh, not s' far below here. Saw her m'self, I did.
#MADDEN.
Did you see her face?
#MIX.
Nope. Somethin' 'd struck her face. Y'd hardly know she was a woman, 'cept f'r her clothes.
#MADDEN.
How long ago?
#MIX.
W'at y' gettin' s' het up about? Oh ... 'bout 'n hour.
#MADDEN.
Oh ... down by Market Wharf?
#MIX.
Sure. Did y' see her?
#MADDEN.
Uhuh.
#MADDEN.
Ed.
#MIX.
Uhuh.
#MADDEN.
Would you call Florrie a ... a ... well one o' them high - strung girls?
#MIX.
Gosh, no!
#MADDEN.
You don't think she'd be the sort to fly off the handle an' do ... well, somethin' desp'rate?
#MIX.
Come off. You know's well's I do, Florrie's nothin' but a big jelly fish.
#MADDEN.
Ed - I don't want you to talk that way about Florrie. You don't 'preciate her.
#MIX.
Well, w'at's bitin' you? W'at y' askin' all these questions f'r, anyways?
#MADDEN.
Oh, nothin'.
#MADDEN.
Ed - I do want to ask you somethin'.
#MIX.
Shoot.
#MADDEN.
I want you to tell the truth about this, Ed. Even if you think it will hurt my feelings. It won't.
#MIX.
Spit it out.
#MADDEN.
Just what sort of a chap do you think I am?
#MIX.
Huh! That's easy. D' y' really wanta know w'at I think?
#MADDEN.
I cert'nly do.
#MIX.
Well - if you really wanta know, I think yer a damn good kid ... but a bit weak on th' pep.
#MADDEN.
Thanks. You don't think I'm unfair?
#MIX.
Unfair? Why, no. How d' y' mean?
#MADDEN.
Well ... here in the house, f'r instance.
#MIX.
Lord, no, Jim! Yer s' easy goin' it'd be a holy shame f'r any one t' slip anythin' over on y'. W'at y' askin' all these questions f'r, anyways?
#MADDEN.
Oh - nothin'.
#MIX.
I know w'at's bitin' you. You an' Florrie's had a row. Come on. Own up!
#MADDEN.
Well ... we did have a ... a sort of a ... disagreement.
#MIX.
I bet y' did. Look here, Jim. W'at's a use o' takin' it s' hard?
#MADDEN.
The trouble is - I guess I was mostly in the wrong.
#MIX.
Tell that to a poodle! I know you an' I know Florrie. I guess I know who'd be in the wrong, all right. She was bad enough w'en y' firs' got sweet on 'r - jus' a lazy fool, ev'n if she did have a pretty face. Gee, how you did fall f'r her face! Moonin' round an' sayin' how wonderful she was! An' Florrie twenty - eight years old ... an' jus' waitin' t' fall into yer arms.
#MADDEN.
Ed - don't say things like that, even in fun.
#MIX.
Hell! It's the truth.... But lately Florrie's jus' plain slumped. She's nothin' now but a selfish, lazy pig.
#MADDEN.
I won't have you talk that way about Florrie. She's made me a good wife ... on the whole. She don't go trapesin' off like some o' your fly by nights. She's affection'te ... an' good tempered ... an' -
#MIX.
Rats! Yer havin' a damn hard time t' say anythin' real nice about 'r. I wouldn' stretch th' truth s' far 's that f'r her, ev'n if she is m' sister.
#MADDEN.
Ed - if you can't talk decently about a nice girl like Florrie, I guess you better get out.
#MIX.
Well I'll be damned! All right, I will go.... Yer crazy, Jim!
#MADDEN.
Don't mind me, Ed. I didn't really mean what I said. I'm all upset.
#MIX.
Sh'd think y' were. W'at y' quarrelin' 'bout? Money?
#MADDEN.
Uhuh.
#MIX.
Huh! Thought as much.... As I was sayin', I know Florrie.
#MADDEN.
It really wasn't her fault.
#MIX.
Well, you are sappy. Ever'body knows Florrie spends more money th'n you an' all my family put t'gether.
#MADDEN.
You wouldn't have me deny her ev'rythin'?... She's got to have some fun.
#MIX.
But, Lord, man, y' don't earn th' income of a John D. Rockefeller.
#MADDEN.
I know.... I ought to do much better. But that isn't her fault. Besides, she's learned her lesson.
#MIX.
Well, I'll be damned! T' hear you talk this way. O' course, y' kep' yer mouth pretty well shut. But we all figgered you was havin' th' devil's own time with Florrie!
#MADDEN.
Ed - I never knew ... till just now ... how fond I was of her.
#MIX.
Jim. Y' never c'n tell w'at these women 're goin' t' do - can yer?
#MADDEN.
I s'pose not, Ed. Even ... even when they're not ... high strung.
#MADDEN.
Was that a footstep?
#MIX.
I guess Florrie ain't comin' f'r some time. I'll be goin'.
#MADDEN.
Why don't you drop into Smith's soda parlor? That's where she always is, this time o' the afternoon.
#MIX.
She ain't there, I don't guess.... I jus' come from there m'self.
#MADDEN.
You did?
#MIX.
Sure.
#MADDEN.
Ed - I can't stand this waitin' f'r her any more. I'm goin' out.
#MIX.
Poor ol' Jim.
#MIX.
Ah!
#MIX.
Hell!
#MRS. MADDEN.
Hm!
#MRS. MADDEN.
Oh Ji - im!
#MADDEN.
Florrie!
#MRS. MADDEN.
'Lo, Jim.
#MADDEN.
Are you really safe, Florrie?
#MRS. MADDEN.
Sure. I'm all right.
#MADDEN.
Oh, I'm so thankful!... I ... I been lookin' for you, Florrie. - Where you been?
#MRS. MADDEN.
Wat d' y' say?
#MADDEN.
Where you been, Florrie? You didn't go down by the river?
#MRS. MADDEN.
Lord no! W'atev'r made y' think that? I jus' took Mrs. Montanio over t' Brailey's new place f'r a couple o' ice cream sodas.
#MADDEN.
Oh. Florrie. I didn't know what I was sayin'.
#MRS. MADDEN.
W'at y' talkin' 'bout?
#MADDEN.
I guess I ought not to ask you to forgive me.
#MRS. MADDEN.
F'give y'? Oh, yes - y' did call me some darn hard names.
#MADDEN.
I know. D' you think you could forgive me?
#MRS. MADDEN.
Sure. I guess so. Glad t' see y' got over yer pet.
#MRS. MADDEN.
Say, Jim - look w'at's on th' table.
#MRS. MADDEN.
Have a chocklick, Jim.
#MADDEN.
Florrie. I got somethin' I want to tell you. After you'd gone out, I kept thinkin' ... thinkin' what mighta happened to you.
#MRS. MADDEN.
Y' poor boob!
#MADDEN.
Florrie - look at me. Out there - the river looked so cold an' black - An' I couldn't find you - ... I knew all of a sudden I ... I hadn't really meant what I said to you.
#MRS. MADDEN.
That's all right.
#MADDEN.
I kept thinkin' ... thinkin' how pretty an' how ... how good natured you are. I thought how we used to walk ... down by the river. Four years ago ... you know - just before we was married.
#MRS. MADDEN.
Don' choo want 'nuther choclick, Jim?
#MADDEN.
Florrie - d'you remember that time ... the first time you let me hold your hand?
#MRS. MADDEN.
W'at's bitin' you? Don't y' see I'm readin'?
#MADDEN.
Scuse me, Florrie. I just wanted to tell you. You know, I'd forgotten.... I mean I didn't realize ... till just now - how fond ... how much I ... I love you.
#MRS. MADDEN.
Tha's ... nice.
#MRS. MADDEN.
Jim. You ain't such a bad ol' boy. Goin' t' take me t' Horseman's t'night f'r lobster?
#MRS. MADDEN.
An' say - I'm jus' dyin' t' see a real ... comical ... show.
