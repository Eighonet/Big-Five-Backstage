#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Well, now we have seen our poor, dear captain for the last time.
#MULBRIDGE.
Yes. He was a good fellow, our captain and - awfully fond of horses.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Why, Daisy, what's the matter, dear? You've been standing here all alone, and yet, until now, you wouldn't stir from the coffin.
#DAISY.
I saw him quite well from here, mother, dear.
#MULBRIDGE.
My girlie - my little girl. Yes - we all loved him.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
There, there, Tempski, hush now. There's the bell; go and open the door.
#MULBRIDGE.
And we'll be off to the stables!
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Sh! The Lieutenant!
#MULBRIDGE.
Go on!
#VON WOLTERS.
WELL, HERR - Herr - Kellermann was the name, wasn't it?
#KELLERMANN.
At your service, Lieutenant.
#VON WOLTERS.
You have done everything very satisfactorily. I am much obliged to you. You understand that the removal of the coffin to the church is to be accomplished as secretly as possible.
#KELLERMANN.
I'm silent as the grave, Lieutenant. My business sort of carries that with it, don't you know.
#VON WOLTERS.
It will be dark about half past five. I have ordered the troops that are to accompany the casket to be here at half past six. At the church - the catafalque and the rest - I can confidently leave all that to you?
#KELLERMANN.
Most assuredly, Lieutenant. I shall see that everything is of the finest.
#VON WOLTERS.
But remember your instructions: all superfluous ostentation is to be rigorously avoided - to - morrow at the funeral procession, also.
#KELLERMANN.
I understand, Lieutenant - because of the way he met his death.
#MULBRIDGE.
eg pardon, Lieutenant, but may I speak to you? I've been in the captain's service seven years. I've been in Germany nearly eighteen years - have a German wife and daughter. I'm not as young as I used to be. What's going to become of the horses and the racing - stable, and - the rest?
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Yes, it's really too bad about him, Lieutenant. He's so fond of his horses. Why, if ever you want to speak to him, you have to go and stay at the stable. That's the only way I can manage to see him.
#MULBRIDGE.
And she's a great help to me, too, Lieutenant.
#VON WOLTERS.
I can understand your anxiety, Mulbridge. The captain spoke about you on our last journey together. He especially commended you and your family to my care. But, of course, everything will depend upon the heir.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
And who is the heir, Lieutenant?
#VON WOLTERS.
No one knows. He had no relatives. But be assured that whoever it is, I will do my best to -
#MULBRIDGE.
Thank you, Lieutenant! Thank you!
#VON WOLTERS.
Have you anything else to do here, Herr Kellermann?
#KELLERMANN.
YES, INDEED, A GREAT MANY THINGS, LIEUTENANT.
#VON WOLTERS.
Oh, by the way, may I have a word with you, Daisy? My dear child, I know that the captain had a great deal of confidence in you.
#DAISY.
Yes, he had.
#VON WOLTERS.
Well then, listen. Some one wishes to come here before the casket is removed some one who must not be seen.
#DAISY.
Very well. She may.
#VON WOLTERS.
What - ? She - ?
#DAISY.
Why, it must be the lady.
#VON WOLTERS.
What lady?
#DAISY.
The lady for whom he let himself be shot.
#VON WOLTERS.
What! You know - ?
#DAISY.
She had to come, of course. Who else should it be?
#VON WOLTERS.
H'm! Well then, listen carefully. If the undertaker - or any other stranger - should still be here when it begins to grow dark, throw on a wrap and wait at the door downstairs until a carriage stops. Will you?
#DAISY.
Certainly I will. And Tempski?
#VON WOLTERS.
Yes, Tempski, faithful as he is -
#DAISY.
Tempski was never around in those days.
#VON WOLTERS.
Oh - so Tempski - was never - around - in those days! H'm! Well then, I'll YOU, MY CHILD. I have another errand, but I'll be back
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
What did the lieutenant want of you?
#DAISY.
Nothing in particular - something about the wreaths.
#KELLERMANN.
Yes, with all those wreaths, we'll have to have an extra carriage for the flowers. He was a fine man, he was - a highly respected man! And on horseback! Why, I've won every time I bet on him! Ah, yes, but sooner or later they all have to come to me!
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
And he was such a kind master! He was just like a child sometimes - so light - hearted and happy - like a little boy! Lately, to be sure,
#HE-.
Well, Daisy!
#DAISY.
I guess Tempski will go.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Yes, yes, you're right. Tempski is outside.
#TEMPSKI.
F - from - our - major.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Why, Tempski, it's perfectly natural that the major -
#TEMPSKI.
From - our - major.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Take the wreath from him, Daisy.
#DAISY.
YES, MOTHER, DEAR.
#KELLERMANN.
From his major that must go on the coffin!
#DAISY.
I'll do it.
#KELLERMANN.
Don't you think - ?
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Yes, let her; she looks after everything.
#KELLERMANN.
But nail it tightly, little lady - else it'll fall off when they're carrying him to the church.
#DAISY.
YES, YES.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Everything is so well arranged here. I don't see why they've got to take him to the church.
#KELLERMANN.
The official statement is that it will prevent any demonstration in the street. You know, the town folks haven't taken very kindly to this murdering business of late. But, of course, that's not the real reason. The truth of the matter is that several very influential ladies would like to attend the funeral without being seen. H'm! - love never dies, they say. Ah, the captain was no saint, I can tell you!
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
What do you know about it?
#KELLERMANN.
Oh, well, there's a lot of talk about the veiled figures that used to go in and out of here at twilight. And if these mirrors could speak - ! That reminds me - I'd almost forgotten - we must cover the mirrors.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
But since the casket is to be taken away in less than an hour - what's the use?
#KELLERMANN.
That doesn't make any difference. The mirrors have got to be draped. It would be a blemish on my art - and I wouldn't answer for it.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Daisy!
#DAISY.
Yes, mother, dear.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Go get a pair of lace curtains to hang over the mirrors.
#DAISY.
YES, MOTHER, DEAR.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Daisy! You're not listening. I AM, MOTHER, DEAR. YOU ASKED ME TO -
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
I asked you to fetch a pair of lace curtains.
#DAISY.
YES, MOTHER, DEAR.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Now that the child isn't here - tell me, Herr Kellermann, do you know anything about the cause of the duel? We're all groping in the dark here at the house.
#KELLERMANN.
Well, they're saying all sorts of things. But the dead are my friends. I never say anything against them. It's a business principle with me.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Yes - but the man who shot him, is he still walking around free as air?
#KELLERMANN.
Yes, that's the way with these fine folks. They fall upon one another like highwaymen. Your honour or your life! The man who survives can laugh. The man who falls - well, he falls into my arms. But, see here, getting into a duel with that fellow, that Baron Renoir - why it was nothing short of suicide! I tell you, where that man goes, no grass grows! On the turf, at the card - table, with the women - always the same story. That man shot him down like a rabbit. Oh, of course, it's always a fine thing to lay down your life for a woman. That's a phrase that -
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Do you really think that a woman - ?
#KELLERMANN.
Sh! Here comes your little girl.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
What's that you're bringing?
#DAISY.
I stopped and filled them first.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
But you were to get a pair of lace curtains!
#DAISY.
Oh, forgive me, mother, dear. I thought you said vases. I'll go
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
I don't know what's come over the child! Why, she's been such a help these days - thought of everything, wanted to do everything herself. nice little girl - how old is she?
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Seventeen, her last birthday.
#KELLERMANN.
Is she at school?
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
She's been going to the Art Institute. She wants to teach drawing.
#KELLERMANN.
I suppose the captain thought a lot of her?
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Oh, dear me, yes. She was always around him from the time that she was a mere child. They used to play together out in the yard like two little kittens! Of course, when she grew older, that sort of thing stopped. But lately, when he seemed so worried, I -
#KELLERMANN.
So he seemed worried, did he?
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Yes, indeed. I've had my suspicions for the last two months. Well, when he seemed so worried, I used to manage to send her in to him pretty
#KELLERMANN.
THANKS, THANKS, LITTLE LADY. What lovely Venetian lace! Ah, yes, every mirror comes to this sooner or later!
#DAISY.
I'd like to get a breath of fresh air, would you mind, mother, dear? I feel so -
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
YES, YES, DEAR. GO OUT FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
#KELLERMANN.
Why, here's a little bunch of flowers!
#DAISY.
Oh, please, please, let me have it.
#KELLERMANN.
If it doesn't fall to pieces. Ah, yes, many, many loved him! He had a beautiful life, he had a beautiful death, and, as for a beautiful funeral - just leave that to Kellermann! I'll be back again for the procession. Good evening, ladies.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
I thought you said you were going out?
#DAISY.
Oh, well, I've changed my mind now.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
I'm glad, because one feels so - so alone in here.
#DAISY.
But we are not alone yet.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
That's just it.
#DAISY.
I'm not afraid.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Tell me something, Daisy, dear. Weren't you in there last night?
#DAISY.
Last night? I?
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Yes, at the coffin.
#DAISY.
What should I be doing at the coffin?
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Well, I thought I heard some one go past the door.
#DAISY.
You must have been dreaming, mother, dear.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Very likely. I haven't been sleeping well these nights. See here, Daisy, perhaps he's left us something - you, at least - tell me, haven't you been thinking about that sometimes?
#DAISY.
If she doesn't come soon - !
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
What's that you were saying? Why, what's the matter with you?
#VON WOLTERS.
Tempski!
#TEMPSKI.
Here, Lieutenant!
#VON WOLTERS.
Hurry over to the garrison church and see if everything is ready.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Why, Kellermann will see -
#VON WOLTERS.
And then go - or no - stay there until the casket arrives. Do you understand? COMMAND, LIEUTENANT.
#VON WOLTERS.
That's attended to. And now, my dear Frau Mulbridge, there's something that I want to confide to you. A visitor is coming here presently - a
#LADY.
She is not to be seen by any one - except Daisy. Daisy, it appears, used to open the door for her sometimes in former days.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Daisy - ? What does this mean?
#DAISY.
Oh, Tempski might have gossiped, you know.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
And so he let you open the door?
#DAISY.
I never gossip, mother.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
I'm finding things out now! Why did I never hear of this before?
#DAISY.
Oh, you were always in the stables with father in the evening.
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
And there I was trying to keep this child from any knowledge of the things that went on in here - and he -
#VON WOLTERS.
We've no time for that now, Frau Mulbridge. Daisy, you will watch outside, won't you?
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Oh, that's too -
#DAISY.
Yes, I'll watch. Should I - ?
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Daisy!
#VON WOLTERS.
May I ask, Frau Mulbridge, that you -
#FRAU MULBRIDGE.
Very well. We have served him faithfully, and I'll not start making any
#VON WOLTERS.
May I show you the way, Countess?
#VON WOLTERS.
Daisy! Kindly see that no one enters the house while this lady is here - no one, do you understand?
#DAISY.
Oh, yes, I understand very well.
#VON WOLTERS.
It may be that she has something else to say to me. If the men should come for the casket before she has left, take them around the other way. Keep the main entrance clear.
#DAISY.
No, that wouldn't be safe.
#VON WOLTERS.
Well, what shall we do?
#DAISY.
I'll - think of something.
#VON WOLTERS.
His death grieves you, too, dear child?
#DAISY.
Me? Oh, yes - me too.
#THE LADY.
Ah, Herr von Wolters - to let them close the coffin before I - I had seen him - I must confess, I had not expected that of you, Herr von Wolters.
#VON WOLTERS.
I didn't dare prevent it, Countess - just because of your coming. It was the only way to have the house to ourselves.
#THE LADY.
Don't call me countess, Herr von Wolters. I am not a countess here. I am only an unhappy woman whom no one in this house knows, whom no one is to know.
#VON WOLTERS.
Wouldn't you care to rest for a moment?
#THE LADY.
Are we quite safe here?
#VON WOLTERS.
Quite. The little girl who, you say, is not unknown to you, is outside at the entrance. I have told her mother of your visit and she will not enter the house. If you wish, however, we can lock the door.
#THE LADY.
Yes, do. Or, no, perhaps it would be better not to - in case any one -
#VON WOLTERS.
Very well.
#THE LADY.
I wanted to lay my roses on his breast. Ah, Herr von Wolters, I loved that man with an infinite love. Perhaps grief will give my life a new and holier meaning - who knows? We seek beauty - and find grief. Tell me, Herr von Wolters, you were his best friend, did you never suspect - ?
#VON WOLTERS.
Never, never.
#THE LADY.
And when you received my letter early this morning asking you to come at once - not even then?
#VON WOLTERS.
I could draw - various conclusions - from that.
#THE LADY.
For instance - ?
#VON WOLTERS.
Oh, please - really, you must excuse me -
#THE LADY.
No, Herr von Wolters. We are here - but why don't you sit down? We are here together, you and I, to hold the last rites over our sainted dead. His friend and his beloved who else has any right to be here? Herr von Wolters, I have given you my full confidence - I have made a strange confession to you. You will not betray me?
#VON WOLTERS.
Ah!
#THE LADY.
And so, in this sacred hour, there must be no concealment between us. Answer me now. What does the world say?
#VON WOLTERS.
The world says so many things, Countess.
#THE LADY.
Tell me, to what extent has my name been associated with this affair?
#VON WOLTERS.
I can't conceal the fact from you, Countess. Your name is mentioned.
#THE LADY.
Yes, that's what my husband says.
#VON WOLTERS.
But please let me add that not a shadow, not the slightest suspicion, has ever -
#THE LADY.
But what else can they think?
#VON WOLTERS.
My dear Countess, when a woman is as beauti - I mean, that when a woman is the centre of so much interest, it's not surprising that some notice was taken of the attentions which he -
#THE LADY.
Yes - but - ?
#VON WOLTERS.
It naturally was observed that my friend -
#THE LADY.
Our friend had a - what shall I say - a susceptible heart. We knew that, who knew him so well. This was not the first time he had - been interested in a woman. And that was why I arranged to have him seen in our house as little as possible - lately, not at all.
#VON WOLTERS.
That fact did not escape notice, Countess. And as Baron Renoir was frequently seen with you - instead of -
#THE LADY.
Don't mention that name, Herr von Wolters! I can't stand it! What could have possessed that man Renoir - ? But do tell me the rest. I've heard only the merest details. They've only told me what they thought necessary.
#VON WOLTERS.
No one knows what actually occurred between the two men. He begged me to ask no questions. You know, he was so reserved of late. It may be that certain expressions which passed between them a few days ago - after they had been drinking - had something to do with it - no one knows. Perhaps there was some insult which was given in private - and which neither of them would make public. The assurance that the injury, whatever it may have been, was irreparable, must satisfy us.
#THE LADY.
Oh, how I hate that man Renoir! - quite apart from the trouble which he has gotten me into! My husband warned me against him long ago. "That scoundrel will compromise you some day," he said, "and then I'll have to fight a duel with him." Instead - this! Oh, you poor, poor darling! And now, when all was so quiet and peaceful between us!
#VON WOLTERS.
My dear Countess, if you think that the change which came over him in the last few months betokened peace and quiet -
#THE LADY.
I don't know anything about that! It wasn't my fault! Was I to blame if he insisted on having notions? Tell me one thing, Herr von Wolters, did he die easily?
#VON WOLTERS.
No one dies easily, Countess.
#THE LADY.
Was he still living when they reached the house?
#VON WOLTERS.
No, he died on the field.
#THE LADY.
Do you know my first name, Herr von Wolters?
#VON WOLTERS.
Certainly.
#THE LADY.
Did he - by any chance - speak - that name?
#VON WOLTERS.
That would have betrayed his secret, Countess.
#THE LADY.
I only meant - at the very last - when he was no longer - conscious.
#VON WOLTERS.
No, Countess. But - pardon me, I don't want to be indelicate - but did he ever call you by some little - little term of endearment - some -
#THE LADY.
Why do you ask?
#VON WOLTERS.
At the very end, he kept murmuring something that sounded like "Girlie" - or -
#THE LADY.
My dear Herr von Wolters, our intimacy was of a different sort.
#VON WOLTERS.
ME, COUNTESS, BUT YOU YOURSELF ASKED.
#THE LADY.
Good heavens - these curtains over the mirrors! They make me feel as if I were looking a blind man in the eyes!
#VON WOLTERS.
Would you like to have me remove them?
#THE LADY.
No, no. Never mind. I want to ask you something, Herr von Wolters. Tell me, what do you think of me?
#VON WOLTERS.
What do you mean, Countess?
#THE LADY.
I want to know what I have done that I should be doomed to bring so much sorrow into the lives of others. I had only just left school when a strange young man shot himself under my window. It was on my account that my husband was transferred here from his former garrison. Tell me, what mark of Cain do I bear that all men follow me? I dress as simply as I can. I never go out without a double veil. Sometimes I have actually been tempted to throw vitriol in my face!
#VON WOLTERS.
Oh, that would have been a shame, Countess!
#THE LADY.
Herr von Wolters!
#VON WOLTERS.
Yes, Countess, to mar that image of divinity would be a sin - and I do not hesitate to repeat it beside the coffin of my friend.
#THE LADY.
Don't! Dear me, how strange it seems! Yesterday we scarcely knew one another - those few visits at my house don't count. To - day - this short conversation - and here we are, sitting side by side, the guardians of a secret which will be buried forever with him. It will, Herr von Wolters?
#VON WOLTERS.
Ah, my dear Countess, please do not offend me.
#THE LADY.
Very well, I shall not worry. Did you love him very dearly?
#VON WOLTERS.
I thought a great deal of him, Countess. He took care of me when I was a young fellow quite alone in the world. He was so - Really, I don't I SHALL -
#THE LADY.
Courage, dear friend! We must both try to be brave.
#VON WOLTERS.
Thank you, Countess. You will not have to reprove me again.
#THE LADY.
You evaded my question before. Do you consider me very guilty, Herr von Wolters?
#VON WOLTERS.
He loved you, Countess. That makes you holy in my eyes.
#THE LADY.
I thank you for that word - little as I deserve it. It has never been my way to undervalue myself. But your opinion meant so much to me -
#VON WOLTERS.
What difference could my humble opinion -
#THE LADY.
Don't say that, my dear friend. There are few people - perhaps not even my own husband - who have ever seen me as you see me at this moment - so weak, so helpless, so - I had almost said - unguarded. Remember that - and spare me.
#VON WOLTERS.
I hope that I have not been inconsiderate, Countess.
#THE LADY.
No, no, no; it's - it's grieving for him that makes me lose my wits. The world had so long set me on a pedestal that I thought I belonged there. Now I feel as if I were torn down. Now I lie there - Herr von Wolters, pay no attention to me!
#VON WOLTERS.
If I could only help you, Countess!
#THE LADY.
Help me - you? And yet, why not? His friend and his beloved! It is we, you and I, who are paying the last honours to the dead. Who could know his worth better than we? Whose grief could be more eloquent than ours? No, no, no - I must not talk. Ah, I see him before me now with his bright, careless smile - his conqueror's smile! I suppose you never were courted by women as he was?
#VON WOLTERS.
My dear Countess, I lead a fairly quiet, uneventful life.
#THE LADY.
But you're not - you're not a Puritan, are you?
#VON WOLTERS.
I must let others judge of that, Countess.
#THE LADY.
Oh! I should like to cry out my sorrow to the whole world - say to them all, "You sordid souls, you couldn't know how much I loved him! What do I care if you damn me, if you - " There's the bell!
#VON WOLTERS.
Probably just a wreath.
#THE LADY.
And if it's not - a - ?
#VON WOLTERS.
WHY, DAISY IS OUTSIDE. BUT TO MAKE SURE - Daisy!
#DAISY.
What is it, Herr von Wolters?
#VON WOLTERS.
Who rang?
#DAISY.
It was a wreath.
#VON WOLTERS.
Just as I supposed.
#THE LADY.
HERE, DEAR. You used to open the door for me, didn't you?
#DAISY.
Yes.
#THE LADY.
But you don't know who I am?
#DAISY.
No.
#THE LADY.
You'll not try to find out?
#DAISY.
Oh, no.
#THE LADY.
Was he fond of you?
#DAISY.
Oh, yes.
#THE LADY.
And have you been crying since he died?
#DAISY.
No.
#THE LADY.
You're a pretty little girl.
#DAISY.
Has my lady any more questions?
#THE LADY.
Do you think one might give her anything? Thank you, dear. We shall
#SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.
What is it? I SHALL SEE MY LADY AGAIN.
#THE LADY.
It did seem though, as if she were waiting for something.
#VON WOLTERS.
If you will pardon me for the suggestion, it was surely not - not for money.
#THE LADY.
By the way, this incident reminds me of something I was just about to - Herr von Wolters, are you my friend?
#VON WOLTERS.
If you consider me worthy of that distinction, Countess.
#THE LADY.
Most assuredly. Well, Herr von Wolters, there is something that troubles me - something that desecrates my grief, if I may use the word. There's the anxiety - the fear that - Yes, yes - I must tell you all. Herr von Wolters, he has my letters. Do you understand? Didn't he give you something for me - a small, sealed package, perhaps - nothing?
#VON WOLTERS.
You are forgetting, Countess, that I was ignorant of all this until a short time ago.
#THE LADY.
Yes, that's true. H'm - it's really too bad. Who has the keys?
#VON WOLTERS.
Why, he gave them to me just before the duel. I have them with me.
#THE LADY.
You've looked through the writing - table?
#VON WOLTERS.
Yes, I had to hand over his papers to the legal authorities. I didn't consider myself entitled to touch his private correspondence at present.
#THE LADY.
Why not?
#VON WOLTERS.
He made a will the day before the duel.
#THE LADY.
Really? In whose favor?
#VON WOLTERS.
I don't know.
#THE LADY.
What! Didn't he make any allusion - nothing - ?
#VON WOLTERS.
The only thing he said was that he had named me as executor.
#THE LADY.
But he had no relatives. Who is to inherit his large fortune?
#VON WOLTERS.
As I've said, I don't know. However, he made a remark that I didn't quite understand, and that I - pardon me - would rather not repeat, if you don't mind.
#THE LADY.
Oh, please!
#VON WOLTERS.
It might give you pain, Countess.
#THE LADY.
Nothing can give me pain after this.
#VON WOLTERS.
Well, he said with a decided emphasis - though perhaps he did not intend that I should notice it - he said, "The one who loved me best shall be my heir."
#THE LADY.
What! He said that? Who could have loved him best if not I? For God's sake, Herr von Wolters!
#VON WOLTERS.
Don't be alarmed, Countess. That would be too grotesque.
#THE LADY.
Perhaps this is his revenge.
#VON WOLTERS.
Revenge? On you? What for?
#THE LADY.
No, no - I'm quite out of my senses, I - But, as you have the keys, you won't mind doing me this slight favour.
#VON WOLTERS.
What favour, Countess?
#THE LADY.
Search for the letters with me - now. It seems to me your duty, not only as a friend but as a gentleman.
#VON WOLTERS.
Pardon me, my dear Countess, you were certainly his last - perhaps his only great love. But his life was varied - and if we were to open his desk now - I really don't know what we might find there.
#THE LADY.
You mean there would be letters from other - ?
#VON WOLTERS.
I must say no more.
#THE LADY.
Well, I'll shut my eyes. I'll only look for my own handwriting.
#VON WOLTERS.
The will is to be opened in a few days, Countess. He has doubtless inserted a clause authorising me as executor to return certain papers to their owners - or destroy them.
#THE LADY.
Ah, I see you're a Puritan, after all. - No, no, I'll not trouble your conscience. This loyalty which you bear him to the very grave is so beautiful, so poetical, and I feel so near to you because of it - Oh, those curtains in front of the mirrors! They make me feel as if I were dead myself, No, no - don't. Thanks. Tell me, how long will it be before the will is opened?
#VON WOLTERS.
Unfortunately, the day is not yet appointed.
#THE LADY.
I shall not sleep a moment until then. Not even my love, my grief, can outweigh this terrible fear. My honour, my future, my life - everything is at stake!
#VON WOLTERS.
Countess!
#THE LADY.
Please stop calling me Countess.
#VON WOLTERS.
Forgive me. What should I - ?
#THE LADY.
Call me your friend. I want to be that. From this day you become closer to me than any other being in all the world. Are you not the legacy, as it were, that our dear dead has left me? - Ah, you and I must become like brother and sister, two beings who have - nothing - to conceal from one another. Herr von Wolters, will you be my guide, my confidant - my friend?
#VON WOLTERS.
Countess! My dear, dear Countess!
#THE LADY.
But you're not to -
#VON WOLTERS.
Forgive me. Your kindness to me makes me feel so - confused - I -
#THE LADY.
Why should it? I feel certain that if he could see us at this moment, he himself would join our hands together.
#VON WOLTERS.
Countess, if you ever need a man who would let himself be torn to pieces for you -
#THE LADY.
No, not that. I only want you to take this great weight from my soul.
#VON WOLTERS.
Ah, Countess, I am a man of my word.
#THE LADY.
And that's what you call being torn to pieces for me?
#VON WOLTERS.
Whether I can answer for this to him and to my own conscience - whether I can ever again think of him - without shame - will depend upon what we shall find in there.
#THE LADY.
But you will open it? Herr von Wolters, you'll not let me die of fear and distraction?
#VON WOLTERS.
I'll open it.
#THE LADY.
Thanks, thanks! Ah, you are good -
#VON WOLTERS.
Don't thank me. I feel as if he could hear it in there.
#THE LADY.
No - no! Won't it work? - Heavens, why your hand is trembling. Let me have it.
#VON WOLTERS.
The keys were entrusted to me, Countess.
#THE LADY.
OH, DO LET ME HAVE IT. Empty!
#VON WOLTERS.
Empty?
#THE LADY.
Are you sure that this was - ?
#VON WOLTERS.
Yes, that was the drawer in which he kept his private papers. I'm sure of it.
#THE LADY.
Well, how can you explain - ?
#VON WOLTERS.
Perhaps he burned everything.
#THE LADY.
And perhaps not! - Who knows? - This is the way he played with the honour of the woman who gave him all! This is my thanks! This is the action of a gentleman!
#VON WOLTERS.
No gentleman, Countess, can do more than let himself be shot for a woman.
#THE LADY.
Who asked him to do it? Was it my fault if jealousy of Renoir drove him mad? And perhaps this is really his revenge! Perhaps we'll live to see even more interesting disclosures! - This is my reward! This - What do you want?
#DAISY.
I beg your pardon. My lady is looking for - letters?
#THE LADY.
So you've been in there eavesdropping, have you?
#DAISY.
I brought in a wreath.
#THE LADY.
Well, what do you know about my letters?
#DAISY.
I intended to give them to you secretly when you left.
#THE LADY.
How do you happen to have these letters?
#DAISY.
Why, how should I happen to have them? He gave them to me.
#THE LADY.
To you? Who are you? Why to you?
#DAISY.
Because he knew that I would do exactly what he told me to do.
#THE LADY.
Can you understand this?
#VON WOLTERS.
What did he tell you to do, Daisy?
#DAISY.
He said to me, "These letters belong to the lady who used to come to see me sometimes. No one is to know about her - not even Herr von Wolters. - When I am dead, the lady will -
#VON WOLTERS.
Did he say that?
#DAISY.
Yes. "When I am dead, the lady will probably come here again. If she does, give her these letters. If she doesn't, then burn them with the others."
#VON WOLTERS.
What others?
#DAISY.
Those over there in the stove.
#THE LADY.
Look at this! Unsealed! Unwrapped!
#DAISY.
He knew that I wouldn't read them.
#THE LADY.
I suppose from now on I shall be at your mercy!
#DAISY.
I don't know you, my lady. And even if I did, you need have no fear.
#THE LADY.
Isn't she kind!
#DAISY.
But I should like to ask you a favour, my lady.
#THE LADY.
By all means. What could I deny you, my dear?
#DAISY.
Oh please, please take these roses - away - with you.
#THE LADY.
What does this mean?
#DAISY.
Oh, please take them!
#THE LADY.
What right have you to make such a shameless request of me?
#DAISY.
I heard - forgive me, I didn't want to - I heard the way you spoke about him before. And it seems to me that your flowers no longer belong upon his coffin.
#THE LADY.
What do you say to that, Herr von Wolters? This person acts as if she were the mistress of the house!
#DAISY.
I am.
#THE LADY.
Oh, really!
#DAISY.
I BECAME - HIS WIFE.
#THE LADY.
I hope you'll come and take tea with me in the near future, Herr von Wolters.
#VON WOLTERS.
Pray, excuse me, but official duties will make it impossible for me to -
#THE LADY.
Thank you just the
#DAISY.
There are the troops already. - Would you be so kind, Herr von Wolters - ? Please let no one come in here. May I take you out the back way, my lady? LEAST, ONLY MY MOTHER. And meanwhile - they will - take the coffin - away! But wouldn't it be better to drop your veil? And your roses - do take them! This way, please.
