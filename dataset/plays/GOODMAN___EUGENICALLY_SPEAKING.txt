#UNA.
Why, my dear man, sit down.
#GEORGE.
Thanks, after you.
#UNA.
Oh! Excuse me. I forgot. You're a car conductor. Naturally you're polite.
#GEORGE.
Not naturally, Miss. But I've learned.
#UNA.
An apt pupil, too. Let me teach you then that the ruder you are to a woman, the more she'll hate you - or love you. Sit down. The polite are not only bourgeois, they're boring.
#GEORGE.
When I know I'm right, I stick to it.
#UNA.
But you must grow tired of standing.
#GEORGE.
If I did, I'd lose my job.
#UNA.
You have already. Sit down.
#GEORGE.
After you.
#UNA.
You're splendid. Now!
#UNA.
Isn't that better than ringing up fares?
#GEORGE.
Fairly.
#UNA.
No! You mustn't do that. That's vulgar.
#GEORGE.
What have I done?
#UNA.
Sit down. You mustn't jump up when I do. Well, there! You punned! You mustn't. We all like puns, but it's good form to call them bad taste.
#JARVIS.
Did you ring for me, Miss?
#UNA.
Yes. Please tell my father that I'd like to see him at once.
#UNA.
Do you know the reason that you are here?
#GEORGE.
The hundred dollars you gave me.
#UNA.
No -
#GEORGE.
Yes. I wouldn't have left my job if you hadn't given me that.
#UNA.
I suppose not. But I mean, do you know why I brought you here?
#GEORGE.
I'm waiting to see.
#UNA.
I wonder if you'll like it.
#GEORGE.
Your father?
#UNA.
No. Dad's a dear. That is, he is when he sees you mean business.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Una, dear?
#UNA.
Oh, Daddy! I'm so glad you were in. Keep your seat. Draw up a chair, Dad - I've done it.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Done what?
#UNA.
Do sit down, Dad. He's so delicious. He won't sit down till we do - and you know how much they have to stand.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Now, dear, what is it you have done?
#UNA.
Selected a husband.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
You mean?
#UNA.
Him! Do sit down. We're all sitting now, you see.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
But, my dear -
#UNA.
Now don't say a word until you hear the whole story. You read that article by Shaw in the Metropolitan, didn't you? I did. You remember what he wrote? "The best eugenic guide is the sex attraction - the Voice of Nature." He thinks the trouble is at present that we dare not marry out of our own sphere. But I'll show you exactly what he says. I always carry the article with me. It's so stimulating.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
You're not going to read me a whole Shaw article, are you? It's five o'clock now and we've a dinner date at eight, dear.
#UNA.
It's a Shaw article, not a Shaw preface. However, I'll only read the passage I've marked. Listen. "I do not believe you will ever have any improvement in the human race until you greatly widen the area of possible sexual selection; until you make it as wide as the numbers of the community make it. Just consider what occurs at the present time. I walk down Oxford Street, let me say, as a young man." He might just as well have said, "young woman," you know.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
And?
#UNA.
, "I see a woman who takes my fancy." With me it would be a man, of course.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
For your purpose, of course.
#UNA.
"I fall in love with her. It would seem very sensible in an intelligent community that I should take off my hat and say to this lady: 'Will you excuse me; but you attract me strongly, and if you are not already engaged, would you mind taking my name and address and considering whether you would care to marry me?' Now I have no such chance at present."
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Exactly. You see, he admits it.
#UNA.
Yes, but why shouldn't I have the chance? That set me thinking. I decided he was right. I am intelligent, am I not?
#BRAITHEWAITE.
I refuse to commit myself, dear, until I hear all your story.
#UNA.
Well, I decided I'd make the chance. You see, I - I've been led to think recently that I ought to be getting married.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
May I ask why?
#UNA.
Yes, dear, but I'd rather not answer.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
I beg pardon.
#UNA.
And when I looked about me for the possibilities in my own set, I - well, I wasn't attracted.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
I admit, in society, as a rule, the women grow stronger and the men weaker.
#UNA.
Exactly. And I knew you wanted to be a proud grandfather.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
You're mistaken, dear. I hadn't given the subject any thought; so I had no desires.
#UNA.
Well, I have... given the subject a good deal of thought. I've spent days buying second - hand clothing to give away at the missions and lodging houses in order to have a look.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
At least there was charity in that.
#UNA.
Yes. You see I didn't want charity to have to begin at my home. Self - preservation is the first law of Nature.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
And self - propagation, I suppose, the second.
#UNA.
Well - the missions were no good. They were all so starved and pinched - looking there I couldn't tell what they'd be like if they got proper nourishment. And I didn't want to take a chance. So I went to some coal yards.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
To find the devil not so black as painted?
#UNA.
Blacker! I couldn't see what they looked like. Of course if I could have asked them to wash their faces.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Considering what you have done, I don't see -
#UNA.
I did ask one, but he made some vulgar remark about black dirt and red paint. So I left him.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
And then?
#UNA.
I spent all to - day riding up and down town in street cars. It's very fascinating, Dad. All you can see for a nickel! I never realized what a public benefactor you were.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Oh, I am amply repaid.
#UNA.
Dad's the president of your traction company, you know. Oh, that's all right. I've lost you your job, but I'll get you a better one as I promised. Don't be afraid of Dad - in the parlor. Sit down.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
You might as well make yourself physically comfortable, you know. There's no telling how my daughter may make us feel in other ways.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
And so to - day you investigated travelling in street cars?
#UNA.
Yes. "Joy - riding," you know. Then I saw him - and decided. I knew he wouldn't dare to propose to me - under existing conditions.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
So you asked him to marry you?
#UNA.
Certainly not. I've too much consideration for you, dear.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
But I thought you said - ?
#UNA.
I decided to bring him home to get your consent first. I knew you'd approve when you saw him. But I wanted to be sure I hadn't overlooked anything. And if I had, I didn't want to have raised his hopes for nothing. Would you mind standing a moment, now, until Dad looks you over?
#BRAITHEWAITE.
My dear, do you think the gentleman - ?
#UNA.
"Gentleman!" Oh, yes, I forgot. I needn't have been so clumsy. I apologize.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
I fear you have been too rude.
#UNA.
So do I. I've never even introduced you. Father, this is - this is - By the way - I forgot to ask - what is your name?
#GEORGE.
Coxey, Miss.
#UNA.
Coxey. What's the first name? I can't call my husband "Coxey," you know.
#GEORGE.
George, Miss.
#UNA.
George! There's a fine virile name for you. George Coxey! How strong that sounds! One of those names that would go equally well in the blue book or the police blotter.
#GEORGE.
I never -
#UNA.
Don't disclaim. I know you've never been arrested. One can see your goodness in your face.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Many of the best people go to jail now, dear.
#UNA.
I know. But he's not rich and thank heaven he's not a fanatic. Isn't he good - looking? And I'm sure he's strong. See those hands of his - a little rough, of course, but I like that, and so firm and, for his job, wonderfully clean. Don't hide them, George. They attracted me from the start.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
How did you come here with my daughter at all, sir?
#UNA.
I got off with him at the car barn when he finished his run and asked him.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Didn't you know you would lose your job by leaving that way?
#GEORGE.
Yes, sir.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
And you came at any rate?
#GEORGE.
You see, sir, she gave me -
#UNA.
A beseeching look. Just one. I didn't use more than was necessary. You see, George, I have learnt economy from father. He hates me to be extravagant.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
That, my dear, is the chief objection I have to this episode - it's extravagance.
#UNA.
Please don't call it an "episode," father.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
You must admit it's - rather unusual.
#UNA.
In England, lords always marry chorus girls.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
But he is a conductor.
#GEORGE.
Yes. And conductors are -
#UNA.
As hard working as chorus girls - only. Don't be snobbish, George. Of course a conductor is more unusual, I admit. I can't help that though - You shouldn't have called me "Una," if you didn't want me to be unique.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
That was most unfortunate - most. It was your mother's idea. She believed in symbols - and in a small family.
#UNA.
Oh! Was that why - ? Well, no matter. I've always thought it meant individuality and I've done my best to live up to it. That statue ought to be on the other side of the room.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
I'll have some of the men move it to - morrow.
#UNA.
I'd like to see the effect now.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
I wish I could teach you concentration. I'm not strong enough to move it myself, dear, and -
#GEORGE.
Can I?
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Why -
#UNA.
Oh! If you would!
#UNA.
I'll take that.
#GEORGE.
Thanks.
#UNA.
Look at him. He's as fine as the statue, isn't he? And you know what you think of that. See the strength he has?
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Well -
#UNA.
Thank you so much. You may put it back again. That was all I wanted. I hope I didn't overtax you.
#GEORGE.
Oh, it ain't very heavy.
#UNA.
You see!
#BRAITHEWAITE.
But he uses "ain't."
#UNA.
Many of the best people use "ain't" now, dear.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Not with his enunciation.
#UNA.
What was yours like when you were a railroad signalman?
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Una! The past of a public man should be private.
#UNA.
George has our children's future before him. All the others I know have only their parents' past behind. You could give him a job suitable for my husband. I'll make my husband suitable for the job.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
But you don't know him, my dear.
#UNA.
I don't know myself for that matter. If I don't like him, it's easy enough to go to Reno.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Then you insist?
#UNA.
I'm tremendously eager. It's so unusual.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
I suppose I could sue Shaw.
#UNA.
Don't be silly. Sue an Englishman with German sympathies! Where's your neutrality?
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Very well.
#UNA.
Then it's settled, dear. We're going to marry.
#GEORGE.
Excuse me, Miss, we ain't.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
"Ain't" again!
#UNA.
"Aren't," dear - I mean, we are.
#GEORGE.
Not.
#UNA.
Why not?
#GEORGE.
Because - I'm married already.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
What?
#UNA.
How annoying!
#GEORGE.
Married three years, and expecting a baby, Miss.
#UNA.
Oh, please!
#BRAITHEWAITE.
You see what plunging means. I told you I believed in eugenic examinations first.
#UNA.
Sh! Be quiet, father. Don't lose your head.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Better than losing your heart.
#UNA.
I have it. Of course. How stupid of me not to think. George.
#GEORGE.
Yes, Miss.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Wouldn't you better call him "Mr. Coxey" now?
#UNA.
George, you must divorce your wife.
#GEORGE.
Me? Why she's as good as gold and -
#UNA.
That's unfortunate. Then I'll have to run away with you and let her get the divorce.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Una!
#UNA.
What, Dad? Have you something better to suggest?
#BRAITHEWAITE.
I can't permit it. I didn't mind the uncommon scandal of your marrying a car conductor, but I absolutely draw the line at common scandal.
#UNA.
Father, dear, why will you sometimes talk to me as though I were the Public Service Commission? There's going to be no scandal. You can keep it out of the newspapers.
#GEORGE.
Excuse me, but that don't make any difference. I don't want to get a divorce.
#UNA.
You don't? Why?
#GEORGE.
Sounds like a song, I know, but - I love my wife.
#UNA.
And you're the unusual man I'm to marry.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Stealing nickels doesn't develop the imagination.
#UNA.
How can you love your wife? Some simple, economizing, prosaic, hausfrau who -
#GEORGE.
I don't know what you're saying, but you better be careful not to insult my wife. She's as good as you are and a rector's daughter.
#UNA.
What?
#GEORGE.
Yes. Daughter of one of the biggest sky - pilots in town. I met her at a settlement house. She put the question to me, too.
#UNA.
She - ?
#GEORGE.
Sure. I've been through something like this before or I'd never been able to stand it so well.
#UNA.
Your wife - ?
#GEORGE.
Had a good deal more pluck than you, though. Up and told her father she would marry me if he liked it or lumped it. He said he'd cut her. And he did. We never seen him since. But Naomi and I don't care. That's her name; so you can see she's a Bible - poacher's daughter. Naomi and I've been happier than any people on earth. She's taught me to stand when a lady was standing. That's why I wouldn't obey you. She's teaching me how to speak, too, and if I do say "ain't" and a lot of other things I oughtn't to when I'm excited, that ai - isn't her fault.
#UNA.
Then she - Naomi - has done everything unusual that I wanted to do, before I did?
#GEORGE.
Sure. You can't be unusual to - day. Too much brains been in the world before.
#UNA.
How is it I never heard this story, if her father's so well known?
#GEORGE.
D'you think your father's the only one can keep things out of the papers?
#UNA.
Oh! And I wanted to be unique.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
There, there, dear. You'd better go, now, Coxey.
#GEORGE.
And my job?
#BRAITHEWAITE.
I'll see you still keep it.
#GEORGE.
Thanks. I don't want to.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
No?
#GEORGE.
I want a better.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Indeed! Pray what?
#GEORGE.
Superintendent or something. I leave it to you. You know more about what jobs there are than I do.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
And on what basis do you ask for a better job?
#GEORGE.
Naomi always said my chance would come and I could take it, if I had nerve and my eyes open. I think now's the time.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Why?
#GEORGE.
Oh, this story about your daughter wouldn't look nice.
#UNA.
Oh!
#BRAITHEWAITE.
You forget the power your father - in - law and I have in the press.
#GEORGE.
No, I don't. But I remember that you can't keep me from spreading the news among your men. And I don't think -
#BRAITHEWAITE.
I could have you prosecuted for blackmail, sir. Have you no honor?
#GEORGE.
Sure. My honor says provide for your family. I've got the makings of a big man in me, Mr. Braithewaite. You can't chain me down with a poor man's morals.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Well! I -
#GEORGE.
I'll work in any job you give me, too. I'm not asking for a cinch, only a chance. If she - - could teach me, Naomi can.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
Well, call around at my office in the morning.
#GEORGE.
Thanks.
#UNA.
And I thought I could be unusual.
#BRAITHEWAITE.
It's easy enough for Shaw, dear. He only writes it.
#UNA.
That's it. I'll write it. I'll write a play showing it's useless trying to escape the usual. That will be unusual, won't it, Dad?
#GEORGE.
Excuse me. I left my cap.
#UNA.
Here it is.
#GEORGE.
Thanks. Buck up, Miss! You meant well.
#UNA.
I suppose I was too daring.
#GEORGE.
If you ask me, I think the trouble was you and that Shaw fellow wasn't daring enough. Marriage is a very particular sort of business. Now if you'd come up to me in the street and just asked me to - Well - I - I guess I'll go. But remember my tip next try, Miss.
