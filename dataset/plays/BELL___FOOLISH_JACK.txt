#MOTHER.
Jack! Jack! Where is the boy? He can never stay in the house. He must always be running round to all the neighbours. Ah, there he is at last!
#JACK.
Well, mother, how are you?
#MARY.
I was getting anxious about you. Where have you been all this time?
#JACK.
Oh, I've been seeing the neighbours.
#MARY.
I thought as much. Which neighbours?
#JACK.
First I went to see Father Clumpylump.
#MARY.
Indeed! Father Clumpylump! Honest man! And what did he say to you?
#JACK.
He gave me a needle for a present. most useful present! Where is it?
#JACK.
I stuck it into a bundle of hay that was standing in a cart, and then I could not find it again.
#MARY.
I should think not, indeed! You ought to have stuck it into your sleeve.
#JACK.
That's just what Father Clumpylump said.
#MARY.
And he was quite right. And then?
#JACK.
Then I went to call on Goody Grumbles.
#MARY.
Indeed! Goody Grumbles, dear, old soul! And what had she to say?
#JACK.
Not much; but she gave me a knife. knife! Another most useful present! Where is it, then?
#JACK.
I stuck it into my sleeve, and it fell out on the way.
#MARY.
Of course it did. You ought to have put it into your pocket.
#JACK.
That's just what Goody Grumbles said.
#MARY.
And she was quite right. And then?
#JACK.
And then I went to see Uncle Crabstick.
#MARY.
Uncle Crabstick! Did he give you anything?
#JACK.
Yes, he gave me a lamb. lamb! How delightful! Where is it, then?
#JACK.
I crammed it into my pocket, and it was stifled.
#MARY.
I should think it was! Into your pocket! Good heavens! Whoever thought of putting a lamb into his pocket! You should have tied a rope round its neck and led it carefully along.
#JACK.
That's just what Uncle Crabstick said.
#MARY.
I should think he did! And then?
#JACK.
Then I went to see Auntie Jumblewig.
#MARY.
That was quite right. Did she give you anything?
#JACK.
She gave me a splendid ham. ham! I am glad. That will come in useful. Where is it?
#JACK.
I tied a rope to it, and led it carefully along the road, but some dogs ate it up while I was not looking.
#MARY.
Of course they did, you foolish boy! You should have carried it on your head.
#JACK.
That's just what Auntie Jumblewig said when she saw me start.
#MARY.
Of course she did! and then?
#JACK.
I went to see Cousin Peter.
#MARY.
Cousin Peter! And what did the good man say to you?
#JACK.
Not much; but he gave me a calf. calf! How generous! Where is the calf then?
#JACK.
I tried to carry it on my head, but he kicked my face, so I let him go.
#MARY.
Serve you right! How could you be so foolish as to carry a calf on your head? You should have taken him to the cow - house and settled him in a nice warm corner, with plenty of straw.
#JACK.
That is just what Cousin Peter advised me to do.
#MARY.
He was quite right. And then?
#JACK.
I went to see Rose.
#MARY.
I am glad you went there. Rose is a charming girl. Was she well disposed towards you?
#JACK.
Very. Indeed, she came here with me.
#MARY.
Where is she, then?
#JACK.
I took her to the cow - house, and settled her in a nice, warm corner, with plenty of straw.
#MARY.
In the cow - house! Rose! Wretched boy! You should have brought her into the best parlour, and asked her to marry you.
#JACK.
That's just what she said.
#MARY.
And she was quite right. Quick! Quick! Let us fetch her.
#JACK.
I should like that very much.
#MARY.
Come, then, at once! Oh, you foolish Jack!
