#WAITER.
Two coffee?
#ENGLISHMAN.
Thanks. Sugar?
#ENGLISHWOMAN.
One.
#AMERICAN.
Waiter, I'd like to have you get my eggs. I've been sitting here quite a while.
#WAITER.
Yes, sare.
#GERMAN.
'Kellner, bezahlen'!
#WAITER.
'Komm' gleich'!
#AMERICAN.
My eggs! Get a wiggle on you!
#WAITER.
Yes, sare.
#ENGLISHMAN.
Ten minutes more.
#ENGLISHWOMAN.
Bother!
#AMERICAN.
'Pears as if they'd a prejudice against eggs here, anyway.
#GERMAN.
In these places man can get nothing.
#GERMAN.
'Kellner, bezahlen'!
#WAITER.
'Eine Krone sechzig'.
#AMERICAN.
See here. If I don't get my eggs before this watch ticks twenty, there'll be another waiter in heaven.
#WAITER.
'Komm' gleich'!
#AMERICAN.
I'm gettin' kind of mad!
#AMERICAN.
Good! I don't like trouble. How much?
#LITTLE MAN.
Herr Ober! Might I have a glass of beer?
#WAITER.
Yes, sare.
#LITTLE MAN.
Thank you very much.
#AMERICAN.
Pardon me, sir; I'd like to have you tell me why you called that little bit of a feller "Herr Ober." Reckon you would know what that means? Mr. Head Waiter.
#LITTLE MAN.
Yes, yes.
#AMERICAN.
I smile.
#LITTLE MAN.
Oughtn't I to call him that?
#GERMAN.
'Nein - Kellner'.
#AMERICAN.
Why, yes! Just "waiter."
#LITTLE MAN.
I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
#GERMAN.
Gott!
#AMERICAN.
In my country we're very democratic - but that's quite a proposition.
#ENGLISHMAN.
More?
#ENGLISHWOMAN.
No, thanks.
#GERMAN.
These fellows - if you treat them in this manner, at once they take liberties. You see, you will not get your beer.
#AMERICAN.
That 'pears to be one up to democracy.
#LITTLE MAN.
Oh, no!
#AMERICAN.
I take considerable stock in Leo Tolstoi myself. Grand man - grand - souled apparatus. But I guess you've got to pinch those waiters some to make 'em skip. You'll appreciate that, the way he acted about my eggs. Waiter! Flash of beer - jump, now!
#WAITER.
'Komm' gleich'!
#GERMAN.
'Cigarren'!
#WAITER.
'Schon'!
#AMERICAN.
Now, if I don't get that flash of beer quicker'n you got yours, I shall admire.
#GERMAN.
Tolstoi is nothing 'nichts'! No good! Ha?
#AMERICAN.
Well, that is a matter of temperament. Now, I'm all for equality. See that poor woman there - very humble woman - there she sits among us with her baby. Perhaps you'd like to locate her somewhere else?
#GERMAN.
Tolstoi is 'sentimentalisch'. Nietzsche is the true philosopher, the only one.
#AMERICAN.
Well, that's quite in the prospectus - very stimulating party - old Nietch - virgin mind. But give me Leo! What do you opine, sir? I guess by your labels you'll be Dutch. Do they read Tolstoi in your country?
#AMERICAN.
That is a very luminous answer.
#GERMAN.
Tolstoi is nothing. Man should himself express. He must push - he must be strong.
#AMERICAN.
That is so. In America we believe in virility; we like a man to expand. But we believe in brotherhood too. We draw the line at niggers; but we aspire. Social barriers and distinctions we've not much use for.
#ENGLISHMAN.
Do you feel a draught?
#ENGLISHWOMAN.
I do - rather.
#GERMAN.
Wait! You are a young people.
#AMERICAN.
That is so; there are no flies on us. Say! I'd like to have you give us your sentiments in relation to the duty of man.
#AMERICAN.
For example - is it your opinion that we should kill off the weak and diseased, and all that can't jump around?
#GERMAN.
'Ja, ja'! That is coming.
#LITTLE MAN.
They might be me.
#AMERICAN.
That's true humility. 'Tisn't grammar. Now, here's a proposition that brings it nearer the bone: Would you step out of your way to help them when it was liable to bring you trouble?
#GERMAN.
'Nein, nein'! That is stupid.
#LITTLE MAN.
I'm afraid not. Of course one wants to - There was St Francis d'Assisi and St Julien L'Hospitalier, and -
#AMERICAN.
Very lofty dispositions. Guess they died of them. Shake hands, sir - my name is - I am an ice - machine maker. I like your sentiments - I feel kind of brotherly. Waiter; where to h - ll is that glass of beer?
#GERMAN.
Cigarren!
#WAITER.
'Komm' gleich'!
#ENGLISHMAN.
Train's late.
#ENGLISHWOMAN.
Really! Nuisance!
#AMERICAN.
Now, we don't have so much of that in America. Guess we feel more to trust in human nature.
#GERMAN.
Ah! ha! you will bresently find there is nothing in him but self.
#LITTLE MAN.
Don't you believe in human nature?
#AMERICAN.
Very stimulating question.
#ENGLISHMAN.
Swap!
#GERMAN.
In human nature I believe so far as I can see him - no more.
#AMERICAN.
Now that 'pears to me kind o' blasphemy. I believe in heroism. I opine there's not one of us settin' around here that's not a hero - give him the occasion.
#LITTLE MAN.
Oh! Do you believe that?
#AMERICAN.
Well! I judge a hero is just a person that'll help another at the expense of himself. Take that poor woman there. Well, now, she's a heroine, I guess. She would die for her baby any old time.
#GERMAN.
Animals will die for their babies. That is nothing.
#AMERICAN.
I carry it further. I postulate we would all die for that baby if a locomotive was to trundle up right here and try to handle it. I guess you don't know how good you are.
#ENGLISHWOMAN.
I beg your pardon.
#AMERICAN.
The English are very humanitarian; they have a very high sense of duty. So have the Germans, so have the Americans.
#LITTLE MAN.
I'm afraid I'm nothing particular. My father was half - English and half - American, and my mother half - German and half - Dutch.
#AMERICAN.
My! That's a bit streaky, any old way. Now, I don't believe we've much use any more for those gentlemen in buttons. We've grown kind of mild - we don't think of self as we used to do.
#GERMAN.
'Cigarren! Donnerwetter'!
#AMERICAN.
That flash of beer!
#WAITER.
'Komm' gleich'! little more, and he will join George Washington! I was about to remark when he intruded: In this year of grace 1913 the kingdom of Christ is quite a going concern. We are mighty near universal brotherhood. The colonel here is a man of blood and iron, but give him an opportunity to be magnanimous, and he'll be right there. Oh, sir! yep!
#LITTLE MAN.
I wonder. One wants to, but somehow -
#AMERICAN.
You seem kind of skeery about that. You've had experience, maybe. I'm an optimist - I think we're bound to make the devil hum in the near future. I opine we shall occasion a good deal of trouble to that old party. There's about to be a holocaust of selfish interests. The colonel there with old - man Nietch he won't know himself. There's going to be a very sacred opportunity.
#GERMAN.
'Der Teufel'!
#ENGLISHMAN.
What does he say?
#GERMAN.
Our drain has come in, de oder platform; only one minute we haf.
#AMERICAN.
Now, that's very provoking. I won't get that flash of beer.
#AMERICAN.
What's that? Help?
#LITTLE MAN.
Come along, good woman, come along!
#AMERICAN.
Guess I'd like that window raised; it's kind of chilly after that old run they gave us.
#AMERICAN.
The Germans are great readers. Very stimulating practice. I read most anything myself! "Don Quixote" - fine book. We Americans take considerable stock in old man Quixote. Bit of a wild - cat - but we don't laugh at him.
#GERMAN.
He is dead. Dead as a sheep. A good thing, too.
#AMERICAN.
In America we have still quite an amount of chivalry.
#GERMAN.
Chivalry is nothing 'sentimentalisch'. In modern days - no good. A man must push, he must pull.
#AMERICAN.
So you say. But I judge your form of chivalry is sacrifice to the state. We allow more freedom to the individual soul. Where there's something little and weak, we feel it kind of noble to give up to it. That way we feel elevated.
#GERMAN.
'Ach'! So!
#AMERICAN.
Dear me!
#LITTLE MAN.
Is there room? I can't find a seat.
#AMERICAN.
Why, yes! There's a seat for one.
#LITTLE MAN.
May I?
#AMERICAN.
Come right in!
#AMERICAN.
Where's the mother?
#LITTLE MAN.
Afraid she got left behind.
#AMERICAN.
My! That would appear to be quite a domestic incident.
#GERMAN.
And you haf got her bundle, and her baby. Ha!
#AMERICAN.
I smile. I guess Providence has played it pretty low down on you. It's sure acted real mean.
#AMERICAN.
Maybe you'd better get off right smart and restore that baby. There's nothing can act madder than a mother.
#LITTLE MAN.
Poor thing, yes! What she must be suffering!
#AMERICAN.
How did it eventuate?
#LITTLE MAN.
We got there just as the train was going to start; and I jumped, thinking I could help her up. But it moved too quickly, and - and left her.
#AMERICAN.
Guess I'd have thrown the baby out to her.
#LITTLE MAN.
I was afraid the poor little thing might break.
#AMERICAN.
It's highly entertaining - not for the baby. What kind of an old baby is it, anyway? I judge it's a bit - niffy.
#LITTLE MAN.
Afraid I've hardly looked at it yet.
#AMERICAN.
Which end up is it?
#LITTLE MAN.
Oh! I think the right end. Yes, yes, it is.
#AMERICAN.
Well, that's something. Maybe you should hold it out of window a bit. Very excitable things, babies!
#ENGLISHWOMAN.
No, no!
#ENGLISHMAN.
My dear!
#AMERICAN.
You are right, ma'am. I opine there's a draught out there. This baby is precious. We've all of us got stock in this baby in a manner of speaking. This is a little bit of universal brotherhood. Is it a woman baby? can only see the top of its head.
#AMERICAN.
You can't always tell from that. It looks kind of over - wrapped up. Maybe it had better be unbound.
#GERMAN.
'Nein, nein, nein'!
#AMERICAN.
I think you are very likely right, colonel. It might be a pity to unbind that baby. I guess the lady should be consulted in this matter.
#ENGLISHWOMAN.
Yes, yes, of course - !
#ENGLISHMAN.
Let it be! Little beggar seems all right.
#AMERICAN.
That would seem only known to Providence at this moment. I judge it might be due to humanity to look at its face.
#LITTLE MAN.
It's sucking my' finger. There, there - nice little thing - there!
#AMERICAN.
I would surmise in your leisure moments you have created babies, sir?
#LITTLE MAN.
Oh! no - indeed, no.
#AMERICAN.
Dear me! - That is a loss. I think we may esteem ourselves fortunate to have this little stranger right here with us. Demonstrates what a hold the little and weak have upon us nowadays. The colonel here - a man of blood and iron - there he sits quite calm next door to it. Now, this baby is rather chastening - that is a sign of grace, in the colonel - that is true heroism.
#LITTLE MAN.
I - I can see its face a little now.
#AMERICAN.
What sort of a physiognomy has it, anyway?
#LITTLE MAN.
I don't see anything but - but spots.
#GERMAN.
Oh! Ha! Pfui!
#AMERICAN.
I am told that is not uncommon amongst babies. Perhaps we could have you inform us, ma'am.
#ENGLISHWOMAN.
Yes, of course - only what sort of -
#LITTLE MAN.
They seem all over its - I feel sure it's - it's quite a good baby underneath.
#AMERICAN.
That will be rather difficult to come at. I'm just a bit sensitive. I've very little use for affections of the epidermis.
#GERMAN.
Pfui!
#AMERICAN.
I guess it would be well to fumigate this carriage. Does it suffer, do you think?
#LITTLE MAN.
Really, I don't - I'm not sure - I know so little about babies. I think it would have a nice expression - if - if it showed.
#AMERICAN.
Is it kind of boiled looking?
#LITTLE MAN.
Yes - yes, it is.
#AMERICAN.
I judge this baby has the measles.
#ENGLISHWOMAN.
Poor little thing! Shall I - ?
#ENGLISHMAN.
No, no - Dash it!
#AMERICAN.
I honour your emotion, ma'am. It does credit to us all. But I sympathize with your husband too. The measles is a very important pestilence in connection with a grown woman.
#LITTLE MAN.
It likes my finger awfully. Really, it's rather a sweet baby.
#AMERICAN.
Well, that would appear to be quite a question. About them spots, now? Are they rosy?
#LITTLE MAN.
No - o; they're dark, almost black.
#GERMAN.
Gott! Typhus!
#AMERICAN.
Typhus! That's quite an indisposition!
#ENGLISHMAN.
Bit stuffy for you here, dear, isn't it?
#AMERICAN.
There's nothing I admire more'n courage. Guess I'll go and smoke in the corridor.
#AMERICAN.
This is the most sublime spectacle I have ever envisaged. There ought to be a record of this. Guess I'm wanted in the dining - car.
#OFFICIAL.
'Das ist der Herr'.
#OFFICIAL.
'Sie haben einen Buben gestohlen'?
#LITTLE MAN.
I only speak English and American.
#OFFICIAL.
'Dies ist nicht Ihr Bube'?
#LITTLE MAN.
Take care - it's ill. Ill - the baby -
#OFFICIAL.
'Verstehe nicht'. Dis is nod your baby? No?
#LITTLE MAN.
No, it is not. No.
#OFFICIAL.
Gut! You are 'rested.
#LITTLE MAN.
Why? I don't want the poor baby.
#OFFICIAL.
'Dies ist nicht Ihr Gepack' - pag? Mary. No.
#OFFICIAL.
Gut! You are 'rested.
#LITTLE MAN.
I only took it for the poor woman. I'm not a thief - I'm - I'm -
#OFFICIAL.
Verstehe nicht.
#LITTLE MAN.
There, there - poor, poor!
#OFFICIAL.
Halt still! You are 'rested. It is all right.
#LITTLE MAN.
Where is the mother?
#OFFICIAL.
She comet by next drain. Das telegram say: 'Halt einen Herren mit schwarzem Buben and schwarzem Gepack'. 'Rest gentleman mit black baby and black - pag.
#OFFICIAL.
'Komm mit us'.
#AMERICAN.
Just a moment!
#AMERICAN.
Guess you've got an angel from heaven there! What's the gentleman in buttons for?
#OFFICIAL.
'Was ist das'?
#AMERICAN.
Is there anybody here that can understand American?
#OFFICIAL.
'Verstehe nicht'.
#AMERICAN.
Well, just watch my gestures. I was saying you have an angel from heaven there. You have there a man in whom Gawd takes quite an amount of stock. You have no call to arrest him. No, Sir. Providence has acted pretty mean, loading off that baby on him. The little man has a heart of gold.
#OFFICIAL.
'Aber, das ist zu viel'!
#AMERICAN.
Now, don't rattle me! Man 'Herz' 'von' Gold. This is a flower of the field - he don't want no gentleman in buttons to pluck him up.
#OFFICIAL.
'Verstehe absolut nichts'. 'Ich muss mein' duty do.
#AMERICAN.
But I'm telling you. This is a white man. This is probably the whitest man on Gawd's earth.
#OFFICIAL.
'Das macht nichts' - gut or no gut, I muss mein duty do.
#AMERICAN.
Oh! Very well, arrest him; do your duty. This baby has typhus.
#AMERICAN.
First - class typhus, black typhus, schwarzen typhus. Now you have it. I'm kind o' sorry for you and the gentleman in buttons. Do your duty!
#OFFICIAL.
Typhus? Der Bub - die baby hat typhus?
#AMERICAN.
I'm telling you.
#OFFICIAL.
Gott im Himmel!
#AMERICAN.
here's a gentleman will corroborate me.
#OFFICIAL.
Typhus! 'Aber das ist grasslich'!
#AMERICAN.
I kind o' thought you'd feel like that.
#OFFICIAL.
'Die Sanitatsmachine! Gleich'!
#OFFICIAL.
'Was zu thun'?
#AMERICAN.
Guess you'd better isolate the baby.
#OFFICIAL.
"'Rest gentleman mit black baby." Wir must de gentleman hold. 'Bitte, mein Herr, sagen Sie ihm, den Buben zu niedersetzen'.
#GERMAN.
He say: Put down the baby.
#OFFICIAL.
You must.
#ENGLISHMAN.
Good man!
#GERMAN.
His spirit ever denies.
#OFFICIAL.
'Aber er muss'! 'Sag' Ihm': Instantly put down baby, and komm' mit us.
#LITTLE MAN.
Leave the poor ill baby here alone? Be - be - be d - d to you!
#AMERICAN.
Bully!
#AMERICAN.
What does that body - snatcher say?
#GERMAN.
He say this man use the baby to save himself from arrest. Very smart he say.
#AMERICAN.
I judge you do him an injustice. This is a white man. He's got a black baby, and he won' leave it in the lurch. Guess we would all act noble that way, give us the chance.
#AMERICAN.
Guess you'd better go out of business and wait for the mother.
#OFFICIAL.
Die Mutter sall 'rested be for taking out baby mit typhus. Ha! Put ze baby down! Do you 'ear?
#AMERICAN.
Now, see here. 'Pears to me you don't suspicion just how beautiful this is. Here we have a man giving his life for that old baby that's got no claim on him. This is not a baby of his own making. No, sir, this is a very Christ - like proposition in the gentleman.
#OFFICIAL.
Put ze baby down, or ich will goummand someone it to do.
#AMERICAN.
That will be very interesting to watch.
#OFFICIAL.
Dake it vrom him.
#AMERICAN.
Guess I lost that.
#GERMAN.
He say he is not his officier.
#AMERICAN.
That just tickles me to death.
#OFFICIAL.
Vill nobody dake ze Bub'?
#ENGLISHWOMAN.
Yes - I -
#ENGLISHMAN.
By Jove! Will you!
#OFFICIAL.

#MOTHER.
'Ach! Ach! Mei' Bubi'!
#OFFICIAL.
'Nimm die Frau'!
#OFFICIAL.
'Warum haben Sie einen Buben mit Typhus mit ausgebracht'?
#AMERICAN.
What was that? I don't want to miss any.
#GERMAN.
He say: Why did you a baby with typhus with you bring out?
#AMERICAN.
Well, that's quite a question.
#MOTHER.
Mei' Bubi - Typhus - aber Typhus? 'Nein, nein, nein! Typhus'!
#OFFICIAL.
Er hat Typhus.
#MOTHER.
'Nein, nein, nein'!
#AMERICAN.
Guess she's kind of right! I judge the typhus is where the baby' slobbered on the shawl, and it's come off on him.
#OFFICIAL.
Er hat Typhus.
#AMERICAN.
Now, that's where you slop over. Come right here.
#AMERICAN.
Skin out the baby's leg. If we don't locate spots on that, it'll be good enough for me.
#MOTHER.
Mei' Bubi!
#AMERICAN.
White as a banana. Guess you've made kind of a fool of us with your old typhus.
#OFFICIAL.
Lass die Frau!
#MOTHER.
Mei' Bubi!
#OFFICIAL.
'Sie wollen den Herrn accusiren'?
#AMERICAN.
What's that? They goin' to pitch him after all?
#AMERICAN.
Ra! Ra! Brother; I am proud to know you. This is one of the greatest moments I have ever experienced. I think I sense the situation when I say that we all esteem it an honour to breathe the rather inferior atmosphere of this station here Along with our little friend. I guess we shall all go home and treasure the memory of his face as the whitest thing in our museum of recollections. And perhaps this good woman will also go home and wash the face of our little brother here. I am inspired with a new faith in mankind. Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to present to you a sure - enough saint - only wants a halo, to be transfigured. Stand right up.
#AMERICAN.
Hold on just a minute! Guess I'll take a snapshot of the miracle. This ought to look bully!
