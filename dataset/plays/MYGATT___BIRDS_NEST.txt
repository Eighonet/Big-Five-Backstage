#MARTIN.
Nine - ten - eleven - twelve - !
#SANFORD.
That you, Martin?
#MARTIN.
Yes, sir.
#SANFORD.
Well, well, Martin, what have you got to keep you awake?
#MARTIN.
I hardly know, sir! It was such a night, sir! I was going to bring up the ear - trumpet -
#SANFORD.
Well, well, did you think you’d find it here, listening to those everlasting chimes? But I’m glad you reminded me, Martin! I shouldn’t have slept a wink if I hadn’t known it was all right, every way!
#MARTIN.
Yes, sir, I put it on the table with the other packages -
#SANFORD.
Thanks. But don’t go in yet, Martin! I - I want to talk.
#MARTIN.
Yes, sir.
#SANFORD.
Just look at her! Isn’t she splendid? Doesn’t she - Now just listen to that, will you? Don’t that show the state I’m in - callin’ the moon “her” and “she”! Why, that’s what they say in the magazines. I was readin’ one last night - one of those love - stories! Why, Martin, I haven’t said “her” and “she” for forty years!
#MARTIN.
Yes, sir.
#SANFORD.
Well, don’t that show - ?
#MARTIN.
The moon’s beautiful, sir!
#SANFORD.
Beautiful! Why, Martin, beautiful’s no word for it! She - she’s elegant! Magnificent - er - “magnifique,” I think the French would call it! Such a romantic language, French! Mrs. McCormorant’s kept a French maid for years! But of course you couldn’t be expected to know, or - or feel - !
#MARTIN.
Not a pain, sir, in your heart?
#SANFORD.
Pain? - in my heart? What are you talking about?
#MARTIN.
Beg pardon, sir, but I understood the doctor said -
#SANFORD.
Damn the doctor! Don’t you know I only went to satisfy Evelina - Mrs. McCormorant? Why, I never was fitter in my life! But she does love me so - and I her! I her! Ah, Martin, again that is something you cannot understand - when two hearts beat as one! I suppose you’d think it was a disease!
#MARTIN.
Sir - ?
#SANFORD.
Ah, no matter! Just think, Martin, this time to - morrow night we shall be here - she and I - here in the Bird’s Nest - Ha - ha - not bad, that, considering the nest - egg! I whispering sweet nothings into her little sea - shell ear!
#MARTIN.
Beg pardon, sir, but shall I fetch the ear - trumpet up to your room?
#SANFORD.
Eh? Now what did you mean by that, I’d like to know?
#MARTIN.
Why, I thought you wanted it, sir!
#SANFORD.
Yes, yes, I wanted it, but you see - I’d just been saying - er - I’d just been alluding - oh, damn it, no matter! No matter!
#MARTIN.
Shall I fetch it, sir?
#SANFORD.
I suppose so! But mind, if ever I find you insinuating things about Mrs. McCormorant’s deafness - oh, well, you may take your month’s pay and clear out! Why, it might gum the whole game!
#MARTIN.
Yes, sir. In fact, sir, as you mentioned it, and a similar thought being in my own mind -
#SANFORD.
I’m not mentioning anything, Martin - and neither are you! - Assuredly not the night before my wedding! - when you know perfectly well, or would, if you had the least touch of romance - that I’m all of a flutter inside! Now where’s that confounded button? This jumpy moonlight makes everything disappear!
#MARTIN.
Here, sir - ! Now you’ll be able to see which ear - trumpet’s the best, sir!
#SANFORD.
Oh, you unwrapped them!
#MARTIN.
Why, yes, seeing how important it was for to - morrow! I was very careful, sir -
#SANFORD.
Yes, yes, it would never do to let her go to church with her trumpet broken. Dear, dear, such an unfortunate accident - and the day before the wedding! Here, let’s bring it all into the garden - Not to hear the vows - “Till death do us part!” Look here - before I go upstairs, let’s try them out - You go over there - and say something!
#MARTIN.
But you’re not deaf, sir!
#SANFORD.
No, I’m not deaf - but it might give us an idea - There! Now try it!
#MARTIN.
You’d best go to bed, sir!
#SANFORD.
I can’t hear a word!
#MARTIN.
You wouldn’t want rheumatism on your wedding day! You know what the doctor -
#SANFORD.
Here - let’s try this one - and change places with me - and you hold the thing - um - a - bob to your ear! Do you know, they say the Bird’s Nest was built for lovers! Can you hear?
#MARTIN.
So I have heard, sir!
#SANFORD.
That’s good! Then I guess I’ll give her this one - it’s too late to try ’em all!
#MARTIN.
Best try if I can hear the story, sir!
#SANFORD.
The story? Oh, yes! Well, I had it from the man I bought Bird’s Nest of, a year ago, before I put in the improvements. Queer! I don’t believe I’ve thought of it since that day! And I asked him why he didn’t put it in order himself, and he - he said that years ago his father was planning to bring his bride here when -
#MARTIN.
Yes, sir?
#SANFORD.
Why, he could! He simply couldn’t! You see - Bird’s Nest was built for lovers - ! Lovers, Martin! Why don’t you laugh? Don’t you see the joke?
#MARTIN.
No, sir. Is the story a joke, sir?
#SANFORD.
The story? Dear, no! A ghost - story, Martin - think of that! Brrr - rrr! Spooks - haunted! Nobody but me’s had the nerve to think of living here for fifty years and more! Afraid the visitors mightn’t approve. Visitors - ha - ha! Bear in mind, Martin - Bird’s Nest was built for lovers. Whatever made you wind up that damned old clock, Martin?
#MARTIN.
I didn’t wind it!
#SANFORD.
You must have! It hasn’t struck since I took the cottage!
#MARTIN.
But it is striking, sir, isn’t it? Striking midnight?
#SANFORD.
So you have heard the story?
#MARTIN.
Yes, sir - ! Ten - eleven - twelve - ! Ah - !
#SANFORD.
Built for lovers - ! Well, why not? Why not? Ain’t love the strongest thing in the world? - Stronger than death?
#LYDIA.
That was very polite of him, dear Richard! Quite as if he understood the circumstances.
#RICHARD.
Yes, yes, but pray do not let us think of that now, my darling! We are home - at last!
#LYDIA.
Yes, of course, dear Richard! But we must be particular about the people - I fear he is not the only one about!
#RICHARD.
Must we think of them at once? Couldn’t we just settle down?
#LYDIA.
Settle down? Without knowing who’s about? The idea! Do you think my mamma brought me up to be that kind of a housekeeper?
#RICHARD.
I’m sure you’re the best housekeeper a man ever had!
#LYDIA.
Thank you, thank you, dear Richard! And I’ll prove it to you! Though I don’t know why I said that about the people a minute ago. Things puzzle me so sometimes. I’ll race you to the kitchen - though it’s unladylike, I suppose, to run - but I do want to make you a pasty. Mamma always made them for my papa, and my marriage being so near, she taught me last week. I made them perfectly yesterday!
#RICHARD.
Lydia! What are they? What on earth can they all be?
#LYDIA.
I haven’t the - the ghost of an idea! What do you think they are, Richard? You’ve studied so much, - wouldn’t the Rev. Mr. Heathcote have prepared you for them?
#RICHARD.
He might have, I suppose, but I don’t believe I ever got that far advanced!
#LYDIA.
That’s because I interfered with the pursuit of your studies, dear Richard! If you hadn’t stopped to marry me -
#RICHARD.
Ah, Lydia, that’s the best thing my poor old tutor ever did, - marrying us to - day!
#LYDIA.
To - day? Oh, Richard, - there’s the queer feeling again - it comes and goes! But if it was to - day, - Oh, Richard, why were we so long getting home?
#RICHARD.
It was that little spill we had, my darling! That’s why you’re still a little shaken. I feel much the same way myself! Ajax was trotting along nicely and, after all, it was hardly strange how frightened he became at that steam - car!
#LYDIA.
Poor little pony! I should think they might have waited for their old experiment till after our wedding! One thing, I am sure that when Papa informs Mr. Van Beuren about the accident, he will put a stop to any such ridiculous practises! Steam - cars, indeed!
#RICHARD.
I suppose so. And yet, of course it isn’t as if it had been a serious accident! Ajax stopped as soon as we upset! You - you’re quite sure it didn’t hurt you, my darling?
#LYDIA.
Why, Richard, you’ve asked me that a hundred times! Of course it didn’t hurt! I was just a bit frightened - more for poor little Jaxy than myself. How he did run! That steam - car made such a queer noise - and moving that way without a thing to make it go. Positively creepy, I call it! But my frock’s all right! There’s only this -
#RICHARD.
Kiss it and make it well! Dearest Lydia, how thankful I am it was nothing serious!
#LYDIA.
And how thankful I am for you! Just what you showed me? No more?
#RICHARD.
A mere scratch!
#LYDIA.
Dear Richard - will you not think me foolish if -
#RICHARD.
If what, Pet? Is it being my wife makes you so afraid of me? Indeed I’ve never noticed such behavior before!
#LYDIA.
Don’t laugh, dear Richard! I know I was never very religious! It is so good to be alive! Alive - ! Alive - ! Religion is just for poor sick dead people, but -
#RICHARD.
What, Lydia?
#LYDIA.
Well, on Sunday, would you send a messenger to the Rev. Mr. Heathcote and have him offer that - that thanksgiving in the prayer - book about a safe return? Oh, Richard, I - I couldn’t bear to have been hurt in the runaway - Not to be here, alive and happy, in Bird’s Nest -
#RICHARD.
But we are in Bird’s Nest, my dearest! We are! We are!
#LYDIA.
Of course we are! But I’m glad to have you tell me so! You see, Richard, long before I was a married woman - one afternoon last spring it was - an old gipsy woman came to our house one day, and she read my palm - Mamma was out - or she never would have permitted it! - And she told me -
#RICHARD.
What did she tell you?
#LYDIA.
She said - “It will end where it began!”
#RICHARD.
Was she referring to my Greek? That ended where it began!
#LYDIA.
Mamma thought it meant my marriage! She consulted the Vicar, but he was too highly educated to believe in such “nonsense,” he called it! And I was always so happy - in spite of sister Eliza’s being so much prettier than me - don’t you think so, Richard?
#RICHARD.
Eliza! Flibbertigibbets! Why, you’re the prettiest girl in the world! There! See for yourself - !
#LYDIA.
How on earth can you think so? Lucky my hair curls, isn’t it? This horrid little mark will never show. Now poor sister Eliza - of course she is much prettier than me, Richard - but her hair’s straight as a poker, and do you know, whenever she tries to have curls, she invariably burns it!
#RICHARD.
Well, speaking of beauty - Good gracious! Glass all round the lamp! How on earth would the smoke get out? And a string - oh, heavens - ! What have I done?
#LYDIA.
Oh, Richard - !
#RICHARD.
How very strange!
#LYDIA.
Richard! My heavens! Did you ever see such clothes? She must have got them out of the Ark!
#RICHARD.
Poor thing! I shall never complain again about women changing the fashions! What else was there for her grandchildren to do?
#LYDIA.
Grandchildren! Why, Richard, I’m sure Grandmamma never wore such a frock! She must have been a great - great, at least!
#RICHARD.
And not on my side! Possibly yours, Lydia?
#LYDIA.
Not at all! But if she isn’t on yours, Richard - ? But she must be on yours! Else why is she here?
#RICHARD.
I tell you she isn’t, Lydia! Look! There he is again! Who can it be?
#LYDIA.
Oh, Richard, dear Richard, I - I don’t like to look at her! It frightens me!
#MARTIN.
I beg pardon, sir, but did you call?
#RICHARD.
Call? No!
#MARTIN.
Nor you, Madam?
#LYDIA.
Yes! Do you know who that lady was?
#MARTIN.
Why, that, Madam, that is Mrs. McCormorant!
#RICHARD.
“Is”! And what a name! “Mc” what? We never had such a name in our family!
#LYDIA.
You’ve already said she wasn’t in your family! And she certainly wasn’t in mine! Will you please tell us who she was? And why her portrait is here?
#MARTIN.
Why, Madam, Mr. Sanford had it put here to surprise her, her becoming his bride in the little church here to - morrow!
#LYDIA.
His bride - to - morrow?
#RICHARD.
Then she’s alive?
#MARTIN.
Why, yes, sir, to be sure she’s alive!
#RICHARD.
But her frock? My wife was quite certain, and so was I, that her frock was - er - well, I don’t like to say anything against the lady, but, well, you know, rather old - fashioned, to say the least! You can see - there’s rather a difference - !
#MARTIN.
There is, indeed, sir! But I have often heard Mr. Sanford say, sir, that all Mrs. McCormorant’s gowns are in the height of fashion!
#LYDIA.
I trust you don’t mean to imply -
#MARTIN.
I imply nothing to your disfavor, Madam - !
#LYDIA.
Of course her frock is of no consequence - nor her being married - but - why should her portrait be here - here in Bird’s Nest?
#RICHARD.
Yes, that’s what we don’t care for! Why should her portrait be here, in our parlor?
#MARTIN.
Why, so they can both admire it, I suppose, sir, after she comes to live here to - morrow!
#LYDIA.
Oh, Richard! I - I feel faint!
#RICHARD.
There, there, my darling! Shall I fetch your salts?
#LYDIA.
No, no, it’s not my salts I need! Oh, what did he say, Richard? What did he say?
#RICHARD.
It was nothing, my darling! We - we must have misunderstood him!
#LYDIA.
No, I don’t think so! I - Oh, Richard, don’t you know? We’ve been mistaken before about - about Bird’s Nest?
#RICHARD.
My dearest Lydia - !
#LYDIA.
You said just now that - that lady was alive - and going to be married, and that she - that they - plan to live here, in Bird’s Nest?
#MARTIN.
Yes, Madam!
#LYDIA.
But doesn’t she know that Richard and I are to live in Bird’s Nest?
#MARTIN.
Are you sure, Madam?
#LYDIA.
We were to live here! Oh, don’t you know? We were to live here - and then - then Ajax was frightened by the steam - car, coming home from church this afternoon, and ever since -
#MARTIN.
The folks about here always say Bird’s Nest was built for lovers!
#LYDIA.
The folks? Since when have they said that? I never heard it!
#MARTIN.
No, Madam, - it was not - in your day! Built for lovers - !
#LYDIA.
And are they - lovers?
#MARTIN.
Mrs. McCormorant is very rich.
#RICHARD.
You keep saying, “Mrs.”! She has been married before?
#MARTIN.
Just so! An attractive woman some think, sir, in spite of her deafness.
#RICHARD.
But why should she be deaf?
#LYDIA.
What does it matter whether she’s deaf or not when -
#MARTIN.
It’s merely her age, sir - ! Sixty - three she is, but -
#RICHARD.
Good God! It’s impossible! It’s unnatural!
#MARTIN.
She took a great fancy to Bird’s Nest the day Mr. Sanford brought her over! It makes them both feel quite young again, so they say!
#LYDIA.
Young! Sixty - three - ! I’m not eighteen - !
#MARTIN.
Haven’t old people a right to happiness, Madam?
#LYDIA.
The folks about here say Bird’s Nest was built for lovers!
#MARTIN.
Quite so, Madam! I am glad to have seen you, Madam - I had heard - so much. But I must go now. I have to make sure Mr. Sanford has taken his medicine before retiring - his heart’s not just right.
#RICHARD.
Mr. Sanford, I presume, is the bridegroom?
#MARTIN.
Er - yes, sir! And somewhat excited over to - morrow.
#LYDIA.
A nice - appearing old man, Richard! I’m glad he’s not being married to - morrow!
#RICHARD.
What do you mean?
#LYDIA.
Well, I prefer their being horrid - like that man and that dreadful woman in the house! I couldn’t help being sorry for the gentle lady that was here, - oh, you know, quite a while ago!
#RICHARD.
You mean the one they called “Virginia”? That was visiting Bird’s Nest before he brought her here to live?
#LYDIA.
Yes, Virginia! But he didn’t really love her! We couldn’t have had them about! What a cold she took that night! I guess it settled on her lungs right away! They weren’t here when we came back.
#RICHARD.
I know - !
#LYDIA.
And another year - that dark beauty. He was speaking a foreign tongue to her when we came. “Celeste,” I think her name was. I think it is a French name. With what I had picked up at the Academy for Young Ladies, I could easily see they were planning to settle right here in a few weeks. She didn’t love him at all! Do you remember how frightened she was, Richard? Big women are always such cowards!
#RICHARD.
Yes, of course, - but -
#LYDIA.
What is it, Richard?
#RICHARD.
You - we’ve upset the plans of a good many people, haven’t we? Need we bother any more about them? We have each other - to - night - !
#LYDIA.
Ah, Richard! Richard! You are only a man - ! No one must live here! Don’t you understand?
#RICHARD.
You mean - else we couldn’t come back?
#LYDIA.
We couldn’t come back! Just think, Richard - we couldn’t come back - ! We’d wait all the long, long year, and then - when to - night came - we couldn’t come back - !
#RICHARD.
Oh, my darling! But we must come back! It is what we live for! It -
#LYDIA.
Just so, Richard! I know you always agree when you - remember - !
#RICHARD.
Do you think you can manage it? The lady isn’t here - this time.
#LYDIA.
But he’s here! And do you know, Richard, in spite of what Mamma has always taught me, I hardly think men are a bit braver than women!
#RICHARD.
Oh, Lydia, you really think not!
#LYDIA.
Really, really, dear Richard! But, oh, look at that moon! Isn’t it a shame to worry about anything with that over our heads? Oh, Richard, I want to dance. If there were only music!
#RICHARD.
Why not make it yourself? The spinnet is there - your papa’s wedding present - he thought you would like it the first night! Look, Lydia, how clear it stands in the moonlight!
#LYDIA.
I could play the minuet! But, oh, that isn’t enough! Come, Richard! Back to the garden! I want to dance!
#RICHARD.
But the music, dearest Lydia! I can never do the steps without the music! Don’t you remember how you laughed at me that time last week?
#LYDIA.
There will be music, dear Richard! Don’t you remember - it used to go - this way - ? Sh - this must be he!
#RICHARD.
After all, Lydia, this is my house! Had I not better call him out and have done with it?
#LYDIA.
Sh - !
#SANFORD.
Ah, romance! All very well for young folks. But she’ll hear my vows all right with this! And romance comes easy at $100,000!
#RICHARD.
Lydia! It’s desecration. Let me challenge him and end it!
#LYDIA.
Hush! Leave it to me - And that - He said that was to hear his vows with. How very strange!
#SANFORD.
’Might as well stay here. ’Can’t sleep a wink.
#RICHARD.
Lydia! It’s our one night! Make him go away!
#LYDIA.
Ah, if he’d go away! If he’d burn that picture, and pack right up, and go away from Bird’s Nest, and never come back!
#SANFORD.
Damned pretty little house for Evelina and me! Damned lucky to get it, and so cheap, too! Some clever Johnny must’ve made up that yarn about the ghosts to pull the prices down! Ghosts! Ha - ha - ha! When I sell, I’ll sell high! I can swear I’ve never seen ’em!
#LYDIA.
I suppose you don’t see me, sir?
#RICHARD.
Dearest Lydia, pray be careful!
#LYDIA.
There, sir! Is it only your bride who can’t hear?
#SANFORD.
Ah, never mind. Too much work - pick it up.
#LYDIA.
Come, Richard!
#RICHARD.
Is it quite safe, do you think?
#LYDIA.
We don’t want to hurt you, sir. Say it with me, Richard - But Bird’s Nest is our very own! Will you go away? You don’t love your bride! And you know - Bird’s Nest was built for lovers!
#SANFORD.
$100,000, by George! That’s enough to make up for a whole lot! And Bird’s Nest -
#LYDIA.
Come, Richard! Let us finish our dance.
#MARTIN.
Dead! Oh, my God! How dare you, you little - little -
#LYDIA.
Oh, my dearest - not yet! Not yet!
#RICHARD.
We had just begun! We had waited a whole year!
#LYDIA.
Oh, Richard! Richard! The church clock has struck! In a moment - our clock!
#RICHARD.
My darling - next year -
#LYDIA.
Oh, stop it! Stop it! Oh, Richard, I - I haven’t seen the nursery yet!
#MARTIN.
Too bad! But Bird’s Nest was built for lovers!
