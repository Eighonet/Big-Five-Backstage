#EPHRAIM SIMPSON.
Is this the office of the “Petersville Post”?
#EDITOR.
It is.
#ELISE.
You are the editor, I reckon?
#EDITOR.
You are right.
#ELISE.
Well, you see my name is Ephraim Simpson, and I live over to Greenfield. I’ve been workin’ this summer hayin’, but I found it was too hard work, and I reckoned I’d come to you and see if you couldn’t give me a chance to edit a little.
#EDITOR.
Why, you know it is quite a difficult thing to learn to edit a paper. It requires education, judgment, and a variety of other qualifications.
#ELISE.
Oh, as to that, I guess I can satisfy you. I have tended school in our deestrict for four winters, and can read, write and cipher like a book.
#EDITOR.
That is all very well, but you know one must be able to compose as well as write.
#ELISE.
Oh, compositions you mean. Well, I have written them some. Don’t you want me to try my hand and show you what I kin do?
#EDITOR.
I am not in particular need of an assistant just now, but perhaps you might as well sit down and try your hand at writing an editorial.
#JOHN JENKINS.
Are you the editor of the “Post”?
#EDITOR.
I am.
#JOHN JENKINS.
Then, sir, allow me to present you with a box of my famous salve
#EDITOR.
Thank you.
#JOHN JENKINS.
Perhaps you’d be willing to insert this little paragraph about it. I wrote it off to save you trouble
#EDITOR.
We have received from Dr. Jenkins a box of his Magnetic Salve, which is warranted to cure every description of cut or bruise in an incredibly short space of time. We know a boy who accidentally cut off one of his fingers. His mother being absent, he bethought himself of Dr. Jenkins’s salve, which she had bought the day previous. He applied it to the injured finger, and before night there was not even a scar to indicate where the wound had been.
#EDITOR.
You want me to insert this?
#JOHN JENKINS.
Yes, sir.
#EDITOR.
But I don’t know the boy referred to.
#JOHN JENKINS.
My dear sir, aint you rather new in the business?
#EDITOR.
Well, and what if I am?
#JOHN JENKINS.
I thought you were, or you’d understand that this is the way they always do things.
#EDITOR.
We are a little more conscientious than editors generally. However, you assure me that the salve is good?
#JOHN JENKINS.
Nothing better in the whole world, sir.
#EDITOR.
And you think it would be safe to speak well of it?
#JOHN JENKINS.
Sir, you will be conferring a blessing on the community.
#EDITOR.
Very well, I will write a little puff for you.
#JOHN JENKINS.
Thank you, sir.
#PRINTER’S DEVIL.
More copy, sir.
#EDITOR.
Here it is
#EDITOR.
Come in.
#ARAMINTA ELLIS
Please, sir, I am Araminta Ellis, the authoress of “Lines on a Faded Buttercup.”
#EDITOR.
I am delighted to see you, Miss Ellis. Did the—the poem you speak of appear in the “Post”?
#ARAMINTA ELLIS
No, sir, it was contributed to the “Weekly Bulletin.” I have never written anything for the “Post,” but should be willing to do so. What are your terms?
#EDITOR.
Three dollars a year.
#ARAMINTA ELLIS
I do not mean the subscription price of the paper, but how much do you pay your poetical contributors?
#EDITOR.
We—ahem—that is, our friends are kind enough to make us a free gift of their productions in that line.
#ARAMINTA ELLIS
But don’t you pay for superior poetry? I have here a poem which I would like to see transferred to your columns
#EDITOR.
Seventy - seven stanzas! That would be too long for our columns. Couldn’t you shorten it?
#ARAMINTA ELLIS
Not without marring its symmetrical proportions. But I will write another and a shorter one soon, which will perhaps suit you better.
#EDITOR.
Thank you, Miss Ellis. That will undoubtedly be better suited to our columns.
#GEORGE CRANE.
Sir, don’t you regard it as a part of an editor’s duty to unmask villany and expose it to the world?
#EDITOR.
Certainly, sir.
#GEORGE CRANE.
Then I should like to furnish you with some information respecting a neighbor of mine, named Henry Perkins. He is a hypocrite, sir! He professes a good deal, but secretly practises petty acts of meanness. I have every reason to believe that he beats his wife; and he has been suspected of robbing his neighbor’s hen - roosts. Just write an article touching him up, and I’ll subscribe to your paper for a year.
#EDITOR.
Cash in advance?
#GEORGE CRANE.
Yes.
#EDITOR.
Very well, then. I’m your man.
#WILLIAM RANDALL.
Is Mr. Clark in?
#EDITOR.
No, sir; but as his substitute I shall be happy to serve you.
#WILLIAM RANDALL.
You must know, sir, that I have been laboring for some years past on the preparation of a remedy for dyspepsia. At length, after great labor and research, I have prepared a pill which I am sure will prove an infallible cure in the most obstinate cases. I have the pleasure, sir, of presenting you with a box of Dr. William Randall’s Anti - Dyspepsia Pills
#EDITOR.
Thank you.
#WILLIAM RANDALL.
By the way, I suppose you will favor me with a notice?
#EDITOR.
Ye - es. , starts up.)
#EPHRAIM SIMPSON.
Well, Mister Editor, how’s that?
#EDITOR.
The hoss.—The hoss is a noble animal. He is also interestin’ and knows a good deal. Some folks get very much attached to their hosses. I knowed a Frenchman once, that thought so much of his hoss that he even went so far as to call his own mother a mare as a pet name. Hosses are very interestin’ animals when they don’t rare up. Not havin’ any more to say on this subjick, I will stop.
#EDITOR.
That is very good; but, on the whole, I don’t think there is any need of an assistant just yet. If there should be a time when I stand in need of one, I will certainly think of you.
#EPHRAIM SIMPSON.
Then you haint got anything for me to do?
#EDITOR.
Not just now.
#EPHRAIM SIMPSON.
Then I must go.
#EDITOR.
And this is the result of my first week’s labor as an editor. Excellent as my friend Clark has heretofore made the “Post,” I think he will acknowledge that I have made some improvements in it. What! What’s this?
#EDITOR.
How did this get into the paper?
#PRINTER‚ÄôS DEVIL.
You gave it out as copy, sir.
#EDITOR.
When?
#PRINTER‚ÄôS DEVIL.
The first day you were here.
#WILLIAM RANDALL.
Did you write that?
#EDITOR.
Yes. I hope it suits you.
#WILLIAM RANDALL.
Suits me! Confound your impudence! Suits me! What do you mean by that, sir?
#EDITOR.
You seem angry—why, I am at a loss to guess.
#WILLIAM RANDALL.
Sir, in noticing my medicine, you have insulted me.
#EDITOR.
In noticing your medicine! How?
#WILLIAM RANDALL.
, “He says it will cure the most obstinate case of dyspepsia. Perhaps it may.” I demand an explanation, sir.
#EDITOR.
It is very easily given. I only intended to say, that personally I had no experience of the matter, and not being able to speak positively, I said “perhaps!”
#WILLIAM RANDALL.
Is that true?
#EDITOR.
Certainly. But, if you wish, I will recall the statement in our next issue.
#WILLIAM RANDALL.
That would be more satisfactory to me.
#HENRY PERKINS.
Are you the editor?
#EDITOR.
Yes.
#HENRY PERKINS.
I suppose you don’t know who I am?
#EDITOR.
No, I don’t.
#HENRY PERKINS.
I am that Henry Perkins whom you have so atrociously libelled in your paper of this morning. Don’t think, sir, that such conduct is to go unpunished! I stand upon my rights, sir, as a citizen, and I will not be trampled upon.
#EDITOR.
Unhand me, sir!
#HENRY PERKINS.
There, you little blackguard! I guess you won’t slander me again in a hurry.
#EDITOR.
I’ll have the law of you, you villain!
#HENRY PERKINS.
You will, eh! Then I must give you your pay in advance.
#EDITOR.
I won’t stand this. I’ll leave a note for Clark, and go home this moment. There’s no knowing what may come next. It is as much as one’s life is worth to be an editor.
