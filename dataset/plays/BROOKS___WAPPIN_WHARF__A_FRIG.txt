#PATCH-EYE.
Darlin'! Darlin'! Darlin'!
#PATCH-EYE.
Me friend, the Duke, is thirsty. Will yer fill the cups? Hurry, ol' dear! And squeeze in jest a bit o' lemon. It sets the stomich.
#DARLIN'.
Yer sets yer stomich like it were hen's eggs. Alers coddlin' it.
#DUKE.
There 's no one like Darlin' fer mixin' grog.
#DARLIN'.
Fer that kind word I 'm lovin' yer. Ain 't he a figger o' a man? Wenus was nothin'. Jest nothin' at all.
#PATCH-EYE.
It 's grog beats off the melancholy. As soon as me pipes go dry, I gets homesick fer the ocean. Here we be, Duke, thrown up at last ter rot like driftwood on the shore. No more sailin' off to Trinidad! No tackin' 'round the Hebrides! We is ships as has sprung a leak. It was 'appy days when we sailed with ol' Flint on the Spanish Main.
#DUKE.
'Appy days, Patch!
#PATCH-EYE.
Aye! The blessed, dear, ol' roarin' hulk. No better pirate ever lived than Flint. Smart with his cutlass. Quick at the trigger. Grog! sloppin' pail o' it was jest a sip.
#DUKE.
I used ter tell him that his leg was holler.
#PATCH-EYE.
He was a vat, was Flint - jest a swishin' keg.
#DUKE.
Grog jest sizzled and disappeared, like when yer drops it on a red - hot seacoal.
#PATCH-EYE.
Fer twenty year and more me and you has seen ol' Flint march his wictims off the plank.
#DUKE.
"Step lively!" he 'd say. "Does n't yer hear Davy callin' to yer?" There was never a sailorman ever sat in the Port Light at Wappin' wharf which could drink with Flint.
#PATCH-EYE.
Wappin' wharf and gibbets is nothin' ter talk about. Funerals even is cheerfuller.
#DUKE.
There 's his parrot.
#PATCH-EYE.
She used ter cuss soft and gentle to herself - 'appy all the day. She ain 't spoke since Flint was took. Peckin' at yer finger and broodin'.
#DUKE.
There 's his ol' clock.
#PATCH-EYE.
As hung in the cabin o' the Spittin' Devil.
#DUKE.
With the pendulum gettin' tangled in a storm. A 'ell of a clock fer a bouncin' ship.
#PATCH-EYE.
She was tickin' peaceful the day Flint was hanged. But she stopped - does yer remember it? - the very minute they pushed him off the ladder.
#DUKE.
She ain 't ticked since.
#PATCH-EYE.
It makes yer 'stitious. And she won 't never run agin - that 's what Flint alers said - till his death 's revenged.
#DUKE.
He told us never ter wind her - says she 'd start hisself without no windin' when the right time came.
#PATCH-EYE.
If I was ter look up and see that pendulum swingin' - Horrers! Yeller elephants would be nothin'!
#DUKE.
Pooh! I 'd give a month o' grog jest ter hear the ol' dear tickin', and ter know that Flint was restin' easy in his rotten coffin - swappin' stories with the pretty angels.
#PATCH-EYE.
I loved Flint like a brother. It was him knocked this out. But it was jest in the way o' business. We differed a leetle in the loot. He was very persuasive, was ol' Flint.
#DUKE.
Yer talks like a woman. They loves yer to cuff 'em. Them was 'appy days, Patch.
#PATCH-EYE.
Blast me gig what 's left, Duke, but me and you has seen a heap o' sights. I suppose I 've drowned meself a hundred men. It 's comfertin' when yer lays awake at night. I feels I ain 't wasted meself. I 've used me gifts. I ain 't been a foolish virgin and put me shinin' talent inside a bushel. But me and you is driftwood now, Duke.
#DUKE.
Aye. But it ain 't no use snifflin' about it, ol' crocodile. Darlin' is certainly handy at mixin' grog. And we 've a right smart cabin with winders on the sea. Since I stuffed yer ol' shirt in the roof it hardly leaks.
#PATCH-EYE.
My shirt! Next week is me week fer changin'. How could yer ha' done it? I 'm a kinder perticerler dresser. I likes ter wash now and then - if it ain 't too often.
#DUKE.
Darlin', me friend Patch is thirsty. And a drop meself. Yer a precious ol' lady, and I loves yer.
#DARLIN'.
Yer spoils me, Duke.
#DUKE.
It 's foul tonight on the ocean. How the wind blows! It be spittin' up outside. The channel 's as riled as a wampire when yer scorns her. How she snorts!
#PATCH-EYE.
The devil hisself is hissin' through his teeth.
#DUKE.
There 'll be sailormen tonight what 's booked fer Davy Jones's locker. I 'm not kickin' much ter be ashore. I rots peaceful.
#DUKE.
Hi, there, for'ard! Batten yer hatch! Yer blowin' the gizzard out o' us.
#PATCH-EYE.
Poor Flint! He was took on jest such a night. Dropped inter the Port Light fer somethin' wet and warmin'. Jest ter kinder say goodby. Ship all fitted out. He 'd got three new sailormen - fine fellers as had been sentenced ter be hanged fer cuttin' purses, but had been let go, as they had reformed and wanted ter be honest pirates.
#DUKE.
I remembers the night, ol' sea - nymph. It was rainin' ter put out the fires o' hell - with the leetle devils stoakin' in the sinners. It 's sinners, Patch, as is used fer kindlers, ter keep the devils in a healthy sweat.
#PATCH-EYE.
He was ter sail when the tide ran out. Lord a Goody! How the tide runs down the Thames, as if it were homesick fer the ocean!
#DUKE.
But someone squealed.
#PATCH-EYE.
Squealers is worse 'n hissin' reptiles. They ketched Flint and they strung him to a gibbet. Poor ol' dear! I never touches me patch, but I thinks o' Flint.
#DUKE.
This here life is snug and easy. We has retired from practice, like store - keepers does who has made a fortin. Ain 't we settin' here in style and comfert, and jest waitin' fer the treasure ships ter come ter us? We gets the plums without chawin' at the dough. We blows out the lighthouse, and we sets our lantern so as ter fool 'em on the course, and when they smashes on the rocks, well - all we does is stuff our pokes with the treasure that washes up. I prays meself fer fog and dirty weather. Now I lay me, says I, and will yer send it thick and oozy?
#PATCH-EYE.
I ain 't disputin' yer. And we robs landlubbers once in a while.
#DUKE.
Now yer talkin', ol' sea - lion. I 'm tellin' yer it were a good haul we made last night on Castle Crag.
#PATCH-EYE.
Who 's disputin' yer?
#DUKE.
I 'm tellin' yer. Silver candles! And spoons! Never seen such a heap o' spoons.
#PATCH-EYE.
What 's anyone want more 'n one spoon fer? Yer cleans it every bite agin the tongue.
#DUKE.
Yer disgusts me, Patch. Yer ain 't no manners. Fer meself I spears me food tidy on me knife.
#DUKE.
There 's jest one leetle thing I does n't understand. I asks yer. What 's the meaning o' this here loot we took at Castle Crag? I asks yer. Ain 't we been by that castle a hundred times? The Earl, he don 't wear clothes like this. None o' the arstocky does, 'cept when they struts on Piccadilly. I asks yer, Patch. I asks yer who wears a thing like that.
#DARLIN'.
Yer looks like the Archbishop o' Canterbury.
#PATCH-EYE.
His Grice takin' the air - pluckin' posies.
#DUKE.
Lookin' like a silly jackass.
#PATCH-EYE.
Yer hurts me feelin's, Duke.
#DUKE.
I does n't like it, Patch. I does n't understand it. And what I does n't understand, I does n't like.
#PATCH-EYE.
What?
#DUKE.
Them gay clothes. Who owned 'em, I asks yer, afore we stole 'em.
#PATCH-EYE.
Darlin'! Me friend, the Duke, is thirsty. Yer had better mix another pot. Our cups is low. Yer does n't want ter be a foolish virgin and get ketched without no grog.
#DUKE.
With this bit o' slop what 's left I drinks to yer shinin' lamps - Wenus's flashin' gigs.
#DARLIN'.
I loves yer, Duke.
#DUKE.
What does yer make, ol' Cyclops, o' the new recruit?
#PATCH-EYE.
Red Joe?
#DUKE.
Him.
#PATCH-EYE.
He 's a right smart pirate, I says. I never seen a feller as could shoot so straight.
#DUKE.
I says so. But he 's a wee bit nobby - kinder stiff in the nose.
#PATCH-EYE.
Looks as if he knowed he was kinder good.
#DUKE.
It 's queer how he come ter us. Jest settin' on top his dory on the beach, when we found him. And what he said about his ship goin' down! Blast me ol' stump, but it were queer.
#PATCH-EYE.
Queer?
#DUKE.
Yer said it, Patch. Queerer than mermaids. Did we ever see a stick o' that ship? I 'm askin' yer, Patch.
#PATCH-EYE.
Ain 't I listenin'?
#DUKE.
Ain 't I tellin' yer? Nary a bit washed in. Did yer ever know a wreck 'long here where nothin' washed in - jest nothin'? I 'm askin' yer.
#PATCH-EYE.
You and me would starve if it happened regular.
#DUKE.
It 's what we lives by - pickin's on the beach.
#PATCH-EYE.
He 's a right smart pirate, 's Red Joe. The Captain - the most 'ticerler man I know - he took ter him at once. He 's a kinder good - lookin' feller.
#DARLIN'.
He ain 't got whiskers like the Duke.
#DUKE.
Queer that never a stick washed in.
#PATCH-EYE.
I 'm not denyin' yer, Duke. Where 's Red Joe now? It 's gettin' on. I 'll jest take a look fer him. It ain 't blowin' so hard. Ol' Borealis - I speaks poetical - ain 't strainin' at his waistcoat buttons like he was.
#DUKE.
Igerence! I pities yer. Borealis ain 't wind. He 's rainbows.
#DUKE.
It 's queer, I says. Nary a stick! Jest Red Joe on top his dory!
#DUKE.
I 'm the artist o' that there masterpiece. The Spittin' Devil! I done it on a rainy mornin'. Genius is queer.
#DARLIN'.
Duke, will yer have a nip o' grog? It eases yer pipes. Yer sounds as if yer had crumbs in yer gullet.
#DUKE.
It 's a lovely tune, and I wrote the words meself.
#DARLIN'.
Duke, does yer happen ter have a wife?
#DUKE.
Some tunes is hard, so I jest makes 'em up as I goes along.
#DARLIN'.
Has yer a wife? A wife as might turn up, I mean.
#DUKE.
Say it agin, Darlin'.
#DARLIN'.
Most sailors has wives o' course, strewed here and there from Bristol to Guinea - jest ter make all ports cozy. So 's yer goin' home ter a 'appy family, no matter where yer steers.
#DUKE.
It 's comfertable, Darlin' - I 'll not deny it - when yer heads ter harbor to see a winkin' candle in a winder on a hill, and know that a faithful wife and a couple o' leetle pirates is waitin' ter hug yer.
#DARLIN'.
I says so, Duke. I 've been a wife meself on and off, with husbands sailin' in and out - kissin' yer and 'oistin' sail. Roundabout, I says, makes 'appy marriages. Has yer a wife, Duke - livin', as yer can remember?
#DUKE.
Yer a bold, for'ard creature. Are yer proposin' ter me?
#DARLIN'.
I blush fer yer bad manners, Duke. I 'm a lady and I waits patient fer the 'appy question. I lets me beauty do the pleadin'. I was a flamin' roarer in me time. Lovers was nothin'. Dozens! There was a sea - captain once - Positive! Jest 'cause we tiffed. And a stage - coach driver! I had ter cool his passion with a rollin' pin. He brooded hisself inter drink. 'Appy days! Duke - askin' yer pardon - I was noticin' lately that you was castin' yer eyes on leetle Betsy.
#DUKE.
As washes the dishes?
#DARLIN'.
Her.
#DUKE.
Go 'long!
#DARLIN'.
And I thought yer might be drawn to her.
#DUKE.
Darlin', I 'm easy riled.
#DARLIN'.
Yer can have her, Duke, on one condition.
#DUKE.
She 's a pretty leetle girl.
#DARLIN'.
Yer must set me up in a pub in Bristol - with brass beer - pulls.
#DUKE.
I 'll not deny I 've given her a thought. Usual, wives is nuisances - naggin' at yer fer sixpences. But sometimes I does get lonesome on a wet night when there are nothin' ter do. I need someone ter hand me down me boots. Betsy 'd make a kinder cozy wife. Could yer learn her ter make grog?
#DARLIN'.
Aye.
#DUKE.
I might do worse. And roast pig that crackles?
#DARLIN'.
I could learn her.
#DUKE.
I might do worser. I 'd marry you, Darlin' -
#DARLIN'.
Dearie!
#DUKE.
But yer gettin' on. Patch might marry yer. He 's only got one eye.
#DARLIN'.
Patch!
#DUKE.
I 'll not deny I 've been considerin' leetle Betsy. I was thinkin' about it this mornin' as I was cleanin' me boot. Wives cleans boots. I 'm the sort o' sailorman she would be sure ter like.
#DARLIN'.
And what about the pub?
#DUKE.
Blast me stump, Darlin', I 'll not ferget yer.
#DARLIN'.
Does I get brass beer - pulls in the tap?
#DUKE.
Everythin' shiny.
#DARLIN'.
I 'm lovin' yer.
#DUKE.
Betsy would kinder jump at me. There 's somethin' tender about a young girl's first love - cooin' in yer arms.
#DARLIN'.
Easy, Duke!
#DUKE.
I alers was a fav'rite with the ladies. I think it 's me whiskers.
#DARLIN'.
'Vast there, Duke! There 's a shoal ahead. Red Joe 's a right smart feller.
#DUKE.
Red Joe?
#DARLIN'.
Him. He sets and watches her.
#DUKE.
What can she see in a young feller like that?
#DARLIN'.
Women 's queer folks. They 're wicious wampires. Jest yer watch 'em together. Red Joe 's snoopin' in on yer.
#DUKE.
Yer can blast me. He ain 't got whiskers.
#DARLIN'.
I 'm tellin' yer, Duke. If I was you I 'd tumble that Red Joe off a cliff. I 'm hintin' to yer, Duke. Off a cliff! It 's the pig. I clean fergot the pig. It 's burnin' on the fire. Off a cliff! I 'm hintin' to yer.
#DUKE.
Red Joe! Women 's queer - queerer than mermaids. A snooper! Jest a 'prentice pirate! No whiskers! Nothin'!
#DUKE.
Evenin', ol' sea - serpent! Where has you been?
#OLD JOE.
Up at the lighthouse. It 's as mirky as hell's back door.
#DUKE.
See Petey?
#OLD JOE.
I did. He was puttering with his light and meowing to his tabby cat.
#DUKE.
We 're a blessin' ter ol' Petey. I 'm bettin' me stump he 'd get lonesome up there 'cept fer us. There 's ol' Petey, starin' at the ocean. Yer ain 't never seen a light at that t' other winder, has yer Joe? We waits fer a merchantman which he knows has gold aboard. Then we jest tips a hint ter Petey, and he douses his light. Then we sets up our lantern - ol' Flint's lantern - outside on the rocks, jest where she shows at t' other winder. The ship sticks her nose agin the cliff. Smash!
#PATCH-EYE.
I dreamed o' gibbets!
#DUKE.
Yer is lucky, ol' keg o' rum, yer does n't dream o' purple rhinoceroses. Go back ter bed. Smash! I says. On comes Petey agin. And we jest as innercent as babies in a crib. It was me own idear. Brains, young feller. Jest yer wait, Joey, till yer sees a light at t' other winder.
#DUKE.
Darlin'! Darlin'!
#DUKE.
Where 's Betsy?
#DARLIN'.
She 's washin' dishes.
#DUKE.
I 'm wonderin' if she would lay off a bit from her jolly occerpation, and sing us a leetle song.
#DARLIN'.
Betsy! I wants yer.
#PATCH-EYE.
I never knowed yer cared fer music, Duke. Usually yer goes outside. Yer jest boohs.
#DUKE.
I does usual, Patch. Tonight 's perticerler. Red Joe ain 't never heard Betsy sing. Does yer like music, Joe?
#OLD JOE.
I like the roaring of the ocean. I like to hear the trees tossing in the wind.
#PATCH-EYE.
Wind ain 't music. Yer should hear Betsy. She 's got a leetle song that makes yer feel as good and peaceful as a whinin' parson.
#DARLIN'.
Betsy! Stop sloppin' with the dishes!
#DUKE.
Betsy, yer is welcome ter the parlor. We wants Red Joe ter hear yer sing. That leetle song o' yers.
#PATCH-EYE.
When I hears that song I feels as if I were rockin' babies in a crib - blessed leetle pirates, pullin' at their bottles, as will foller the sea some day.
#DUKE.
Yer ol' nose sounds as if it were tootin' fer a fog. Yer might be roundin' the Isle o' Dogs on a mirky night.
#DUKE.
Joe, you and me has got ter put ile in the lantern. Come on, ol' sweetheart. When yer sees this lantern blinkin' at that there winder, yer will know that willainy 's afoot.
#DUKE.
Yer said it, Darlin'. Yer said it. Red Joe 's castin' his eye on Betsy. Off a cliff! Tonight! Now! If I gets a chance. Off a cliff! Come on, Joey!
#PATCH-EYE.
Will yer wait a bit, Betsy - askin' yer pardon - while I talks to yer?
#BETSY.
Of course, Patch.
#PATCH-EYE.
I don 't suppose, dearie, I 'm the kind o' pirate as sets yer thinkin' of fiddles tunin' up, ner parsons. No, yer says. Ner cradles and leetle devils bitin' at their coral. And I don 't suppose yer has a kind o' hankerin' and yearnin'. Yer never sets and listens to me comin'. Course not, yer says. Betsy, if I talk out square you 'll not blab it all 'round the village, will yer? They would point their fingers at me, and giggle in their sleeves. I want ter tell yer somethin' o' a wery tender nater. There 's a leetle word as begins with L. L, I mean, not 'ell. I would n't want yer to think, Betsy, I 'm cussin'. 'Ell is cussin'. That leetle word is what 's ailing me. It 's love, Betsy. It 's me heart. Smashed all ter bits! Jesus, yer asks, what done it? It 's a pretty girl, I answers yer, as has smashed it. Does yer foller, Betsy? A pretty girl about your size, and with eyes the color o' yourn. What does yer say, Betsy? Yer says nothin'.
#BETSY.
I never meant to, Patch. I 'm sorry.
#PATCH-EYE.
Course you are. Jest as sorry as the careless feller as nudged Humpty Dumpty off the wall. But it did n't do no good. There he was, broke all ter flinders. And all the King's horses and all the King's men could n't fix him. Humpty Dumpty is me, Betsy. Regularly all split up, fore and aft, rib and keel. I mopes all day fer you, Betsy. And I mopes all night. Last night I did n't get ter sleep, jest fidgettin', till way past 'leven o' clock. And I woke agin at seven, askin' meself, if I loves you hopeless. Yer is a lump o' sugar, Betsy, as would sweeten ol' Patch's life. If we was married I 'd jest tag 'round behind yer and hand yer things. And now yer tells me there ain 't no hope at all.
#BETSY.
No hope at all, Patch.
#PATCH-EYE.
Yesterday I was countin' the potaters in the pot, sayin' ter meself. She loves me - She don 't love me. But the last potater did n't love me, Betsy. There was jest one too many potaters in the pot. No, yer says, yer could n't love me. Cause why? Cause Patch is a shabby pirate with only one eye.
#BETSY.
I am sorry, Patch.
#PATCH-EYE.
Blessed leetle fingers, as twines their selves all 'round me heart. Patch, yer says, yer sorry. There ain 't no hope at all. Yer nudges him off the wall, but yer can 't fix him. But I never heard that Humpty Dumpty did a lot o' squealin' when he bust. He took it like a pirate. And so does Patch. I does n't sulk. If yer will pardon me, Betsy, I 'll leave yer. Me feelin 's get lumpy in me throat. I 'll take a wink o' sleep in the loft.
#PATCH-EYE.
There was jest one too many potaters in the pot.
#OLD JOE.
I slipped the Duke in the dark. I came back to talk with you. How old are you, my dear?
#BETSY.
I don 't know.
#OLD JOE.
You don 't know? How long have you lived here?
#BETSY.
In this cabin? Three years.
#OLD JOE.
And where did you live before?
#BETSY.
In the village - in Clovelly.
#OLD JOE.
Did your parents live there?
#BETSY.
Y - e - s. I think so. I don 't know. Old Nancy, they called her - she brought me up. But she died three years ago.
#OLD JOE.
Who was old Nancy?
#BETSY.
She did washing for the sailormen.
#OLD JOE.
Was she good to you?
#BETSY.
Oh yes. I think - I do not know - that she was not my mother.
#OLD JOE.
And Darlin'?
#BETSY.
Yes. She has been good to me. And the others, too. I seem to remember someone else. How long have you been a pirate? pirate? Years, it seems, my dear. But I am more used to a soldier's oaths. I have trailed a pike in the Lowland wars. The roar of cannon, and siege and falling walls, are gayer tunes than any ocean tempest. What is this that you remember, Betsy?
#BETSY.
It is far off. Some one sang to me. It was not Nancy. When Nancy died, Darlin' took me and brought me up. That was three years ago. But last year the Captain and Duke and Patch - Eye came climbing up the rocks. They were sailormen, they said, who had lost a ship. And these cliffs with the sea pounding on the shore comforted them when they were lonely. So they stayed. And Darlin' and I cook for them.
#OLD JOE.
Do you remember who it was who sang to you?
#BETSY.
No.
#OLD JOE.
That song you just sang - where did you learn it?
#BETSY.
I have always known it. It makes me sad to sing it, for it sets me thinking - thinking of something that I have forgotten. Some days I climb high on the cliffs and I look upon the ocean. And I know that there is land beyond - where children play - but I see nothing but a rim of water. And sometimes the wind comes off the sea, and it brings me familiar far - off voices - voices I once knew - voices I once knew - fragments from a life I have forgotten. Why do you ask about my song?
#OLD JOE.
Because I heard it once myself.
#BETSY.
Where? Perhaps, if you will tell me, it will help me to remember.
#OLD JOE.
I heard the song once when I was a lad - when I was taken on a visit.
#BETSY.
Were your parents pirates?
#OLD JOE.
It was a long journey and all day we bumped upon the road, seeking an outlet from the tangled hills. Night overtook our weary horses and blew out the flaming candles in the west; and shadows were a blanket on the sleeping world. Toward midnight I was roused. We had come to the courtyard of a house - this house where I was taken on a visit.
#BETSY.
Was it like this, Joe - a cabin on a cliff?
#OLD JOE.
I remember how the moon peeped around the corner to see who came so late knocking on the door. I remember - I remember - Do you remember when you first came to live with Nancy?
#BETSY.
I dreamed once - you will think me silly - Are there great stone steps somewhere, wider than this room, with marble women standing motionless? And walls with dizzy towers upon them?
#OLD JOE.
Go on, Betsy.
#BETSY.
In Clovelly there are naught but cabins pitched upon a hill, and ladders to a loft. And, at the foot of the town, a mole, where boats put in. And I have listened to the songs of the fishermen as they wind their nets. And through the window of the tavern I have heard them singing at their rum. And sometimes I have been afraid. I have stuffed my ears and ran. But the ugly songs have followed me and scared me in the night. The shadows from the moon have reeled across the floor, like a tipsy sailor from the Harbor Light. Joe, are you really a man from the sea?
#OLD JOE.
Why, Betsy?
#BETSY.
The sea is never gentle. It never sleeps. I have stood listening at the window on breathless nights, but the ocean always slaps against the rocks. Even in a calm it moves and frets. Is it not said that the ghosts of evil men walk back and forth on the spot where their crimes are done? The ocean, perhaps, for its cruel wreckage, haunts these cliffs. It is doomed through all eternity with a lather of breaking waves to wash these rocks of blood. And the wind whistles to bury the cries of drowning men that plague the memory. Joe -
#OLD JOE.
Yes, my dear.
#BETSY.
You are the only one - Patch - Eye, Duke and the Captain - you are the only one who is always gentle. And I have wondered if you could really be a pirate.
#OLD JOE.
Me? Me? Gentle? The devil himself is my softer twin.
#BETSY.
Don 't! Don 't!
#OLD JOE.
What do you know of scuttled ships, and rascals ripped in fight? Of the last bubbles that grin upon the surface where a dozen men have drowned?
#BETSY.
Joe! For God's sake! Don 't!
#OLD JOE.
Is it gentleness to plunge a dagger in a man and watch for his dying eye to glaze?
#BETSY.
It is a lie. Tell me it is a lie!
#OLD JOE.
My dear.
#BETSY.
It is a lie.
#OLD JOE.
We 'll pretend it is a lie.
#BETSY.
How long, Joe, have you lived with us?
#OLD JOE.
Two weeks, Betsy.
#BETSY.
Two weeks? So short a time. From Monday to Monday and then around again to Monday. It is so brief a space that a flower would scarcely droop and wither. And yet the day you came seems already long ago. And all the days before are of a different life. It was another Betsy, not myself, who lived in this cabin on a Sunday before a Monday.
#OLD JOE.
It is so always, Betsy, when friends suddenly come to know each other. All other days sink to unreality like the memory of snow upon a day of August. We wonder how the flowering meadows were once a field of white. Our past selves, Betsy, walk apart from us and, although we know their trick of attitude and the fashion of their clothes, they are not ourselves. For friendship, when it grips the heart, rewinds the fibres of our being. Do you remember, dear, how you ran in fright when you first saw me clambering up these rocks?
#BETSY.
I was sent to call the Duke to dinner and carried a bell to ring it on the cliff. I was afraid when a stranger's head appeared upon the path.
#OLD JOE.
Yet, when I spoke, you stopped.
#BETSY.
At the first word I knew I need n't be afraid. And you took my hand to help me up the slope. You asked my name, and told me yours was Joe. Then we came together to this cabin. And each day I have been with you. Two weeks only.
#OLD JOE.
I shall be gone, Betsy, in a little while.
#BETSY.
Gone?
#OLD JOE.
I am not, my dear, the master of myself. We must forget these days together.
#BETSY.
Joe!
#OLD JOE.
May be I shall return. Fate is captain. The future shows so vaguely in the mist. Listen! It is the Duke.
#OLD JOE.
We must speak of these things together. Another time when there is no interruption.
#BETSY.
I shall be lonely when you go.
#CAPTAIN.
There 's news! There 's news, me men! I 've brought big news from the village.
#CAPTAIN.
By the bones of me ten fingers, it 's a blythe night fer our business. It 's wetter than a crocodile's nest. When I smells a fog, I feels good. I tastes it and is 'appy.
#PATCH-EYE.
What 's yer news, Captain?
#CAPTAIN.
News? Oh yes, the news. I 've jest hearn - I 've jest hearn - blast me rotten timbers! How can a man talk when he 's dry! A cup o' grog!
#CAPTAIN.
There 's big news, me hearties.
#DUKE.
What 's yer news, Captain? We asks yer.
#CAPTAIN.
I 'm tellin' yer. It 's sweatin' with curiosity that kills cats. Down in the village I learnt - I was jest takin' a drop o' rum at the Harbor Light. It 's not as sweet as Darlin's. They skimps their sugar. Yer wants ter keep droppin' it in as yer stirs it. I thinks they puts in too much water. Water 's not much good - 'cept fer washin'. And washin' 's not much good.
#DUKE.
Now then, Captain, hold hard on yer tiller agin wobblin', and get ter port.
#DARLIN'.
We 're hangin' on yer lips.
#CAPTAIN.
Yer need n't keep shovin' me. I kicks up when I 'm riled. They say down in the village -
#CAPTAIN.
There 's Petey -
#PATCH-EYE.
We 're jest fidgettin' fer the news.
#CAPTAIN.
The news? Oh, yes. Now yer hears it. A great merchantman has jest sailed from Bristol. The Royal 'Arry. It 's her. With gold fer the armies in France. She 's a brig o' five hundred ton. This night, when the tide runs out, she slips away from Bristol harbor. With this wind she should be off Clovelly by this time termorrer night.
#DARLIN'.
Glory ter God!
#DUKE.
And then Petey will douse his glim. And we 'll set up the ship's lantern.
#PATCH-EYE.
Smash!
#DUKE.
Then Petey will light hisself.
#PATCH-EYE.
And we 'll be jest as innercent as babies rockin' in a crib.
#DUKE.
And lay it on the helmsman fer bein' sleepy.
#CAPTAIN.
And I 've other news. Down in the village they say - fer a fishin' sloop brought the word - that his 'Ighness, the Prince o' Wales, left London a month ago.
#DUKE.
And him not givin' me word. I calls that shabby. He was me fag at Eton.
#PATCH-EYE.
Does yer think, Captain, he 'll spend a week - end with us, ridin' to the 'ounds, jest tellin' us the London gossip - how the pretty Duchesses is cuttin' up?
#DUKE.
I thought he was settin' in Whitehall, tryin' on crowns, so as ter get one that did n't scratch his ears.
#CAPTAIN.
They say he 's incarnito.
#PATCH-EYE.
What? Is it somethin' yer ketches like wollygogs in the stomich?
#DUKE.
Igerence. I 'm 'shamed o' yer, Patch. Ain 't yer been ter school? Ain 't yer done lessons on a slate? Ain 't yer been walloped so standin' 's been comfertabler. The Captain and me soils ourselves talkin' to yer. Incarnito is dressed up fancy, so as no one can know him.
#DARLIN'.
Like Cindereller at the party.
#DUKE.
If yer wants Patch ter understand yer, Captain, yer has got to use leetle words as is still pullin' at their bottles.
#DARLIN'.
When words grow big and has got beards they jest don 't say nothin' to Patch.
#CAPTAIN.
This here Prince o' Wales is journeyin' down Plymouth way.
#DUKE.
What 's that ter us? I 'm askin' yer. His 'Ighness cut me when I passed him in Piccadilly. The bloomin' swab! I pulled me hat, standin' in the gutter, but he jest seemed ter smell somethin'.
#PATCH-EYE.
It were n't roses, I 'm tellin' yer.
#CAPTAIN.
Silence! They say he has sworn an oath to break up the pirate business on the coast.
#PATCH-EYE.
And let us starve? It 's unfeelin'.
#DUKE.
No pickin's on the beach?
#OLD JOE.
I 'd like to catch him. I 'd slit his wizen.
#DARLIN'.
I 'd put pizen in the pig I feeds him.
#DUKE.
I 'd nudge him off the cliff - jest like he were a sneakin' snooper.
#CAPTAIN.
Well, there 's yer news! I 'm dry. Darlin'! Some grog!
#CAPTAIN.
Here 's to the Royal 'Arry!
#DUKE.
And may the helmsman be wery sleepy!
#DARLIN'.
And we as innercent as leetle pirates suckin' at their bottles!
#ALL.
The Royal 'Arry!
#MEG.
I tells fortins, gentlemen. Would n't any o' yer like ter see the future? I sees what 's comin' in this here magic glass. I tells yer when ter set yer nets - and of rising storms. Has any o' yer a kind o' hankerin' fer matrimony? I can tell yer if the lady be light or dark. It will cost yer only a sixpence.
#CAPTAIN.
Yer insults me. Fer better and fer worse is usual fer worse. Does yer think yer can anchor an ol' sea - dog like me to a kennel as is made fer landlubbery lap dogs? I 've deserted three wives. And that 's enough. More 's a hog.
#DARLIN'.
Husbands is nuisances, as I was tellin' the sea - captain, jest afore he cut his throat.
#DUKE.
Thank ye, ol' lady, I does n't need yer. When the ol' Duke is willin', he knows a leetle dear as will come flutterin' to his arms.
#PATCH-EYE.
What can yer do fer an ol' sailorman like me? I 'd like someone with curlin' locks, as can mix grog as good as Darlin's. And I likes roast pig - crackly, as Darlin' cooks it. I has a leetle girl in mind, but she 's kinder holdin' off. What does yer see, dearie? Does yer hear any fiddles tunin' fer the nupshals? Is there a pretty lady waitin' fer a kiss?
#MEG.
I sees the ocean. And a ship. I sees inside the cabin o' that ship.
#PATCH-EYE.
Does yer see me as the captain o' that ship? Jest settin' easy, bawlin' orders - jest feedin' on plum duff.
#MEG.
I sees yer in irons.
#PATCH-EYE.
Mother o' goodness! Now yer done it!
#MEG.
I sees Wappin' wharf. I sees a gibbet. I sees -
#PATCH-EYE.
Horrers!
#MEG.
I sees you swingin' on that gibbet - stretchin' with yer toes - swingin' in the wind.
#PATCH-EYE.
Yer makes me grog sour on me.
#MEG.
I sees misfortin fer everyone here - 'cept one - tragedy, the gibbet. Go not upon the sea until the moon has turned. Ha! Leetle glass, has yer more to show? Has yer any comfort? The light fades out. It is dark.
#DUKE.
Ain 't yer givin' us more 'n a sixpence worth o' misery? Yer gloom is sloppin' over the brim.
#MEG.
Ah! Here 's light agin at last. There 's a red streak across the dial. It drips! It 's blood!
#CAPTAIN.
Ain 't yer got any pretty picters in that glass?
#PATCH-EYE.
Graveyards are cheerfuller 'n gibbets.
#MEG.
Peace! I sees a man in a velvet cloak. It 's him that swings yer to a gibbet. It 's him that strangles yer till yer eyes is poppin'. That man avoid like a pizened snake.
#CAPTAIN.
Avoid? By the rotten bones o' Flint, if I meets that man in a velvet cloak I hooks out his eye.
#DUKE.
Captain, yer sweats yerself unnecessary. Here 's Red Joe, ol' dear. Joe 's a spry young feller. He looks as if he might be hankerin' fer a wife. Hey, Darlin'?
#DARLIN'.
He 's the kind as wampires makes their wictims.
#MEG.
I sees a tall buildin' with gold spires. I hears a shout o' joy and I hears stately music, like what yer hears in Bartolmy Fair arter the Lord Mayor has made his speech. I sees a man in a silk cloak. He swaggers to the music. I sees - I sees -
#MEG.
I sees - I sees - nothin'! The glass is blank!
#CAPTAIN.
Nothin'? Jest nothin' at all?
#PATCH-EYE.
Ain 't there no blood drippin'?
#DARLIN'.
Ner gibbets?
#CAPTAIN.
Ner sailormen swingin' in the wind?
#MEG.
I sees danger fer yer, Joe. Who can tell whether it be death? 'T is beyond my magic. But beware a knife! Go not near the cliff! You will see me agin. And in your hour o' danger. When yer least expects it.
#PATCH-EYE.
Nice cheerful ol' lady, I says.
#CAPTAIN.
Yer can pipe the devil up, but she give me shivers.
#OLD JOE.
For just a minute I thought some old lady had died and left me her money box.
#PATCH-EYE.
Yer can dim me gig that 's left, I 'm clean upset.
#CAPTAIN.
I ain 't been so down in the boots since the blessed angels took Flint ter 'ell.
#DUKE.
Captain, you and Patch is melancholier 'n funerals. Weepin' widders is jollier. Will yer let a hanted, thirsty, grog - eyed grand - daughter o' a blinkin' sea - serpent upset yer 'appy dispersitions? Stiffen yerself! Keep yer nose up, Captain! We has sea enough. We 're not thumpin' on the rocks.
#CAPTAIN.
Yer said it, Duke. I sulks unnecessary. There 's ol' Petey shinin' up there. Termorrer night, if the wind holds, we 'll see his starin' eye go out, and our lantern shinin' at t' other winder. The crossbones as hung on the masthead o' the Spittin' Devil. Ol' Flint's wery flag. Him as they hanged on a gibbet on Wappin' wharf. It was a mirky night like this, with 'prentices gawpin' in the lanterns and Jack Ketch unsnarlin' his cursed ropes. I spits blood ter think o' it.
#DUKE.
I 'll die easy when I 've revenged his death and the ol' clock is tickin' peaceful and Flint sleepin' 'appy in his rotten coffin. drink all 'round. We 'll drink the health o' this here flag. You 'll drink with us, Darlin'.
#DARLIN'.
Yer spoils me, Captain.
#CAPTAIN.
And now we 'll drink confusion to the swab that 's settin' on the English throne.
#DUKE.
Here 's to ol' Flint!
#ALL.
Here 's to ol' Flint!
#OLD JOE.
My memory fumbles in the past. I, too, hear familiar voices - lost for many years. A dark curtain lifts and in the past I see myself a child. There are strange tunes in the wind tonight. Methinks they sing the name of Margaret.
#DUKE.
Betsy! Betsy!
#DUKE.
Would yer like ter be the Duchess?
#DUKE.
I 'm askin' yer, Betsy. Yer ol' Duke is askin' yer. I 'm lovin' yer. Yer ol' Duke is lovin' yer. I 'll do the right thing by yer. I 'll marry yer. There! I 've said it. When yer married yer can jest set on a cushion without nothin' ter do - nothin' 'cept cookin' and washin' and darnin'. Does yer jump at me, Betsy?
#DUKE.
Ain 't yer a kind o' hankerin' fer me? Come ter me arms, sweetie, and confess yer blushin' love. I 'm askin' yer. I 'm askin' yer ter be the Duchess.
#BETSY.
But I do not love you, Duke.
#DUKE.
Make yerself comfertable. Yer husband 's willin'. When I cramps, I shifts yer. Kiss me, when yer wants.
#BETSY.
You are an old goose.
#DUKE.
Did I hear yer? Does yer hold off fer me ter nag yer? The ol' Duke 's waitin' ter fold yer in his lovin' arms.
#BETSY.
I do not love you, Duke.
#DUKE.
I 'm blowed. I 'm a better man than Patch. I 'm tellin' yer. Is it me stump, Betsy? I has n't a hook hand like the Captain. Yer has got ter be linked all 'round. There 's no fun, I says, in bein' hugged by a one - armed man. Yer would be lop - sided in a week.
#BETSY.
It 's just that I do not love you, Duke.
#DUKE.
Yer wounds me feelin's. Does n't I ask yer pretty? Should I have waited fer a moon and took yer walkin'? And perched with yer on the rocks, with the ol' moon winkin' at yer, shovin' yer on? The Duke 's never been refused before. A number o' wery perticerler ladies, arter breakfast even, has jest come scamperin'. 'T ain 't Patch, is it Betsy? A pretty leetle girl would n't love a feller as has one eye. It ain 't the Captain. He ain 't no hand with the ladies. Yer not goin' ter tell me it 's Petey? I would n't want yer ter fall in love with a blinkin' light.
#BETSY.
You have lovely whiskers, Duke.
#DUKE.
Yer can pull one fer the locket that yer wears. Are yer makin' fun o' me?
#BETSY.
I would n't dare.
#DUKE.
Does yer mean it, Betsy? Are yer relentin'? Are yer goin' ter say the 'appy word as splices us from keel to topsail? Yer ain 't jest a cruel syren are yer, wavin' me on, hopin' I 'll smash meself? Are yer winkin' at me like ol' Flint's lantern - me thinkin' it 's love I see, shinin' in yer laughin' eyes?
#BETSY.
Why don 't you marry Darlin'?
#DUKE.
Her with one tooth? Yer silly. I boohs at yer. Ol' ladies with one hoof inside a coffin does n't make good brides. Yer wants someone kinder gay and spry, as yer can pin flowers to.
#BETSY.
She loves you, Duke.
#DUKE.
Course she does. So does the ol' lady as keeps the tap at the Harbor Light, and one - eyed Pol as mops up the liquor that is spilt. And youngsters, too. A pretty leetle dear - jest a cozy armful - was winkin' at me yesterday - kinder givin' me the snuggle - up. I pities 'em. It 's their nater, God 'elp 'em, ter love me; but the ol' Duke is perticerler. Yer has lovely eyes, Betsy - blessed leetle mirrors where I sees Cupid playin'. They shines like the lights o' a friendly harbor.
#BETSY.
Darlin' cooks roast pig that crackles.
#DUKE.
I sets me heart on top me stomich. Ain 't yer comfertable, settin' on me knee? Shall I shift yer to me stump? Betsy, I calls arter we are married, fetch me down me slipper and lay it on the hearth ter warm. Yer husband 's home. And I tosses yer me boot, all mud fer cleanin'. And then yer passes the grog. And arter about the second cup I limbers up and kisses yer. And then yer sets upon me knee. It will be snug on winter evenin's when the blast is blowin'. And when we 're married yer can kiss me pretty near as often as yer please. And I won 't deny as I won 't like it. The ol' Duke ain 't slingin' the permission 'round general. Darlin' nags me. What yer laughin' at?
#BETSY.
You silly old man!
#DUKE.
Yer riles me. Once and fer all, will yer marry me? I 'll not waste the night argyin' with yer. I 'm not goin' ter tease yer. I 've only one knee and it ain 't no bench fer gigglin' girls as pokes fun at their betters. I 'll jolt yer till yer teeth rattles. Is it someone else? Has yer a priory 'tachment? Red Joe? Is it Red Joe, Betsy? Is he snoopin' 'round?
#DUKE.
There 's somethin' about that young feller I does n't like. He 's a snooper. Betsy, does yer get what I 'm talkin' about? I have offered ter make yer the Duchess. I 'll buy - I 'll steal yer a set o' red beads. I 'll give yer a sixpence - without no naggin' - every time yer goes ter town, jest ter spend reckless. I 'll marry yer. I 'll take yer ter Minehead and get the piousest parson in the town. Would yer like Darlin' fer a bridesmaid - and grog and angel - cake? Me jest settin' ready ter kiss yer every time yer passes it. I 'm blowed! You are wickeder than ol' Flint's lantern. It must be Red Joe. Him with the smirk! There 's a young feller 'round here, Betsy, as wants ter look out fer his wizen.
#DUKE.
I does n't understand 'em. I 'm thinkin' the girl 's a fool. A ninny I calls her. It 's Red Joe. Off a cliff! Yer said it, Darlin'. Off a cliff!
#DUKE.
Yer a spiteful bird. Yer as mean as women. Ninnies I calls 'em. It must ha' been the moon. I should ha' waited fer a moon.
#PATCH-EYE.
Darlin' loves yer, Duke.
#CAPTAIN.
Course she does. They all does. Youngsters, too - winkin' and givin' me the snuggle - up.
#PATCH-EYE.
Yer has lovely whiskers, Duke.
#CAPTAIN.
Yer can pull one, Betsy, fer the locket that yer wears.
#CAPTAIN.
There! I done yer. Yer a child at cards, Patch. How ain 't it that yer never learnt? Did n't yer ever play black - ace at the Rusty Anchor down Greenwich way? Crack me hook, I 've played with ol' Flint hisself, settin' in the leetle back room. With somethin' wet and warmin' now and then, jest ter keep the stomich cozy. Never stopped till Phoebus's fiery eye looked in the winder.
#PATCH-EYE.
Poor ol' Flint! I never sees his clock up there but I drops a tear.
#CAPTAIN.
Yer cries as easy as a crocodile. And yer as innercent at cards as - as a baby bitin' at his coral, a cooin' leetle pirate.
#PATCH-EYE.
It 's frettin' does it, Captain.
#CAPTAIN.
What 's frettin' yer?
#PATCH-EYE.
It 's what the ol' lady said last night. She hung me ter a gibbet, jest like ol' Flint. There 's a gibbet, Captain, on Wappin' wharf, jest 'round the corner from the Sailors' Rest. Does yer remember it, Captain? It makes yer grog belch on yer.
#CAPTAIN.
Aye. There was two sailormen hangin' there when I comes in a year ago.
#PATCH-EYE.
Horrers!
#CAPTAIN.
Jest swingin' in the wind, and tryin' ter get their toes down comfertable. Jest reachin' with their footies ter ease theirselves.
#PATCH-EYE.
The ol' lady last night made me a wee bit creepy. Gibbets and Wappin' wharf ain 't nothin' ter talk about.
#CAPTAIN.
I never see a flock o' crows but I asks their pardon fer keepin' 'em waitin' fer their supper. Crows, Patch, is fond o' yer as yer are, without neither sauce ner gravy - jest pickin' 'appy, soup ter nuts, at yer dry ol' bones. Here 's ol' Patch, they says, waitin' in the platter fer his 'ungry guests ter come.
#PATCH-EYE.
Me stomich 's turned keel up.
#CAPTAIN.
Patch, yer ain 't got spunk ter be a pirate. Yer as soft as Petey's pussycat.
#PATCH-EYE.
I ain 't, ain 't I? Was n't it me as nudged the Captain o' the Northern Star off his poop - when he were n't lookin'? Him with a pistol in his boot! Did n't I hit Bill, the bos'n, with a marline - spike - jest afore he woke up? Sweet dreams, I says, and I tapped him gentle. I got a lot o' spunk. Bill did n't wake up, he did n't. Was n't it me, Captain, that started that mutiny? Was n't it me? I 'm askin' yer.
#CAPTAIN.
Still braggin' o' that ol' time. It was more 'n four years ago. What yer done since? Jest loadin' yer stomich - jest gruntin' and wallerin' in the trough - jest braggin'.
#PATCH-EYE.
I ain 't 'fraid o' nothin' - 'cept a gibbet. But the ol' lady kinder got me. Yer looked down yer nose yerself, Captain - askin' yer pardon.
#CAPTAIN.
Struck me, Patch, she was jest a wee bit flustered by Red Joe. Did yer notice how she sat and looked at the glass? And would n't say nothin'? Jest nothin' at all.
#PATCH-EYE.
And then the ol' dear's fingers slipped and the glass was broke.
#CAPTAIN.
It looks almost as if she done it a purpose.
#DUKE.
Course she done it a purpose. It was ter stop me lookin' 'cross her shoulder in the glass.
#CAPTAIN.
What does yer think she saw?
#PATCH-EYE.
Was it blood drippin'?
#DUKE.
I 'll tell yer. I 'll tell yer.
#CAPTAIN.
Well, ain 't we listenin', Duke?
#PATCH-EYE.
Jest strainin' our ears.
#DUKE.
I 'll tell yer. I squinted in the glass, meself, arter it was broke. and PATCH. What did yer see?
#DUKE.
Nothin'! Jest nothin'!
#CAPTAIN.
The Duke, he jest seen nothin'.
#PATCH-EYE.
Jest nothin' at all.
#DUKE.
That 's what gets me. If the ol' lady 'd seen nothin', she would n't took ter fidgettin'. And therefore she seen somethin'. Does yer foller? You, Captain? I 'spects nothin' from Patch.
#PATCH-EYE.
Yer hurts me feelin's, Duke.
#DUKE.
Somethin' 's wrong. Somethin' 's wrong with Red Joe.
#PATCH-EYE.
Red Joe 's a right smart feller, I says.
#CAPTAIN.
He can shoot as straight as ol' Flint. Barin' meself, Joe 's as straight a shot as I 've seen in many a year. Patch, agin him, is jest a crooked stick.
#PATCH-EYE.
Pick on the Duke jest once, why does n't yer?
#DUKE.
Ease off, mates! Red Joe ain 't goin' ter hang on no gibbet. 'Cause why? 'Cause I 'm tellin' yer. I 'll tell yer what the ol' lady seen in the glass.
#CAPTAIN.
We 're listenin', Duke.
#PATCH-EYE.
Like kittens at a mouse - hole.
#DUKE.
Captain, it 's deuced strange that Red Joe's ship - nary a stick o' her - never come ter shore. Does yer remember a wreck 'long here where nothin' washed ter shore?
#CAPTAIN.
Yer right, Duke. I never did.
#DUKE.
Does you remember one, stoopid?
#PATCH-EYE.
I does n't remember one this minute, Duke.
#DUKE.
Ol' Flint, he had a pigtail, did n't he? And you 've a pigtail, Captain, has n't yer? And Patch - Eye, he 's got what he calls a pigtail.
#CAPTAIN.
Spinach, I calls it.
#DUKE.
And ol' Pew, he 'd got a pigtail, ain 't he? And every blessed man as sailed with him. I 'm tellin' yer, Captain.
#PATCH-EYE.
The sea - cook, he did n't have one.
#DUKE.
Sea - cooks ain 't sailormen. They 're swabs. Jest indoor swabs. Did yer ever see a pirate snipped all 'round like a landlubber, with nary a whisp behind?
#CAPTAIN.
Yer can rot me keel, Duke, I never did.
#PATCH-EYE.
I agrees with the Captain.
#DUKE.
Red Joe, he ain 't got a pigtail.
#CAPTAIN.
No more he ain 't.
#PATCH-EYE.
Was n't it Noah, Captain; as got his pigtail cut by some designin' woman? Does yer think Red Joe 's gone and met a schemin' wixen?
#CAPTAIN.
I scorns yer igerence. Yer thinks o' Jonah.
#DUKE.
Well? Well? I 've told yer Red Joe ain 't got a pigtail. Does n't yer smell anythin'?
#CAPTAIN.
I can 't say as I sniffs nothin' - leastways, nothin' perticerler. I smells a bit o' grog, perhaps.
#PATCH-EYE.
I gets a whiff o' garlic from the kitchen.
#DUKE.
The two o' yer never can smell nothin' when there 's garlic or grog around. I 'm askin' yer pardon, Captain. Does Red Joe talk like a pirate? Sink me, he can 't rip an oath. Did yer ever know a pirate which could n't talk fluent?
#CAPTAIN.
What 's bitin' yer, Duke?
#DUKE.
Ain 't I tellin' yer?
#CAPTAIN.
Ain 't we listenin'?
#PATCH-EYE.
Jest hangin' on yer tongue?
#DUKE.
Captain, you and me and Patch has seen a heap o' sights. We knows the ocean. We knows her when she 's blue and when she 's kickin' 'igher than a gallow's tree.
#CAPTAIN.
We has been ter Virginy.
#PATCH-EYE.
We has traded slaves at the Barbadoes.
#DUKE.
And does n't we set around o' nights and swap the sights we seen - mermaids and sea - serpents and such? Did yer jest once ever hear Red Joe tell what he 's seen? Yer can sink me stern up with all lights burnin', if I think the feller 's ever been beyond the Isle o' Dogs.
#CAPTAIN.
What 's bitin' yer, Duke?
#DUKE.
It 's jest this. Red Joe ain 't no pirate. He 's a landlubber.
#CAPTAIN.
I seem ter get what Duke means. He 's hintin', Patch, that Red Joe ain 't a pirate.
#PATCH-EYE.
If he ain 't a pirate, what is he? I asks yer that.
#DUKE.
He 's a bloomin' spy. spy!
#PATCH-EYE.
If I thought he was a spy, I 'd ketch him right here with me dirk. I hates spies worse 'n empty bottles.
#CAPTAIN.
I 'd scrape him with me hook.
#DUKE.
I 've been thinkin', Captain, while you and Patch has been amusin' yerselves. Askin' yer pardon, Captain, but cards rots the mind. Did yer ever know a pirate that ain 't drunk at the Port Light on Wappin' wharf?
#CAPTAIN.
Not as yet I never did. I never knowed a pirate as did n't have a double - barreled nose fer grog.
#DUKE.
Well, when Red Joe comes in, we 'll jest ask him. And we 'll ask him if he ever played black - ace at the Rusty Anchor.
#CAPTAIN.
It ain 't no night ter have spies about. With the Royal 'Arry comin' on so pretty.
#PATCH-EYE.
And jest gettin' ready ter smash hisself.
#DUKE.
That innercent ship will be due in less 'n half an hour.
#CAPTAIN.
If Red Joe is a spy, by the fiery beard o' Satan, I 'm tellin' yer that dead men tell no tales.
#DUKE.
Askin' yer pardon, Captain, bein' as it was me as smelled him out, won 't yer let me slit his wizen? I does it pretty, without mussin' up the cabin. I ain 't askin' favors often, Captain. And I 've 'ticerler reasons - reasons as touches me heart. Reasons as touches me heart! Red Joe 's been snoopin'.
#CAPTAIN.
I loves yer, Duke. There ain 't much as I won 't let yer have. And jest ter show yer that I 'm all cut up by this here snoopin', when I 'm dead I 'll will yer this ol' hook o' mine, as has scraped a hundred men.
#DUKE.
Yer honors me, Captain. And if I is shoveled in first, me stump is yourn.
#CAPTAIN.
It 's handsome of yer, Duke. And I 'll not be jolly till a year is up - jest like a widder.
#DUKE.
Yer touches me. I 'll tie a black ribbon on yer hook.
#OLD JOE.
Hello, mates! Evening, Captain! Are n't you cozy! As peaceful as old ladies with their darning. I 've just come from seeing Petey, up at the lighthouse. Petey says that along in about fifteen minutes the Royal Harry will be showing around the cliff. Is n't it time, Captain, to set up the lantern where 's she 's useful?
#DUKE.
Is n't it? Did yer hear that, Captain? Ain 't it, is what Red Joe means.
#CAPTAIN.
Right yer are, Joey. We must be trottin'.
#DUKE.
What 's the name o' that tavern, Joe, at Wappin' wharf where we gets the uncommon grog?
#OLD JOE.
Wappin' wharf? I 'm blessed if the name 's not gone from me. The grog 's nothing to Darling's.
#DUKE.
What does yer call the tavern on the Isle o' Dogs?
#OLD JOE.
I 'm remembering the rum. What 's the use of looking at the signboard?
#DUKE.
How does yer sight ter turn the bar at Guinea?
#OLD JOE.
Sorry, Duke. It was my watch below. I was snoring when we turned.
#CAPTAIN.
What happened to yer pigtail?
#PATCH-EYE.
Where does we ship the niggers?
#DARLIN'.
Ain 't yer got a mermaid on yer chest?
#OLD JOE.
Who offers me his carcass first? What! Is pirate blood so thin and white?
#PATCH-EYE.
It 's me patch, Captain. It 's fetched loose. I follers yer.
#OLD JOE.
Come, Duke, and take your answer! Have you no stomach for my message? 'Fore God, is there no black ram to lead his sheep to the shearing?
#PATCH-EYE.
Scrape him with yer hook, Captain, I follers yer.
#OLD JOE.
My knife frets. It is thirsty for thick red wine. Who offers me his cask to tap? I 'll pledge the King, although it is a dirty vintage. Come, Captain, I 'll carve you to a dainty morsel. We 'll have fresh meat for the platter. You 'll not be known from scared rabbit - flesh.
#OLD JOE.
You bearded hound!
#PATCH-EYE.
He 's tauntin' yer, Captain. Hand him the hook! The Duke and me is back o' yer.
#OLD JOE.
Do you fear to cheat the gibbet on Wapping wharf? A knife 's a sweeter end. Who comes first? I 'll help him across the Styx. Or sink or swim! Flint waits in hell for three whelps to join his crew.
#PATCH-EYE.
Captain, I 'm 'sprized at yer good nater. Scrape him one!
#OLD JOE.
Who comes to the barber first? Cowards! I 'll ram your pigtails down your throats. I 'll wash your dirt in blood. - turned his excited somersault down the carpet.)
#PATCH-EYE.
Did yer notice, Captain, how I took him by the throat? He was squirmin' loose when I grabbed him. It was me tripped him.
#DUKE.
Captain, I asks yer a favor. Can I stick him now. Dead men tell no tales.
#PATCH-EYE.
Captain, yer jest makes a pet o' the Duke. Ain 't it my turn? I gets rusty.
#DARLIN'.
Let the Duke do it. He has more reasons than Patch.
#CAPTAIN.
Lay off, me hearties! Does n't yer know we 're in a hurry? Red Joe 's kickin' up has wasted a heap o' time. The Royal 'Arry will be showin' 'round the cliff any minute now. Red Joe 's safe. He 's tied up double. We 'll have a merry party arterward - with grog and angel cake. It 's business afore pleasure. Here, Duke, take the lantern. It 's full o' ile. Jest stir yer timber stump, Duke. Yer can foller, Patch. Yer follers better 'n yer leads. Some folks is pussycats.
#DUKE.
He 's pokin' fun at yer, ol' lionheart.
#PATCH-EYE.
Yer hurts me feelin's.
#DUKE.
I 'll hurt yer in a fatter place - where yer sits - if yer does n't step along. Yer a yeller - livered, maggoty land fish. I curbs me tongue. I scorns yer worse 'n cow's milk. Go 'long, afore I loosens up and tells yer what yer are!
#CAPTAIN.
In about two minutes that blessed eye o' Petey will go out. We must set up the lantern afore the Royal 'Arry sticks her nose in sight.
#DUKE.
By by, Joey. See yer later, ol' angel cake. Yer has jest time ter say "Now I lay me."
#CAPTAIN.
How 's the night, Duke?
#DUKE.
Blacker than the Earl o' Hell's top - boots.
#DARLIN'.
I 'll jest stick me apron on me head and go 'long, too. It ain 't proper fer a lady as has me temptin' beauty ter be left alone with snoopers.
#BETSY.
God help the poor sailormen!
#OLD JOE.
Betsy! Betsy! For the love of God!
#BETSY.
The ship 's in sight. I see her lights. She has rounded the farther cliff. I see her turning. She heads in from the sea. Her three masts are in line. She steers for the lantern. God have mercy! She 'll strike in another minute. I can 't bear to listen. I can 't bear to look.
#OLD JOE.
Betsy! Betsy! Do you hear? Margaret! Margaret!
#OLD JOE.
Quick! Margaret! Margaret! That knife! That knife on the stones! Margaret, cut me loose!
#BETSY.
You 've hit it! Thank God! The light is shattered. I seem to remember now. My name is Margaret. I remember -
#OLD JOE.
What do you remember? great staircase - a room, with shadows from a candle. And when I was afraid, a lady sang to me. And she set the candle so that the fearful giant upon the wall ran off, and I was safe.
#OLD JOE.
What else do you remember?
#BETSY.
I remember -
#OLD JOE.
Margaret, do you remember me?
#BETSY.
Yes, I remember you. Were you not a great tall lad whose crook'd elbow was level with my head? And once we climbed a tower - or do I recall a dream? You held me so that I might see the waves breaking on the rocks below. Then with level eyes we looked upon the sea, and cried out our discovery of each glistening sail. Are these things real? One morning you mounted horse, and I was held aloft so that you might stoop and kiss me. You rode off with a clatter on the stones. You turned and waved your hat. And now you have come back. You are Hal. We were playmates once.
#OLD JOE.
And by luck and God's help we shall be playmates once again.
#BETSY.
Quick, Hal! You must escape. Quick! Before the pirates come. Follow the path to the village! You can escape by the Royal Harry.
#CAPTAIN.
Blast me, the lantern 's out!
#PATCH-EYE.
Rot me, but there were an explosion!
#DARLIN'.
Poof! And there were n't no lantern!
#DUKE.
What done it? What done it? I asks yer.
#DUKE.
She is still headed on. Her nose is still pointin' toward the cliff.
#CAPTAIN.
What 's that?
#DUKE.
I hears the rattlin' o' chains. She 's droppin' anchor. She has sniffed the willainy. Her anchor 's down. She 's saved hisself. Blow me, she 's saved hisself.
#CAPTAIN.
Yer can hang me ter a gibbet.
#PATCH-EYE.
Yer can rot me bones.
#DARLIN'.
Me heart 's gone palpy.
#DUKE.
What done it? What done it? I asks yer.
#DUKE.
What done it? What done it? I asks yer.
#PATCH-EYE.
Jest when everythin' was goin' pretty.
#CAPTAIN.
Jest when she was about ter hit.
#DARLIN'.
Me heart near stopped - I was that excited.
#DUKE.
The mystery o' this business is how the blinkin' lantern went out.
#CAPTAIN.
Ol' Petey done his part.
#PATCH-EYE.
He doused herself in time.
#CAPTAIN.
It was the lantern done it.
#DUKE.
When there were n't no light at all, the Royal 'Arry, she jest sniffed willainy and dropped anchor.
#PATCH-EYE.
I was repeatin' Smash yer devil! Smash yer devil! - kinder hurryin' her on.
#DARLIN'.
I was sayin' Now I lay me - throbbin' with excitement.
#DUKE.
It was n't ile. I put ile in the lantern meself. Captain, yer seen me put in ile.
#CAPTAIN.
I seen yer. And I swished it meself ter be sure.
#PATCH-EYE.
Nothin 's been right since that ol' lady hanged me ter a gibbet.
#CAPTAIN.
There we was watchin' -
#PATCH-EYE.
Pop!
#CAPTAIN.
And all of a sudden - quicker 'n seven devils - the bloomin' lantern went all ter pieces. It 's grog, I says. Snakes is next. It were a comfert to the ol' Captain ter know that all o' yer seen it. I seen a yeller rhinoceros once, runnin' along with purple mice - all alone I seen it - and it kinder sickened me o' rum.
#PATCH-EYE.
Does yer think the lantern exploded?
#DUKE.
Did yer ever hear o' a ship's lantern explodin'? I asks yer, Captain.
#CAPTAIN.
Yer talks silly, Patch. That lantern has hung fer twenty year on ol' Flint's ship - swingin' easy and contented all 'round the Horn - and it ain 't never exploded once.
#DUKE.
Swabs' lanterns explode, stoopid. Ships' lanterns don 't. Captain, I feels as mournful as when Flint's clock did n't tick no more and we knowed he was took by the blessed angels.
#CAPTAIN.
I ain 't meself as gay as a cuckoo - not quite I ain 't.
#PATCH-EYE.
Ever since that ol' lady -
#DUKE.
Lay off on that ol' lady!
#DUKE.
Captain! Captain! Quick! Tie him up!
#DUKE.
It 's him that done it. It 's Red Joe.
#CAPTAIN.
How did he get loose?
#DUKE.
Does yer see that knife? Does yer see Joe? I 'm tellin' yer. It was him shot out the lantern.
#PATCH-EYE.
Did n't I help ter tie him meself?
#DUKE.
Askin' yer pardon, Captain, but you and Patch has the brains o' a baby aligator. A stuffed rhinocopoterus is pos' - lutely nothin'. Askin' yer pardon fer speakin' so plain. I does all yer thinkin' for yer. There 's some folks settin' here as are fat - headed, and thinks ships' lanterns explode.
#PATCH-EYE.
Easy now, ol' dear. Yer alers pitchin' inter me, 'cause I 'm good - natered.
#CAPTAIN.
Red Joe, I calls yer a dirty spy. A swab! A landlubber! Fer one copper farthin' I 'd ketch yer one with this hook.
#DUKE.
It was me discovered him. I asks yer, Captain, ter leave Red Joe ter me. I hates him most perticerler.
#BETSY.
Did you call, Captain?
#DARLIN'.
Nobody ain 't callin' yer, dearie. Now jest toddle back to the kitchen.
#DUKE.
This ain 't no place fer a leetle girl. It will give yer bad dreams. Mince pie 's nothin'.
#DUKE.
Where you goin', Betsy?
#BETSY.
I 've an errand in the village.
#DUKE.
Well, yer ain 't goin'. It ain 't no night fer a leetle girl ter be out. I ain 't goin' ter have me Duchess snifflin' with a cold. Go to grandma! It was me discovered him, Captain. I 'm askin' yer a favor. He 's a snooper.
#PATCH-EYE.
Captain, I gets rusty.
#CAPTAIN.
Lay off, me hearties. Duke! Patch! I loves both o' yer. I loves yer equal, like two mugs o' grog as is full alike. Yer can pitch dice ter see which does it.
#DUKE.
I drops 'em in me mug, so 's they can get a smell o' rum. The leetle bones is me friends. I never throws less 'n a five spot. I makes a pint o' shakin' the bones till they rattles jolly. I likes the sound o' it even better 'n the blessed scrapin' o' a spoon what 's stirrin' grog. Write it on me tombstone - if I rots ashore - He was the kinder feller as never throwed less 'n a five spot.
#CAPTAIN.
Go 'long, Duke. Bones, as is kept waitin', sulks.
#PATCH-EYE.
One or three?
#DUKE.
One 's enough. I 'm talkin' to yer, bones. I wants sixes, sweeties.
#DUKE.
Now yer done it!
#PATCH-EYE.
You is all thumbs, Betsy.
#CAPTAIN.
Easy, mates! It were jest an accident. Betsy, fetch a seacoal from the hearth! Betsy! We ain 't goin' ter wallop yer. Where are yer, Betsy?
#DARLIN'.
Come out o' yer hidin'!
#CAPTAIN.
I 'll light the candle meself.
#CAPTAIN.
There yer are - blazin' like ol' Petey. Yer had better sit down, Betsy. Crack me stump, where is the girl?
#PATCH-EYE.
Kinder silly o' her ter run away. We ain 't never walloped her.
#DUKE.
Women 's silly folks. I calls 'em ninnies. It don 't do no good tryin' ter understand 'em. Now then, ol' lionheart, are yer ready? Two fives! I 've done yer, Patch.
#PATCH-EYE.
Yer as sweet as honey. Tell me yer loves me. Me dirk is itchin' fer yer answer. Luck 's a lady as dotes on me. A pair o' sixes! Does yer see it, Duke? Stick yer blinkin' eye right down agin the table! It 's me, Captain. Joey are yer ready?
#OLD JOE.
God, if I were loose I 'd take you by the dirty gullet and twist it until you roared. I 'd kick you off my path like a snarling cur. Of what filth does nature sometimes compound a man! Shall a skunk walk two - legged to infect the air? Three cowards will hang on Wapping wharf before the month is up.
#PATCH-EYE.
Are n't meanin' us, are yer Joey?
#OLD JOE.
And I 'll tell you more.
#CAPTAIN.
Ain 't we listenin' to yer? Yer can talk spry, as Patch here has a leetle job ter do, and it 's nearin' bed time.
#DUKE.
We does n't want ter sit up late and lose our beauty sleep jest listenin' to a speech. pirate takes his chance of death. You guard your dirty skins by wrecking ships upon the rocks. You dare not pit yourselves against a breathing victim. Like carrion - crows you sit to a vile and bloated banquet.
#PATCH-EYE.
Tip me the wink, Captain, when yer has heard enough.
#OLD JOE.
Stand off, you whelp! The King of England fights in France -
#DUKE.
Ain 't yer 'shamed that you is not there ter help?
#OLD JOE.
I 'll tell you why I am not in France. I swore to his majesty that I would clear his coast of pirates. My plans are made. The channel is swept by gunboats. They will close in on you tomorrow - you and all the dirty vermin that befoul these cliffs.
#DUKE.
He talks so big, ye 'd think he was the King himself.
#DUKE.
We 'll play ch'rades. Here 's yer costume, Joey. There! It fits yer like the skin o' a snake. We makes yer King. Yer looks like yer was paradin' in St. James's park, lampin' a Duchess.
#PATCH-EYE.
Does yer majesty need a new 'igh chancellor. I asks yer fer it. I wants a fine house in London town, runnin' ter the Strand, and peacocks struttin' in the garden.
#CAPTAIN.
King, I asks yer ter cast yer gig on me. I 'd be a right smart Archbishop o' Canterbury. Me whiskers is 'clesiastical.
#DUKE.
I offers meself, King, as Lord 'Igh Admiral o' the Navy. I swears fluent.
#DARLIN'.
Has yer a Princess vacant? I lolls graceful on a throne.
#CAPTAIN.
'Vast there, me hearties! I 'm thinkin' I 'm hearin' the sound o' footsteps.
#DUKE.
Did yer lordship hear any sound?
#PATCH-EYE.
Askin' your Grice's pardon, I did n't ketch a thing. Did you hear anythin', Princess?
#DARLIN'.
There 's nothin' come ter me pearly ears.
#CAPTAIN.
Silence! I wants ter listen.
#CAPTAIN.
Well, Patch, yer had better get yer dirk ready. I 'm uncommon sleepy. I wants ter get ter bed.
#DARLIN'.
Ketch him a deep one, Patch.
#PATCH-EYE.
I takes it mighty kind o' you, Captain. Yer has alers been a lovin' father ter me. Joey, I 'll tell yer what yer are. Yer the kind o' feller I hates most perticerler. Yer a spy! Say yer prayers, you hissin' snake!
#OLD JOE.
My wasted day is done. In the tempest's wrack the stars are dim and faith 's the only compass. Now or hereafter, what matters it? The sun will gild the meadows as of yesteryear. The moon will fee the world with silver coin. And all across the earth men will traffic on their little errands until nature calls them home. I am a stone cast in a windy pool where scarce a ripple shows. Life 's but a candle in the wind. Mine will not burn to socket.
#DUKE.
He 's all wound up like a clock - jest tickin' words.
#CAPTAIN.
Patch, Joe is tellin' us poetical that his wick has burned right down to the bottle. Yer had better put it out, without more hesitatin'.
#DUKE.
Does yer see it, Captain?
#PATCH-EYE.
Horrers!
#DUKE.
It 's never went since Flint was hanged.
#CAPTAIN.
And would n't run till his death 's revenged and him layin' peaceful in his coffin.
#PATCH-EYE.
Does yer think it 's grog? Does all o' yer see it?
#DUKE.
What done it?
#CAPTAIN.
What 's that?
#PATCH-EYE.
It makes me jumpy.
#DUKE.
It ain 't a night when folks whistles jest fer cows and such. Finish yer job, Patch.
#PATCH-EYE.
Are yer feared o' somethin' special, Duke?
#DUKE.
Feared? If we ain 't quick, there 'll be a gibbet fer all o' us.
#CAPTAIN.
Ain 't the clock tickin' peaceful?
#PATCH-EYE.
She ain 't got no right ter tick. It 's like a dead man talkin'.
#DUKE.
Quick! Give me the knife! I 'll stick it in him. And when I 'm done, we scatters. There 's trouble brewin'. Termorrer night, when the tide is out, we meets at the holler cave. And may the devil lend a helpin' hand. Snooper, are yer ready? Does yer see this here blade shinin' in the candle? In about one minute I 'll be wipin' off a streak o' red upon me breeks. Flint - blessin' on yer gentle soul! - yer can rest in peace!
#DUKE.
It 's him the fortin - teller mentioned. It 's the man in a velvet cloak!
#CAPTAIN.
It 's him! Me God! Me hook!
#BETSY.
Joe! Hal! Thank God, you are safe.
#OLD JOE.
Margaret!
#SAILOR CAPTAIN.
I am the captain of the Royal Harry.
#OLD JOE.
Captain, I charge you to arrest these men.
#SAILOR CAPTAIN.
Yes, your Royal Highness.
#DUKE.
Royal 'Ighness? Did yer hear what he said?
#DARLIN'.
'Ighness nothin'. He 's jest a snooper.
#OLD JOE.
You will transport them in chains to London to wait their sentence by a court of law.
#SAILOR CAPTAIN.
Yes, your majesty.
#OLD JOE.
You mistake me, Captain. My father is the King of England. I am but the Prince of Wales.
#SAILOR CAPTAIN.
Alas, sire, we bring you heavy news. Your Royal Father, the King of England, has been killed, fighting gloriously on the soil of France.
#OLD JOE.
Bear with me. My grief has leaped the channel. My thought is a silent mourner at my father's grave. Shall a King sink to the measure of a mound of turf for the tread of a peasant's foot? Where is now the ermine robe, the glistening crown, the harness of a fighting hour, the sceptre that marked the giddy office, the voice, the flashing eye that stirred a coward to bravery, the iron gauntlet shaking in the pallid face of France? All - all covered by a spadeful of country earth. Captain, has Calais fallen to our army's siege? Are the French lilies plucked for England's boutoniere?
#SAILOR CAPTAIN.
Calais has fallen.
#OLD JOE.
Then God be praised even in this hard hour. By heaven's help I throw off the idle practice of my youth. The empty tricks and trivial habits of the careless years, I renounce them all. A wind has scoured the sullen clouds of youth. My past has been a ragged garment, stained with heedless hours. Tonight I cast it off, like a coat that is out at elbow. My father henceforth lives in me.
#MEG.
Hooray! I wants ter be the first, yer Majesty, ter swear allegiance to yer throne. I saw yer future in the glass. Ol' Meg knowed yer, like she had rocked yer in the cradle. I told yer I would come in yer hour o' danger. It was me reached through the winder fer the gun ter save yer. It was me whistle that yer heard, dearie, hurryin' up the sailormen as Betsy went ter fetch.
#OLD JOE.
Thanks my good woman. We grant you a pension for your love.
#OLD JOE.
Ha! My velvet cloak, which I left at Castle Crag when I laid aside the Prince and took disguise. These unintentioned ruffians by their dirty jest have clothed me to my office.
#SAILOR CAPTAIN.
I swear my allegiance, your Majesty.
#OLD JOE.
I rely on my sailors to clear the coast and seas. But first I want your allegiance in another high concern. Some fourteen years ago, when I was a lad of ten, I journeyed with my royal father to the castle of the Duke of Cornwall, which stands high on the wind - swept coast. Its giddy towers rise sheer above the ocean until the very rooks nesting in the battlements grow dizzy at the height. It is the outer bastion of the world, laughing to scorn the ocean's siege. In that castle, Captain, there lived a little girl; and she and I romped the sounding corridors together. And once I led her to an open 'brasure in the steep - pitched wall, and held her so that she might see the waves curling on the rocks below. And tales of mermaids I invented, and shipwreck and treasure buried in the noisy caverns of the rock, where twice a day the greedy tide goes in and out to seek its fortune. And far afield we wandered and stood waist - deep in the golden meadows, until the weary twilight called us home. And I remember, when tired with play, that her mother sang to us an old song, a lullaby. Her voice was soft, with a gentleness that only a mother knows who sits with drowsy children. And to that little girl I was betrothed. It was sworn with oath and signature that some day I would marry her and that, when I became king of England in the revolving years, she would be its queen.
#BETSY.
By what miracle did you know me, Hal?
#OLD JOE.
It was the song you sang. Your voice was the miracle that told the secret. With unvarnished speech I woo you. I love you, Margaret, and I ask you to be my wife.
#MEG.
Hooray!
#OLD JOE.
The magic of your lips, my dear, is the miracle that answers me. My loyal sailors, I present you. Margaret, Duchess of Cornwall, Countess of Devon, Princess of the Western Marches, by right and title possessor of all land 'twixt Exeter and Land's End. And now, by her consent and the grace of God, the wife of Harry, King of England.
#CAPTAIN.
Leetle Betsy, I fergives yer.
#DUKE.
I asks yer health, though I swings termorrer.
#PATCH-EYE.
And may yer live long and 'appy!
#DARLIN'.
We 're lovin' yer, Betsy.
#BETSY.
My gracious lord, for these three years this cabin has been my home. These are my friends - the only friends I have ever known. They fed me when I had no food and they kept me warm against the cold. Must they hang? I ask you to pardon them.
#DARLIN'.
Glory ter God!
#OLD JOE.
The pardon is granted. Captain, strike off their irons!
#DARLIN'.
We loves yer, Betsy.
#CAPTAIN.
We are fonder of yer than grog and singin' angels.
#PATCH-EYE.
I thanks yer, King.
#DUKE.
It were jest an hour ago, settin' in that chair, I asks ter splice yer, Betsy, keel ter topsail. The ol' Duke never thought the Countess of all them places, and the Queen o' England, ter boot, would ever be settin' on his knee, pullin' at his whiskers - him askin' her ter name the 'appy day.
#BETSY.
It was a prior attachment, Duke.
#CAPTAIN.
We 'll serve yer, King, like we served ol' Flint.
#PATCH-EYE.
Top and bottom, fore and aft.
#DUKE.
We 'll brag how the King o' England and us has drunk grog together, and how the Queen washed up the mugs.
#MEG.
Hooray!
#OLD JOE.
And now, Captain, lead the way. We must speed to London.
#BETSY.
Good by, Duke. Some day you will find a girl who cooks roast pig that crackles. blessin', Betsy, on yer laughin' eyes! health ter King Hal and his blushin' bride!
#ALL.
King Hal! Leetle Betsy!
#PATCH-EYE.
Darlin'! Me friend, the Duke, is thirsty. Yer had better mix another pot o' grog. Yer does n't want ter be a foolish virgin and get ketched without no grog.
#DARLIN'.
Yer coddles yer stomich, Patch.
#PATCH-EYE.
The Duke, he knows a leetle dear as is jest waitin' ter come flutterin' ter his lovin' arms. I thinks it 's yer whiskers, Duke.
#CAPTAIN.
Yer can pull one, Betsy, fer the locket that yer wears. We is laughin' at yer, ol' walrus.
#DUKE.
Kings is bigger than Dukes. I looses without no kickin' up. There 's no one like Darlin' fer mixin' grog.
#DARLIN'.
Fer that kind word I 'm lovin' yer.
#PATCH-EYE.
It 's grog beats off the melancholy. As soon as me pipes goes dry, I gets homesick fer the ocean. Here we be, Duke, thrown up at last ter rot like driftwood on the shore. It was 'appy days when we sailed with ol' Flint on the Spanish Main.
#CAPTAIN.
'Appy days, Patch!
#ALL.
'Appy days!
