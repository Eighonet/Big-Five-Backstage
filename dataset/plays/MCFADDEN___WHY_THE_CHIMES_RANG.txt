#HOLGER.
Take heart, Steen, perhaps we can go next year.
#STEEN.
Next year! Next year I'll be so old I won't want to go.
#HOLGER.
Oh, quite old folks go to the Christmas service. Come, let's watch the people going down to town.
#STEEN.
No.
#HOLGER.
The road'll be full, grand folk! Come watch, Steen.
#STEEN.
No!
#HOLGER.
Why the road's all empty again!
#STEEN.
Everybody's gone!
#HOLGER.
They're lighting the cathedral!
#STEEN.
I don't care!
#HOLGER.
Oh, Steen, come see, - like the stars coming out!
#STEEN.
I won't see! Mother said way last summer that we could go to - night, and now -
#HOLGER.
She meant it! She didn't know that the grandmother would be ill, and she and father'ud have to go to her. Be fair, Steen!
#STEEN.
They might let us go alone. "Too little!" Bah!
#HOLGER.
Steen, come here!
#STEEN.
What?
#HOLGER.
Look, by the dead pine yonder, an old woman facing us, kneeling in the snow, see? praying!
#STEEN.
She's looking at us!
#HOLGER.
She's raising her hand to us!
#STEEN.
She's beckoning!
#HOLGER.
No, she's making the Sign of the Cross.
#STEEN.
Who is she, Holger?
#HOLGER.
I don't know.
#STEEN.
Oh, Holger, I'm afraid!
#HOLGER.
No, no! Look, she has turned away, - she's deeper in the shadow, - why, she's gone! Just some old granny going down to town, and thou afraid!
#STEEN.
And thou afraid!
#HOLGER.
I was not!
#STEEN.
Oh - h - h - h!
#HOLGER.
Well, I was just a little bit afraid - lest she might frighten thee. Hush, - steps - coming here!
#STEEN.
The old woman!
#HOLGER.
No, - Uncle Bertel!
#BERTEL.
Hullo, there, - open, Holger!
#STEEN.
Oh, Uncle, Uncle, Uncle Bertel!
#HOLGER.
Uncle Bertel, welcome!
#BERTEL.
Help, help! - Robbers! - I'm beset! - Gently, youngsters! - Brrrrr! It's cold in the forest to - night! - Well, why am I come? - Tell me that!
#STEEN.
To take us to the Christmas Service?
#HOLGER.
Uncle! How didst thou know we were not going?
#BERTEL.
I met a fox - who said -
#HOLGER.
Oh - h! - Thou hast seen mother and father!
#BERTEL.
By our Lady, yes! - and walking so fast they had only time to throw me a word from the sides of their mouths. "Go up," cried Mother, - "I wist my boys are deep in tears!" - and I, not wishing to see you drown in so much water -
#HOLGER.
Dear Uncle Bertel!
#STEEN.
Come, let's go quick!
#BERTEL.
Patience, patience, young colt, plenty of time, mother said something else.
#STEEN.
What?
#BERTEL.
That I should find some warm porridge for my pains.
#HOLGER.
Why, of course, there is porridge! Nice and warm it is! All ready for supper.
#STEEN.
Supper! How could we forget supper? - Give me a big bowlful, Holger.
#HOLGER.
There isn't a big bowlful here.
#STEEN.
Nice kind good supper, umh!
#HOLGER.
Listen!
#BERTEL.
To what?
#HOLGER.
Someone - sobbing - at the door! Nothing there!
#BERTEL.
The wind! - Thy old tricks, Holger, - always dreaming some strange thing.
#HOLGER.
Didst thou pass an old woman on the road - near here?
#BERTEL.
Not a soul nearer than the town gate. Come, boy, eat, - eat! See how Steen eats!
#HOLGER.
Oh, Uncle Bertel, - I'm too glad to eat!
#BERTEL.
Thou art right, lad, - fasting were better than feasting this day in Tralsund! - they say, - do you know what they say in the town?
#HOLGER.
What?
#BERTEL.
They say - that to - night in the great church - when the offerings are laid upon the altar for the Christ child, - something will happen!
#HOLGER.
What?
#BERTEL.
Who can say? All day the folk have been pouring into the town as never before. The market place is crowded, every inn is full. No church but the cathedral could hold such a multitude. Never have I seen such excitement, such fervor!
#HOLGER.
There will be many gifts!
#BERTEL.
- the rich are bringing their treasure, gold and jewels, king's ransoms, aye and the King comes.
#HOLGER.
The King?
#BERTEL.
The King Himself!
#STEEN.
Oh, and shall we see Him, Uncle, and the fine gifts and everything?
#BERTEL.
Why not? - Even the poorest may go up and give - what hast thou to offer?
#STEEN.
I? - Nothing!
#HOLGER.
Oh, I have, see, Uncle? See! - Last week I was gathering sticks in the forest and a fine gentleman rode past and asked the way of me. I showed him the path and he gave me these!
#BERTEL.
Faith, real money in the family.
#STEEN.
Oh, I thought we were going to buy cakes with those, Holger.
#HOLGER.
But it's better to give it to the Christ Child. You see He is a little child, smaller than even you, - and I think He would like a little gift, - a little bright gift that would buy cakes for Him.
#BERTEL.
Aye, to - night we must think of Him, - there in His Holy Church.
#HOLGER.
It is a holy place, the church! - I feel it every time I go, - it's like God's forest, - the pillars like old oaks and the great windows all colors like sunsets through the trees.
#BERTEL.
'Tis like the forest.
#HOLGER.
And when the organ plays that's like a storm gathering in the mountains. storm? - Aye! - "The Lord hath His way in the whirlwind and in the storm and the clouds are the dust of His feet!" - Why should He not do a wonder as of old? Perhaps the great miracle will come again!
#HOLGER.
Oh, which, Uncle? - There are so many in the Bible!
#STEEN.
Yes, which? - Would there be a whale now to swallow a priest?
#BERTEL.
Thou goosey! This was no Bible miracle, - it happened there, there, where we see the lights, - hundreds of years ago. Surely thou hast heard of the Miracle of the Chimes?
#HOLGER.
I've heard folks speak of it, - but I never knew just what happened.
#STEEN.
Oh, tell us, Uncle Bertel.
#BERTEL.
Aye, listen then! - You see the great tower there? - It goes so high into the clouds that no one can see it's top! - No one even knows how high it is for the men who built it have been dead for hundreds of years.
#STEEN.
But what has that to do with the chimes?
#HOLGER.
Hush, Steen, let uncle speak!
#BERTEL.
The chimes are up at the top of the tower - and they are holy bells, - miraculous bells, placed there by sainted hands, - and when they rang 'twas said that angels' voices echoed through them.
#STEEN.
Why doesn't someone ring them now?
#BERTEL.
Ah, that is not so easy! - They are said to ring on Christmas Eve when the gifts are laid on the altar for the Christ - child, - but not every offering will ring them, it must be a perfect gift. And for all these years not one thing has been laid upon the altar good enough to make the chimes ring out.
#HOLGER.
Oh, that's what the priest was talking about to mother, then. He said it mustn't be just a fine gift for show but something full of love for the Christ - child.
#STEEN.
Oh, I want to hear them!
#BERTEL.
We shall! - The very air is full of holy mystery! The Spirit of Christ will be there in the church to - night! Thy cap, boy!
#STEEN.
Here they are, old dreamer! - And hurry!
#HOLGER.
I'm coming! - Nothing can happen to stop us now, can it? Steen!
#STEEN.
Oh! - The Old Woman!
#BERTEL.
When did she come in?
#STEEN.
I didn't see her!
#HOLGER.
What dost thou want, dame?
#OLD WOMAN.
Refuge - from the storm of the world!
#HOLGER.
Surely thou shalt rest here.
#OLD WOMAN.
Oh, son, I am so weary and so heavy laden.
#HOLGER.
She's faint! She's so cold! Quick, Steen, build up the fire! She must have lost her way in the forest.
#BERTEL.
We have scant time to lose with that old beggar.
#HOLGER.
What'll I do with her?
#BERTEL.
Leave her and come on.
#STEEN.
And come - before it is to - morrow!
#HOLGER.
Oh, I - ought we to go and leave her?
#STEEN.
Not go?
#BERTEL.
Go, of course we'll go, she'll warm herself and march along.
#HOLGER.
But she is ill. Thou shalt go with Uncle but I - must stay with her.
#BERTEL.
Nonsense, Holger!
#HOLGER.
No, it isn't! - If we should all go now, the fire would go out and the light, - and she would wake up in the cold darkness and not know where to turn for help.
#BERTEL.
Na, by Saint Christopher! - Miss a miracle to keep company with a beggar! - Who held her hand before thou camest along? Send her packing and make haste, Holger.
#STEEN.
Oh, do, Holger!
#HOLGER.
If there were some place near that we could take her.
#BERTEL.
There isn't a place on the road, - they've all gone to town long ago. Bid her fare there also!
#HOLGER.
Mother wouldn't treat her so, - she'd be good to her.
#BERTEL.
Think of what you'll miss! Well, this is idle talk, thou and I will go, Steen.
#STEEN.
Oh, come, - let's go!
#BERTEL.
Thou and I will see the King, perchance - The Christ! Thou art stubborn, Holger, I who am older tell thee what to do! Come, Steen!
#STEEN.
Good - bye, Holger.
#HOLGER.
Good - bye! Oh, wait, wait for me, Uncle, I will go! No!
#MOTHER.
The path - is so - steep!
#HOLGER.
Didst thou speak, dame? Thou art like Grandmother, and I know what Mother would do for her! Art warmer, dame? - still cold! - The covers aren't very thick. Thou must get warm!
#MOTHER.
Berries, - yes, find berries.
#HOLGER.
Oh, thou art hungry! Dame, here is food!
#MOTHER.
Food, give it to me, child, I am dying for food!
#HOLGER.
Ah, poor soul! - Why, thou wert starving! - Na, just see! - Mother says that's what makes my little brother so round and rosy, because he eats so much porridge, - you like it, don't you?
#MOTHER.
It is life itself! Bless thee, Child!
#HOLGER.
Oh, thou art warm!
#MOTHER.
Aye, warm! Listen, - is that music?
#HOLGER.
From the Cathedral! - Aye, it must be, - last summer we could hear it plain, and now with so many thousands there! It's beginning! - Everyone is there!
#MOTHER.
Why are they there.
#HOLGER.
It's the great service! All the world is there, the village folk, and strangers from afar, great court folk, too, - aye, and the King, - our King! And He will give a gift, - a King's gift! Look, dame, you can even see the windows gleam! It is so near! It's all beginning and - I - am not there!
#MOTHER.
Son!
#HOLGER.
Aye, dame?
#MOTHER.
Thou, too, wouldst go? Another time thou'll go!
#HOLGER.
It'll never be the same again! To - night the Christ comes. Bertel said - "The Christ!"
#MOTHER.
Nay, son, pray to the Christ - child, pray that He does not pass thee by!
#HOLGER.
Oh, it's no use! I'd rather be all blind and never see than miss the vision that the Christ will send!
#MOTHER.
Look, look what comes!
#HOLGER.
Dame! Oh - h - h - h!
#HOLGER.
Perhaps there are no chimes, perhaps the Christ hears us not!
#MOTHER.
Have faith, - have faith in God.
#HOLGER.
I would that I could give my pennies to the Child.
#MOTHER.
Go up, my son, - fear not - The Christ - Child waits for all!
#ANGEL.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, it is not gold nor silver nor rich pearls but love and selfsacrifice that please the Lord. The Christ - Child was hungered and you gave him meat, - a stranger and you took Him in.
#HOLGER.
But I - I have not seen the Christ - Child.
#ANGEL.
Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these His Brethern, you have done it unto Him!
#HOLGER.
Dame, - dame! - The Chimes, - the star - did you see? Gone! Gone! But the Chimes! The stars! - God's Chimes!
