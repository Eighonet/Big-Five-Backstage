#DRUNKARD.
Good evening, Madam Prostitute. Why are the dogs whining like this to - night?
#PROSTITUTE.
They must be seeing things.
#DRUNKARD.
Yes, your black soul. Perhaps they think you a devil. That's why they chase all over the butchers' stalls. No wonder. They've reason to be afraid.
#BEGGAR.
He - he - he. Ha - ha - ha. drunkard and a prostitute are the same thing. None of us is clean of sin.
#BEGGAR.
Don't take me for a "pal."
#DRUNKARD.
Leave him alone. He sings hymns the whole day long.
#BEGGAR.
Poverty is no sin.
#DRUNKARD.
Don't mix in. What do dogs see at night?
#PROSTITUTE.
They say that on the first of May the Holy Mother walks through the market place, and gathers all the stray souls.
#DRUNKARD.
What have the dogs got to do with it?
#PROSTITUTE.
They are people laden with sins. People who died without the Holy Sacrament, and who were buried outside of the fence. At night they roam about the market in the shape of dogs. They run about in the stalls of the butchers. The devil, too, stays there, but when the first of May comes and the prayers begin, the Holy Mother walks through the market - place. The souls of the damned cling to her dress, and she takes them with her to Heaven.
#BEGGAR.
Strong vinegar bursts the cask. Her soul must be black indeed.
#DRUNKARD.
It's awful to look into it. You'll be among them yet....
#PROSTITUTE.
I'm not afraid of that. The mercy of God is great. It will reach even me. But all of you will be among the dogs too. Those who live in the street come back to the street after death.
#BEGGAR.
The street is the home of the beggar. Poverty is no sin.
#DRUNKARD.
Ah, good evening, Napoleon. Where do you hail from?
#FOOL.
From Turkey. I have driven out the Turk.
#DRUNKARD.
And where is your army?
#FOOL.
I have left it on the Vistula.
#DRUNKARD.
And when will you drive the Russians out of there?
#FOOL.
I have given my orders already.
#DRUNKARD.
Are they being carried out?
#FOOL.
I only need to draw my sword.
#DRUNKARD.
Your sword?
#FOOL.
Napoleon gave it to me.
#PROSTITUTE.
Leave him be. Every one is crazy in his way. You are cold. Come to the fire. He wanders about the hollows the whole night long.
#FOOL.
I've quartered all of my soldiers, but I have no place for myself to sleep in. fool, and yet he knows what he says. Do you want to eat?
#FOOL.
I get my dinner from the tables of Kings.
#BEGGAR.
You've brought the fool here too? He's got the whole market place to be crazy in, and he comes here, where honest people sleep.
#PROSTITUTE.
Leave him alone I tell you. Crazy though he be, he still wants to be among people. Like aches for like.
#BEGGAR.
Let him go to the graveyard, and yell his craziness out among the graves; - and not disturb honest men in their sleep. The street is the beggar's home, and I don't want to share it with madmen. All that the people throw out of their homes, wanders into the street.
#DRUNKARD.
Who made you boss here? The street belongs to all. Lie down in the city hall, in the mayor's bed, if you want to have rest.
#PROSTITUTE.
Keep still. He has a right to the place. He's had it long enough.
#DRUNKARD.
What kind of a right? Are you a newcomer? How long have you been here?
#PROSTITUTE.
All my life. I was born in the street, there, behind the fence near the church. My mother pointed out the place to me. I have never known any other home, but the street. In the daytime it belongs to all. When people open their shops, and peasants come in their wagons, and trade begins, I feel a stranger here, and I hide in the fields near the cemetery. But when night comes, and people retire into their holes, then the street is mine. I know every nook and corner of the market place. It is my home.
#DRUNKARD.
You've said it well. In that house there, I have a home, a bed, and a wife. In the daytime I work there. I sit among boots, and drive nails into heels and soles. And I bear my wife's nagging and cursing patiently.... But when night comes I can't stand it any longer. The house becomes too small for me. Something draws me into the street.
#PROSTITUTE.
It is the curse of the street that rests on you as it does on the howling dogs. All of us are damned, and we are punished here for our sins. And we will not be delivered, till the Holy Mother will come, and we will take hold of her dress, and our souls will be freed.
#BEGGAR.
He - he - he. Ha - ha - ha.
#DRUNKARD.
In the daytime I don't mind it. Then I am like other people. I work like all do. But when night comes....
#PROSTITUTE.
It's the curse of the street. Don't worry. God will pity all of us. His mercy is great.
#DRUNKARD.
What's that?
#PROSTITUTE.
That's Manka's bastard. He strays the street. He wants to come near the fire.
#DRUNKARD.
Call him here.
#PROSTITUTE.
Keep still. He will chase the boy away. They believe the boy is born of the Devil.
#DRUNKARD.
Who made him boss here? All of us are children of the Devil. Come here, you.
#PROSTITUTE.
He lies the whole night behind his mother's doorstep. She is afraid of her husband. Sometimes she gives him a piece of bread, when no one looks. Thus he crawls like a worm in the street - human flesh and blood.
#DRUNKARD.
Let him come near the fire - so. Give him a piece of bread. I'll take care of any one who tries to hurt him.
#BEGGAR.
No. That's too much. Who brought this here? You know that the Devil is in him?
#PROSTITUTE.
Have pity.
#BEGGAR.
You're the Devil's wife. That's why you pity his child.
#DRUNKARD.
We're all the children of the Devil. You've no more on your hide than he has.
#BEGGAR.
Don't you start anything. I am a Christian, and believe in God. I've no home. That's why I sleep on the street. Every dog finds his hole. But I won't live together with the Devil. And I won't be the neighbor of a harlot either. Nor was a drunkard ever a friend of mine. What are you running after me for? This whole street belongs to the Devil. Why are you trying to stop me?
#PROSTITUTE.
Don't leave us. Let him only warm himself. He'll go away.
#BEGGAR.
It does me little honor to be with folk like you anyway.
#DRUNKARD.
Why do you hold him back? Let him go if he thinks us below his dignity.
#PROSTITUTE.
And do you really think it an honor for one to remain with you? That man is decent at least.
#DRUNKARD.
Ah, you grow pious as you grow old.
#PROSTITUTE.
I have always wanted to be in decent company.
#PROSTITUTE.
It's awful to be with so many sick people. Not one amongst them who is of sound mind. Not one who has a clean conscience. The Beggar has gone away.
#DRUNKARD.
The dogs have also come to the fire.
#PROSTITUTE.
Even they are drawn to people.
#DRUNKARD.
What's the trouble with him? Take him away.
#PROSTITUTE.
That's the Devil in him crying - see him gazing at something.
#DRUNKARD.
Praised be God. The dawn.
#PROSTITUTE.
How different the light is to - day.
#DRUNKARD.
What are the dogs howling about? Chase them away from the fire.
#PROSTITUTE.
They are looking somewheres. They sniff at the air. They must see something now.
#PROSTITUTE.
Something is coming near to us.
#DRUNKARD.
What is the Fool laughing at? What is he gazing at? Chase him away from the fire.
#PROSTITUTE.
They all see more clearly than we.
#DRUNKARD.
Something is coming near to us.
#THIEF.
Fall on your knees. Draw off your hats! Do you see who is coming? The queen! The queen! Who is there? Ah, the Fool. Well, how are your armies getting along? Hold them in readiness. Hold them in readiness. The Drunkard! Ah, the right man for the game. With awe do I kiss the little hand of Madame Prostitute. : And your little heir is here also? : Take them with you, oh, Queen. They too are dogs like us, thrown into the street. Let them come with us, We have room for many, many.
#MOTHER.
Take them with us, my man. We will all go together.
#THIEF.
Our company is growing big. Come with us.
#DRUNKARD.
So you are the thief they let out of prison not long ago. And I was afraid of you a little while ago. That's a fine joke. Always at your play. Who's the woman, and the children? Where did you get them?
#THIEF.
Brother, this is not play. She is a queen. And they are princes. Every one a prince. At your knees before her! Take off your hat.
#DRUNKARD.
I know this gentleman quite well. He likes to joke.
#THIEF.
To - night is the night when the dogs are delivered. Look at her. Look at us. We were locked in, and we have come out. We are all one family - dogs. We wander on the street. Men have shut their doors in our faces. Come, dogs. We will unite to - day. Throw off your chains, and shake yourself as if you were shaking dust from your shoulders. You are men after all. I have known you from childhood. I knew your mother.
#DRUNKARD.
I don't know what you mean.
#THIEF.
Look at yourself. What have they made of you? You walk the street all night like an outcast. Your children are afraid of you. They hide when they see you drunk on the street, and weep for you. Are you to blame for it? You were made one with a mass of flesh you hate. You sit bent over your boots the whole day long, and curses and blows are hurled at your head. And when night comes you crawl in the gutter, and you will crawl there till you will be freed from shame.
#DRUNKARD.
What are you telling me this for?
#THIEF.
And are you to blame for this? Have you had one minute of happiness in your whole life? Who took care of you? You were raised by your stepfather's cane. Show me the scars on your body. They beat you from childhood on; first your stepfather, then your "step - wife." No one ever spoke to you as to a friend. No one ever comforted you in your grief.
#THIEF.
And he is an honest man. I know him. We went to the same school. He had an honest mother. She loved him only as a mother can. She brought him bread behind his stepfather's back.
#DRUNKARD.
I will never drink again. I give my word of honor.
#THIEF.
Don't cry, brother. We are all dogs of the street. But we unite to - day. Come with us, come. We will care for you. We will all be together. Take the Prostitute, and come with us.
#PROSTITUTE.
Me?
#THIEF.
We will not turn you, nor avoid you. We know what you are. You are not to blame. Who brought you up? Who was your mother? You were born in the street like a goat. Every stone, every hole in the earth caresses you like a mother. You were thrown into the street at birth, and men ran from you as from a leper. Any wonder that this is what became of you? You lay in the street like an old, dirty rag.
#PROSTITUTE.
I am not worthy of such comforting words by a gentleman.
#THIEF.
You are worthy. You are like all of us. Your skin is dirty, but your soul is clean. Wash your sins away, throw the curse from off your shoulders, and you will become a human being like all of us. You too long for people. I know you. You are good, you love humanity. It is they who have cursed you so. You were always a clean child. Wait. Wait. I wash your head, and you are a human being like the rest of us. The curse is removed from you. Look around yourself. Spring is here. Its fragrance is everywhere. You are a girl yet, a mere child. You know no wickedness. You are in your father's garden. Your mother sits near the window and looks at you. You are walking with your beloved.
#PROSTITUTE.
Don't talk to me like that.
#THIEF.
You are being married now. Virgins come and bring you your bridal dress, your veil, your myrtle wreath. You are chaste. They lead you to the altar. Your mother lays her hand on your head and blesses you. Sweet harp music is heard. Your bridegroom takes his place beside you.
#DRUNKARD.
I will be together with her. I will defend her. I will not let them insult her. She is my sister. I will work for her.
#THIEF.
That's the way. The dogs unite to - day. And, he, too, is our child. All of us are dogs of the street. All of us unite to - day.
#DRUNKARD.
He is our child. He will be with us. Come, we will go together. I will work for you. You will bring him up, and he will be our child. What? You do not hear? Listen. I mean it with my whole heart.
#THIEF.
That's the way. That's the way. That's the way. To - day we unite. We go together. We will be one with the dogs. Blow the trumpets, boys. Beat the drums. We choose a queen to - day. The army waits for you, with swords in their hands, with spears ready. Do you see the cannon all trained? All wait for your command. Do you see the foe around you? Here stands the army.
#FOOL.
Yes, yes.
#THIEF.
Give your order, Napoleon. You are our general. Draw the sword, and command!
#FOOL.
Present arms!
#THIEF.
That's the way. The dogs unite to - day. All will unite. We choose a queen to - day. She is worthy of wearing the crown of the street. Come, queen. Mount to your throne. Boys, blow your trumpets. Beat your drums. At your knees. All hats off. The queen comes. The queen comes. So will we go to our land.
#PROSTITUTE.
Oh, see, see. It is the Holy Mother. Look at her - her face. She has come from the church. Oh, it is the holy picture before which I always pray. I know her. Our Holy Mother in her very flesh. Oh, Mother, Mother, take me under Thy protection. Ah, ah, what are you doing there. Come into the house. There is work to be done.
#DRUNKARD.
Ha - ha - ha. That's Helenka, Andrey the Plasterer's wife. Ha - ha - ha. He's cracked a good joke.
#HELENKA.
Why did you drag me into the street?
#THIEF.
Come with me. Remember what we said. Come to another land with me.
#HELENKA.
What does he want with me? Why did he drag me into the street? Come home, children.
#THIEF.
Dogs, where are you running?... You dogs, you damned dogs.... Get out of the way....
