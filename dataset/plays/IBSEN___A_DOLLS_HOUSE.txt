#NORA.
Hide the Christmas - tree carefully, Ellen; the children must on no account see it before this evening, when it’s lighted up. How much?
#PORTER.
Fifty öre.
#NORA.
There is a crown. No, keep the change.
#NORA.
Yes; he is at home.
#HELMER.
Is that my lark twittering there?
#NORA.
Yes, it is.
#HELMER.
Is it the squirrel frisking around?
#NORA.
Yes!
#HELMER.
When did the squirrel get home?
#NORA.
Just this minute. Come here, Torvald, and see what I’ve been buying.
#HELMER.
Don’t interrupt me. Buying, did you say? What! All that? Has my little spendthrift been making the money fly again?
#NORA.
Why, Torvald, surely we can afford to launch out a little now. It’s the first Christmas we haven’t had to pinch.
#HELMER.
Come come; we can’t afford to squander money.
#NORA.
Oh yes, Torvald, do let us squander a little, now—just the least little bit! You know you’ll soon be earning heaps of money.
#HELMER.
Yes, from New Year’s Day. But there’s a whole quarter before my first salary is due.
#NORA.
Never mind; we can borrow in the meantime.
#HELMER.
Nora! Still my little featherbrain! Supposing I borrowed a thousand crowns to - day, and you made ducks and drakes of them during Christmas week, and then on New Year’s Eve a tile blew off the roof and knocked my brains out——
#NORA.
Hush! How can you talk so horridly?
#HELMER.
But supposing it were to happen—what then?
#NORA.
If anything so dreadful happened, it would be all the same to me whether I was in debt or not.
#HELMER.
But what about the creditors?
#NORA.
They! Who cares for them? They’re only strangers.
#HELMER.
Nora, Nora! What a woman you are! But seriously, Nora, you know my principles on these points. No debts! No borrowing! Home life ceases to be free and beautiful as soon as it is founded on borrowing and debt. We two have held out bravely till now, and we are not going to give in at the last.
#NORA.
Very well—as you please, Torvald.
#HELMER.
Come come; my little lark mustn’t droop her wings like that. What? Is my squirrel in the sulks? Nora, what do you think I have here?
#NORA.
Money!
#HELMER.
There! Of course I know all sorts of things are wanted at Christmas.
#NORA.
Ten, twenty, thirty, forty. Oh, thank you, thank you, Torvald! This will go a long way.
#HELMER.
I should hope so.
#NORA.
Yes, indeed; a long way! But come here, and let me show you all I’ve been buying. And so cheap! Look, here’s a new suit for Ivar, and a little sword. Here are a horse and a trumpet for Bob. And here are a doll and a cradle for Emmy. They’re only common; but they’re good enough for her to pull to pieces. And dress - stuffs and kerchiefs for the servants. I ought to have got something better for old Anna.
#HELMER.
And what’s in that other parcel?
#NORA.
No, Torvald, you’re not to see that until this evening!
#HELMER.
Oh! Ah! But now tell me, you little spendthrift, have you thought of anything for yourself?
#NORA.
For myself! Oh, I don’t want anything.
#HELMER.
Nonsense! Just tell me something sensible you would like to have.
#NORA.
No, really I don’t know of anything——Well, listen, Torvald——
#HELMER.
Well?
#NORA.
If you really want to give me something, you might, you know—you might——
#HELMER.
Well? Out with it!
#NORA.
You might give me money, Torvald. Only just what you think you can spare; then I can buy something with it later on.
#HELMER.
But, Nora——
#NORA.
Oh, please do, dear Torvald, please do! I should hang the money in lovely gilt paper on the Christmas - tree. Wouldn’t that be fun?
#HELMER.
What do they call the birds that are always making the money fly?
#NORA.
Yes, I know—spendthrifts, of course. But please do as I ask you, Torvald. Then I shall have time to think what I want most. Isn’t that very sensible, now?
#HELMER.
Certainly; that is to say, if you really kept the money I gave you, and really spent it on something for yourself. But it all goes in housekeeping, and for all manner of useless things, and then I have to pay up again.
#NORA.
But, Torvald——
#HELMER.
Can you deny it, Nora dear? It’s a sweet little lark, but it gets through a lot of money. No one would believe how much it costs a man to keep such a little bird as you.
#NORA.
For shame! How can you say so? Why, I save as much as ever I can.
#HELMER.
Very true—as much as you can—but that’s precisely nothing.
#NORA.
H’m! If you only knew, Torvald, what expenses we larks and squirrels have.
#HELMER.
You’re a strange little being! Just like your father—always on the look - out for all the money you can lay your hands on; but the moment you have it, it seems to slip through your fingers; you never know what becomes of it. Well, one must take you as you are. It’s in the blood. Yes, Nora, that sort of thing is hereditary.
#NORA.
I wish I had inherited many of papa’s qualities.
#HELMER.
And I don’t wish you anything but just what you are—my own, sweet little song - bird. But I say—it strikes me you look so—so—what shall I call it?—so suspicious to - day——
#NORA.
Do I?
#HELMER.
You do, indeed. Look me full in the face.
#NORA.
Well?
#HELMER.
Hasn’t the little sweet - tooth been playing pranks to - day?
#NORA.
No; how can you think such a thing!
#HELMER.
Didn’t she just look in at the confectioner’s?
#NORA.
No, Torvald; really——
#HELMER.
Not to sip a little jelly?
#NORA.
No; certainly not.
#HELMER.
Hasn’t she even nibbled a macaroon or two?
#NORA.
No, Torvald, indeed, indeed!
#HELMER.
Well, well, well; of course I’m only joking.
#NORA.
I shouldn’t think of doing what you disapprove of.
#HELMER.
No, I’m sure of that; and, besides, you’ve given me your word—— Well, keep your little Christmas secrets to yourself, Nora darling. The Christmas - tree will bring them all to light, I daresay.
#NORA.
Have you remembered to invite Doctor Rank?
#HELMER.
No. But it’s not necessary; he’ll come as a matter of course. Besides, I shall ask him when he looks in to - day. I’ve ordered some capital wine. Nora, you can’t think how I look forward to this evening.
#NORA.
And I too. How the children will enjoy themselves, Torvald!
#HELMER.
Ah, it’s glorious to feel that one has an assured position and ample means. Isn’t it delightful to think of?
#NORA.
Oh, it’s wonderful!
#HELMER.
Do you remember last Christmas? For three whole weeks beforehand you shut yourself up every evening till long past midnight to make flowers for the Christmas - tree, and all sorts of other marvels that were to have astonished us. I was never so bored in my life.
#NORA.
I didn’t bore myself at all.
#HELMER.
But it came to little enough in the end, Nora.
#NORA.
Oh, are you going to tease me about that again? How could I help the cat getting in and pulling it all to pieces?
#HELMER.
To be sure you couldn’t, my poor little Nora. You did your best to give us all pleasure, and that’s the main point. But, all the same, it’s a good thing the hard times are over.
#NORA.
Oh, isn’t it wonderful?
#HELMER.
Now I needn’t sit here boring myself all alone; and you needn’t tire your blessed eyes and your delicate little fingers——
#NORA.
No, I needn’t, need I, Torvald? Oh, how wonderful it is to think of! And now I’ll tell you how I think we ought to manage, Torvald. As soon as Christmas is over— - Oh, there’s a ring! That’s somebody come to call. How tiresome!
#HELMER.
I’m “not at home” to callers; remember that.
#ELLEN.
A lady to see you, ma’am.
#NORA.
Show her in.
#ELLEN.
And the doctor has just come, sir.
#HELMER.
Has he gone into my study?
#ELLEN.
Yes, sir.
#MRS. LINDEN.
How do you do, Nora?
#NORA.
How do you do?
#MRS. LINDEN.
I see you don’t recognise me.
#NORA.
No, I don’t think—oh yes!—I believe—— What, Christina! Is it really you?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes; really I!
#NORA.
Christina! And to think I didn’t know you! But how could I—— How changed you are, Christina!
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes, no doubt. In nine or ten years——
#NORA.
Is it really so long since we met? Yes, so it is. Oh, the last eight years have been a happy time, I can tell you. And now you have come to town? All that long journey in mid - winter! How brave of you!
#MRS. LINDEN.
I arrived by this morning’s steamer.
#NORA.
To have a merry Christmas, of course. Oh, how delightful! Yes, we will have a merry Christmas. Do take your things off. Aren’t you frozen? There; now we’ll sit cosily by the fire. No, you take the arm - chair; I shall sit in this rocking - chair. Yes, now I can see the dear old face again. It was only at the first glance——But you’re a little paler, Christina—and perhaps a little thinner.
#MRS. LINDEN.
And much, much older, Nora.
#NORA.
Yes, perhaps a little older—not much—ever so little. Oh, what a thoughtless wretch I am! Here I sit chattering on, and——Dear, dear Christina, can you forgive me!
#MRS. LINDEN.
What do you mean, Nora?
#NORA.
Poor Christina! I forgot: you are a widow.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes; my husband died three years ago.
#NORA.
I know, I know; I saw it in the papers. Oh, believe me, Christina, I did mean to write to you; but I kept putting it off, and something always came in the way.
#MRS. LINDEN.
I can quite understand that, Nora dear.
#NORA.
No, Christina; it was horrid of me. Oh, you poor darling! how much you must have gone through!—And he left you nothing?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Nothing.
#NORA.
And no children?
#MRS. LINDEN.
None.
#NORA.
Nothing, nothing at all?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Not even a sorrow or a longing to dwell upon.
#NORA.
My dear Christina, how is that possible?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Oh, it happens so sometimes, Nora.
#NORA.
So utterly alone! How dreadful that must be! I have three of the loveliest children. I can’t show them to you just now; they’re out with their nurse. But now you must tell me everything.
#MRS. LINDEN.
No, no; I want you to tell me——
#NORA.
No, you must begin; I won’t be egotistical to - day. To - day I’ll think only of you. Oh! but I must tell you one thing—perhaps you’ve heard of our great stroke of fortune?
#MRS. LINDEN.
No. What is it?
#NORA.
Only think! my husband has been made manager of the Joint Stock Bank.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Your husband! Oh, how fortunate!
#NORA.
Yes; isn’t it? A lawyer’s position is so uncertain, you see, especially when he won’t touch any business that’s the least bit—shady, as of course Torvald never would; and there I quite agree with him. Oh! you can imagine how glad we are. He is to enter on his new position at the New Year, and then he’ll have a large salary, and percentages. In future we shall be able to live quite differently—just as we please, in fact. Oh, Christina, I feel so lighthearted and happy! It’s delightful to have lots of money, and no need to worry about things, isn’t it?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes; at any rate it must be delightful to have what you need.
#NORA.
No, not only what you need, but heaps of money—heaps!
#MRS. LINDEN.
Nora, Nora, haven’t you learnt reason yet? In our schooldays you were a shocking little spendthrift.
#NORA.
Yes; that’s what Torvald says I am still. But “Nora, Nora” is not so silly as you all think. Oh! I haven’t had the chance to be much of a spendthrift. We have both had to work.
#MRS. LINDEN.
You too?
#NORA.
Yes, light fancy work: crochet, and embroidery, and things of that sort; and other work too. You know, of course, that Torvald left the Government service when we were married. He had little chance of promotion, and of course he required to make more money. But in the first year after our marriage he overworked himself terribly. He had to undertake all sorts of extra work, you know, and to slave early and late. He couldn’t stand it, and fell dangerously ill. Then the doctors declared he must go to the South.
#MRS. LINDEN.
You spent a whole year in Italy, didn’t you?
#NORA.
Yes, we did. It wasn’t easy to manage, I can tell you. It was just after Ivar’s birth. But of course we had to go. Oh, it was a wonderful, delicious journey! And it saved Torvald’s life. But it cost a frightful lot of money, Christina.
#MRS. LINDEN.
So I should think.
#NORA.
Twelve hundred dollars! Four thousand eight hundred crowns! Isn’t that a lot of money?
#MRS. LINDEN.
How lucky you had the money to spend!
#NORA.
We got it from father, you must know.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Ah, I see. He died just about that time, didn’t he?
#NORA.
Yes, Christina, just then. And only think! I couldn’t go and nurse him! I was expecting little Ivar’s birth daily; and then I had my poor sick Torvald to attend to. Dear, kind old father! I never saw him again, Christina. Oh! that’s the hardest thing I have had to bear since my marriage.
#MRS. LINDEN.
I know how fond you were of him. But then you went to Italy?
#NORA.
Yes; you see, we had the money, and the doctors said we must lose no time. We started a month later.
#MRS. LINDEN.
And your husband came back completely cured.
#NORA.
Sound as a bell.
#MRS. LINDEN.
But—the doctor?
#NORA.
What do you mean?
#MRS. LINDEN.
I thought as I came in your servant announced the doctor——
#NORA.
Oh, yes; Doctor Rank. But he doesn’t come professionally. He is our best friend, and never lets a day pass without looking in. No, Torvald hasn’t had an hour’s illness since that time. And the children are so healthy and well, and so am I. Oh, Christina, Christina, what a wonderful thing it is to live and to be happy!—Oh, but it’s really too horrid of me! Here am I talking about nothing but my own concerns. Oh, don’t be angry with me! Now tell me, is it really true that you didn’t love your husband? What made you marry him, then?
#MRS. LINDEN.
My mother was still alive, you see, bedridden and helpless; and then I had my two younger brothers to think of. I didn’t think it would be right for me to refuse him.
#NORA.
Perhaps it wouldn’t have been. I suppose he was rich then?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Very well off, I believe. But his business was uncertain. It fell to pieces at his death, and there was nothing left.
#NORA.
And then——?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Then I had to fight my way by keeping a shop, a little school, anything I could turn my hand to. The last three years have been one long struggle for me. But now it is over, Nora. My poor mother no longer needs me; she is at rest. And the boys are in business, and can look after themselves.
#NORA.
How free your life must feel!
#MRS. LINDEN.
No, Nora; only inexpressibly empty. No one to live for! That’s why I could not bear to stay any longer in that out - of - the way corner. Here it must be easier to find something to take one up—to occupy one’s thoughts. If I could only get some settled employment—some office work.
#NORA.
But, Christina, that’s such drudgery, and you look worn out already. It would be ever so much better for you to go to some watering - place and rest.
#MRS. LINDEN.
I have no father to give me the money, Nora.
#NORA.
Oh, don’t be vexed with me.
#MRS. LINDEN.
My dear Nora, don’t you be vexed with me. The worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter. You have no one to work for, yet you have to be always on the strain. You must live; and so you become selfish. When I heard of the happy change in your fortunes—can you believe it?—I was glad for my own sake more than for yours.
#NORA.
How do you mean? Ah, I see! You think Torvald can perhaps do something for you.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes; I thought so.
#NORA.
And so he shall, Christina. Just you leave it all to me. I shall lead up to it beautifully!—I shall think of some delightful plan to put him in a good humour! Oh, I should so love to help you.
#MRS. LINDEN.
How good of you, Nora, to stand by me so warmly! Doubly good in you, who know so little of the troubles and burdens of life. I know so little of——?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Oh, well—a little fancy - work, and so forth.—You’re a child, Nora.
#NORA.
Oh, come, you mustn’t be so patronising!
#MRS. LINDEN.
No?
#NORA.
You’re like the rest. You all think I’m fit for nothing really serious——
#MRS. LINDEN.
Well, well——
#NORA.
You think I’ve had no troubles in this weary world.
#MRS. LINDEN.
My dear Nora, you’ve just told me all your troubles.
#NORA.
Pooh—those trifles! I haven’t told you the great thing.
#MRS. LINDEN.
The great thing? What do you mean?
#NORA.
I know you look down upon me, Christina; but you have no right to. You are proud of having worked so hard and so long for your mother.
#MRS. LINDEN.
I am sure I don’t look down upon any one; but it’s true I am both proud and glad when I remember that I was able to keep my mother’s last days free from care.
#NORA.
And you’re proud to think of what you have done for your brothers, too.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Have I not the right to be?
#NORA.
Yes indeed. But now let me tell you, Christina—I, too, have something to be proud and glad of.
#MRS. LINDEN.
I don’t doubt it. But what do you mean?
#NORA.
Hush! Not so loud. Only think, if Torvald were to hear! He mustn’t—not for worlds! No one must know about it, Christina—no one but you.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Why, what can it be?
#NORA.
Come over here. Yes, Christina—I, too, have something to be proud and glad of. I saved Torvald’s life.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Saved his life? How?
#NORA.
I told you about our going to Italy. Torvald would have died but for that.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Well—and your father gave you the money.
#NORA.
Yes, so Torvald and every one believes; but——
#MRS. LINDEN.
But——?
#NORA.
Papa didn’t give us one penny. It was I that found the money.
#MRS. LINDEN.
You? All that money?
#NORA.
Twelve hundred dollars. Four thousand eight hundred crowns. What do you say to that?
#MRS. LINDEN.
My dear Nora, how did you manage it? Did you win it in the lottery?
#NORA.
In the lottery? Pooh! Any one could have done that!
#MRS. LINDEN.
Then wherever did you get it from?
#NORA.
H’m; tra - la - la - la!
#MRS. LINDEN.
Of course you couldn’t borrow it.
#NORA.
No? Why not?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Why, a wife can’t borrow without her husband’s consent.
#NORA.
Oh! when the wife has some idea of business, and knows how to set about things——
#MRS. LINDEN.
But, Nora, I don’t understand——
#NORA.
Well, you needn’t. I never said I borrowed the money. There are many ways I may have got it. I may have got it from some admirer. When one is so—attractive as I am——
#MRS. LINDEN.
You’re too silly, Nora.
#NORA.
Now I’m sure you’re dying of curiosity, Christina——
#MRS. LINDEN.
Listen to me, Nora dear: haven’t you been a little rash?
#NORA.
Is it rash to save one’s husband’s life?
#MRS. LINDEN.
I think it was rash of you, without his knowledge——
#NORA.
But it would have been fatal for him to know! Can’t you understand that? He wasn’t even to suspect how ill he was. The doctors came to me privately and told me his life was in danger—that nothing could save him but a winter in the South. Do you think I didn’t try diplomacy first? I told him how I longed to have a trip abroad, like other young wives; I wept and prayed; I said he ought to think of my condition, and not to thwart me; and then I hinted that he could borrow the money. But then, Christina, he got almost angry. He said I was frivolous, and that it was his duty as a husband not to yield to my whims and fancies—so he called them. Very well, thought I, but saved you must be; and then I found the way to do it.
#MRS. LINDEN.
And did your husband never learn from your father that the money was not from him?
#NORA.
No; never. Papa died at that very time. I meant to have told him all about it, and begged him to say nothing. But he was so ill—unhappily, it wasn’t necessary.
#MRS. LINDEN.
And you have never confessed to your husband?
#NORA.
Good heavens! What can you be thinking of? Tell him, when he has such a loathing of debt! And besides—how painful and humiliating it would be for Torvald, with his manly self - respect, to know that he owed anything to me! It would utterly upset the relation between us; our beautiful, happy home would never again be what it is.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Will you never tell him?
#NORA.
Yes, some time perhaps—many, many years hence, when I’m—not so pretty. You mustn’t laugh at me! Of course I mean when Torvald is not so much in love with me as he is now; when it doesn’t amuse him any longer to see me dancing about, and dressing up and acting. Then it might be well to have something in reserve. Nonsense! nonsense! That time will never come. Now, what do you say to my grand secret, Christina? Am I fit for nothing now? You may believe it has cost me a lot of anxiety. It has been no joke to meet my engagements punctually. You must know, Christina, that in business there are things called instalments, and quarterly interest, that are terribly hard to provide for. So I’ve had to pinch a little here and there, wherever I could. I couldn’t save much out of the housekeeping, for of course Torvald had to live well. And I couldn’t let the children go about badly dressed; all I got for them, I spent on them, the blessed darlings!
#MRS. LINDEN.
Poor Nora! So it had to come out of your own pocket - money.
#NORA.
Yes, of course. After all, the whole thing was my doing. When Torvald gave me money for clothes, and so on, I never spent more than half of it; I always bought the simplest and cheapest things. It’s a mercy that everything suits me so well—Torvald never had any suspicions. But it was often very hard, Christina dear. For it’s nice to be beautifully dressed—now, isn’t it?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Indeed it is.
#NORA.
Well, and besides that, I made money in other ways. Last winter I was so lucky—I got a heap of copying to do. I shut myself up every evening and wrote far into the night. Oh, sometimes I was so tired, so tired. And yet it was splendid to work in that way and earn money. I almost felt as if I was a man.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Then how much have you been able to pay off?
#NORA.
Well, I can’t precisely say. It’s difficult to keep that sort of business clear. I only know that I’ve paid everything I could scrape together. Sometimes I really didn’t know where to turn. Then I used to sit here and pretend that a rich old gentleman was in love with me——
#MRS. LINDEN.
What! What gentleman?
#NORA.
Oh, nobody!—that he was dead now, and that when his will was opened, there stood in large letters: “Pay over at once everything of which I die possessed to that charming person, Mrs. Nora Helmer.”
#MRS. LINDEN.
But, my dear Nora—what gentleman do you mean?
#NORA.
Oh dear, can’t you understand? There wasn’t any old gentleman: it was only what I used to dream and dream when I was at my wits’ end for money. But it doesn’t matter now—the tiresome old creature may stay where he is for me. I care nothing for him or his will; for now my troubles are over. Oh, Christina, how glorious it is to think of! Free from all anxiety! Free, quite free. To be able to play and romp about with the children; to have things tasteful and pretty in the house, exactly as Torvald likes it! And then the spring will soon be here, with the great blue sky. Perhaps then we shall have a little holiday. Perhaps I shall see the sea again. Oh, what a wonderful thing it is to live and to be happy!
#MRS. LINDEN.
There’s a ring. Perhaps I had better go.
#NORA.
No; do stay. No one will come here. It’s sure to be some one for Torvald.
#ELLEN.
If you please, ma’am, there’s a gentleman to speak to Mr. Helmer.
#NORA.
Who is the gentleman?
#KROGSTAD.
It is I, Mrs. Helmer.
#NORA.
You? What is it? What do you want with my husband?
#KROGSTAD.
Bank business—in a way. I hold a small post in the Joint Stock Bank, and your husband is to be our new chief, I hear.
#NORA.
Then it is——?
#KROGSTAD.
Only tiresome business, Mrs. Helmer; nothing more.
#NORA.
Then will you please go to his study.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Nora—who was that man? Mr. Krogstad—a lawyer.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Then it was really he?
#NORA.
Do you know him?
#MRS. LINDEN.
I used to know him—many years ago. He was in a lawyer’s office in our town.
#NORA.
Yes, so he was.
#MRS. LINDEN.
How he has changed!
#NORA.
I believe his marriage was unhappy.
#MRS. LINDEN.
And he is a widower now?
#NORA.
With a lot of children. There! Now it will burn up.
#MRS. LINDEN.
His business is not of the most creditable, they say?
#NORA.
Isn’t it? I daresay not. I don’t know. But don’t let us think of business—it’s so tiresome.
#DR. RANK.
No, no; I’m in your way. I shall go and have a chat with your wife. Oh, I beg your pardon. I’m in the way here too.
#NORA.
No, not in the least. Doctor Rank—Mrs. Linden.
#DR. RANK.
Oh, indeed; I’ve often heard Mrs. Linden’s name; I think I passed you on the stairs as I came up.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes; I go so very slowly. Stairs try me so much.
#DR. RANK.
Ah—you are not very strong?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Only overworked.
#DR. RANK.
Nothing more? Then no doubt you’ve come to town to find rest in a round of dissipation?
#MRS. LINDEN.
I have come to look for employment.
#DR. RANK.
Is that an approved remedy for overwork?
#MRS. LINDEN.
One must live, Doctor Rank.
#DR. RANK.
Yes, that seems to be the general opinion.
#NORA.
Come, Doctor Rank—you want to live yourself.
#DR. RANK.
To be sure I do. However wretched I may be, I want to drag on as long as possible. All my patients, too, have the same mania. And it’s the same with people whose complaint is moral. At this very moment Helmer is talking to just such a moral incurable——
#MRS. LINDEN.
Ah!
#NORA.
Whom do you mean?
#DR. RANK.
Oh, a fellow named Krogstad, a man you know nothing about—corrupt to the very core of his character. But even he began by announcing, as a matter of vast importance, that he must live.
#NORA.
Indeed? And what did he want with Torvald?
#DR. RANK.
I haven’t an idea; I only gathered that it was some bank business.
#NORA.
I didn’t know that Krog—that this Mr. Krogstad had anything to do with the Bank?
#DR. RANK.
Yes. He has got some sort of place there. I don’t know whether, in your part of the country, you have people who go grubbing and sniffing around in search of moral rottenness—and then, when they have found a “case,” don’t rest till they have got their man into some good position, where they can keep a watch upon him. Men with a clean bill of health they leave out in the cold.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Well, I suppose the—delicate characters require most care.
#DR. RANK.
There we have it! It’s that notion that makes society a hospital.
#DR. RANK.
Why do you laugh at that? Have you any idea what “society” is?
#NORA.
What do I care for your tiresome society? I was laughing at something else—something excessively amusing. Tell me, Doctor Rank, are all the employees at the Bank dependent on Torvald now?
#DR. RANK.
Is that what strikes you as excessively amusing?
#NORA.
Never mind, never mind! Yes, it is funny to think that we—that Torvald has such power over so many people. Doctor Rank, will you have a macaroon?
#DR. RANK.
What!—macaroons! I thought they were contraband here.
#NORA.
Yes; but Christina brought me these. Mrs. Linden. What! I——?
#NORA.
Oh, well! Don’t be frightened. You couldn’t possibly know that Torvald had forbidden them. The fact is, he’s afraid of me spoiling my teeth. But, oh bother, just for once!—That’s for you, Doctor Rank! And you too, Christina. And I’ll have one while we’re about it—only a tiny one, or at most two. Oh dear, I am happy! There’s only one thing in the world I really want.
#DR. RANK.
Well; what’s that?
#NORA.
There’s something I should so like to say—in Torvald’s hearing.
#DR. RANK.
Then why don’t you say it?
#NORA.
Because I daren’t, it’s so ugly.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Ugly?
#DR. RANK.
In that case you’d better not. But to us you might——What is it you would so like to say in Helmer’s hearing?
#NORA.
I should so love to say “Damn it all!”
#DR. RANK.
Are you out of your mind?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Good gracious, Nora——! Say it—there he is!
#NORA.
Hush—sh—sh
#NORA.
Well, Torvald dear, have you got rid of him?
#HELMER.
Yes; he has just gone.
#NORA.
Let me introduce you—this is Christina, who has come to town——
#HELMER.
Christina? Pardon me, I don’t know——
#NORA.
Mrs. Linden, Torvald dear—Christina Linden.
#HELMER.
Indeed! A school - friend of my wife’s, no doubt?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes; we knew each other as girls.
#NORA.
And only think! she has taken this long journey on purpose to speak to you.
#HELMER.
To speak to me!
#MRS. LINDEN.
Well, not quite——
#NORA.
You see, Christina is tremendously clever at office - work, and she’s so anxious to work under a first - rate man of business in order to learn still more——
#HELMER.
Very sensible indeed.
#NORA.
And when she heard you were appointed manager—it was telegraphed, you know—she started off at once, and——Torvald, dear, for my sake, you must do something for Christina. Now can’t you?
#HELMER.
It’s not impossible. I presume Mrs. Linden is a widow?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes.
#HELMER.
And you have already had some experience of business?
#MRS. LINDEN.
good deal.
#HELMER.
Well, then, it’s very likely I may be able to find a place for you.
#NORA.
There now! There now!
#HELMER.
You have come at a fortunate moment, Mrs. Linden.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Oh, how can I thank you——?
#HELMER.
There is no occasion. But for the present you must excuse me——
#DR. RANK.
Wait; I am going with you.
#NORA.
Don’t be long, Torvald dear.
#HELMER.
Only an hour; not more.
#NORA.
Are you going too, Christina?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes; I must set about looking for lodgings.
#HELMER.
Then perhaps we can go together?
#NORA.
What a pity we haven’t a spare room for you; but it’s impossible——
#MRS. LINDEN.
I shouldn’t think of troubling you. Good - bye, dear Nora, and thank you for all your kindness.
#NORA.
Good - bye for the present. Of course you’ll come back this evening. And you, too, Doctor Rank. What! If you’re well enough? Of course you’ll be well enough. Only wrap up warmly. There they are! There they are! Come in! Come in! Oh, my sweet darlings! Do you see them, Christina? Aren’t they lovely?
#DR. RANK.
Don’t let us stand here chattering in the draught.
#HELMER.
Come, Mrs. Linden; only mothers can stand such a temperature.
#NORA.
How fresh and bright you look! And what red cheeks you’ve got! Like apples and roses. Have you had great fun? That’s splendid! Oh, really! You’ve been giving Emmy and Bob a ride on your sledge!—both at once, only think! Why, you’re quite a man, Ivar. Oh, give her to me a little, Anna. My sweet little dolly! Yes, yes; mother will dance with Bob too. What! Did you have a game of snowballs? Oh, I wish I’d been there. No; leave them, Anna; I’ll take their things off. Oh, yes, let me do it; it’s such fun. Go to the nursery; you look frozen. You’ll find some hot coffee on the stove. Really! A big dog ran after you? But he didn’t bite you? No; dogs don’t bite dear little dolly children. Don’t peep into those parcels, Ivar. What is it? Wouldn’t you like to know? Take care—it’ll bite! What? Shall we have a game? What shall we play at? Hide - and - seek? Yes, let’s play hide - and - seek. Bob shall hide first. Am I to? Yes, let me hide first.
#KROGSTAD.
I beg your pardon, Mrs. Helmer——
#NORA.
Ah! What do you want?
#KROGSTAD.
Excuse me; the outer door was ajar—somebody must have forgotten to shut it——
#NORA.
My husband is not at home, Mr. Krogstad.
#KROGSTAD.
I know it.
#NORA.
Then what do you want here?
#KROGSTAD.
To say a few words to you.
#NORA.
To me? Go in to Anna. What? No, the strange man won’t hurt mamma. When he’s gone we’ll go on playing. It is to me you wish to speak?
#KROGSTAD.
Yes, to you.
#NORA.
To - day? But it’s not the first yet——
#KROGSTAD.
No, to - day is Christmas Eve. It will depend upon yourself whether you have a merry Christmas.
#NORA.
What do you want? I’m not ready to - day——
#KROGSTAD.
Never mind that just now. I have come about another matter. You have a minute to spare?
#NORA.
Oh, yes, I suppose so; although——
#KROGSTAD.
Good. I was sitting in the restaurant opposite, and I saw your husband go down the street——
#NORA.
Well?
#KROGSTAD.
——with a lady
#NORA.
What then?
#KROGSTAD.
May I ask if the lady was a Mrs. Linden?
#NORA.
Yes.
#KROGSTAD.
Who has just come to town?
#NORA.
Yes. To - day.
#KROGSTAD.
I believe she is an intimate friend of yours?
#NORA.
Certainly. But I don’t understand——
#KROGSTAD.
I used to know her too.
#NORA.
I know you did.
#KROGSTAD.
Ah! You know all about it. I thought as much. Now, frankly, is Mrs. Linden to have a place in the Bank?
#NORA.
How dare you catechise me in this way, Mr. Krogstad—you, a subordinate of my husband’s? But since you ask, you shall know. Yes, Mrs. Linden is to be employed. And it is I who recommended her, Mr. Krogstad. Now you know.
#KROGSTAD.
Then my guess was right.
#NORA.
You see one has a wee bit of influence, after all. It doesn’t follow because one’s only a woman——When people are in a subordinate position, Mr. Krogstad, they ought really to be careful how they offend anybody who—h’m——
#KROGSTAD.
——who has influence?
#NORA.
Exactly.
#KROGSTAD.
Mrs. Helmer, will you have the kindness to employ your influence on my behalf?
#NORA.
What? How do you mean?
#KROGSTAD.
Will you be so good as to see that I retain my subordinate position in the Bank?
#NORA.
What do you mean? Who wants to take it from you?
#KROGSTAD.
Oh, you needn’t pretend ignorance. I can very well understand that it cannot be pleasant for your friend to meet me; and I can also understand now for whose sake I am to be hounded out.
#NORA.
But I assure you——
#KROGSTAD.
Come come now, once for all: there is time yet, and I advise you to use your influence to prevent it.
#NORA.
But, Mr. Krogstad, I have no influence—absolutely none.
#KROGSTAD.
None? I thought you said a moment ago——
#NORA.
Of course not in that sense. I! How can you imagine that I should have any such influence over my husband?
#KROGSTAD.
Oh, I know your husband from our college days. I don’t think he is any more inflexible than other husbands.
#NORA.
If you talk disrespectfully of my husband, I must request you to leave the house.
#KROGSTAD.
You are bold, madam.
#NORA.
I am afraid of you no longer. When New Year’s Day is over, I shall soon be out of the whole business.
#KROGSTAD.
Listen to me, Mrs. Helmer. If need be, I shall fight as though for my life to keep my little place in the Bank.
#NORA.
Yes, so it seems.
#KROGSTAD.
It’s not only for the salary: that is what I care least about. It’s something else——Well, I had better make a clean breast of it. Of course you know, like every one else, that some years ago I—got into trouble.
#NORA.
I think I’ve heard something of the sort.
#KROGSTAD.
The matter never came into court; but from that moment all paths were barred to me. Then I took up the business you know about. I had to turn my hand to something; and I don’t think I’ve been one of the worst. But now I must get clear of it all. My sons are growing up; for their sake I must try to recover my character as well as I can. This place in the Bank was the first step; and now your husband wants to kick me off the ladder, back into the mire.
#NORA.
But I assure you, Mr. Krogstad, I haven’t the least power to help you.
#KROGSTAD.
That is because you have not the will; but I can compel you.
#NORA.
You won’t tell my husband that I owe you money?
#KROGSTAD.
H’m; suppose I were to?
#NORA.
It would be shameful of you. The secret that is my joy and my pride—that he should learn it in such an ugly, coarse way—and from you. It would involve me in all sorts of unpleasantness——
#KROGSTAD.
Only unpleasantness.
#NORA.
But just do it. It’s you that will come off worst, for then my husband will see what a bad man you are, and then you certainly won’t keep your place.
#KROGSTAD.
I asked whether it was only domestic unpleasantness you feared?
#NORA.
If my husband gets to know about it, he will of course pay you off at once, and then we shall have nothing more to do with you.
#KROGSTAD.
Listen, Mrs. Helmer: either your memory is defective, or you don’t know much about business. I must make the position a little clearer to you.
#NORA.
How so?
#KROGSTAD.
When your husband was ill, you came to me to borrow twelve hundred dollars.
#NORA.
I knew of nobody else.
#KROGSTAD.
I promised to find you the money——
#NORA.
And you did find it.
#KROGSTAD.
I promised to find you the money, on certain conditions. You were so much taken up at the time about your husband’s illness, and so eager to have the wherewithal for your journey, that you probably did not give much thought to the details. Allow me to remind you of them. I promised to find you the amount in exchange for a note of hand, which I drew up.
#NORA.
Yes, and I signed it.
#KROGSTAD.
Quite right. But then I added a few lines, making your father security for the debt. Your father was to sign this.
#NORA.
Was to——? He did sign it!
#KROGSTAD.
I had left the date blank. That is to say, your father was himself to date his signature. Do you recollect that?
#NORA.
Yes, I believe——
#KROGSTAD.
Then I gave you the paper to send to your father, by post. Is not that so?
#NORA.
Yes.
#KROGSTAD.
And of course you did so at once; for within five or six days you brought me back the document with your father’s signature; and I handed you the money.
#NORA.
Well? Have I not made my payments punctually?
#KROGSTAD.
Fairly—yes. But to return to the point: You were in great trouble at the time, Mrs. Helmer.
#NORA.
I was indeed!
#KROGSTAD.
Your father was very ill, I believe?
#NORA.
He was on his death - bed.
#KROGSTAD.
And died soon after?
#NORA.
Yes.
#KROGSTAD.
Tell me, Mrs. Helmer: do you happen to recollect the day of his death? The day of the month, I mean?
#NORA.
Father died on the 29th of September.
#KROGSTAD.
Quite correct. I have made inquiries. And here comes in the remarkable point— which I cannot explain.
#NORA.
What remarkable point? I don’t know——
#KROGSTAD.
The remarkable point, madam, that your father signed this paper three days after his death!
#NORA.
What! I don’t understand——
#KROGSTAD.
Your father died on the 29th of September. But look here: he has dated his signature October 2nd! Is not that remarkable, Mrs. Helmer? Can you explain it? It is noteworthy, too, that the words “October 2nd” and the year are not in your father’s handwriting, but in one which I believe I know. Well, this may be explained; your father may have forgotten to date his signature, and somebody may have added the date at random, before the fact of your father’s death was known. There is nothing wrong in that. Everything depends on the signature. Of course it is genuine, Mrs. Helmer? It was really your father himself who wrote his name here?
#NORA.
No, it was not. I wrote father’s name.
#KROGSTAD.
Ah!—Are you aware, madam, that that is a dangerous admission?
#NORA.
How so? You will soon get your money.
#KROGSTAD.
May I ask you one more question? Why did you not send the paper to your father?
#NORA.
It was impossible. Father was ill. If I had asked him for his signature, I should have had to tell him why I wanted the money; but he was so ill I really could not tell him that my husband’s life was in danger. It was impossible.
#KROGSTAD.
Then it would have been better to have given up your tour.
#NORA.
No, I couldn’t do that; my husband’s life depended on that journey. I couldn’t give it up.
#KROGSTAD.
And did it never occur to you that you were playing me false?
#NORA.
That was nothing to me. I didn’t care in the least about you. I couldn’t endure you for all the cruel difficulties you made, although you knew how ill my husband was.
#KROGSTAD.
Mrs. Helmer, you evidently do not realise what you have been guilty of. But I can assure you it was nothing more and nothing worse that made me an outcast from society.
#NORA.
You! You want me to believe that you did a brave thing to save your wife’s life?
#KROGSTAD.
The law takes no account of motives.
#NORA.
Then it must be a very bad law.
#KROGSTAD.
Bad or not, if I produce this document in court, you will be condemned according to law.
#NORA.
I don’t believe that. Do you mean to tell me that a daughter has no right to spare her dying father trouble and anxiety?—that a wife has no right to save her husband’s life? I don’t know much about the law, but I’m sure you’ll find, somewhere or another, that that is allowed. And you don’t know that—you, a lawyer! You must be a bad one, Mr. Krogstad.
#KROGSTAD.
Possibly. But business—such business as ours—I do understand. You believe that? Very well; now do as you please. But this I may tell you, that if I am flung into the gutter a second time, you shall keep me company.
#NORA.
Oh nonsense! He wants to frighten me. I’m not so foolish as that. But——? No, it’s impossible! Why, I did it for love!
#CHILDREN.
Mamma, the strange man has gone now.
#NORA.
Yes, yes, I know. But don’t tell any one about the strange man. Do you hear? Not even papa!
#CHILDREN.
No, mamma; and now will you play with us again?
#NORA.
No, no; not now.
#CHILDREN.
Oh, do, mamma; you know you promised.
#NORA.
Yes, but I can’t just now. Run to the nursery; I have so much to do. Run along, run along, and be good, my darlings! No! Ellen, bring in the Christmas - tree! No, it’s quite impossible!
#ELLEN.
Where shall I stand it, ma’am?
#NORA.
There, in the middle of the room.
#ELLEN.
Shall I bring in anything else?
#NORA.
No, thank you, I have all I want.
#NORA.
There must be a candle here—and flowers there.—That horrible man! Nonsense, nonsense! there’s nothing to be afraid of. The Christmas - tree shall be beautiful. I’ll do everything to please you, Torvald; I’ll sing and dance, and——
#NORA.
Oh! You’re back already?
#HELMER.
Yes. Has anybody been here?
#NORA.
Here? No.
#HELMER.
That’s odd. I saw Krogstad come out of the house.
#NORA.
Did you? Oh, yes, by - the - bye, he was here for a minute.
#HELMER.
Nora, I can see by your manner that he has been begging you to put in a good word for him.
#NORA.
Yes.
#HELMER.
And you were to do it as if of your own accord? You were to say nothing to me of his having been here. Didn’t he suggest that too?
#NORA.
Yes, Torvald; but——
#HELMER.
Nora, Nora! And you could condescend to that! To speak to such a man, to make him a promise! And then to tell me an untruth about it!
#NORA.
An untruth!
#HELMER.
Didn’t you say that nobody had been here? My little bird must never do that again! A song - bird must sing clear and true; no false notes. That’s so, isn’t it? Yes, I was sure of it. And now we’ll say no more about it. Oh, how cosy and quiet it is here!
#NORA.
Torvald!
#HELMER.
Yes.
#NORA.
I’m looking forward so much to the Stenborgs’ fancy ball the day after to - morrow.
#HELMER.
And I’m on tenterhooks to see what surprise you have in store for me.
#NORA.
Oh, it’s too tiresome!
#HELMER.
What is?
#NORA.
I can’t think of anything good. Everything seems so foolish and meaningless.
#HELMER.
Has little Nora made that discovery?
#NORA.
Are you very busy, Torvald?
#HELMER.
Well——
#NORA.
What papers are those?
#HELMER.
Bank business.
#NORA.
Already!
#HELMER.
I have got the retiring manager to let me make some necessary changes in the staff and the organization. I can do this during Christmas week. I want to have everything straight by the New Year.
#NORA.
Then that’s why that poor Krogstad——
#HELMER.
H’m.
#NORA.
If you hadn’t been so very busy, I should have asked you a great, great favour, Torvald.
#HELMER.
What can it be? Out with it.
#NORA.
Nobody has such perfect taste as you; and I should so love to look well at the fancy ball. Torvald, dear, couldn’t you take me in hand, and settle what I’m to be, and arrange my costume for me?
#HELMER.
Aha! So my wilful little woman is at a loss, and making signals of distress.
#NORA.
Yes, please, Torvald. I can’t get on without your help.
#HELMER.
Well, well, I’ll think it over, and we’ll soon hit upon something.
#NORA.
Oh, how good that is of you! How well the red flowers show.—Tell me, was it anything so very dreadful this Krogstad got into trouble about?
#HELMER.
Forgery, that’s all. Don’t you know what that means?
#NORA.
Mayn’t he have been driven to it by need?
#HELMER.
Yes; or, like so many others, he may have done it in pure heedlessness. I am not so hard - hearted as to condemn a man absolutely for a single fault.
#NORA.
No, surely not, Torvald!
#HELMER.
Many a man can retrieve his character, if he owns his crime and takes the punishment.
#NORA.
Punishment——?
#HELMER.
But Krogstad didn’t do that. He evaded the law by means of tricks and subterfuges; and that is what has morally ruined him.
#NORA.
Do you think that——?
#HELMER.
Just think how a man with a thing of that sort on his conscience must be always lying and canting and shamming. Think of the mask he must wear even towards those who stand nearest him—towards his own wife and children. The effect on the children—that’s the most terrible part of it, Nora.
#NORA.
Why?
#HELMER.
Because in such an atmosphere of lies home life is poisoned and contaminated in every fibre. Every breath the children draw contains some germ of evil.
#NORA.
Are you sure of that?
#HELMER.
As a lawyer, my dear, I have seen it often enough. Nearly all cases of early corruption may be traced to lying mothers.
#NORA.
Why—mothers?
#HELMER.
It generally comes from the mother’s side; but of course the father’s influence may act in the same way. Every lawyer knows it too well. And here has this Krogstad been poisoning his own children for years past by a life of lies and hypocrisy—that is why I call him morally ruined. So my sweet little Nora must promise not to plead his cause. Shake hands upon it. Come, come, what’s this? Give me your hand. That’s right. Then it’s a bargain. I assure you it would have been impossible for me to work with him. It gives me a positive sense of physical discomfort to come in contact with such people.
#NORA.
How warm it is here. And I have so much to do.
#HELMER.
Yes, and I must try to get some of these papers looked through before dinner. And I shall think over your costume too. Perhaps I may even find something to hang in gilt paper on the Christmas - tree. My precious little song - bird!
#NORA.
It can’t be. It’s impossible. It must be impossible!
#ANNA.
T
#NORA.
No, no, no; don’t let them come to me! Keep them with you, Anna.
#ANNA.
Very well, ma’am.
#NORA.
Corrupt my children!—Poison my home! It’s not true! It can never, never be true! - Footnote 5: About sixpence. There are 100 öre in a krone or crown, which is worth thirteenpence halfpenny. Footnote 6: “Spillefugl,” literally “playbird,” means a gambler. Footnote 7: The dollar was the old unit of currency in Norway. The crown was substituted for it shortly before the date of this play. Footnote 8: “Död og pine,” literally “death and torture”; but by usage a comparatively mild oath.
#NORA.
There’s somebody coming! Nobody; of course nobody will come to - day, Christmas - day; nor to - morrow either. But perhaps———No, nothing in the letter - box; quite empty. Stuff and nonsense! Of course he won’t really do anything. Such a thing couldn’t happen. It’s impossible! Why, I have three little children.
#ANNA.
I’ve found the box with the fancy dress at last.
#NORA.
Thanks; put it down on the table.
#ANNA.
But I’m afraid it’s very much out of order.
#NORA.
Oh, I wish I could tear it into a hundred thousand pieces!
#ANNA.
Oh, no. It can easily be put to rights—just a little patience.
#NORA.
I shall go and get Mrs. Linden to help me.
#ANNA.
Going out again? In such weather as this! You’ll catch cold, ma’am, and be ill.
#NORA.
Worse things might happen.—What are the children doing?
#ANNA.
They’re playing with their Christmas presents, poor little dears; but——
#NORA.
Do they often ask for me?
#ANNA.
You see they’ve been so used to having their mamma with them.
#NORA.
Yes; but, Anna, I can’t have them so much with me in future.
#ANNA.
Well, little children get used to anything.
#NORA.
Do you think they do? Do you believe they would forget their mother if she went quite away?
#ANNA.
Gracious me! Quite away?
#NORA.
Tell me, Anna—I’ve so often wondered about it—how could you bring yourself to give your child up to strangers?
#ANNA.
I had to when I came to nurse my little Miss Nora.
#NORA.
But how could you make up your mind to it?
#ANNA.
When I had the chance of such a good place? A poor girl who’s been in trouble must take what comes. That wicked man did nothing for me.
#NORA.
But your daughter must have forgotten you.
#ANNA.
Oh, no, ma’am, that she hasn’t. She wrote to me both when she was confirmed and when she was married.
#NORA.
Dear old Anna—you were a good mother to me when I was little.
#ANNA.
My poor little Nora had no mother but me.
#NORA.
And if my little ones had nobody else, I’m sure you would——Nonsense, nonsense! Go in to the children. Now I must——You’ll see how lovely I shall be to - morrow.
#ANNA.
I’m sure there will be no one at the ball so lovely as my Miss Nora.
#NORA.
Oh, if I dared go out. If only nobody would come. If only nothing would happen here in the meantime. Rubbish; nobody is coming. Only not to think. What a delicious muff! Beautiful gloves, beautiful gloves! To forget—to forget! One, two, three, four, five, six—— Ah, there they come.
#NORA.
Oh, it’s you, Christina. There’s nobody else there? I’m so glad you have come.
#MRS. LINDEN.
I hear you called at my lodgings.
#NORA.
Yes, I was just passing. There’s something you must help me with. Let us sit here on the sofa—so. To - morrow evening there’s to be a fancy ball at Consul Stenborg’s overhead, and Torvald wants me to appear as a Neapolitan fisher - girl, and dance the tarantella; I learned it at Capri.
#MRS. LINDEN.
I see—quite a performance.
#NORA.
Yes, Torvald wishes it. Look, this is the costume; Torvald had it made for me in Italy. But now it’s all so torn, I don’t know——
#MRS. LINDEN.
Oh, we shall soon set that to rights. It’s only the trimming that has come loose here and there. Have you a needle and thread? Ah, here’s the very thing.
#NORA.
Oh, how kind of you.
#MRS. LINDEN.
So you’re to be in costume to - morrow, Nora? I’ll tell you what—I shall come in for a moment to see you in all your glory. But I’ve quite forgotten to thank you for the pleasant evening yesterday.
#NORA.
Oh, yesterday, it didn’t seem so pleasant as usual.—You should have come to town a little sooner, Christina.—Torvald has certainly the art of making home bright and beautiful.
#MRS. LINDEN.
You too, I should think, or you wouldn’t be your father’s daughter. But tell me—is Doctor Rank always so depressed as he was last evening?
#NORA.
No, yesterday it was particularly noticeable. You see, he suffers from a dreadful illness. He has spinal consumption, poor fellow. They say his father was a horrible man, who kept mistresses and all sorts of things—so the son has been sickly from his childhood, you understand.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Why, my darling Nora, how do you come to know such things?
#NORA.
Oh, when one has three children, one sometimes has visits from women who are half—half doctors—and they talk of one thing and another.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Does Doctor Rank come here every day?
#NORA.
Every day of his life. He has been Torvald’s most intimate friend from boyhood, and he’s a good friend of mine too. Doctor Rank is quite one of the family.
#MRS. LINDEN.
But tell me—is he quite sincere? I mean, isn’t he rather given to flattering people?
#NORA.
No, quite the contrary. Why should you think so?
#MRS. LINDEN.
When you introduced us yesterday he said he had often heard my name; but I noticed afterwards that your husband had no notion who I was. How could Doctor Rank——?
#NORA.
He was quite right, Christina. You see, Torvald loves me so indescribably, he wants to have me all to himself, as he says. When we were first married he was almost jealous if I even mentioned any of my old friends at home; so naturally I gave up doing it. But I often talk of the old times to Doctor Rank, for he likes to hear about them.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Listen to me, Nora! You are still a child in many ways. I am older than you, and have had more experience. I’ll tell you something. You ought to get clear of all this with Dr. Rank.
#NORA.
Get clear of what?
#MRS. LINDEN.
The whole affair, I should say. You were talking yesterday of a rich admirer who was to find you money——
#NORA.
Yes, one who never existed, worse luck. What then?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Has Doctor Rank money?
#NORA.
Yes, he has.
#MRS. LINDEN.
And nobody to provide for?
#NORA.
Nobody. But——?
#MRS. LINDEN.
And he comes here every day?
#NORA.
Yes, I told you so.
#MRS. LINDEN.
I should have thought he would have had better taste.
#NORA.
I don’t understand you a bit.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Don’t pretend, Nora. Do you suppose I can’t guess who lent you the twelve hundred dollars?
#NORA.
Are you out of your senses? How can you think such a thing? A friend who comes here every day! Why, the position would be unbearable!
#MRS. LINDEN.
Then it really is not he?
#NORA.
No, I assure you. It never for a moment occurred to me——Besides, at that time he had nothing to lend; he came into his property afterwards.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Well, I believe that was lucky for you, Nora dear.
#NORA.
No, really, it would never have struck me to ask Dr. Rank——And yet, I’m certain that if I did——
#MRS. LINDEN.
But of course you never would.
#NORA.
Of course not. It’s inconceivable that it should ever be necessary. But I’m quite sure that if I spoke to Doctor Rank——
#MRS. LINDEN.
Behind your husband’s back?
#NORA.
I must get clear of the other thing; that’s behind his back too. I must get clear of that.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes, yes, I told you so yesterday; but——
#NORA.
A man can manage these things much better than a woman.
#MRS. LINDEN.
One’s own husband, yes.
#NORA.
Nonsense. When everything is paid, one gets back the paper.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Of course.
#NORA.
And can tear it into a hundred thousand pieces, and burn it up, the nasty, filthy thing!
#MRS. LINDEN.
Nora, you are hiding something from me.
#NORA.
Can you see it in my face?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Something has happened since yesterday morning. Nora, what is it?
#NORA.
Christina——! Hush! There’s Torvald coming home. Do you mind going into the nursery for the present? Torvald can’t bear to see dressmaking going on. Get Anna to help you.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Very well; but I shan’t go away until you have told me all about it.
#NORA.
Oh, how I’ve been longing for you to come, Torvald dear!
#HELMER.
Was that the dressmaker——?
#NORA.
No, Christina. She’s helping me with my costume. You’ll see how nice I shall look.
#HELMER.
Yes, wasn’t that a happy thought of mine?
#NORA.
Splendid! But isn’t it good of me, too, to have given in to you about the tarantella?
#HELMER.
Good of you! To give in to your own husband? Well well, you little madcap, I know you don’t mean it. But I won’t disturb you. I daresay you want to be “trying on.”
#NORA.
And you are going to work, I suppose?
#HELMER.
Yes. Look here. I’ve just come from the Bank——
#NORA.
Torvald.
#HELMER.
Yes?
#NORA.
If your little squirrel were to beg you for something so prettily——
#HELMER.
Well?
#NORA.
Would you do it?
#HELMER.
I must know first what it is.
#NORA.
The squirrel would skip about and play all sorts of tricks if you would only be nice and kind.
#HELMER.
Come, then, out with it.
#NORA.
Your lark would twitter from morning till night—— Oh, that she does in any case.
#NORA.
I’ll be an elf and dance in the moonlight for you, Torvald.
#HELMER.
Nora—you can’t mean what you were hinting at this morning?
#NORA.
Yes, Torvald, I beg and implore you!
#HELMER.
Have you really the courage to begin that again?
#NORA.
Yes, yes; for my sake, you must let Krogstad keep his place in the Bank.
#HELMER.
My dear Nora, it’s his place I intend for Mrs. Linden.
#NORA.
Yes, that’s so good of you. But instead of Krogstad, you could dismiss some other clerk.
#HELMER.
Why, this is incredible obstinacy! Because you have thoughtlessly promised to put in a word for him, I am to——!
#NORA.
It’s not that, Torvald. It’s for your own sake. This man writes for the most scurrilous newspapers; you said so yourself. He can do you no end of harm. I’m so terribly afraid of him——
#HELMER.
Ah, I understand; it’s old recollections that are frightening you.
#NORA.
What do you mean?
#HELMER.
Of course you’re thinking of your father.
#NORA.
Yes—yes, of course. Only think of the shameful slanders wicked people used to write about father. I believe they would have got him dismissed if you hadn’t been sent to look into the thing, and been kind to him, and helped him.
#HELMER.
My little Nora, between your father and me there is all the difference in the world. Your father was not altogether unimpeachable. I am; and I hope to remain so.
#NORA.
Oh, no one knows what wicked men may hit upon. We could live so quietly and happily now, in our cosy, peaceful home, you and I and the children, Torvald! That’s why I beg and implore you——
#HELMER.
And it is just by pleading his cause that you make it impossible for me to keep him. It’s already known at the Bank that I intend to dismiss Krogstad. If it were now reported that the new manager let himself be turned round his wife’s little finger——
#NORA.
What then?
#HELMER.
Oh, nothing, so long as a wilful woman can have her way——! I am to make myself a laughing - stock to the whole staff, and set people saying that I am open to all sorts of outside influence? Take my word for it, I should soon feel the consequences. And besides—there is one thing that makes Krogstad impossible for me to work with——
#NORA.
What thing?
#HELMER.
I could perhaps have overlooked his moral failings at a pinch——
#NORA.
Yes, couldn’t you, Torvald?
#HELMER.
And I hear he is good at his work. But the fact is, he was a college chum of mine—there was one of those rash friendships between us that one so often repents of later. I may as well confess it at once—he calls me by my Christian name; and he is tactless enough to do it even when others are present. He delights in putting on airs of familiarity—Torvald here, Torvald there! I assure you it’s most painful to me. He would make my position at the Bank perfectly unendurable.
#NORA.
Torvald, surely you’re not serious?
#HELMER.
No? Why not?
#NORA.
That’s such a petty reason.
#HELMER.
What! Petty! Do you consider me petty!
#NORA.
No, on the contrary, Torvald dear; and that’s just why——
#HELMER.
Never mind; you call my motives petty; then I must be petty too. Petty! Very well!—Now we’ll put an end to this, once for all. Ellen!
#NORA.
What do you want?
#HELMER.
To settle the thing. Here; take this letter; give it to a messenger. See that he takes it at once. The address is on it. Here’s the money.
#ELLEN.
Very well, sir.
#HELMER.
There, Madam Obstinacy.
#NORA.
Torvald—what was in the letter?
#HELMER.
Krogstad’s dismissal.
#NORA.
Call it back again, Torvald! There’s still time. Oh, Torvald, call it back again! For my sake, for your own, for the children’s sake! Do you hear, Torvald? Do it! You don’t know what that letter may bring upon us all.
#HELMER.
Too late.
#NORA.
Yes, too late.
#HELMER.
My dear Nora, I forgive your anxiety, though it’s anything but flattering to me. Why should you suppose that I would be afraid of a wretched scribbler’s spite? But I forgive you all the same, for it’s a proof of your great love for me. That’s as it should be, my own dear Nora. Let what will happen—when it comes to the pinch, I shall have strength and courage enough. You shall see: my shoulders are broad enough to bear the whole burden.
#NORA.
What do you mean by that?
#HELMER.
The whole burden, I say——
#NORA.
That you shall never, never do!
#HELMER.
Very well; then we’ll share it, Nora, as man and wife. That is how it should be. Are you satisfied now? Come, come, come, don’t look like a scared dove. It’s all nothing—foolish fancies.—Now you ought to play the tarantella through and practise with the tambourine. I shall sit in my inner room and shut both doors, so that I shall hear nothing. You can make as much noise as you please. And when Rank comes, just tell him where I’m to be found.
#NORA.
He would do it. Yes, he would do it. He would do it, in spite of all the world.—No, never that, never, never! Anything rather than that! Oh, for some way of escape! What shall I do——! Doctor Rank——!—Anything, anything, rather than——!
#NORA.
Good afternoon, Doctor Rank. I knew you by your ring. But you mustn’t go to Torvald now. I believe he’s busy.
#DR. RANK.
And you?
#NORA.
Oh, you know very well, I have always time for you.
#DR. RANK.
Thank you. I shall avail myself of your kindness as long as I can.
#NORA.
What do you mean? As long as you can?
#DR. RANK.
Yes. Does that frighten you?
#NORA.
I think it’s an odd expression. Do you expect anything to happen?
#DR. RANK.
Something I have long been prepared for; but I didn’t think it would come so soon.
#NORA.
What have you discovered? Doctor Rank, you must tell me!
#DR. RANK.
I am running down hill. There’s no help for it.
#NORA.
It’s you——?
#DR. RANK.
Who else should it be?—Why lie to one’s self? I am the most wretched of all my patients, Mrs. Helmer. In these last days I have been auditing my life - account—bankrupt! Perhaps before a month is over, I shall lie rotting in the churchyard.
#NORA.
Oh! What an ugly way to talk.
#DR. RANK.
The thing itself is so confoundedly ugly, you see. But the worst of it is, so many other ugly things have to be gone through first. There is only one last investigation to be made, and when that is over I shall know pretty certainly when the break - up will begin. There’s one thing I want to say to you: Helmer’s delicate nature shrinks so from all that is horrible: I will not have him in my sick - room——
#NORA.
But, Doctor Rank——
#DR. RANK.
I won’t have him, I say—not on any account! I shall lock my door against him.—As soon as I am quite certain of the worst, I shall send you my visiting - card with a black cross on it; and then you will know that the final horror has begun.
#NORA.
Why, you’re perfectly unreasonable to - day; and I did so want you to be in a really good humour.
#DR. RANK.
With death staring me in the face?—And to suffer thus for another’s sin! Where’s the justice of it? And in one way or another you can trace in every family some such inexorable retribution——
#NORA.
Nonsense, nonsense! Now cheer up!
#DR. RANK.
Well, after all, the whole thing’s only worth laughing at. My poor innocent spine must do penance for my father’s wild oats.
#NORA.
I suppose he was too fond of asparagus and Strasbourg pâté, wasn’t he?
#DR. RANK.
Yes; and truffles.
#NORA.
Yes, truffles, to be sure. And oysters, I believe?
#DR. RANK.
Yes, oysters; oysters, of course.
#NORA.
And then all the port and champagne! It’s sad that all these good things should attack the spine.
#DR. RANK.
Especially when the luckless spine attacked never had any good of them.
#NORA.
Ah, yes, that’s the worst of it.
#DR. RANK.
H’m——
#NORA.
Why did you smile?
#DR. RANK.
No; it was you that laughed.
#NORA.
No; it was you that smiled, Dr. Rank.
#DR. RANK.
I see you’re deeper than I thought.
#NORA.
I’m in such a crazy mood to - day.
#DR. RANK.
So it seems.
#NORA.
Dear, dear Doctor Rank, death shall not take you away from Torvald and me.
#DR. RANK.
Oh, you’ll easily get over the loss. The absent are soon forgotten.
#NORA.
Do you think so?
#DR. RANK.
People make fresh ties, and then——
#NORA.
Who make fresh ties?
#DR. RANK.
You and Helmer will, when I am gone. You yourself are taking time by the forelock, it seems to me. What was that Mrs. Linden doing here yesterday?
#NORA.
Oh!—you’re surely not jealous of poor Christina?
#DR. RANK.
Yes, I am. She will be my successor in this house. When I am out of the way, this woman will perhaps——
#NORA.
Hush! Not so loud! She’s in there.
#DR. RANK.
To - day as well? You see!
#NORA.
Only to put my costume in order—dear me, how unreasonable you are! Now do be good, Doctor Rank! To - morrow you shall see how beautifully I shall dance; and then you may fancy that I’m doing it all to please you—and of course Torvald as well. Doctor Rank, sit down here, and I’ll show you something.
#DR. RANK.
What is it?
#NORA.
Look here! Look!
#DR. RANK.
Silk stockings.
#NORA.
Flesh - coloured. Aren’t they lovely? It’s so dark here now; but to - morrow——No, no, no; you must only look at the feet. Oh, well, I suppose you may look at the rest too.
#DR. RANK.
H’m——
#NORA.
What are you looking so critical about? Do you think they won’t fit me?
#DR. RANK.
I can’t possibly give any competent opinion on that point.
#NORA.
For shame! Take that.
#DR. RANK.
And what other wonders am I to see?
#NORA.
You sha’n’t see anything more; for you don’t behave nicely.
#DR. RANK.
When I sit here gossiping with you, I can’t imagine—I simply cannot conceive—what would have become of me if I had never entered this house.
#NORA.
Yes, I think you do feel at home with us.
#DR. RANK.
And now to have to leave it all——
#NORA.
Nonsense. You sha’n’t leave us.
#DR. RANK.
And not to be able to leave behind the slightest token of gratitude; scarcely even a passing regret—nothing but an empty place, that can be filled by the first comer.
#NORA.
And if I were to ask you for——? No——
#DR. RANK.
For what?
#NORA.
For a great proof of your friendship.
#DR. RANK.
Yes—yes?
#NORA.
I mean—for a very, very great service——
#DR. RANK.
Would you really, for once, make me so happy?
#NORA.
Oh, you don’t know what it is.
#DR. RANK.
Then tell me.
#NORA.
No, I really can’t, Doctor Rank. It’s far, far too much—not only a service, but help and advice besides——
#DR. RANK.
So much the better. I can’t think what you can mean. But go on. Don’t you trust me?
#NORA.
As I trust no one else. I know you are my best and truest friend. So I will tell you. Well then, Doctor Rank, there is something you must help me to prevent. You know how deeply, how wonderfully Torvald loves me; he wouldn’t hesitate a moment to give his very life for my sake.
#DR. RANK.
Nora—do you think he is the only one who——?
#NORA.
Who——?
#DR. RANK.
Who would gladly give his life for you?
#NORA.
Oh!
#DR. RANK.
I have sworn that you shall know it before I—go. I shall never find a better opportunity.—Yes, Nora, now I have told you; and now you know that you can trust me as you can no one else.
#NORA.
Let me pass, please.
#DR. RANK.
Nora——
#NORA.
Ellen, bring the lamp. Oh dear, Doctor Rank, that was too bad of you.
#DR. RANK.
That I have loved you as deeply as—any one else? Was that too bad of me?
#NORA.
No, but that you should have told me so. It was so unnecessary——
#DR. RANK.
What do you mean? Did you know——?
#DR. RANK.
Nora—Mrs. Helmer—I ask you, did you know?
#NORA.
Oh, how can I tell what I knew or didn’t know? I really can’t say——How could you be so clumsy, Doctor Rank? It was all so nice!
#DR. RANK.
Well, at any rate, you know now that I am at your service, body and soul. And now, go on.
#NORA.
Go on—now?
#DR. RANK.
I beg you to tell me what you want.
#NORA.
I can tell you nothing now.
#DR. RANK.
Yes, yes! You mustn’t punish me in that way. Let me do for you whatever a man can.
#NORA.
You can do nothing for me now.—Besides, I really want no help. You shall see it was only my fancy. Yes, it must be so. Of course! You are a nice person, Doctor Rank! Aren’t you ashamed of yourself, now that the lamp is on the table?
#DR. RANK.
No; not exactly. But perhaps I ought to go—for ever.
#NORA.
No, indeed you mustn’t. Of course you must come and go as you’ve always done. You know very well that Torvald can’t do without you.
#DR. RANK.
Yes, but you?
#NORA.
Oh, you know I always like to have you here.
#DR. RANK.
That is just what led me astray. You are a riddle to me. It has often seemed to me as if you liked being with me almost as much as being with Helmer.
#NORA.
Yes; don’t you see? There are people one loves, and others one likes to talk to.
#DR. RANK.
Yes—there’s something in that.
#NORA.
When I was a girl, of course I loved papa best. But it always delighted me to steal into the servants’ room. In the first place they never lectured me, and in the second it was such fun to hear them talk.
#DR. RANK.
Ah, I see; then it’s their place I have taken?
#NORA.
Oh, my dear Doctor Rank, I don’t mean that. But you understand, with Torvald it’s the same as with papa——
#ELLEN.
Please, ma’am——
#NORA.
Ah!
#DR. RANK.
Anything wrong?
#NORA.
No, no, not in the least. It’s only—it’s my new costume——
#DR. RANK.
Your costume. Why, it’s there.
#NORA.
Oh, that one, yes. But this is another that—I have ordered it—Torvald mustn’t know——
#DR. RANK.
Aha! So that’s the great secret.
#NORA.
Yes, of course. Please go to him; he’s in the inner room. Do keep him while I——
#DR. RANK.
Don’t be alarmed; he sha’n’t escape.
#NORA.
Is he waiting in the kitchen?
#ELLEN.
Yes, he came up the back stair——
#NORA.
Didn’t you tell him I was engaged?
#ELLEN.
Yes, but it was no use.
#NORA.
He won’t go away?
#ELLEN.
No, ma’am, not until he has spoken to you.
#NORA.
Then let him come in; but quietly. And, Ellen—say nothing about it; it’s a surprise for my husband.
#ELLEN.
Oh, yes, ma’am, I understand.
#NORA.
It is coming! The dreadful thing is coming, after all. No, no, no, it can never be; it shall not!
#NORA.
Speak softly; my husband is at home.
#KROGSTAD.
All right. That’s nothing to me.
#NORA.
What do you want? little information.
#NORA.
Be quick, then. What is it?
#KROGSTAD.
You know I have got my dismissal.
#NORA.
I couldn’t prevent it, Mr. Krogstad. I fought for you to the last, but it was of no use.
#KROGSTAD.
Does your husband care for you so little? He knows what I can bring upon you, and yet he dares——
#NORA.
How could you think I should tell him?
#KROGSTAD.
Well, as a matter of fact, I didn’t think it. It wasn’t like my friend Torvald Helmer to show so much courage——
#NORA.
Mr. Krogstad, be good enough to speak respectfully of my husband.
#KROGSTAD.
Certainly, with all due respect. But since you are so anxious to keep the matter secret, I suppose you are a little clearer than yesterday as to what you have done.
#NORA.
Clearer than you could ever make me.
#KROGSTAD.
Yes, such a bad lawyer as I——
#NORA.
What is it you want?
#KROGSTAD.
Only to see how you are getting on, Mrs. Helmer. I’ve been thinking about you all day. Even a mere money - lender, a gutter - journalist, a—in short, a creature like me—has a little bit of what people call feeling.
#NORA.
Then show it; think of my little children.
#KROGSTAD.
Did you and your husband think of mine? But enough of that. I only wanted to tell you that you needn’t take this matter too seriously. I shall not lodge any information, for the present.
#NORA.
No, surely not. I knew you wouldn’t.
#KROGSTAD.
The whole thing can be settled quite amicably. Nobody need know. It can remain among us three.
#NORA.
My husband must never know.
#KROGSTAD.
How can you prevent it? Can you pay off the balance?
#NORA.
No, not at once.
#KROGSTAD.
Or have you any means of raising the money in the next few days?
#NORA.
None—that I will make use of.
#KROGSTAD.
And if you had, it would not help you now. If you offered me ever so much money down, you should not get back your I.O.U.
#NORA.
Tell me what you want to do with it.
#KROGSTAD.
I only want to keep it—to have it in my possession. No outsider shall hear anything of it. So, if you have any desperate scheme in your head——
#NORA.
What if I have?
#KROGSTAD.
If you should think of leaving your husband and children——
#NORA.
What if I do?
#KROGSTAD.
Or if you should think of—something worse——
#NORA.
How do you know that?
#KROGSTAD.
Put all that out of your head.
#NORA.
How did you know what I had in my mind?
#KROGSTAD.
Most of us think of that at first. I thought of it, too; but I hadn’t the courage——
#NORA.
Nor I.
#KROGSTAD.
No, one hasn’t. You haven’t the courage either, have you?
#NORA.
I haven’t, I haven’t.
#KROGSTAD.
Besides, it would be very foolish.—Just one domestic storm, and it’s all over. I have a letter in my pocket for your husband——
#NORA.
Telling him everything?
#KROGSTAD.
Sparing you as much as possible.
#NORA.
He must never read that letter. Tear it up. I will manage to get the money somehow——
#KROGSTAD.
Pardon me, Mrs. Helmer, but I believe I told you——
#NORA.
Oh, I’m not talking about the money I owe you. Tell me how much you demand from my husband—I will get it.
#KROGSTAD.
I demand no money from your husband.
#NORA.
What do you demand then?
#KROGSTAD.
I will tell you. I want to regain my footing in the world. I want to rise; and your husband shall help me to do it. For the last eighteen months my record has been spotless; I have been in bitter need all the time; but I was content to fight my way up, step by step. Now, I’ve been thrust down again, and I will not be satisfied with merely being reinstated as a matter of grace. I want to rise, I tell you. I must get into the Bank again, in a higher position than before. Your husband shall create a place on purpose for me——
#NORA.
He will never do that!
#KROGSTAD.
He will do it; I know him—he won’t dare to show fight! And when he and I are together there, you shall soon see! Before a year is out I shall be the manager’s right hand. It won’t be Torvald Helmer, but Nils Krogstad, that manages the Joint Stock Bank.
#NORA.
That shall never be.
#KROGSTAD.
Perhaps you will——?
#NORA.
Now I have the courage for it.
#KROGSTAD.
Oh, you don’t frighten me! A sensitive, petted creature like you——
#NORA.
You shall see, you shall see!
#KROGSTAD.
Under the ice, perhaps? Down into the cold, black water? And next spring to come up again, ugly, hairless, unrecognisable——
#NORA.
You can’t terrify me.
#KROGSTAD.
Nor you me. People don’t do that sort of thing, Mrs. Helmer. And, after all, what would be the use of it? I have your husband in my pocket, all the same.
#NORA.
Afterwards? When I am no longer——?
#KROGSTAD.
You forget, your reputation remains in my hands! Well, now you are prepared. Do nothing foolish. As soon as Helmer has received my letter, I shall expect to hear from him. And remember that it is your husband himself who has forced me back again into such paths. That I will never forgive him. Good - bye, Mrs. Helmer.
#NORA.
He’s going. He’s not putting the letter into the box. No, no, it would be impossible! What’s that. He’s standing still; not going down stairs. Has he changed his mind? Is he——? In the letter - box! There it lies.—Torvald, Torvald—now we are lost!
#MRS. LINDEN.
There, I think it’s all right now. Shall we just try it on?
#NORA.
Christina, come here.
#MRS. LINDEN.
What’s the matter? You look quite distracted.
#NORA.
Come here. Do you see that letter? There, see—through the glass of the letter - box.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes, yes, I see it.
#NORA.
That letter is from Krogstad——
#MRS. LINDEN.
Nora—it was Krogstad who lent you the money?
#NORA.
Yes; and now Torvald will know everything.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Believe me, Nora, it’s the best thing for both of you.
#NORA.
You don’t know all yet. I have forged a name——
#MRS. LINDEN.
Good heavens!
#NORA.
Now, listen to me, Christina; you shall bear me witness——
#MRS. LINDEN.
How “witness”? What am I to——?
#NORA.
If I should go out of my mind—it might easily happen——
#MRS. LINDEN.
Nora!
#NORA.
Or if anything else should happen to me—so that I couldn’t be here——!
#MRS. LINDEN.
Nora, Nora, you’re quite beside yourself!
#NORA.
In case any one wanted to take it all upon himself—the whole blame—you understand——
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes, yes; but how can you think——?
#NORA.
You shall bear witness that it’s not true, Christina. I’m not out of my mind at all; I know quite well what I’m saying; and I tell you nobody else knew anything about it; I did the whole thing, I myself. Remember that.
#MRS. LINDEN.
I shall remember. But I don’t understand what you mean——
#NORA.
Oh, how should you? It’s the miracle coming to pass.
#MRS. LINDEN.
The miracle?
#NORA.
Yes, the miracle. But it’s so terrible, Christina; it mustn’t happen for all the world.
#MRS. LINDEN.
I shall go straight to Krogstad and talk to him.
#NORA.
Don’t; he’ll do you some harm.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Once he would have done anything for me.
#NORA.
He?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Where does he live?
#NORA.
Oh, how can I tell——? Yes—— Here’s his card. But the letter, the letter——!
#HELMER.
Nora!
#NORA.
Oh, what is it? What do you want?
#HELMER.
Well, well, don’t be frightened. We’re not coming in; you’ve bolted the door. Are you trying on your dress?
#NORA.
Yes, yes, I’m trying it on. It suits me so well, Torvald.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Why, he lives close by here.
#NORA.
Yes, but it’s no use now. We are lost. The letter is there in the box.
#MRS. LINDEN.
And your husband has the key?
#NORA.
Always. Krogstad must demand his letter back, unread. He must find some pretext——
#NORA.
But this is the very time when Torvald generally——
#MRS. LINDEN.
Prevent him. Keep him occupied. I shall come back as quickly as I can.
#NORA.
Torvald!
#HELMER.
Well, may one come into one’s own room again at last? Come, Rank, we’ll have a look—— But how’s this?
#NORA.
What, Torvald dear?
#HELMER.
Rank led me to expect a grand transformation.
#DR. RANK.
So I understood. I suppose I was mistaken.
#NORA.
No, no one shall see me in my glory till to - morrow evening.
#HELMER.
Why, Nora dear, you look so tired. Have you been practising too hard?
#NORA.
No, I haven’t practised at all yet.
#HELMER.
But you’ll have to——
#NORA.
Oh yes, I must, I must! But, Torvald, I can’t get on at all without your help. I’ve forgotten everything.
#HELMER.
Oh, we shall soon freshen it up again.
#NORA.
Yes, do help me, Torvald. You must promise me——Oh, I’m so nervous about it. Before so many people——This evening you must give yourself up entirely to me. You mustn’t do a stroke of work; you mustn’t even touch a pen. Do promise, Torvald dear!
#HELMER.
I promise. All this evening I shall be your slave. Little helpless thing——! But, by - the - bye, I must just——
#NORA.
What do you want there?
#HELMER.
Only to see if there are any letters.
#NORA.
No, no, don’t do that, Torvald.
#HELMER.
Why not?
#NORA.
Torvald, I beg you not to. There are none there.
#HELMER.
Let me just see.
#HELMER.
Aha!
#NORA.
I can’t dance to - morrow if I don’t rehearse with you first.
#HELMER.
Are you really so nervous, dear Nora?
#NORA.
Yes, dreadfully! Let me rehearse at once. We have time before dinner. Oh, do sit down and play for me, Torvald dear; direct me and put me right, as you used to do.
#HELMER.
With all the pleasure in life, since you wish it.
#NORA.
Now play for me! Now I’ll dance!
#HELMER.
Slower! Slower!
#NORA.
Can’t do it slower!
#HELMER.
Not so violently, Nora.
#NORA.
I must! I must!
#HELMER.
No, no, Nora—that will never do.
#NORA.
Didn’t I tell you so!
#DR. RANK.
Let me play for her.
#HELMER.
Yes, do—then I can direct her better.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Ah——!
#NORA.
We’re having such fun here, Christina!
#HELMER.
Why, Nora dear, you’re dancing as if it were a matter of life and death.
#NORA.
So it is.
#HELMER.
Rank, stop! This is the merest madness. Stop, I say!
#HELMER.
I couldn’t have believed it. You’ve positively forgotten all I taught you.
#NORA.
You see for yourself.
#HELMER.
You really do want teaching.
#NORA.
Yes, you see how much I need it. You must practise with me up to the last moment. Will you promise me, Torvald?
#HELMER.
Certainly, certainly.
#NORA.
Neither to - day nor to morrow must you think of anything but me. You mustn’t open a single letter—mustn’t look at the letter - box.
#HELMER.
Ah, you’re still afraid of that man——
#NORA.
Oh yes, yes, I am.
#HELMER.
Nora, I can see it in your face—there’s a letter from him in the box.
#NORA.
I don’t know, I believe so. But you’re not to read anything now; nothing ugly must come between us until all is over.
#DR. RANK.
You mustn’t contradict her.
#HELMER.
The child shall have her own way. But to - morrow night, when the dance is over——
#NORA.
Then you shall be free. appears in the doorway, right.]
#ELLEN.
Dinner is on the table, ma’am.
#NORA.
We’ll have some champagne, Ellen.
#ELLEN.
Yes, ma’am.
#HELMER.
Dear me! Quite a banquet.
#NORA.
Yes, and we’ll keep it up till morning. And macaroons, Ellen—plenty—just this once.
#HELMER.
Come, come, don’t let us have this wild excitement! Be my own little lark again.
#NORA.
Oh yes, I will. But now go into the dining - room; and you too, Doctor Rank. Christina, you must help me to do up my hair.
#DR. RANK.
There’s nothing in the wind? Nothing—I mean——?
#HELMER.
Oh no, nothing of the kind. It’s merely this babyish anxiety I was telling you about.
#NORA.
Well?
#MRS. LINDEN.
He’s gone out of town.
#NORA.
I saw it in your face.
#MRS. LINDEN.
He comes back to - morrow evening. I left a note for him.
#NORA.
You shouldn’t have done that. Things must take their course. After all, there’s something glorious in waiting for the miracle.
#MRS. LINDEN.
What is it you’re waiting for?
#NORA.
Oh, you can’t understand. Go to them in the dining - room; I shall come in a moment.
#NORA.
Five. Seven hours till midnight. Then twenty - four hours till the next midnight. Then the tarantella will be over. Twenty - four and seven? Thirty - one hours to live. appears at the door, right.]
#HELMER.
What has become of my little lark?
#NORA.
Here she is! - Footnote 9: In the original, “We say ‘thou’ to each other.”
#MRS. LINDEN.
Not here yet; and the time is nearly up. If only he hasn’t—— Ah, there he is. Come in; there is no one here.
#KROGSTAD.
I found a note from you at my house. What does it mean?
#MRS. LINDEN.
I must speak to you.
#KROGSTAD.
Indeed? And in this house?
#MRS. LINDEN.
I could not see you at my rooms. They have no separate entrance. Come in; we are quite alone. The servants are asleep, and the Helmers are at the ball upstairs.
#KROGSTAD.
Ah! So the Helmers are dancing this evening? Really?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes. Why not?
#KROGSTAD.
Quite right. Why not?
#MRS. LINDEN.
And now let us talk a little.
#KROGSTAD.
Have we two anything to say to each other?
#MRS. LINDEN.
great deal.
#KROGSTAD.
I should not have thought so.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Because you have never really understood me.
#KROGSTAD.
What was there to understand? The most natural thing in the world—a heartless woman throws a man over when a better match offers.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Do you really think me so heartless? Do you think I broke with you lightly?
#KROGSTAD.
Did you not?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Do you really think so?
#KROGSTAD.
If not, why did you write me that letter?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Was it not best? Since I had to break with you, was it not right that I should try to put an end to all that you felt for me?
#KROGSTAD.
So that was it? And all this—for the sake of money!
#MRS. LINDEN.
You ought not to forget that I had a helpless mother and two little brothers. We could not wait for you, Nils, as your prospects then stood.
#KROGSTAD.
Perhaps not; but you had no right to cast me off for the sake of others, whoever the others might be.
#MRS. LINDEN.
I don’t know. I have often asked myself whether I had the right.
#KROGSTAD.
When I had lost you, I seemed to have no firm ground left under my feet. Look at me now. I am a shipwrecked man clinging to a spar.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Rescue may be at hand.
#KROGSTAD.
It was at hand; but then you came and stood in the way.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Without my knowledge, Nils. I did not know till to - day that it was you I was to replace in the Bank.
#KROGSTAD.
Well, I take your word for it. But now that you do know, do you mean to give way?
#MRS. LINDEN.
No, for that would not help you in the least.
#KROGSTAD.
Oh, help, help——! I should do it whether or no.
#MRS. LINDEN.
I have learnt prudence. Life and bitter necessity have schooled me.
#KROGSTAD.
And life has taught me not to trust fine speeches.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Then life has taught you a very sensible thing. But deeds you will trust?
#KROGSTAD.
What do you mean?
#MRS. LINDEN.
You said you were a shipwrecked man, clinging to a spar.
#KROGSTAD.
I have good reason to say so.
#MRS. LINDEN.
I too am shipwrecked, and clinging to a spar. I have no one to mourn for, no one to care for.
#KROGSTAD.
You made your own choice.
#MRS. LINDEN.
No choice was left me.
#KROGSTAD.
Well, what then?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Nils, how if we two shipwrecked people could join hands?
#KROGSTAD.
What!
#MRS. LINDEN.
Two on a raft have a better chance than if each clings to a separate spar.
#KROGSTAD.
Christina!
#MRS. LINDEN.
What do you think brought me to town?
#KROGSTAD.
Had you any thought of me?
#MRS. LINDEN.
I must have work or I can’t bear to live. All my life, as long as I can remember, I have worked; work has been my one great joy. Now I stand quite alone in the world, aimless and forlorn. There is no happiness in working for one’s self. Nils, give me somebody and something to work for.
#KROGSTAD.
I cannot believe in all this. It is simply a woman’s romantic craving for self - sacrifice.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Have you ever found me romantic?
#KROGSTAD.
Would you really——? Tell me: do you know all my past?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes.
#KROGSTAD.
And do you know what people say of me?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Did you not say just now that with me you could have been another man?
#KROGSTAD.
I am sure of it.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Is it too late?
#KROGSTAD.
Christina, do you know what you are doing? Yes, you do; I see it in your face. Have you the courage then——?
#MRS. LINDEN.
I need some one to be a mother to, and your children need a mother. You need me, and I—I need you. Nils, I believe in your better self. With you I fear nothing.
#KROGSTAD.
Thank you—thank you, Christina. Now I shall make others see me as you do.—Ah, I forgot——
#MRS. LINDEN.
Hush! The tarantella! Go! go!
#KROGSTAD.
Why? What is it?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Don’t you hear the dancing overhead? As soon as that is over they will be here.
#KROGSTAD.
Oh yes, I shall go. Nothing will come of this, after all. Of course, you don’t know the step I have taken against the Helmers.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes, Nils, I do know.
#KROGSTAD.
And yet you have the courage to——?
#MRS. LINDEN.
I know to what lengths despair can drive a man.
#KROGSTAD.
Oh, if I could only undo it!
#MRS. LINDEN.
You could. Your letter is still in the box.
#KROGSTAD.
Are you sure?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes; but——
#KROGSTAD.
Is that what it all means? You want to save your friend at any price. Say it out—is that your idea?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Nils, a woman who has once sold herself for the sake of others, does not do so again.
#KROGSTAD.
I shall demand my letter back again.
#MRS. LINDEN.
No, no.
#KROGSTAD.
Yes, of course. I shall wait till Helmer comes; I shall tell him to give it back to me—that it’s only about my dismissal—that I don’t want it read——
#MRS. LINDEN.
No, Nils, you must not recall the letter.
#KROGSTAD.
But tell me, wasn’t that just why you got me to come here?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes, in my first alarm. But a day has passed since then, and in that day I have seen incredible things in this house. Helmer must know everything; there must be an end to this unhappy secret. These two must come to a full understanding. They must have done with all these shifts and subterfuges.
#KROGSTAD.
Very well, if you like to risk it. But one thing I can do, and at once——
#MRS. LINDEN.
Make haste! Go, go! The dance is over; we’re not safe another moment.
#KROGSTAD.
I shall wait for you in the street.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes, do; you must see me home.
#KROGSTAD.
I never was so happy in all my life!
#MRS. LINDEN.
What a change! What a change! To have some one to work for, to live for; a home to make happy! Well, it shall not be my fault if I fail.—I wish they would come.— Ah, here they are! I must get my things on.
#NORA.
No, no, no! I won’t go in! I want to go upstairs again; I don’t want to leave so early!
#HELMER.
But, my dearest girl——!
#NORA.
Oh, please, please, Torvald, I beseech you—only one hour more!
#HELMER.
Not one minute more, Nora dear; you know what we agreed. Come, come in; you’re catching cold here.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Good - evening.
#NORA.
Christina!
#HELMER.
What, Mrs. Linden! You here so late?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes, I ought to apologise. I did so want to see Nora in her costume.
#NORA.
Have you been sitting here waiting for me?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes; unfortunately I came too late. You had gone upstairs already, and I felt I couldn’t go away without seeing you.
#HELMER.
Well then, just look at her! I assure you she’s worth it. Isn’t she lovely, Mrs. Linden?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes, I must say——
#HELMER.
Isn’t she exquisite? Every one said so. But she’s dreadfully obstinate, dear little creature. What’s to be done with her? Just think, I had almost to force her away.
#NORA.
Oh, Torvald, you’ll be sorry some day that you didn’t let me stay, if only for one half - hour more.
#HELMER.
There! You hear her, Mrs. Linden? She dances her tarantella with wild applause, and well she deserved it, I must say—though there was, perhaps, a little too much nature in her rendering of the idea—more than was, strictly speaking, artistic. But never mind—the point is, she made a great success, a tremendous success. Was I to let her remain after that—to weaken the impression? Not if I know it. I took my sweet little Capri girl—my capricious little Capri girl, I might say—under my arm; a rapid turn round the room, a curtsey to all sides, and—as they say in novels—the lovely apparition vanished! An exit should always be effective, Mrs. Linden; but I can’t get Nora to see it. By Jove! it’s warm here. What! No light there? Oh, of course. Excuse me——
#NORA.
Well?
#MRS. LINDEN.
I’ve spoken to him.
#NORA.
And——?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Nora—you must tell your husband everything—— Nora. I knew it!
#MRS. LINDEN.
You have nothing to fear from Krogstad; but you must speak out.
#NORA.
I shall not speak.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Then the letter will.
#NORA.
Thank you, Christina. Now I know what I have to do. Hush——!
#HELMER.
Well, Mrs. Linden, have you admired her?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes; and now I must say good - night.
#HELMER.
What, already? Does this knitting belong to you?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes, thanks; I was nearly forgetting it.
#HELMER.
Then you do knit?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes.
#HELMER.
Do you know, you ought to embroider instead?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Indeed! Why?
#HELMER.
Because it’s so much prettier. Look now! You hold the embroidery in the left hand, so, and then work the needle with the right hand, in a long, graceful curve—don’t you?
#MRS. LINDEN.
Yes, I suppose so.
#HELMER.
But knitting is always ugly. Just look—your arms close to your sides, and the needles going up and down—there’s something Chinese about it.—They really gave us splendid champagne to - night.
#MRS. LINDEN.
Well, good - night, Nora, and don’t be obstinate any more.
#HELMER.
Well said, Mrs. Linden!
#MRS. LINDEN.
Good - night, Mr. Helmer.
#HELMER.
Good - night, good - night; I hope you’ll get safely home. I should be glad to—but you have such a short way to go. Good - night, good - night. At last we’ve got rid of her: she’s a terrible bore.
#NORA.
Aren’t you very tired, Torvald?
#HELMER.
No, not in the least.
#NORA.
Nor sleepy?
#HELMER.
Not a bit. I feel particularly lively. But you? You do look tired and sleepy.
#NORA.
Yes, very tired. I shall soon sleep now.
#HELMER.
There, you see. I was right after all not to let you stay longer.
#NORA.
Oh, everything you do is right.
#HELMER.
Now my lark is speaking like a reasonable being. Did you notice how jolly Rank was this evening?
#NORA.
Indeed? Was he? I had no chance of speaking to him.
#HELMER.
Nor I, much; but I haven’t seen him in such good spirits for a long time. It’s splendid to be back in our own home, to be quite alone together!—Oh, you enchanting creature!
#NORA.
Don’t look at me in that way, Torvald.
#HELMER.
I am not to look at my dearest treasure?—at all the loveliness that is mine, mine only, wholly and entirely mine?
#NORA.
You mustn’t say these things to me this evening.
#HELMER.
I see you have the tarantella still in your blood— - and that makes you all the more enticing. Listen! the other people are going now. Nora—soon the whole house will be still.
#NORA.
Yes, I hope so.
#HELMER.
Yes, don’t you, Nora darling? When we are among strangers, do you know why I speak so little to you, and keep so far away, and only steal a glance at you now and then—do you know why I do it? Because I am fancying that we love each other in secret, that I am secretly betrothed to you, and that no one dreams that there is anything between us.
#NORA.
Yes, yes, yes. I know all your thoughts are with me.
#HELMER.
And then, when the time comes to go, and I put the shawl about your smooth, soft shoulders, and this glorious neck of yours, I imagine you are my bride, that our marriage is just over, that I am bringing you for the first time to my home—that I am alone with you for the first time—quite alone with you, in your trembling loveliness! All this evening I have been longing for you, and you only. When I watched you swaying and whirling in the tarantella—my blood boiled—I could endure it no longer; and that’s why I made you come home with me so early——
#NORA.
Go now, Torvald! Go away from me. I won’t have all this.
#HELMER.
What do you mean? Ah, I see you’re teasing me, little Nora! Won’t—won’t! Am I not your husband——? Did you hear——?
#HELMER.
Who’s there?
#DR. RANK.
It is I; may I come in for a moment?
#HELMER.
Oh! what can he want just now? Wait a moment. Come, it’s nice of you to look in.
#DR. RANK.
I thought I heard your voice, and that put it into my head. Ah, this dear old place! How cosy you two are here!
#HELMER.
You seemed to find it pleasant enough upstairs, too.
#DR. RANK.
Exceedingly. Why not? Why shouldn’t one take one’s share of everything in this world? All one can, at least, and as long as one can. The wine was splendid——
#HELMER.
Especially the champagne.
#DR. RANK.
Did you notice it? It’s incredible the quantity I contrived to get down.
#NORA.
Torvald drank plenty of champagne, too.
#DR. RANK.
Did he?
#NORA.
Yes, and it always puts him in such spirits.
#DR. RANK.
Well, why shouldn’t one have a jolly evening after a well - spent day?
#HELMER.
Well - spent! Well, I haven’t much to boast of in that respect.
#DR. RANK.
But I have, don’t you see?
#NORA.
I suppose you have been engaged in a scientific investigation, Doctor Rank?
#DR. RANK.
Quite right.
#HELMER.
Bless me! Little Nora talking about scientific investigations!
#NORA.
Am I to congratulate you on the result?
#DR. RANK.
By all means.
#NORA.
It was good then?
#DR. RANK.
The best possible, both for doctor and patient—certainty.
#NORA.
Certainty?
#DR. RANK.
Absolute certainty. Wasn’t I right to enjoy myself after that?
#NORA.
Yes, quite right, Doctor Rank.
#HELMER.
And so say I, provided you don’t have to pay for it to - morrow.
#DR. RANK.
Well, in this life nothing is to be had for nothing.
#NORA.
Doctor Rank—I’m sure you are very fond of masquerades?
#DR. RANK.
Yes, when there are plenty of amusing disguises——
#NORA.
Tell me, what shall we two be at our next masquerade?
#HELMER.
Little featherbrain! Thinking of your next already!
#DR. RANK.
We two? I’ll tell you. You must go as a good fairy.
#HELMER.
Ah, but what costume would indicate that?
#DR. RANK.
She has simply to wear her everyday dress.
#HELMER.
Capital! But don’t you know what you will be yourself?
#DR. RANK.
Yes, my dear friend, I am perfectly clear upon that point.
#HELMER.
Well?
#DR. RANK.
At the next masquerade I shall be invisible.
#HELMER.
What a comical idea!
#DR. RANK.
There’s a big black hat—haven’t you heard of the invisible hat? It comes down all over you, and then no one can see you.
#HELMER.
No, you’re right there.
#DR. RANK.
But I’m quite forgetting what I came for. Helmer, give me a cigar—one of the dark Havanas.
#HELMER.
With the greatest pleasure.
#DR. RANK.
Thank you.
#NORA.
Let me give you a light. thousand thanks.
#DR. RANK.
And now, good - bye!
#HELMER.
Good - bye, good - bye, my dear fellow.
#NORA.
Sleep well, Doctor Rank.
#DR. RANK.
Thanks for the wish.
#NORA.
Wish me the same.
#DR. RANK.
You? Very well, since you ask me—Sleep well. And thanks for the light.
#HELMER.
He’s been drinking a good deal.
#NORA.
I daresay. Torvald, what are you doing there?
#HELMER.
I must empty the letter - box; it’s quite full; there will be no room for the newspapers to - morrow morning.
#NORA.
Are you going to work to - night?
#HELMER.
You know very well I am not.—Why, how is this? Some one has been at the lock.
#NORA.
The lock——?
#HELMER.
I’m sure of it. What does it mean? I can’t think that the servants——? Here’s a broken hair - pin. Nora, it’s one of yours.
#NORA.
It must have been the children——
#HELMER.
Then you must break them of such tricks.—There! At last I’ve got it open. Ellen!—Ellen, just put the hall door lamp out.
#HELMER.
Just see how they’ve accumulated. Why, what’s this?
#NORA.
The letter! Oh no, no, Torvald!
#HELMER.
Two visiting - cards—from Rank.
#NORA.
From Doctor Rank?
#HELMER.
Doctor Rank. They were on the top. He must just have put them in.
#NORA.
Is there anything on them?
#HELMER.
There’s a black cross over the name. Look at it. What an unpleasant idea! It looks just as if he were announcing his own death.
#NORA.
So he is.
#HELMER.
What! Do you know anything? Has he told you anything?
#NORA.
Yes. These cards mean that he has taken his last leave of us. He is going to shut himself up and die.
#HELMER.
Poor fellow! Of course I knew we couldn’t hope to keep him long. But so soon——! And to go and creep into his lair like a wounded animal——
#NORA.
When we must go, it is best to go silently. Don’t you think so, Torvald?
#HELMER.
He had so grown into our lives, I can’t realise that he is gone. He and his sufferings and his loneliness formed a sort of cloudy background to the sunshine of our happiness.—Well, perhaps it’s best as it is—at any rate for him. And perhaps for us too, Nora. Now we two are thrown entirely upon each other. My darling wife! I feel as if I could never hold you close enough. Do you know, Nora, I often wish some danger might threaten you, that I might risk body and soul, and everything, everything, for your dear sake.
#NORA.
Now you shall read your letters, Torvald.
#HELMER.
No, no; not to - night. I want to be with you, my sweet wife.
#NORA.
With the thought of your dying friend——?
#HELMER.
You are right. This has shaken us both. Unloveliness has come between us—thoughts of death and decay. We must seek to cast them off. Till then—we will remain apart.
#NORA.
Torvald! Goodnight! good - night!
#HELMER.
Good - night, my little song - bird. Sleep well, Nora. Now I shall go and read my letters.
#NORA.
Never to see him again. Never, never, never. Never to see the children again. Never, never.—Oh that black, icy water! Oh that bottomless——! If it were only over! Now he has it; he’s reading it. Oh, no, no, no, not yet. Torvald, good - bye——! Good - bye, my little ones——!
#HELMER.
Nora!
#NORA.
Ah——!
#HELMER.
What is this? Do you know what is in this letter?
#NORA.
Yes, I know. Let me go! Let me pass!
#HELMER.
Where do you want to go?
#NORA.
You shall not save me, Torvald.
#HELMER.
True! Is what he writes true? No, no, it is impossible that this can be true.
#NORA.
It is true. I have loved you beyond all else in the world.
#HELMER.
Pshaw—no silly evasions!
#NORA.
Torvald——!
#HELMER.
Wretched woman—what have you done!
#NORA.
Let me go—you shall not save me! You shall not take my guilt upon yourself!
#HELMER.
I don’t want any melodramatic airs. Here you shall stay and give an account of yourself. Do you understand what you have done? Answer! Do you understand it?
#NORA.
Yes; now I begin fully to understand it.
#HELMER.
Oh! what an awful awakening! During all these eight years—she who was my pride and my joy—a hypocrite, a liar—worse, worse—a criminal. Oh, the unfathomable hideousness of it all! Ugh! Ugh!
#HELMER.
I ought to have known how it would be. I ought to have foreseen it. All your father’s want of principle—be silent!—all your father’s want of principle you have inherited—no religion, no morality, no sense of duty. How I am punished for screening him! I did it for your sake; and you reward me like this.
#NORA.
Yes—like this.
#HELMER.
You have destroyed my whole happiness. You have ruined my future. Oh, it’s frightful to think of! I am in the power of a scoundrel; he can do whatever he pleases with me, demand whatever he chooses; he can domineer over me as much as he likes, and I must submit. And all this disaster and ruin is brought upon me by an unprincipled woman!
#NORA.
When I am out of the world, you will be free.
#HELMER.
Oh, no fine phrases. Your father, too, was always ready with them. What good would it do me, if you were “out of the world,” as you say? No good whatever! He can publish the story all the same; I might even be suspected of collusion. People will think I was at the bottom of it all and egged you on. And for all this I have you to thank—you whom I have done nothing but pet and spoil during our whole married life. Do you understand now what you have done to me?
#NORA.
Yes.
#HELMER.
The thing is so incredible, I can’t grasp it. But we must come to an understanding. Take that shawl off. Take it off, I say! I must try to pacify him in one way or another—the matter must be hushed up, cost what it may.—As for you and me, we must make no outward change in our way of life—no outward change, you understand. Of course, you will continue to live here. But the children cannot be left in your care. I dare not trust them to you.—Oh, to have to say this to one I have loved so tenderly—whom I still——! But that must be a thing of the past. Henceforward there can be no question of happiness, but merely of saving the ruins, the shreds, the show—— What’s that? So late! Can it be the worst? Can he——? Hide yourself, Nora; say you are ill.
#ELLEN.
Here is a letter for you, ma’am.
#HELMER.
Give it to me. Yes, from him. You shall not have it. I shall read it.
#NORA.
Read it!
#HELMER.
I have hardly the courage to. We may both be lost, both you and I. Ah! I must know. Nora!
#HELMER.
Nora!—Oh! I must read it again.—Yes, yes, it is so. I am saved! Nora, I am saved!
#NORA.
And I?
#HELMER.
You too, of course; we are both saved, both of us. Look here—he sends you back your promissory note. He writes that he regrets and apologises, that a happy turn in his life——Oh, what matter what he writes. We are saved, Nora! No one can harm you. Oh, Nora, Nora——; but first to get rid of this hateful thing. I’ll just see—— No, I will not look at it; the whole thing shall be nothing but a dream to me. There! it’s gone!—He said that ever since Christmas Eve——Oh, Nora, they must have been three terrible days for you!
#NORA.
I have fought a hard fight for the last three days.
#HELMER.
And in your agony you saw no other outlet but——No; we won’t think of that horror. We will only rejoice and repeat—it’s over, all over! Don’t you hear, Nora? You don’t seem able to grasp it. Yes, it’s over. What is this set look on your face? Oh, my poor Nora, I understand; you cannot believe that I have forgiven you. But I have, Nora; I swear it. I have forgiven everything. I know that what you did was all for love of me.
#NORA.
That is true.
#HELMER.
You loved me as a wife should love her husband. It was only the means that, in your inexperience, you misjudged. But do you think I love you the less because you cannot do without guidance? No, no. Only lean on me; I will counsel you, and guide you. I should be no true man if this very womanly helplessness did not make you doubly dear in my eyes. You mustn’t dwell upon the hard things I said in my first moment of terror, when the world seemed to be tumbling about my ears. I have forgiven you, Nora—I swear I have forgiven you.
#NORA.
I thank you for your forgiveness.
#HELMER.
No, stay——! What are you going to do?
#NORA.
To take off my masquerade dress.
#HELMER.
Yes, do, dear. Try to calm down, and recover your balance, my scared little song - bird. You may rest secure. I have broad wings to shield you. Oh, how lovely—how cosy our home is, Nora! Here you are safe; here I can shelter you like a hunted dove whom I have saved from the claws of the hawk. I shall soon bring your poor beating heart to rest; believe me, Nora, very soon. To - morrow all this will seem quite different—everything will be as before. I shall not need to tell you again that I forgive you; you will feel for yourself that it is true. How could you think I could find it in my heart to drive you away, or even so much as to reproach you? Oh, you don’t know a true man’s heart, Nora. There is some thing indescribably sweet and soothing to a man in having forgiven his wife—honestly forgiven her, from the bottom of his heart. She becomes his property in a double sense. She is as though born again; she has become, so to speak, at once his wife and his child. That is what you shall henceforth be to me, my bewildered, helpless darling. Don’t be troubled about anything, Nora; only open your heart to me, and I will be both will and conscience to you. Why, what’s this? Not gone to bed? You have changed your dress?
#NORA.
Yes, Torvald; now I have changed my dress.
#HELMER.
But why now, so late——?
#NORA.
I shall not sleep to - night.
#HELMER.
But, Nora dear——
#NORA.
It’s not so late yet. Sit down, Torvald; you and I have much to say to each other.
#HELMER.
Nora—what does this mean? Your cold, set face——
#NORA.
Sit down. It will take some time. I have much to talk over with you.
#HELMER.
You alarm me, Nora. I don’t understand you.
#NORA.
No, that is just it. You don’t understand me; and I have never understood you—till to - night. No, don’t interrupt. Only listen to what I say.—We must come to a final settlement, Torvald.
#HELMER.
How do you mean?
#NORA.
Does not one thing strike you as we sit here?
#HELMER.
What should strike me?
#NORA.
We have been married eight years. Does it not strike you that this is the first time we two, you and I, man and wife, have talked together seriously?
#HELMER.
Seriously! What do you call seriously?
#NORA.
During eight whole years, and more—ever since the day we first met—we have never exchanged one serious word about serious things.
#HELMER.
Was I always to trouble you with the cares you could not help me to bear?
#NORA.
I am not talking of cares. I say that we have never yet set ourselves seriously to get to the bottom of anything.
#HELMER.
Why, my dearest Nora, what have you to do with serious things?
#NORA.
There we have it! You have never understood me.—I have had great injustice done me, Torvald; first by father, and then by you.
#HELMER.
What! By your father and me?—By us, who have loved you more than all the world? You have never loved me. You only thought it amusing to be in love with me.
#HELMER.
Why, Nora, what a thing to say!
#NORA.
Yes, it is so, Torvald. While I was at home with father, he used to tell me all his opinions, and I held the same opinions. If I had others I said nothing about them, because he wouldn’t have liked it. He used to call me his doll - child, and played with me as I played with my dolls. Then I came to live in your house——
#HELMER.
What an expression to use about our marriage!
#NORA.
I mean I passed from father’s hands into yours. You arranged everything according to your taste; and I got the same tastes as you; or I pretended to—I don’t know which—both ways, perhaps; sometimes one and sometimes the other. When I look back on it now, I seem to have been living here like a beggar, from hand to mouth. I lived by performing tricks for you, Torvald. But you would have it so. You and father have done me a great wrong. It is your fault that my life has come to nothing.
#HELMER.
Why, Nora, how unreasonable and ungrateful you are! Have you not been happy here?
#NORA.
No, never. I thought I was; but I never was.
#HELMER.
Not—not happy!
#NORA.
No; only merry. And you have always been so kind to me. But our house has been nothing but a play - room. Here I have been your doll - wife, just as at home I used to be papa’s doll - child. And the children, in their turn, have been my dolls. I thought it fun when you played with me, just as the children did when I played with them. That has been our marriage, Torvald.
#HELMER.
There is some truth in what you say, exaggerated and overstrained though it be. But henceforth it shall be different. Play - time is over; now comes the time for education.
#NORA.
Whose education? Mine, or the children’s?
#HELMER.
Both, my dear Nora.
#NORA.
Oh, Torvald, you are not the man to teach me to be a fit wife for you.
#HELMER.
And you can say that?
#NORA.
And I—how have I prepared myself to educate the children?
#HELMER.
Nora!
#NORA.
Did you not say yourself, a few minutes ago, you dared not trust them to me?
#HELMER.
In the excitement of the moment! Why should you dwell upon that?
#NORA.
No—you were perfectly right. That problem is beyond me. There is another to be solved first—I must try to educate myself. You are not the man to help me in that. I must set about it alone. And that is why I am leaving you.
#HELMER.
What—do you mean to say——?
#NORA.
I must stand quite alone if I am ever to know myself and my surroundings; so I cannot stay with you.
#HELMER.
Nora! Nora!
#NORA.
I am going at once. I daresay Christina will take me in for to - night——
#HELMER.
You are mad! I shall not allow it! I forbid it!
#NORA.
It is of no use your forbidding me anything now. I shall take with me what belongs to me. From you I will accept nothing, either now or afterwards.
#HELMER.
What madness this is!
#NORA.
To - morrow I shall go home—I mean to what was my home. It will be easier for me to find some opening there.
#HELMER.
Oh, in your blind inexperience——
#NORA.
I must try to gain experience, Torvald.
#HELMER.
To forsake your home, your husband, and your children! And you don’t consider what the world will say.
#NORA.
I can pay no heed to that. I only know that I must do it.
#HELMER.
This is monstrous! Can you forsake your holiest duties in this way?
#NORA.
What do you consider my holiest duties?
#HELMER.
Do I need to tell you that? Your duties to your husband and your children.
#NORA.
I have other duties equally sacred.
#HELMER.
Impossible! What duties do you mean?
#NORA.
My duties towards myself.
#HELMER.
Before all else you are a wife and a mother.
#NORA.
That I no longer believe. I believe that before all else I am a human being, just as much as you are—or at least that I should try to become one. I know that most people agree with you, Torvald, and that they say so in books. But henceforth I can’t be satisfied with what most people say, and what is in books. I must think things out for myself, and try to get clear about them.
#HELMER.
Are you not clear about your place in your own home? Have you not an infallible guide in questions like these? Have you not religion?
#NORA.
Oh, Torvald, I don’t really know what religion is.
#HELMER.
What do you mean?
#NORA.
I know nothing but what Pastor Hansen told me when I was confirmed. He explained that religion was this and that. When I get away from all this and stand alone, I will look into that matter too. I will see whether what he taught me is right, or, at any rate, whether it is right for me.
#HELMER.
Oh, this is unheard of! And from so young a woman! But if religion cannot keep you right, let me appeal to your conscience—for I suppose you have some moral feeling? Or, answer me: perhaps you have none?
#NORA.
Well, Torvald, it’s not easy to say. I really don’t know—I am all at sea about these things. I only know that I think quite differently from you about them. I hear, too, that the laws are different from what I thought; but I can’t believe that they can be right. It appears that a woman has no right to spare her dying father, or to save her husband’s life! I don’t believe that.
#HELMER.
You talk like a child. You don’t understand the society in which you live.
#NORA.
No, I do not. But now I shall try to learn. I must make up my mind which is right—society or I.
#HELMER.
Nora, you are ill; you are feverish; I almost think you are out of your senses.
#NORA.
I have never felt so much clearness and certainty as to - night.
#HELMER.
You are clear and certain enough to forsake husband and children?
#NORA.
Yes, I am.
#HELMER.
Then there is only one explanation possible.
#NORA.
What is that?
#HELMER.
You no longer love me.
#NORA.
No; that is just it.
#HELMER.
Nora!—Can you say so!
#NORA.
Oh, I’m so sorry, Torvald; for you’ve always been so kind to me. But I can’t help it. I do not love you any longer.
#HELMER.
Are you clear and certain on this point too?
#NORA.
Yes, quite. That is why I will not stay here any longer.
#HELMER.
And can you also make clear to me how I have forfeited your love?
#NORA.
Yes, I can. It was this evening, when the miracle did not happen; for then I saw you were not the man I had imagined.
#HELMER.
Explain yourself more clearly; I don’t understand.
#NORA.
I have waited so patiently all these eight years; for of course I saw clearly enough that miracles don’t happen every day. When this crushing blow threatened me, I said to myself so confidently, “Now comes the miracle!” When Krogstad’s letter lay in the box, it never for a moment occurred to me that you would think of submitting to that man’s conditions. I was convinced that you would say to him, “Make it known to all the world”; and that then——
#HELMER.
Well? When I had given my own wife’s name up to disgrace and shame——?
#NORA.
Then I firmly believed that you would come forward, take everything upon yourself, and say, “I am the guilty one.”
#HELMER.
Nora——!
#NORA.
You mean I would never have accepted such a sacrifice? No, certainly not. But what would my assertions have been worth in opposition to yours?—That was the miracle that I hoped for and dreaded. And it was to hinder that that I wanted to die.
#HELMER.
I would gladly work for you day and night, Nora—bear sorrow and want for your sake. But no man sacrifices his honour, even for one he loves.
#NORA.
Millions of women have done so.
#HELMER.
Oh, you think and talk like a silly child.
#NORA.
Very likely. But you neither think nor talk like the man I can share my life with. When your terror was over—not for what threatened me, but for yourself—when there was nothing more to fear—then it seemed to you as though nothing had happened. I was your lark again, your doll, just as before—whom you would take twice as much care of in future, because she was so weak and fragile. Torvald—in that moment it burst upon me that I had been living here these eight years with a strange man, and had borne him three children.—Oh, I can’t bear to think of it! I could tear myself to pieces!
#HELMER.
I see it, I see it; an abyss has opened between us.—But, Nora, can it never be filled up?
#NORA.
As I now am, I am no wife for you.
#HELMER.
I have strength to become another man.
#NORA.
Perhaps—when your doll is taken away from you.
#HELMER.
To part—to part from you! No, Nora, no; I can’t grasp the thought.
#NORA.
The more reason for the thing to happen.
#HELMER.
Nora, Nora, not now! Wait till to - morrow.
#NORA.
I can’t spend the night in a strange man’s house.
#HELMER.
But can we not live here, as brother and sister——?
#NORA.
You know very well that wouldn’t last long. Goodbye, Torvald. No, I won’t go to the children. I know they are in better hands than mine. As I now am, I can be nothing to them.
#HELMER.
But some time, Nora—some time——?
#NORA.
How can I tell? I have no idea what will become of me.
#HELMER.
But you are my wife, now and always!
#NORA.
Listen, Torvald—when a wife leaves her husband’s house, as I am doing, I have heard that in the eyes of the law he is free from all duties towards her. At any rate, I release you from all duties. You must not feel yourself bound, any more than I shall. There must be perfect freedom on both sides. There, I give you back your ring. Give me mine.
#HELMER.
That too?
#NORA.
That too.
#HELMER.
Here it is.
#NORA.
Very well. Now it is all over. I lay the keys here. The servants know about everything in the house—better than I do. To - morrow, when I have started, Christina will come to pack up the things I brought with me from home. I will have them sent after me.
#HELMER.
All over! all over! Nora, will you never think of me again?
#NORA.
Oh, I shall often think of you, and the children, and this house.
#HELMER.
May I write to you, Nora?
#NORA.
No—never. You must not.
#HELMER.
But I must send you——
#NORA.
Nothing, nothing.
#HELMER.
I must help you if you need it.
#NORA.
No, I say. I take nothing from strangers.
#HELMER.
Nora—can I never be more than a stranger to you?
#NORA.
Oh, Torvald, then the miracle of miracles would have to happen——
#HELMER.
What is the miracle of miracles?
#NORA.
Both of us would have to change so that——Oh, Torvald, I no longer believe in miracles.
#HELMER.
But I will believe. Tell me! We must so change that——?
#NORA.
That communion between us shall be a marriage. Good - bye.
#HELMER.
Nora! Nora! Empty. She is gone. Ah! The miracle of miracles——?!
