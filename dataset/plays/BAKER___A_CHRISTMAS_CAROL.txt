#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Here, you! don't you do it; don't you do it! Haven't I told you, that, if you venture to waste my coals, 'twill be necessary for us to part? Haven't I?
#FREDERICK.
A merry Christmas, uncle! Ha, ha, ha! A merry Christmas! God save you!
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Bah! humbug!
#FREDERICK.
Christmas a humbug, uncle? You don't mean that, I'm sure.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
I do. Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas - time to but a time for paying bills without money,—a time for finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer? Bah! If I had my will, every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas" on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and burned with a stake of holly through his heart, he should.
#FREDERICK.
Uncle!
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Nephew, keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.
#FREDERICK.
Keep it! But you don't keep it.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Let me leave it alone, then. Much good may it do you! Much good it has ever done you.
#FREDERICK.
There are many good things, from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas - time when it has come round, apart from the veneration due to its sacred origin , as a good time,—a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time,—the only time I know of in the long calendar of the year when men and women seem, by one consent, to open their shut - up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow - travellers to the grave, and not another race of creatures, bound on other journeys. And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Let me hear another sound from you, and you'll keep your Christmas by losing your situation. You're quite a powerful speaker, sir. I wonder you don't go into Parliament.
#FREDERICK.
Don't be angry, uncle. Come, dine with us to - morrow.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
I'll see you— What's the matter with you?
#FREDERICK.
Come, uncle; say "Yes."
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
No.
#FREDERICK.
But why? why?
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Why did you get married?
#FREDERICK.
Because I fell in love.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Because you fell in love! Good afternoon.
#FREDERICK.
Nay, uncle, you never came to see me before that happened. Why give it as a reason for not coming now?
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Good afternoon.
#FREDERICK.
I want nothing from you: I ask nothing from you. Why cannot we be friends?
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Good afternoon.
#FREDERICK.
I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. But I have made the trial, in homage to Christmas; and I'll keep my Christmas humor to the last. So a merry Christmas, uncle!
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Good afternoon.
#FREDERICK.
And a happy new year!
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Good afternoon.
#FREDERICK.
Bob Cratchit, a merry Christmas!
#BOB CRATCHIT.
A merry Christmas, sir. God bless it!
#FREDERICK.
Ay, God bless it! and a happy new year.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
And a happy new year, sir; God bless that too!
#FREDERICK.
Ay, ay, Bob; God bless that too.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Here, you!
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Yes, sir.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
You'll want all day to - morrow, I suppose?
#BOB CRATCHIT.
If quite convenient, sir.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
It's not convenient, and it's not fair. If I was to stop half - a - crown for it, you'd think yourself mightily ill - used, I'll be bound.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
Yes, sir.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
And yet you don't think me ill - used, when I pay a day's wages for no work.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
It's only once a year, sir. poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty - fifth day of December. Well, you can't have it.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
But, sir—
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
You can't have it. I shall expect you here earlier to - morrow.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
But, sir—
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
No more. Go!
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
There's another fellow, my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking about a "merry Christmas!" I'll retire to Bedlam. I don't make merry myself at Christmas, and I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the prisons and the workhouses. They cost enough, and those who are badly off can go there. Merry Christmas! Pooh! bah! humbug, humbug! Mercy! what's that? How now? What do you want with me?
#JACOB MARLEY.
Much.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Who are you?
#JACOB MARLEY.
Ask me who I was.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Who were you, then?
#JACOB MARLEY.
In life, I was your partner, Jacob Marley.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Can—can you sit down?
#JACOB MARLEY.
I can.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Do it, then.
#JACOB MARLEY.
You don't believe in me.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
I don't.
#JACOB MARLEY.
What evidence would you have of my reality, beyond that of your senses?
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
I don't know.
#JACOB MARLEY.
Why do you doubt your senses?
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Because a little thing affects them. A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested blot of beef, a bit of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There's more of gravy than grave about you, whatever you are. Mercy! Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me? Why do spirits walk the earth? and why do they come to me?
#JACOB MARLEY.
It is required of every man, that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellow - men, and travel far and wide; and, if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so after death. My spirit never walked beyond the counting - house. Mark me! in life my spirit never moved beyond the narrow limits of our money - changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Seven years dead, and travelling all the time! You travel fast.
#JACOB MARLEY.
On the wings of the wind.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
You might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years.
#JACOB MARLEY.
Oh, blind man! blind man! not to know that ages of incessant labor by immortal creatures for this earth, must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed; not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life's opportunities misused. Yet I was like this man. I once was like this man.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
But you were always a good man of business, Jacob.
#JACOB MARLEY.
Business! Mankind was my business. The common welfare was my business. Charity, mercy, forbearance, benevolence, were all my business. Hear me; my time is nearly gone.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
I will; but don't be hard upon me. Don't be flowery, Jacob, pray.
#JACOB MARLEY.
I am here to - night, to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate; a chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
You were always a good friend to me. Thank'ee.
#JACOB MARLEY.
You will be haunted by three spirits.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob? I—I think I'd rather not.
#JACOB MARLEY.
Without their visits you cannot hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first to - night, when the bell tolls one. Expect the second to - morrow night at the same hour; the third upon the next night, when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Are you the spirit whose coming was foretold to me?
#SPIRIT.
I am.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Who and what are you?
#SPIRIT.
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Long past?
#SPIRIT.
No: your past. The things that you will see with me are shadows of the things that have been. They will have no consciousness of us.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
What business brought you here?
#SPIRIT.
Your welfare. Look!
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
It is myself. Why, it's Ali Baba! It's dear, old, honest Ali Baba. Yes, yes; I know. One day, Christmas - time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come here the first time, just like that poor boy. There's Robinson. There's the parrot,—green body and yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is. Poor Robin Crusoe, he called him, when he came home after sailing round the island. "Poor Robin Crusoe! Where have you been, Robin Crusoe?" Ah! poor boy, poor boy! I wish —but it's too late now.
#SPIRIT.
What is the matter?
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Nothing, nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something. That's all.
#SPIRIT.
Let us see another Christmas. , "Sir Roger de Coverley." The characters should be all ready, and take their places, instantly the curtain falls on the previous picture, as the time is very short.)
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Why, it's Fezziwig,—bless his old heart!—my master Fezziwig alive again; and there's Dick Wilkins, to be sure. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear! those were happy times. How grateful we were! small matter, to make these silly people so full of gratitude.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Small?
#SPIRIT.
Why, is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money,—three or four, perhaps. Is that so much, that he deserves this praise?
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
It isn't that, Spirit. He has the power to make his people happy or unhappy,—to make their service light or burdensome, a pleasure or a toil. The happiness he gives is quite as great as though it cost a fortune.
#SPIRIT.
What is the matter?
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Nothing particular.
#SPIRIT.
Something, I think.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
No, no. I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now: that's all.
#SPIRIT.
My time grows short. Quick!
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Again myself.
#SPIRIT.
Listen.
#MARY.
It matters little—to you, very little. Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have no just cause to grieve.
#YOUTH.
What idol has displaced you? golden one. You fear the world too much. I have seen your noble aspirations fall off, one by one, until the master passion—gain—engrosses you; have I not?
#YOUTH.
What then? Even if I have grown so much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you. Have I ever sought release from our engagement?
#MARY.
In words, no. Never.
#YOUTH.
In what, then?
#MARY.
In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another atmosphere of life, another hope as its great end. If you were free to - day, to - morrow, yesterday, can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl? or, choosing her, do I not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you, with a full heart, for the love of him you once were.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Spirit, remove me from this place.
#SPIRIT.
I told you these were shadows of the things that have been. That they are what they are, do not blame me.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Away, I say! I cannot bear it. Leave me. Away, away! Haunt me no longer! Stave TWO. LIVELY MUSIC. CURTAIN RISES, SHOWING SCROOGE'S office, as before. SCROOGE sitting in chair, looking at back stage, the curtains of which are drawn, disclosing the GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT, who sits upon a seat covered with red, his right arm leaning upon a barrel. In his lap is a bowl of steaming punch; in his left hand, a torch ; round him are strewn articles, such as are given for presents. After a few seconds, CHRISTMAS PRESENT rises, and comes forward. The curtains close.
#SPIRIT.
Look up, look up, and know me better, man. I am the Ghost of Christmas Present. Look upon me. You have never seen the like of me before?
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Never.
#SPIRIT.
Have never walked forth with the younger members of my family; meaning my elders born in these later years?
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
I don't think I have. I'm afraid I have not. Have you had many brothers, Spirit?
#SPIRIT.
More than eighteen hundred. tremendous family to provide for. Spirit, show me what you will. Last night I learnt a lesson which is working now. To - night, if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.
#SPIRIT.
Look well upon the pictures I disclose.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
It's my clerk, Bob Cratchit.
#SPIRIT.
Ay, Bob Cratchit, who pockets on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blesses his four - roomed house with the sprinklings of his torch.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
A merry Christmas to us all, my dears! God bless us!
#ALL.
God bless us!
#TINY TIM.
God bless us, every one!
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.
#SPIRIT.
I see a vacant seat in the poor chimney - corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the future, the child will die.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
No, no! Oh, no, kind Spirit; say he will be spared.
#SPIRIT.
If these shadows remain unaltered by the future, none other of my race will find him here. What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
My very words, when I was asked to give a trifle for the poor!
#SPIRIT.
Man,—if man you be in heart, not adamant,—forbear that wretched cant until you have discovered what the surplus is, and where it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that, in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless, and less fit to live, than this poor man's child.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
He must live! he must live! Poor Bob! poor Bob!
#SPIRIT.
Come; look upon another picture.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Fred's house!
#SPIRIT.
Ay, your nephew, making merry. If you listen, you will hear him say of his Uncle Scrooge, "He may rail at Christmas till he dies; but he can't help thinking better of it—I defy him—if he finds me going there in good temper, year after year, and saying, 'Uncle Scrooge, how are you?'"
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
And I refused his invitation,—I refused it! I couldn't do it again, if I had the chance. O Fred, Fred! A merry Christmas, and God bless you! office, as before. Back curtains drawn. The GHOST OF CHRISTMAS FUTURE standing, R., pointing down; SCROOGE beside him, L. Mournful music.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, Ghost of the Future, I fear you more than any spectre I have seen; but as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I have borne you company, and did it with a thankful heart. Spectre, something informs me that our parting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not how. Tell me who that man was with the covered face, whom we saw lying dead, of whom the merchants in the street spoke so carelessly, at whom the vultures of the dead sneered and jested. Before I draw near to that stone to which you point, answer me one question. Are these the shadows of the things that will be? or are they shadows of things that may be, only? Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead; but, if the courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is thus with what you show me. Am I that man who lay upon the bed? No, Spirit! Oh, no, no! Spirit, hear me! I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope? Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me, by an altered life. I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the past, the present, and the future. The spirits of all these shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone! What's this, my own office! Hallo! what's to - day?
#BOY.
Eh?
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
What's to - day, my fine fellow?
#BOY.
To - day? Why, Christmas Day.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
It's Christmas Day. I haven't missed it. Hallo, my fine fellow!
#BOY.
Hallo!
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Do you know the poulterer's, in the next street but one, at the corner?
#BOY.
I should hope I did.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
An intelligent boy; a remarkable boy! Do you know whether they've sold the prize turkey that was hanging up there? Not the little prize turkey, the big one.
#BOY.
What! the one as big as me?
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Ha, ha, ha! What a delightful boy! It's a pleasure to talk to him. Yes, my buck.
#BOY.
It's hanging there now.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Is it? Go and buy it.
#BOY.
Walk - er.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
No, no: I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell 'em to bring it here, that I may give them the directions. Come back with the man, and I'll give you a shilling. Come back with him in less than five minutes, and I'll give you half - a - crown. What a delightful boy! See him run! I'll send him to Bob Cratchit's. He sha'n't know who sent it. It's twice the size of Tiny Tim. Joe Miller never made such a joke as sending it to Bob's will be. I forget he's to be here to - day. Oh, if he'd only come late! Here he is, sure enough! Hallo! what do you mean by coming here at this time of day?
#BOB CRATCHIT.
I am very sorry, sir. I am behind my time.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
You are? Yes, I think you are. Step this way, if you please.
#BOB CRATCHIT.
I'm very sorry—
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Are you? What do you mean by coming here at this time? Now, I'll tell you what, my man; I'm not going to stand this thing any longer; and therefore I'm about to raise your salary. A merry Christmas, Bob! A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year. I'll raise your salary, and endeavor to assist your struggling family; and we'll discuss your affairs to - morrow over a Christmas bowl of sparkling bishop, Bob. Home to your family, and have a merry Christmas, and in the morning make up the fires, and buy a second coal - scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit.
#FREDERICK.
A merry Christmas! Here I am again, uncle.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
A merry Christmas, Fred! I'm going to dine with you.
#FREDERICK.
That's right, uncle. You'll find a merry company.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
You can't tell me. I know 'em all. My niece, Plumper, the fat sister. Wonderful party! wonderful games! wonderful unanimity! wonderful happiness!
#FREDERICK.
We'll have a merry Christmas.
#EBENEZER SCROOGE.
Ay, that we will. Henceforth I will honor Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the past, the present, and the future. The spirits of all three shall strive within me. God bless us all!
#FREDERICK.
God bless us all!
#BOB CRATCHIT.
God bless us all!
