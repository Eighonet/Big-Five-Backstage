#BARLOW.
Is Mrs. O’Farrell not here?
#PEYTON.
No, sir.
#BARLOW.
H’m.... Will you let her know I’ve come?
#PEYTON.
Mrs. O’Farrell is not at home, sir.
#BARLOW.
Not at home?... But....
#PEYTON.
Mrs. O’Farrell said, would you kindly sit down and make yourself comfortable? And I was to give you the Morning Post.]
#BARLOW.
I can’t imagine why Mrs. O’Farrell should think I haven’t read the Morning Post at six o’clock in the evening.
#PEYTON.
And Mrs. O’Farrell said, will you have a whisky and soda, sir?
#BARLOW.
But when is Mrs. O’Farrell coming in?
#PEYTON.
I don’t know at all, sir.
#BARLOW.
But she telegraphed to me this afternoon, asking me to come and see her at once.
#PEYTON.
Yes, sir; I took the telegram to the post office myself.
#BARLOW.
It seems very extraordinary that she should have gone out. The matter was of considerable importance.
#PEYTON.
Yes, sir.
#BARLOW.
Very well, I’ll sit down and wait. But I can’t stay long. I’m dining at ... no matter.
#PEYTON.
Very good, sir.
#BARLOW.
Oh, thank you. Did you say you had the Morning Post?
#PEYTON.
Yes, sir.
#BARLOW.
Ah, thank you.
#BARLOW.
The Duchess of St. Erth returned to Wales yesterday. The Marchioness of Mereston has arrived at 89 Grosvenor Square. The Marchioness of Serlo and Lady Eleanor King leave for Paris this morning.
#PEYTON.
Mrs. Golightly.
#BARLOW.
Isabel!
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Are you here, Davenport? Where’s Penelope?
#BARLOW.
She’s out!
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Out?
#PEYTON.
Mrs. O’Farrell said, would you kindly sit down and make yourself comfortable, ma’am? And I was to bring you the Church Times.]
#BARLOW.
But....
#PEYTON.
And Mrs. O’Farrell said, will you have a strong cup of tea, ma’am?
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
I’m surprised that Mrs. O’Farrell should have gone out, because she expected me.
#PEYTON.
Yes, ma’am.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
What is this?
#PEYTON.
The Church Times, ma’am.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Oh, thank you.... I think I will have a cup of tea, please.
#PEYTON.
Very good, ma’am.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
I wonder why on earth Penelope should insist on my reading the Church Times.]
#BARLOW.
I’ve just had a telegram from her.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
So have I, asking me to come at once. Perhaps we shall find some explanation in the Church Times.]
#BARLOW.
Nonsense. What can the Church Times have to do with the Archduchess Anastasia?
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
My dear Davenport, what are you talking about?
#PEYTON.
Professor Golightly.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Hulloa, Davenport! My dear, you’re the last person I expected to find here. I thought there was a meeting of the Missionary Society at the Albert Hall.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Oh, thank you.
#PEYTON.
Mrs. O’Farrell said, will you have a glass of barley - water, sir?
#GOLIGHTLY.
Barley - water!
#PEYTON.
And I was to bring you the Athenæum. We couldn’t get this week’s, sir, but this is last week’s, and Mrs. O’Farrell hopes it will do as well.
#GOLIGHTLY.
It’s very kind of you to have taken so much trouble.
#PEYTON.
Thank you, sir.
#GOLIGHTLY.
What on earth does Penelope want me to do with last week’s Athenæum and a glass of barley - water?
#BARLOW.
Well, presumably she wants you to drink the one and to read the other.
#GOLIGHTLY.
My dear, I think it’s very hard that you should have brought up our only child on the idea that my favourite form of refreshment is barley - water.
#BARLOW.
It looks as if Penelope expected you, too.
#GOLIGHTLY.
I’ve just had a wire from her.
#BARLOW.
Have you? I wonder why on earth she wired to you.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
It’s so extraordinary that she shouldn’t be here. It makes me feel very nervous.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Well, frankly, I couldn’t make head or tail of it, so I jumped into a motor cab and came round from the club at once.
#PEYTON.
Mr. Beadsworth.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Well, I’m hanged.
#BARLOW.
My dear Charles, I wish you wouldn’t be slangy. It’s gone out in our set.
#BEADSWORTH.
I’ve just had a telegram from Penelope asking me to come at once. Will you let Mrs. O’Farrell know I’m here?
#GOLIGHTLY.
She’s out.
#PEYTON.
Mrs. O’Farrell said, would you make yourself comfortable, sir, and we’ve got the Law Times if you’d like to read it, and will you have a glass of port, sir?
#GOLIGHTLY.
By all means have a glass of port, and I’ll swop it for my barley - water.
#BEADSWORTH.
Thank you.
#PEYTON.
Very good, sir.
#BEADSWORTH.
What does she want me to do with the Law Times?
#GOLIGHTLY.
I asked the same question when Peyton handed me last week’s Athenæum, and Davenport, with the perspicacity that distinguishes him, answered: read it.
#BEADSWORTH.
Can you tell me what Penelope wants? Her telegram suggested that she wished to see me not as an old friend, but in my official capacity as the family solicitor.
#GOLIGHTLY.
I haven’t an idea. I thought her telegram most mysterious.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
I wish she’d come in. I’m beginning to be dreadfully uneasy.
#BARLOW.
I think I can put your minds at rest. I am in a position to explain the whole matter to you. The telegram she sent me makes it perfectly clear. I daresay you know that the Archduchess Anastasia is a patient of Dickie’s. And a very nice patient for him to have. I’ve never met her, though I happen to know several members of her family, and she’s a very cultivated, pleasant woman. I’ve always said to Dickie that that is the sort of practice he ought to get. The middle classes do a doctor no good.
#GOLIGHTLY.
My dear Davenport, do go on with your story.
#BARLOW.
Well, it appears that the Archduchess Anastasia has signified her desire to know Penelope. Very charming and graceful action on her part, and just like her. Of course she’s extremely grateful to Dickie for all he’s done. He’s worked a miraculous cure, and I daresay she’s heard that Penelope is my niece. It’s a maxim you can always go on: royalty knows everything. And the long and the short of it is that she’s coming to lunch here. Of course Penelope knows nothing about these matters, and in a state of great excitement she’s sent for me. It’s the best thing she could do. I can tell her everything. I’ve lived in that set all my life. It’s nothing to be particularly proud about - mere accident of birth - I happen to be a gentleman. A certain family. Well, there it is, you see.
#GOLIGHTLY.
But do you mean to say that Penelope wired all that to you? It must have cost her a perfect fortune.
#BARLOW.
She put it a little more briefly, of course, but that was the gist of it.
#BEADSWORTH.
I can’t imagine why she should send for me because a royalty is coming to luncheon with her. It was very inconvenient to get away. I had a dozen people waiting to see me, and I was obliged to slip out by the back door in order to avoid them.
#GOLIGHTLY.
But what are the exact words of the wire she sent you, Davenport?
#BARLOW.
You can see it if you like. “Come at once. Archduchess Anastasia. Penelope.”
#GOLIGHTLY.
But d’you mean to say that you made up all that story out of those three words?
#BARLOW.
Penelope knew I had a certain amount of intelligence. She didn’t want to waste her money, so she just put what was essential, and left me to gather the rest.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
But my telegram says nothing about the Archduchess Anastasia.
#BARLOW.
What did Penelope say to you?
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
“Come at once! Grave scandal! Central African Mission. Penelope.”
#BARLOW.
But that’s absurd. You know how stupid the Post Office is. They must have made a mistake. I know that the Pomeranian Royal Family is very odd, but there are limits, and I can’t imagine the Archduchess Anastasia being mixed up in a scandal with a Central African missionary.
#BEADSWORTH.
Well, my wire merely said: “Come at once; six and eightpence. Penelope.”
#BARLOW.
Six and eightpence! Why six and eightpence?
#BEADSWORTH.
I don’t know. That is why I lost no time in coming.
#GOLIGHTLY.
My impression is that the Archduchess Anastasia, instead of paying Dickie’s bill for miraculously curing her, has eloped with a missionary, and Penelope, by aid of the law , wants to recover the money.
#BARLOW.
It’s nonsense! You’re so unpractical, Charles.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
But you had a telegram too, dear.
#GOLIGHTLY.
“Come at once. Decimal 7035. Penelope.”
#BARLOW.
How very odd.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Penelope.
#THE OTHERS.
Penelope.
#PENELOPE.
Good evening, mamma!
#BARLOW.
Well?
#PENELOPE.
Well, papa.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Now, Penelope.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, Mr. Beadsworth, how nice of you to come. Kiss me, Uncle Davenport.
#PENELOPE.
Thank you.... Was your whisky and soda quite right? And the port? Father, you haven’t touched the barley - water. You ungrateful old thing!
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
My dear, for goodness’ sake explain.
#BARLOW.
Where have you been all this time?
#PENELOPE.
I - I’ve been sitting in the consulting - room. I watched you all come in.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Peyton said you were out.
#BARLOW.
Really, Penelope, I think your behaviour is outrageous.
#PENELOPE.
You see, I thought if I saw you one after the other as you came in, I should have to make four scenes instead of one. It would have been very exhausting and not nearly so effective.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Are you going to make a scene?
#PENELOPE.
I’m going to make a dreadful scene in a minute.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Now, my dear, before you go any further, for goodness’ sake tell us what you meant by your telegrams.
#PENELOPE.
Well, you see, I wanted you all to come immediately, and I thought the best thing was to trail your ruling passions under your noses.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Do you understand what she means, Charles?
#PENELOPE.
My dear mother, it’s the simplest thing in the world. You spend your life in converting the heathen - from a distance - and I knew if I mentioned the Central African Mission you’d fly here on the wings of the wind.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
In point of fact I came in an omnibus. But do you mean to tell me that there has been no scandal in connection with the Central African Mission?
#PENELOPE.
I’m dreadfully sorry to disappoint you, mother.
#GOLIGHTLY.
And what in heaven’s name made you wire decimal 7035 to me?
#PENELOPE.
Oh, that’s our telephone number, and I just put decimal instead of Gerrard.
#GOLIGHTLY.
I thought the figures were strangely familiar.
#PENELOPE.
And there you are, you see.
#BARLOW.
I think it’s a capital idea. And she just flung the words six and eightpence at you, Beadsworth, and knew she’d fetch the lawyer.
#PENELOPE.
You’re not cross with me, are you?
#BARLOW.
And now, my dear, that you’ve disposed of them, tell me all about the Archduchess Anastasia.
#PENELOPE.
The Archduchess Anastasia? But I invented her.
#BARLOW.
What d’you mean, you invented her? I know her well, I’ve known her for years. I know her whole family.
#PENELOPE.
Well, you see - I wanted you to come, too. And....
#BARLOW.
I don’t understand what you mean at all, Penelope. You mention one of my most intimate friends, and then you tell me you invented her.
#PENELOPE.
I’m awfully sorry. I really didn’t know there was such a person, and I thought I’d made her up out of my own head.... I think it was rather clever of me to hit upon some one you know so well.
#BARLOW.
I don’t know why you should think the mere mention of the Archduchess’s name would make me come here.
#PENELOPE.
Well, you see, I know that you go out a great deal, and you know such crowds of people. I felt quite sure that if there were an Archduchess Anastasia you’d know her, and well, there it is you see.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Now, Penelope, tell us what you really do want.
#PENELOPE.
I want to divorce Dickie.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
What!
#GOLIGHTLY.
My dear child.
#BARLOW.
Good gracious!
#PENELOPE.
I intended to make such a scene, and now you’ve made me blurt it all out in three words.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
But I don’t understand.
#PENELOPE.
I’ll say it again, shall I? I want to divorce Dickie.
#BEADSWORTH.
You don’t really mean it, do you?
#PENELOPE.
Of course I mean it. I’m never going to speak to him again. That’s to say, I shall have a scene with him first. I’m quite determined to have a scene with somebody.
#GOLIGHTLY.
And where is Dickie now?
#PENELOPE.
He’s on his way home with the usual story. Oh, if you only knew how utterably miserable I am.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
My darling, is it really serious?
#PENELOPE.
Oh, what can I do to make you all understand?
#GOLIGHTLY.
The best way would be to begin at the beginning, and tell us all about it coherently.
#BARLOW.
My dear Charles, this is not the kind of matter in which you can be of any use. You’re a mathematician, and you’re not expected to know anything about practical affairs.
#GOLIGHTLY.
I apologise profusely.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Darling?
#PENELOPE.
Well, the first thing is that I simply dote upon Dickie. I’ve never loved any one else, and I never shall.
#BEADSWORTH.
That’s a very satisfactory confession after four years of matrimony.
#PENELOPE.
Five years, three months, and two days. And every day I’ve loved Dickie more.
#BEADSWORTH.
I’ve never seen a more devoted couple.
#PENELOPE.
We’ve never had a quarrel. We’ve never even been cross with one another. It’s been a honeymoon that’s never come to an end.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Well?
#PENELOPE.
And now I’ve discovered that he’s been lying to me for the last month. He’s been coming home dreadfully late, and when I’ve asked him where he’s been, he’s said that he had to see a patient who was very ill - such an interesting case - and it worried him so much that he was obliged to go to his club and have a rubber to settle his nerves. And the interesting case and the rubber of bridge are Ada Fergusson.
#BARLOW.
But who is Ada Fergusson? I’ve never heard of her.
#PENELOPE.
Ada Fergusson’s a great friend of mine. And I hate her. I always knew she was a cat. For the last four weeks Dickie’s been spending every afternoon with her from four till seven.
#GOLIGHTLY.
But do you always ask your husband where he’s been when he comes in?
#PENELOPE.
My dear papa, what has that got to do with it? We all know that you’re an old dear, and the greatest mathematician in the world, but you know nothing about life at all.
#GOLIGHTLY.
I apologise again.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Give him a sheet of paper and a pencil, Penelope, and he’ll amuse himself by doing sums while we talk the matter out.
#PENELOPE.
There you are, papa.
#BEADSWORTH.
But how did you find out?
#PENELOPE.
Oh, what does it matter how I found out! I’ve got all sorts of proofs.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
You could knock me down with a feather.
#GOLIGHTLY.
My dear!
#BARLOW.
I am not in the least surprised.
#PENELOPE.
Uncle Davenport!
#BARLOW.
I have expected it all along. You will remember, Isabel, that I was against the marriage from the beginning. I said, one doesn’t marry a doctor. One sometimes meets them in society when they’ve had their angles rubbed off a little and perhaps have been knighted, but one never meets their wives. We suppose they do marry, but they don’t marry any one we know. I may be old - fashioned, but I stick to my opinion that there are only three possible professions for a gentleman, the law, the army, and the church.
#PENELOPE.
My dear Uncle Davenport, you’re talking nonsense.
#BARLOW.
You ask me for my opinion, and I give it you. I regret that you should think it nonsense.
#BEADSWORTH.
And what are you proposing to do now?
#PENELOPE.
I’m never going to live with Dickie again. As soon as I’ve seen him I shall leave this house for ever.
#BEADSWORTH.
You’re proposing to have a few words with him?
#PENELOPE.
Several. I’m going to tell him that I despise him, and that I hate him; I’m going to throw my wedding ring in his face, and then I shall sweep out of the room.
#BEADSWORTH.
Have you really made up your mind that you won’t forgive him?
#PENELOPE.
Nothing would induce me ever to speak to him again if it weren’t that I want to tell him exactly what I think of him.
#BARLOW.
Besides, you’ve got your family to think of. Of course you must leave him. You see, that is what I say, you’re not safe with people of no birth. I look upon all this as a blessing in disguise.
#BEADSWORTH.
Do you wish to bring an action for judicial separation?
#PENELOPE.
My dear Mr. Beadsworth, what are you talking about! I’m going to divorce him. I’m going to make an awful scandal.
#BEADSWORTH.
Well, I suppose we could arrange that at a pinch with the help of the newspapers. Has he ever been cruel to you?
#PENELOPE.
Good heavens, no! That’s what makes me so angry. The last month he’s been more perfectly charming and delightful than ever. Oh, I wish I could do something really unpleasant to Ada Fergusson. Something with boiling oil in it.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
I am shocked, frankly shocked. I would never have thought that Dickie could be so wicked.
#BARLOW.
Family life in England is going to the dogs. That is the long and short of it.
#PENELOPE.
Mother, a dreadful thing has happened. Papa has suddenly become a drivelling lunatic.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
My dear, what are you saying?
#PENELOPE.
He’s been adding two and two together all over that piece of paper, and he makes it five every time.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Charles!
#PENELOPE.
Look.
#BARLOW.
Two and two are five. Two and two are five.
#BEADSWORTH.
Two and two are five. Two and two are five.
#BARLOW.
I knew this would happen. I’ve been expecting it for years.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Charles, pull yourself together.
#PENELOPE.
Papa, you don’t really think that two and two are five?
#GOLIGHTLY.
On the contrary, I’m convinced that two and two are four.
#PENELOPE.
Then why on earth have you made it five?
#GOLIGHTLY.
Do you know why you buy Pears’ soap?
#PENELOPE.
I expect you’ve been working too hard, father dear. Why don’t you go and lie down for half an hour? And when Dickie comes in he’ll give you a tonic.
#GOLIGHTLY.
You buy Pears’ soap because you’re told on fifty thousand hoardings that it’s matchless for the complexion.
#PENELOPE.
That’s not funny, papa, that’s silly.
#GOLIGHTLY.
You’ve only got to say a thing often enough, and all the world will believe it. And when the world believes it, it’s very hard to say if it’s true or not.
#PENELOPE.
What has that got to do with two and two?
#GOLIGHTLY.
I thought if I wrote “two and two are five” often enough I might come to think it true.
#PENELOPE.
But if you wrote it a million times it wouldn’t be any truer.
#GOLIGHTLY.
That is the conclusion I’m regretfully forced to.
#PENELOPE.
Well?
#GOLIGHTLY.
The whole of life is merely a matter of adding two and two together and getting the right answer.
#BARLOW.
My dear Charles, if you’re going to discuss life I think there’s no need for me to stay. I’ve told you for twenty years that you’re a scholar and a recluse. I have lived in the world, and I’m a practical man. If Penelope wants to consult me, I am at her service; if not....
#PENELOPE.
Hold your tongue, Uncle Davenport.
#BARLOW.
Really, Penelope.
#GOLIGHTLY.
During the last five years I’ve seen you adding two and two together and making them about seventy - nine.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
I don’t know what you’re talking about, Charles. Dickie’s behaviour is abominable, and there are no excuses for him. It’s a mere matter of common morality.
#GOLIGHTLY.
My dear, I have no objection to you talking common morality if you’ll let me talk common sense.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
My dear Charles, they’re the same thing.
#PENELOPE.
If you think you can make me forgive Dickie by telling me that you were a wicked old thing yourself in your youth, I may as well tell you at once that it won’t wash.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
What are you talking about, my dear?
#PENELOPE.
Well, I’ve noticed that when a woman discovers that her husband has been unfaithful, her male relations invariably try to console her by telling her how shockingly they’ve treated their own wives.
#GOLIGHTLY.
My dear, I was going to confess nothing of the sort. I never confess.
#PENELOPE.
Of course, if it were the other way about, and mamma had kicked over the traces a little....
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Darling, can you see me performing an acrobatic feat of that character?
#PENELOPE.
Go on, papa.
#GOLIGHTLY.
I think you’ve treated Dickie shamefully.
#PENELOPE.
I?
#GOLIGHTLY.
If your mother had behaved to me as you’ve behaved to Dickie, I should certainly have taken to drink.
#PENELOPE.
But I’ve been a perfect angel. I’ve simply worshipped the ground he walked on. I’ve loved him as no man was ever loved before.
#GOLIGHTLY.
No man could stand it.
#PENELOPE.
Papa, what do you mean?
#GOLIGHTLY.
My dear, you’ve loved him morning, noon, and night. You’ve loved him when he talked, and you’ve loved him when he was silent. You’ve loved him walking, you’ve loved him eating, you’ve loved him sleeping. He’s never been able to escape from your love.
#PENELOPE.
But I couldn’t help it.
#GOLIGHTLY.
You need not have shown it.
#PENELOPE.
And do you mean to say that justifies him in philandering with Ada Fergusson?
#GOLIGHTLY.
It excuses him.
#PENELOPE.
What beasts men must be!
#GOLIGHTLY.
No; but strange as it may seem to you, they’re human beings. When you were a child you doted on strawberry ices.
#PENELOPE.
I dote on them still.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Would you like to eat strawberry ice for breakfast, lunch, tea, and dinner every day for a month?
#PENELOPE.
Good heavens! the thought fills me with horror.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Poor Dickie has lived on strawberry ice for five years. It’s been his only means of sustenance.
#PENELOPE.
Oh!
#GOLIGHTLY.
You’ve never let him go out without coming into the hall to put on his hat and kiss him good - bye; he’s never come into the house without you running down to help him off with his coat and kiss him welcome. When he sat down after breakfast in the morning to read his paper and smoke his pipe, I’ve seen you sit down on the arm of his chair and put your arm round his neck.
#BARLOW.
Penelope!
#PENELOPE.
Do you think it was very awful?
#BARLOW.
My dear child!
#PENELOPE.
Did Mrs. Beadsworth never sit on the arm of your chair when you were smoking your pipe?
#BEADSWORTH.
I must confess I’m thankful my wife occupied those moments in attending to her household duties.
#PENELOPE.
You are a lot of horrid old things. I ask you to come here to sympathise with me, and you’re perfectly brutal to me.
#BARLOW.
My dear Penelope, there are limits.
#PENELOPE.
Well, I don’t care; I’m going to divorce him.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Let’s do another little simple addition, shall we? Perhaps two and two will make four a second time.
#PENELOPE.
I don’t know that I much like being a mathematician’s daughter.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Don’t you think, instead of divorcing your husband, it would be better to win back his affection?
#PENELOPE.
I don’t want his affection.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Are you sure you wouldn’t if you could get it?
#PENELOPE.
Papa, d’you think I ever could win back his love? You say I’ve lost it through my own fault. Oh, I don’t know what to do without him. I’ve been so wretched since I knew. I’ve tried to put a cheerful face on it, but if you knew what I feel in my heart.... Oh, the brutes, why didn’t they hide it from me?
#BARLOW.
My dear Penelope, I expected you to have more spirit. He’s a person of no family. I should have thought you were well rid of him.
#PENELOPE.
Uncle Davenport, if you say a word against him, I will immediately have an attack of hysterics.
#BARLOW.
What you expect your father to be able to tell you I can’t imagine.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings, Davenport....
#BARLOW.
I shouldn’t have thought one could describe you as either. But, in any case, I can stay no longer.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, no, don’t go yet, Uncle Davenport.
#BARLOW.
It appears that my advice is not wanted, and I promised to look in on dear Lady Hollington before dinner.
#PENELOPE.
Do telephone to her that you can’t come. You’ll find a telephone in my sitting - room.
#BARLOW.
I’m too indulgent. People don’t rate me at my proper value.
#PENELOPE.
Papa, say you’ll get Dickie back for me. I want him. I want him.
#GOLIGHTLY.
My dear, it’s very simple. It merely requires a great deal of tact, a great deal of courage, and a great deal of self - control.
#PENELOPE.
Nothing else? good deal. You must never let yourself out of hand; you must keep guard on your tongue and your eyes and your smiles - and your temper.
#PENELOPE.
I think you said it was very simple.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Is Ada Fergusson pretty?
#PENELOPE.
No, she’s perfectly hideous.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Is she? That makes it more serious.
#PENELOPE.
Why?
#GOLIGHTLY.
If a man falls in love with a pretty woman, he falls out of it. But if he falls in love with a plain one, he’ll be in love with her all his life.
#PENELOPE.
You take a load off my mind. Ada Fergusson’s extremely attractive.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Then you’ll get him back.
#PENELOPE.
Tell me exactly what to do, and I’ll do it.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Give him his head.
#PENELOPE.
Is that all?
#GOLIGHTLY.
It means a good deal. When he comes in, don’t make a scene, but be charming to him. For once, don’t ask him where he’s been. When he leaves you, don’t ask him where he’s going, nor at what time he’ll be back. Don’t let him know that you have the least suspicion that anything has happened. On the contrary, take every opportunity of throwing him into Ada Fergusson’s society.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Charles, you’re asking Penelope to connive at immorality.
#GOLIGHTLY.
When every difficulty disappears, Dickie will find half the savour of the intrigue gone. Half your battle is won. Leave the rest to time and Ada Fergusson. Let Ada Fergusson sit on the arm of his chair when he wants to read his paper. Let him account to Ada Fergusson for all his movements. Under such circumstances a woman is always on tenterhooks, and consequently she’s always exacting. Whenever there’s a pause in the conversation, Ada Fergusson will say, Do you care for me as much as ever you did? That speech is the rope around love’s throat. Whenever he wants to go away, Ada Fergusson will implore him to stay five minutes longer. Those five minutes that a man stays against his will are the nails in love’s coffin. Each time he leaves her Ada Fergusson will say, At what time will you be back? That question is the earth shovelled into love’s grave.
#PENELOPE.
Where did you learn all this, father?
#GOLIGHTLY.
It’s a mere matter of adding two and two together, my darling.
#PENELOPE.
I had no idea that mathematics were so interesting - nor so immoral.
#GOLIGHTLY.
What do you think of it?
#PENELOPE.
But if Dickie falls out of love with Ada Fergusson there’s no reason why he should fall in love again with me.
#GOLIGHTLY.
You must make him.
#PENELOPE.
I wish I knew how.
#GOLIGHTLY.
It only requires a little more tact, a little more courage, and a little more self - control.
#PENELOPE.
But if I acquire so many virtues I shan’t be a woman, but a monster, and how can he love me then?
#BEADSWORTH.
There’s a car stopping at the door.
#PENELOPE.
Listen.... I can hear a key being turned. It must be Dickie.
#BEADSWORTH.
What are you going to do?
#PENELOPE.
What do you think, mamma?
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
My dear, I highly disapprove of your father’s idea, and I can’t imagine how it ever came into his head, but I’m bound to say I think there’s some sense in it.
#PENELOPE.
I’ll try. Remember, no one knows anything that has happened. You’ll back me up, mamma, won’t you?
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
You’re not going to ask me to tell a pack of lies, darling?
#PENELOPE.
Only white ones, mother. If there’s a whopper to tell, I’ll tell it myself.
#BEADSWORTH.
But what about Barlow?
#GOLIGHTLY.
He’s a man of the world. He’s sure to put his foot in it.
#PENELOPE.
I’ll settle him.
#PENELOPE.
Ah!
#BARLOW.
I could not get on to her. I don’t know what’s the matter with those telephone girls. Hussies!
#PENELOPE.
Uncle Davenport, I find I’ve been entirely mistaken about Dickie. He’s not to blame in any way.
#BARLOW.
Good gracious me! And Ada Fergusson?
#PENELOPE.
Is, I have no doubt, no worse than anybody else.
#BARLOW.
This is a surprise. How on earth have you come to this conclusion?
#PENELOPE.
By adding two and two together.
#BARLOW.
Upon my word! I must say, it annoys me that I should have been forced to break an important engagement for no reason. I should have thought....
#PENELOPE.
Uncle Davenport, it’s quite bad enough that I should be done out of a scene, but if you’re going to make one it’s more than I can stand.
#BEADSWORTH.
Well, as I can’t be of any more use to you, I think I’ll get back to the bosom of my family.
#PENELOPE.
Of course, I look upon this as a professional visit.
#BEADSWORTH.
Oh, nonsense!
#PENELOPE.
I couldn’t dream of accepting your services for nothing. You must really let me know what I owe you.
#BEADSWORTH.
I really don’t know what to say.
#PENELOPE.
Dickie charges a guinea when he goes to see anybody.
#BEADSWORTH.
You only mentioned six and eightpence in your telegram.
#PENELOPE.
Very well, I’ll owe you that. It would really make me feel more comfortable.
#BEADSWORTH.
You’re not going to hand it over in hard cash?
#PENELOPE.
I wasn’t thinking of paying you. But I’d like to think I owed it you. You see, then, I shan’t feel under any obligation.
#BEADSWORTH.
In that case I surrender. Good - bye.
#PENELOPE.
Good - bye.
#BARLOW.
Good - bye, Beadsworth. You must come and dine with me at the club one of these days.
#BEADSWORTH.
I should like to. Good - bye.
#BARLOW.
Very nice fellow. Quite a gentleman. No one would think he was a solicitor. I shall ask him to dinner with one or two people who don’t matter.
#PENELOPE.
There’s Dickie. D’you hear him whistling? He’s evidently in the best of spirits.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Hulloa! I couldn’t make out what had become of you, Pen.
#PENELOPE.
Why?
#DICKIE BIRD.
You generally come down to meet me when I get in.
#PENELOPE.
My sainted mother is here.
#DICKIE BIRD.
That’s no reason why you should neglect a devoted husband. How is your sainted mother? Hulloa, Uncle Davenport, what price duchesses to - day?
#BARLOW.
I beg your pardon. I don’t know what you mean.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I say, you’ve been doing yourselves rather proud, haven’t you? Who’s been drinking port?
#PENELOPE.
Nobody. It’s an empty glass.
#DICKIE BIRD.
That’s how providence behaves to me. Deliberately puts temptation in my way. It’s simply poison. Gout in my family, you know. My ancestors have lived on colchicum for a hundred years. I feel a tingling in my toes at the mere sight of a bottle of port. And yet I drink it.
#BARLOW.
It’s a great mistake, of course, to think that gout is a mark of good family. The porter of my club is a martyr to it.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Perhaps he’s the illegitimate son of an earl. You should ask him if he has a strawberry mark on his left shoulder. What’s the matter, Pen?
#PENELOPE.
With me?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I thought you seemed a bit under the weather.
#PENELOPE.
Why?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I don’t know. You’re not quite up to your usual form, are you? You’ve not asked me what I’ve been doing to - day. As a rule you’re so interested in my movements.
#PENELOPE.
I thought you’d tell me if you wanted to.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I say, I do think that’s a bit thick. I go slaving my very soul out to provide you with a motor and nice frocks and things, and you don’t take the smallest interest in what I do.
#PENELOPE.
Well, what have you been doing this afternoon?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, I’ve had the very deuce of a day. I’ve got a very interesting case on just now. Taking up a lot of my time. Of course, it worries me rather, but I suppose all these things come in the day’s march. Well, I spent the best part of an hour there.
#PENELOPE.
An hour?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Yes, we had a consultation, you know.
#PENELOPE.
But you had a consultation yesterday.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Yesterday? Yes, she’s a fussy old thing. She’s always wanting consultations.
#PENELOPE.
That’s jolly, isn’t it?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I don’t think it is. It looks as if she hadn’t really confidence in me.
#PENELOPE.
On the other hand, you can charge double, can’t you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Yes, of course, it has that advantage.
#PENELOPE.
I’ve been hankering after an ermine stole for a long time. I shall buy it now.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, but I haven’t been paid yet.
#PENELOPE.
They’ll be only too glad to wait. And it’s such a bargain.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Well, after my consultation I was so fagged that I had to go into the club to have a rubber of Bridge.
#GOLIGHTLY.
By the way, what is the name of your patient?
#DICKIE BIRD.
The name of my patient?
#PENELOPE.
Oh, yes, I was telling papa that you’d got a new patient who was bringing in pots of money. I couldn’t remember her name.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh - er, Mrs. Mac....
#PENELOPE.
Mrs. Mac what?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Mrs. Macnothing.
#BARLOW.
How d’you mean, Mrs. Macnothing? I’ve never heard of a family called Macnothing.
#DICKIE BIRD.
No, of course, her name isn’t Macnothing.
#BARLOW.
But you distinctly said it was Mrs. Macnothing.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Now, my dear Pen, did I say anything about Macnothing?
#PENELOPE.
Well, what is her name then?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’ve been telling you for the last ten minutes. Her name’s Mrs. Mack.
#BARLOW.
Why on earth didn’t you say so at once?
#GOLIGHTLY.
How did you find such a profitable patient?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, it was a great piece of luck. She heard about me from that little friend of yours, Pen. What is her name?
#GOLIGHTLY.
You seem to have a very bad memory for names, Dickie. You should make a knot in your handkerchief.
#DICKIE BIRD.
It’s a friend of Pen’s. Her husband’s in the navy, stationed at Malta, isn’t he?
#PENELOPE.
Ada Fergusson.
#DICKIE BIRD.
That’s it, of course. Mrs. Fergusson.
#BARLOW.
One of the Fergussons of Kingarth, I suppose?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I don’t know at all. Quite a nice little thing, I thought. I must confess that she didn’t interest me very much.
#PEYTON.
Mrs. Fergusson.
#PENELOPE.
How d’you do?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Is it a preposterous hour to pay a call?
#PENELOPE.
Of course not. I’m always delighted to see you.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I’ve been shopping the whole afternoon, and it suddenly occurred to me that I hadn’t seen you for ages.
#PENELOPE.
Do you know my sainted mother?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
How d’you do?
#PENELOPE.
This is my noble father, and this is my uncle.
#BARLOW.
How d’you do?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
You haven’t forgotten me?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Of course not.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
We haven’t met for ages, have we?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Simply ages.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I passed you in Piccadilly the other day, and you cut me dead.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m so sorry, I’m so short - sighted.
#PENELOPE.
Dickie, you’re not at all short - sighted. How can you tell such fibs?
#BARLOW.
Dickie feels that only a physical impediment can excuse a man for not seeing a pretty woman.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, how very nice of you to say that.
#BARLOW.
Not at all, not at all.
#PENELOPE.
I wanted to thank you for getting Dickie such a splendid patient.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’ve just been telling my wife about Mrs. Mack.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, yes.
#DICKIE BIRD.
It was really awfully good of you to tell her to send for me. I’ve been to see her this afternoon.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, yes. I like to do all I can for people. I hope you’ll find her a nice patient.
#PENELOPE.
She seems to require a lot of visits.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Yes, she was only telling me the other day how much she liked Dr. O’Farrell. I’m afraid she’s very ill, poor dear.
#DICKIE BIRD.
To tell you the truth, I’m extremely worried about her.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
It’s a great comfort to all her friends to know that Dr. O’Farrell is looking after her.
#BARLOW.
I’ve been wondering if she’s one of the Staffordshire Macks or one of the Somersetshire Macks.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I don’t know at all.
#BARLOW.
How d’you mean you don’t know at all? She must be one or the other.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I don’t see that it matters either way.
#PENELOPE.
What is she like?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, I don’t know. Like everybody else, I suppose.
#PENELOPE.
Don’t be silly, Dickie. You must know if she’s fat or thin.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I should say fat, wouldn’t you?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Obese.
#PENELOPE.
Yes?
#DICKIE BIRD.
She has grey hair.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
All in little corkscrew curls.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Yes. I wonder how she does them.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
She has very pretty blue eyes, hasn’t she?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Yes, very pretty blue eyes.
#PENELOPE.
What is her Christian name?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Er - I don’t know at all.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Catherine.
#PENELOPE.
Catherine Mack? Mother, it’s your old friend Catherine Mack. What an extraordinary coincidence!
#GOLIGHTLY.
Catherine Mack. Why, of course, I remember her perfectly. Little grey corkscrew curls and very pretty blue eyes.
#PENELOPE.
Wouldn’t she like mamma to go and see her?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m afraid she can’t see any one just yet.
#GOLIGHTLY.
You must tell her how sorry we are to hear she’s so ill.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, yes, I’ll give her any message you like.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
I think I ought to be going. Will you come, Charles?
#GOLIGHTLY.
Yes, my dear.
#PENELOPE.
Good - bye, mother, darling.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I say, what the dickens have you come here for now?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
You didn’t tell me when I should see you to - morrow.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Good heavens, you might have rung me up on the telephone.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, I never trust the telephone.
#DICKIE BIRD.
How do you mean you never trust the telephone? Are you in the habit....
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Dickie!
#DICKIE BIRD.
I beg your pardon, I didn’t mean that.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Why on earth did you invent that cock - and - bull story about Mrs. Mack?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I didn’t. It invented itself. I was obliged to account for my movements.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
D’you mean to say your wife asks you where you’ve been and where you’re going? How like a woman. By the way, what are you doing this evening?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, Penelope and I are dining at the Carlton grill room, and going to a music hall.
#BARLOW.
Good - bye, Mrs. Fergusson.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Good - bye.
#BARLOW.
Devilish fine woman.
#PENELOPE.
Uncle Davenport!
#BARLOW.
Good - bye, dear. Quite a lady.
#PENELOPE.
Good - bye.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Are you all right?
#PENELOPE.
Yes, leave it to me. I’m beginning to feel my feet.
#GOLIGHTLY.
I noticed it.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Charming man your uncle is, Penelope. So distinguished.
#PENELOPE.
You’ve made a conquest of him. He told me you were a devilish fine woman.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Not really? Men often tell me I’m a womanly woman.
#PENELOPE.
I daresay it means the same thing.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
But I must fly too. I really had no idea it was so late.
#PENELOPE.
Are you doing anything to - night?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, no! I live very quietly. There’s nothing that I enjoy more than an evening all by myself, with a book.
#PENELOPE.
You used to be so fond of going out.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I know that my husband prefers me to remain at home. And when I think of him bravely serving his country in a foreign land I have no heart for gaiety.
#PENELOPE.
What a charming nature you have.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
My husband’s in a man - of - war. He’s stationed at Malta, you know. It’s so dreadful that my health forces me to remain in England.
#PENELOPE.
I wonder if you’d do me a great kindness.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
My dear, I’ll always do anything for an old friend.
#PENELOPE.
The fact is, I’ve had a perfectly fiendish headache the whole afternoon.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I knew there was something the matter with you the moment I came in.
#PENELOPE.
We’ve got a couple of stalls for a music hall to - night. It would be awfully kind of you if you’d go with Dickie instead of me.
#PENELOPE.
Dickie hates going out alone, and I simply can’t stir. You can have a jolly little dinner together at a restaurant, and you can go on afterwards.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Are you really sure you can’t go, Pen?
#PENELOPE.
It’s absolutely out of the question.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Don’t you think Dr. O’Farrell ought to stay and look after you?
#PENELOPE.
Oh, no! It’ll do him good to go out. He’s been working so dreadfully hard. This afternoon he had a consultation that lasted nearly an hour.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Would you like me to come with you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I should love it, if it wouldn’t bore you.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Then I shall be delighted.
#PENELOPE.
Thanks so much. But it’s getting very late. I think you ought to start at once.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You’re sure you don’t mind my leaving you, Penelope?
#PENELOPE.
Positive.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Well, just wait a moment, and I’ll make you up a dose of something.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, no, I promise you I’m much better without medicine.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Nonsense. Of course I must give you something.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
That’s the advantage of having a doctor in the family.
#PENELOPE.
Yes, it’s a great advantage.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I do envy you, having your husband always at hand. When I think of mine bravely serving his country - and you know, every doctor I go to tells me it would be most dangerous for me to join him.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Here it is.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, no, Dickie, I’d much rather not.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Don’t be silly, darling. This’ll pull you together like anything.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I’m sure she ought to lie down.
#PENELOPE.
No, I think I’d rather stand up if you don’t mind.
#DICKIE BIRD.
How extraordinarily unreasonable you are! Now lie down on this sofa.
#PENELOPE.
Of course, if I absolutely must.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
We must make you comfortable before we go.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Let’s put all the cushions behind her. Is that nice?
#PENELOPE.
Yes, thank you.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Poor little thing.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I’m sure she ought to have something over her feet.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Let’s put this rug over her feet. There. Now take this medicine.... There....
#PENELOPE.
Oh, no, Dickie. I’ll take it after you’ve gone. I really will. I promise you I’ll take it.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Why on earth can’t you take it now?
#PENELOPE.
Well, I hate making faces before you.
#DICKIE BIRD.
But I’ve often seen you make faces.
#PENELOPE.
Yes, at you. That’s quite a different thing.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Now, take it like a good girl.
#PENELOPE.
After you’ve gone.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I’m not going to stir from this room till you’ve taken it.
#PENELOPE.
Give it me. Hold my nose, Dickie. Oh, I wish I’d never married you, Dickie.
#DICKIE BIRD.
It’ll make you feel like one o’clock.
#PENELOPE.
I don’t want to feel like one o’clock.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Good - bye. So sorry you’re feeling seedy.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Good - bye, darling.
#PENELOPE.
I hope you’ll have an awfully good time.
#PENELOPE.
No, I won’t. I won’t.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’ll just write you out a prescription, shall I?
#PATIENT.
Oh, it’s too good of you. I’m afraid I’m giving you so much trouble.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Not at all. Now what would you like me to give you?
#PATIENT.
Oh, whatever you like, please. It’s too good of you.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You know, there’s not much the matter with you.
#PATIENT.
Oh, I’m so sorry. I really, really....
#DICKIE BIRD.
I should have thought you’d be rather pleased.
#PATIENT.
Yes, of course, I’m very much pleased. I didn’t mean that. I’ve taken up so much of your time.
#DICKIE BIRD.
It’s only out of the people who’ve got nothing the matter with them that I make a living. The people who are ill either get well or die, and that’s the end of them.
#PATIENT.
Yes, I see. I never thought of that. Beautiful day it is, isn’t it?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Won’t you sit down?
#PATIENT.
Oh, it’s too good of you. Thank you, thank you. I’m afraid I’m taking up so much of your time.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I always make my patients sit on the other side of my desk since one of them suddenly saw a snake on me, and flung himself at my throat in order to save me from being bitten. He nearly throttled me in the process, and when I knelt on his chest, he said I was an ungrateful devil, and he wouldn’t interfere with the snakes next time they went for me.
#PATIENT.
Oh, but you don’t think there’s any danger of my flying at your throat, do you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
No, of course not.
#PATIENT.
I drink nothing for my luncheon, and only claret and water for my dinner.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I suppose you wouldn’t think you’d had your money’s worth if I gave you no medicine?
#PATIENT.
Oh, it’s too good of you, but I think, for my wife’s sake, I’d like to take something.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Well, look here, I’ve given you some strychnine to buck you up, and some bismuth to quiet you down. Take it three times a day after meals.
#PATIENT.
Oh, thank you so much. I’m sure it’s just what I want. And now - er. And now - er....
#DICKIE BIRD.
I think there’s nothing more I can do for you.
#PATIENT.
No, er - thank you very much. I - er - it’s so good of you to have taken so much trouble. Yes, er....
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh.... My fee is two guineas.
#PATIENT.
Oh, thank you so much. That’s just what I wanted to ask you. Shall I write you a cheque?
#DICKIE BIRD.
We always prefer to have it in hard cash, you know, in case it’s a bogus cheque.
#PATIENT.
Oh, certainly. It’s too good of you. I thought you mightn’t like it.
#DICKIE BIRD.
It’s extraordinary how nervous people are about giving a doctor money. If you only knew how jolly glad he is to get it.
#PATIENT.
Yes. Thank you very much.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Hang it all, man, not on the mantelpiece. There are limits.
#PATIENT.
Oh, I beg your pardon. I’m so sorry.
#DICKIE BIRD.
We always like it put on the desk.
#PATIENT.
I don’t often come and consult doctors.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I can see that. If you did you’d probably give me two pounds and say you hadn’t got two shillings on you, especially if you were a woman.
#PATIENT.
You don’t say so. Really it never occurred to me.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Thank you. Well, good - bye.
#PATIENT.
Good - bye, and thank you so much. Beautiful day, isn’t it? Good - bye.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Hulloa! Come in, won’t you? Pen, here’s your noble parent.
#GOLIGHTLY.
I was just going up to see Pen.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Come and sit down here, and we’ll have a smoke.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Aren’t you expecting patients?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, it’s just on five o’clock. I don’t suppose any one else will come. We might have tea down here.
#GOLIGHTLY.
How are things going?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Rotten. Look here, a wretched two guineas. That’s all I’ve made this afternoon.
#PENELOPE.
Well, father?
#GOLIGHTLY.
Kiss your noble parent, my child. You’ve got a new dress on.
#PENELOPE.
I rather like it, don’t you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Is that another new frock, Pen?
#PENELOPE.
Yes, darling. Why?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, nothing.
#PENELOPE.
The wife of a fashionable physician has to spend a lot of money on her clothes.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Dickie was lamenting that times were very bad.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What can you expect with this beastly weather! Fine, dry, cold day after day. We haven’t had a fog this autumn. It doesn’t give one a chance. Of course everybody keeps well. Times are getting worse and worse. Everybody has decent drains now. An officious Government gives people pure water. If it weren’t for patent medicines and the malade imaginaire half the doctors in London would starve.
#PENELOPE.
Never mind, Dickie. There may be a motor accident just outside our front door one of these days.
#DICKIE BIRD.
It would be just like my luck if they were all killed outright. No, what I want is a really good epidemic, a very complicated form of influenza that’d keep people on their backs for about a month.
#PENELOPE.
And supposing I got it?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Well, if you got it that bounder on the other side of the street would have to treat you. And he couldn’t charge you as you’re my wife, and he’d simply grind his teeth at having to waste his time.
#PENELOPE.
The bounder on the other side of the street is Dr. Rogers. I like him much better than Dickie.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Pompous ass.
#PENELOPE.
He’s got such a pleasant bedside manner.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You’ve never seen my bedside manner. I say, I must just go and wash my hands, they’re covered with Picric Acid.
#PENELOPE.
Where’s mother? Converting the heathen?
#GOLIGHTLY.
From the safe distance of the Albert Hall.
#PENELOPE.
I’m glad you came alone.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Is anything the matter?
#PENELOPE.
I can’t go on with it any longer. I’ve come to the end of my strength.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Is Dickie still ...?
#PENELOPE.
Yes. I can’t imagine what he sees in her. I sit and watch her sometimes and wonder what she has that I haven’t got. You don’t think I’m plain, do you?
#GOLIGHTLY.
Certainly not. If you had been I should have exposed you at your birth, like the ancient Spartans.
#PENELOPE.
There are lots of men who are willing to tell me that I’m extremely attractive.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Why don’t you let them?
#PENELOPE.
My dear father, you’re the most immoral parent I’ve ever come across.
#GOLIGHTLY.
It might be politic.
#PENELOPE.
No, I don’t know whether I shall ever get Dickie back again, but I don’t want to get him back by exciting his jealousy. I don’t want his love if I can only have it by making him think other men are in love with me.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Remember that two and two never make five.
#PENELOPE.
It’s easy enough to give advice. You’ve only got to sit still and watch. I’ve got to do things. And the worst of it is that doing things means doing nothing.
#GOLIGHTLY.
My dear.
#PENELOPE.
Now, father, don’t look as if you didn’t understand or I shall throw something at your head. It wouldn’t be so bad if I could be up and doing, but I just have to sit still and keep my temper. You don’t know what I’ve suffered this month with a smiling face. I’ve laughed while my heart ached. I’ve chaffed Dickie when I’ve known he was just going to meet Ada Fergusson. I’ve arranged little parties so that they might be together. I haven’t even dared to cry by myself in case Ada Fergusson should see that my eyes were red and tell Dickie. He’s seen her every day, every single day for the last month, and all the time I’ve been cheerful and pleasant and amusing.
#GOLIGHTLY.
But how does he manage to get the time?
#PENELOPE.
Of course he’s been neglecting his practice. He’s sent his assistant to people he ought to have seen himself. You remember Mrs. Mack, don’t you?
#GOLIGHTLY.
The imaginary Mrs. Mack? Yes.
#PENELOPE.
If you knew how I hated Mrs. Mack! She’s been having operations. She has an operation about once a week, and Dickie goes off for the whole day in his car.
#GOLIGHTLY.
She must have the constitution of a boa - constrictor.
#PENELOPE.
And the curious thing is that she always has an operation when there’s a race meeting. She had an operation for the Duke of York’s Stakes at Kempton; and she had another operation for the Cesarewitch, and a third for Sandown.
#GOLIGHTLY.
How very singular.
#PENELOPE.
It is till you know that Ada Fergusson adores racing. And the thing that makes me so furious is that I’m quite certain Dickie puts on her money for her; and when her horse wins she pockets the profits, and when it loses she doesn’t pay her stake.
#GOLIGHTLY.
That sounds very nasty of her. What makes you think it?
#PENELOPE.
I do it myself.... Poor Dickie, it’s going to cost him a lot of money this month.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Why?
#PENELOPE.
Because whenever he goes out for the day I have to console myself by buying something. I generally choose something rather dear.
#GOLIGHTLY.
I don’t remember that I advised that in the treatment of a volatile husband.
#PENELOPE.
No, I added it of my own accord.
#GOLIGHTLY.
But why did you send for me to - day?
#PENELOPE.
Because the end has come. And I can’t stand it any longer. This morning Dickie said that Mrs. Mack was well enough to be moved, and he was going to take her over to Paris to put her in the Riviera train.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Do you mean to say that....
#PENELOPE.
Ada Fergusson wants a little jaunt in Paris.
#GOLIGHTLY.
What are you going to do?
#PENELOPE.
I’m going to tell him he must choose between us. I’m going to do everything I can to prevent him from going. And I mean to let him know that if he goes it’s the end.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Oh!
#PENELOPE.
Don’t say oh! Say I’m quite right. Say it’s the only thing to do.
#GOLIGHTLY.
But I think you’re quite wrong.
#PENELOPE.
Wrong!
#GOLIGHTLY.
You don’t suppose he wants to go to Paris. No man in his senses would take the risk.
#PENELOPE.
Then why is he going?
#GOLIGHTLY.
Because she’s making him. And once a woman in these circumstances makes a man do what he doesn’t want to, it’s the beginning of the end.
#PENELOPE.
How d’you know?
#GOLIGHTLY.
I don’t know. I guess it.
#PENELOPE.
It seems to me that a lifetime spent in the study of mathematics has resulted in some very various knowledge.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Be a good girl, Pen, and let them go.
#PENELOPE.
You were right when you said I should want a great deal of tact, and a great deal of patience, and a great deal of self - control. My word!
#GOLIGHTLY.
Well?
#PENELOPE.
I’ll do nothing. I’ll hold my tongue, I’ll smile, I’ll make jokes, but....
#GOLIGHTLY.
Yes?
#PENELOPE.
I want some hats badly. I’ll just go and ring up Françoise and tell her to send me all she’s got in the shop.
#GOLIGHTLY.
I was just going.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m sorry. Why so soon?
#GOLIGHTLY.
I promised to fetch my wife.
#PENELOPE.
You must come back. This is the first time I’ve been separated from Dickie since our marriage, and I shall want to hide my head in the maternal bosom while my noble father pats my hand.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I wish you wouldn’t take it so calmly, Pen. You might be a bit cut up.
#PENELOPE.
But, darling, I’m making every preparation to have fit after fit of violent hysterics. I can’t do more.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Rot me, that’s right.
#PENELOPE.
After all, Dickie, I know you wouldn’t go if you could help it. It’s only because you feel it’s your duty, isn’t it?
#GOLIGHTLY.
Why are you going by night?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, you see, there’s so much less of a crowd. It’s more convenient when you’re carting an invalid about.
#PENELOPE.
It’ll be great fun, because you’ll see all the gay young men who are making a little excursion to Paris with the object of their affections. I’m told they always go by night so that no one should see them on the journey.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Well, I must be getting on or I shall be late. Au revoir.]
#PENELOPE.
Don’t be too long, father, in case my emotions get the better of me before you come back.
#GOLIGHTLY.
I may see you later, Dickie.
#PENELOPE.
I’m going upstairs to have tea.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’d like to have a little talk with you, Pen.
#PENELOPE.
Then come up into the drawing - room.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’d rather talk to you down here.
#PENELOPE.
Very well. Talk.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You can send for the tea if you like.
#PENELOPE.
No; I’ll let it stand and ruin my digestion.
#DICKIE BIRD.
D’you know what these are?
#PENELOPE.
Bills, darling?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I can see they’re bills, thank you!
#PENELOPE.
This is for the frock I’ve got on. You wouldn’t think it cost so much, would you? You see, you have to pay for the cut.
#DICKIE BIRD.
And what do you expect me to do with them?
#PENELOPE.
You can put them in the waste - paper basket if you like, but it would be shorter to pay them.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Now, look here, Pen. It’s perfectly preposterous. You know I’m not going to stand this sort of thing.
#PENELOPE.
Darling, you’re not going to make a scene for a few little things I’ve bought myself. I was positively in rags, and I thought you liked me to dress neatly.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Hang it all, I’m a poor man, and you’ve spent more than a hundred and fifty pounds in this one month.
#PENELOPE.
Does it come to as much as that? It’s lucky you’ve got such a good patient in Mrs. Mack, isn’t it?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Senseless extravagance I call it. Now look here, here’s thirty - five pounds for a dress in blue cloth - absurd price to pay - on 9th of October.
#PENELOPE.
Duke of York’s Stakes at Kempton.
#DICKIE BIRD.
How d’you mean, Duke of York’s Stakes at Kempton?
#PENELOPE.
I just happen to remember they were on that day because Madame Claude was so surprised to see me. It was only by the merest chance that she hadn’t gone to the races herself.
#DICKIE BIRD.
But what on earth put it into your head to go and buy a blue cloth dress?
#PENELOPE.
Well, you see, darling, it was the day of the first operation that was performed on Mrs. Mack. And you were away all day, and I felt awfully depressed and lonely. And I knew how anxious you were, and it made me anxious, so I just went and ordered a blue cloth to cheer myself up a bit.
#DICKIE BIRD.
And look here, on the 13th of October there’s an ermine stole and a muff.
#PENELOPE.
Yes, that was the second operation on poor Mrs. Mack.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I say, I think it’s a bit thick.
#PENELOPE.
Well, I had to do something while you were away. And it made me feel so miserable to see everybody driving off with race glasses to Liverpool Street.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I beg your pardon.
#PENELOPE.
You see, the 13th of October was the Cesarewitch.
#DICKIE BIRD.
And I suppose all the others are to be explained in the same way. October 22.
#PENELOPE.
Sandown Races. I wonder why you always had your operations on the same day as an important race meeting.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I suppose you think it odd? little.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Well, it isn’t odd at all. It’s one of old Peter Marsden’s cranky ways. I told you it was Peter Marsden who did the operations, didn’t I? The fact is, he’s simply mad on racing. And he’s lost such a pot of money that he always fixes an important operation for the same day as a race meeting so that he absolutely won’t be able to go to it.
#PENELOPE.
Funny old thing. Peter Marsden, not you, darling.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Now look here, Pen, we’ll say no more about these bills. I’ll pay them this time....
#PENELOPE.
I knew you would.
#DICKIE BIRD.
But there must be no more of them.
#PENELOPE.
I really don’t know why you should make such a fuss. After all, you’ve been earning simply heaps and heaps of money with Mrs. Mack.
#DICKIE BIRD.
We mustn’t count our chickens before they’re hatched. I haven’t had a penny out of her yet.
#PENELOPE.
But now that she’s going away you can send in your bill.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, I couldn’t possibly. It would kill her.
#PENELOPE.
Don’t you think you might risk it?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I think you’re awfully heartless, Pen. You forget that I’m very much attached to the old lady. I look upon her as a friend as well as a patient.
#PENELOPE.
Perhaps she’ll leave you something in her will. We want a new electric brougham, don’t we?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, I shouldn’t accept it. I have the strongest feeling against doctors getting legacies from their patients.
#PENELOPE.
Well, you’ll be able to charge at least a hundred and fifty pounds for taking her to Paris.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Pen!
#PENELOPE.
Oh, you made me jump.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You’re not proposing to buy anything more?
#PENELOPE.
Well, darling, I know that when I get up to - morrow morning and you’re not here, I shall feel dreadfully lonely and depressed.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Have your sainted mother to stay with you.
#PENELOPE.
And it’s struck me that I simply haven’t got a hat I can wear.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Penelope.
#PENELOPE.
It’ll make my frocks last so much longer if I have some nice hats. You see, you ring the changes, and people think you have a new gown on.
#DICKIE BIRD.
And may I venture to inquire how many hats you’ll want to overcome your depression?
#PENELOPE.
Three.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I never heard anything so preposterous.
#PENELOPE.
Now look here, Dickie, I’m willing to meet you half way; I promise you they shan’t cost more than five pounds each. You can afford that out of the hundred and fifty.
#DICKIE BIRD.
The fact is, Pen, that Mrs. Mack is more a friend than a patient, and she’s not so well to do as I thought. I’m proposing to make no charge for accompanying her to Paris.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, no, Dickie, I won’t hear of it. You’ve got a wife to think of - if you died to - morrow I should be totally unprovided for. You have no right to be quixotic. It’s not fair to me. lady wishes to see you, sir.
#DICKIE BIRD.
At this hour?
#PEYTON.
It’s Mrs. Watson, sir.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, yes, I know. Show her in.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Thank heaven, there’s somebody. I’ll get a few guineas out of her at all events. Four visits. That’ll be five guineas. By Jove, I want them.
#PENELOPE.
What’s the matter with her?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I don’t know, but I’m pretending I do. And she probably won’t find out.
#PENELOPE.
I’ll leave you. I must just telephone to some one.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Well, Mrs. Watson?
#MRS. WATSON.
You mustn’t mind my coming so late. I know you don’t see any one after five, but I’m going away.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m delighted to see you. I promise you that.
#MRS. WATSON.
I’m starting for the Riviera with my daughter to - morrow, and I thought I’d like to see you again before I went.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Of course. And how have you been getting on?
#MRS. WATSON.
Oh! I don’t get on. I never get better.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Have you been taking your medicine regularly?
#MRS. WATSON.
Yes; but it doesn’t do me any good.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Let’s try your knee jerks, shall we?
#DICKIE BIRD.
That seems right enough.
#MRS. WATSON.
Sir Benjamin Broadstairs tried everything, and he couldn’t cure me; and then I went to Sir William Wilson, and he told me not to do any of the things that Sir Benjamin Broadstairs told me to do, and I got worse and worse!
#DICKIE BIRD.
You seem uncommonly cheerful about it.
#MRS. WATSON.
I’ve been to every doctor in London, and they all say I’m a wonderful case. I like being examined by doctors, and they take such an interest in me. The hours and hours they’ve spent over me. I can never be grateful enough for all the kindness I’ve had from them.
#DICKIE BIRD.
It’s very nice of you to say so. I think I’ll try you on something else to - day.
#MRS. WATSON.
Oh! make it nice and strong; won’t you, doctor?
#DICKIE BIRD.
You seem to like your medicine with some body in it.
#MRS. WATSON.
Well, I like taking medicines. It’s something to do; and now my daughter’s married I’m very much alone. I think I’ve taken every medicine in the Pharmacopœia, and they’ve none of them done me any good.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Well, perhaps this will. You must take it three times a day before meals.
#MRS. WATSON.
Oh! but I’ve had this before, Dr. O’Farrell. Sir Arthur Thomas gave me this only a few months ago.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Well, try it again. Perhaps you didn’t give it a fair chance.
#MRS. WATSON.
I was reading in the Lancet the other day that a German doctor had discovered a new medicine which does nerve cases such a lot of good. I’m sure it’s the very thing for me.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What on earth were you reading the Lancet for?
#MRS. WATSON.
Oh, I always read the Lancet and the British Medical Journal. You see, my poor husband had to take them in for his practice.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You don’t mean to say your husband was a doctor?
#MRS. WATSON.
Oh, I thought I told you that I was a doctor’s widow.
#MRS. WATSON.
I can never bear to hear doctors spoken badly of. They never do me any good, but they’ve been kindness itself. I’ve only once been rudely treated, and that - if you’ll believe it - was by a mere nobody. I told him all my symptoms, and he said to me, Madam, can you eat? Yes, I said. I have breakfast in the morning and a little soup at eleven o’clock; and then I have lunch, and I always make a good tea, and I eat a little dinner at half - past seven, and before I go to bed I have some bread and milk. Then he said, Madam, can you sleep? Yes, I said, for an old woman I sleep very well; I sleep eight or nine hours regularly. Then he said, Madam, can you walk? Oh! yes, I said, I always make a point of walking four miles a day. Then he said, My opinion is that you’ve got nothing the matter with you at all. Good afternoon.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Fancy.
#MRS. WATSON.
Well, I just looked him up and down, and I said to him, Sir, your opinion is not shared by Sir Benjamin Broadstairs, or Sir William Wilson, or Sir Arthur Thomas. And I didn’t even offer him a fee, but I just swept out of the room. You won’t give me that new medicine?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Honestly, I don’t think it’s quite what you want.
#MRS. WATSON.
Very well. I expect you know best. And now I mustn’t take up any more of your time.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, it’s of no value, thank you.
#MRS. WATSON.
Will you tell me what I owe you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, as a doctor’s widow, of course, I couldn’t dream of accepting a fee.
#MRS. WATSON.
That is kind of you. But you must allow me to give you a little present.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, really, you know....
#MRS. WATSON.
I’ve seen every doctor in London of any importance, and they’ve none of them charged me a penny, but I always make them a little present. I know that you doctors have to go out in all weathers, and you never wrap yourselves up. So I give them a woollen comforter.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, thank you very much.
#MRS. WATSON.
I made it myself.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Did you!
#MRS. WATSON.
And Sir Benjamin promised to wear his every winter. You’ll find it so warm.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m very grateful to you.
#MRS. WATSON.
And now, good - bye, and thank you so much.
#DICKIE BIRD.
When you come back from the Riviera, you might do worse than consult Dr. Rogers. He lives just at the other end of the street, you know. He’s very good in cases like yours.
#MRS. WATSON.
Thank you so much.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Good - bye.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Pen! Pen!
#PENELOPE’S VOICE.
Yes.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Come in.
#MRS. WATSON.
I knew there was something I wanted to ask you particularly, and I nearly forgot it. Sir Benjamin Broadstairs said I ought never to eat anything but toast, and Sir William Wilson said he didn’t think toast was at all good for me, and I only ought to eat bread. Now, I wonder what I had better do?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Well, if I were you, I’d eat bread toasted only on one side.
#MRS. WATSON.
Thank you so much. Good - bye. I hope you’ll like the comforter.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m sure I shall. Good - bye.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Pen! Pen!
#PENELOPE.
What is the matter?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Look! That’s my fee! That!
#PENELOPE.
It’s a woollen comforter.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Don’t be idiotic, Penelope. I can see it’s a woollen comforter.
#PENELOPE.
But what’s the meaning of it?
#DICKIE BIRD.
She’s a doctor’s widow. Of course I couldn’t charge her anything. She kept it dark till to - day. I’ll tell you what, doctors’ widows oughtn’t to be allowed to survive their husbands.
#PENELOPE.
Oh!
#DICKIE BIRD.
When you’re my widow, Pen, you go right up one side of Harley Street and then right down the other and see them all.
#PENELOPE.
But supposing I’m not ill?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Hang it all, when you’ve lost me the least you can do is to enjoy indifferent health.
#PEYTON.
If you please, sir, Mrs. Watson says, may she just see you for one minute.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Yes.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What the dickens does she want now?
#MRS. WATSON.
You’ll think you’ve never seen the last of me.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Not at all. Not at all.
#MRS. WATSON.
I’ve been thinking about what you said about toasting my bread on one side.... On which side shall I put the butter?
#DICKIE BIRD.
H’m. H’m. You must put the butter on the toasted side.
#MRS. WATSON.
Oh, thank you. Now just one more question, do you think a little jam would hurt me?
#DICKIE BIRD.
No, I don’t think a little jam would hurt you, but you mustn’t put it on the same side as you put the butter.
#MRS. WATSON.
Oh, thank you. Good afternoon. I’m so much obliged.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Not at all. Not at all.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Suttee.... That’s the word. Suttee.
#PENELOPE.
Dickie, what are you talking about?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’ve been trying to think of it for ten minutes. That’s what doctors’ widows ought to do - Suttee. Like the Hindoos.
#PENELOPE.
Burn themselves alive at their husbands’ death?
#DICKIE BIRD.
You’ve hit it. Suttee. That’s the word.
#PENELOPE.
But, darling, I should hate to grace your funeral by making a bonfire of myself.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, you have no affection for me.
#PENELOPE.
Lots, but that’s asking a great deal, isn’t it?
#DICKIE BIRD.
No, you don’t care for me as much as you used to. You’re quite different. I’ve noticed lots of things.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, nonsense.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You’ve changed lately. You never come down to see me off in the morning, and you don’t ask me at what time I’m coming back. You always used to sit on the arm of my chair after breakfast when I was smoking my pipe and reading the paper.
#PENELOPE.
You must have hated it, didn’t you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Of course I hated it, but it showed you were fond of me, and now that you don’t do it any more I miss it.
#PEYTON.
Mrs. Fergusson.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
The maid told me you were here, so I asked her to show me straight in. I hope you don’t mind.
#PENELOPE.
Of course not. We’re delighted to see you anywhere. Won’t you have some tea?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
No, thank you. The fact is, I’ve come to see Dr. O’Farrell professionally.
#PENELOPE.
You’re not ill?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I’ve not been very well lately, and I thought I’d like to see a doctor. Will you treat me?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’ll do anything I can for you.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
But it must be really a professional visit. You know, I want to pay.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, nonsense, Dickie couldn’t dream of accepting money from one of my friends.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
No, I’ve got the strictest principles on that point. I think it’s too bad of people to want a doctor to treat them for nothing. I really insist on paying the usual fee.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, well, we’ll discuss that later.
#PENELOPE.
I’ll leave you alone, shall I?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Do you mind, dear? It makes me a little uncomfortable to discuss my symptoms before a third party.
#PENELOPE.
Of course.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
We shall only be five minutes.
#PENELOPE.
I warn you that Dickie’s medicines are perfectly beastly.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m sorry you’re seedy. You were all right yesterday.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I’ve never been better in my life, thank you.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
That’s the advantage of you being a doctor. When I want to see you alone I can do it under your wife’s very nose. Don’t you think it was rather ingenious?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Very.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What on earth are you doing?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I wanted to see if Penelope was listening.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Of course she wasn’t listening. That’s about the last thing she’d do.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, my dear, don’t get in a temper about it. Lots of women do listen, you know.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Do they? I haven’t had the pleasure of meeting them.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Fiddle.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Then will you tell me in what way I can be of use to you?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Certainly not, if you ask me as crossly as that. You may kiss my hand. That’s right. Still cross?
#DICKIE BIRD.
No.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Do you love me as much as ever?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Yes.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
You wouldn’t say no if you didn’t, would you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
No.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Brute!
#DICKIE BIRD.
I say, what on earth have you come for?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
You are nice to me to - day.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Well, when I left you yesterday we fixed up everything. I gave you your ticket, and I wrote down the time the train started.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Well, for one thing I wanted to see Penelope.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Why?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
It amuses me to see her simplicity. I get a lot of pleasure in looking at her and thinking how little she suspects what is going on under her very nose. She’s the most trusting person I ever met in my life.
#DICKIE BIRD.
If you want to know anything, it makes me feel devilish uncomfortable.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
My poor, dear boy, what are you talking about?
#DICKIE BIRD.
It wouldn’t be so bad if we had to take any precautions. But she trusts us absolutely. Why, she’s always throwing us together. It never enters her head that there can be the least reason for suspicion. It’s like knocking a man down who can’t defend himself.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I suppose that means that you no longer love me?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Of course I love you. Good heavens, I’ve told you so till I’m blue in the face.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, no, you no longer love me. Men only begin to have scruples when they stop caring for you.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I’ve sacrificed everything for your sake. And now you insult me. And when I think of my poor husband bravely serving his country in a foreign land! Oh, it’s cruel, cruel!
#DICKIE BIRD.
But I’ve only said it made me feel low down to treat Penelope badly.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
You don’t think of my feelings. You don’t think how I feel. What about my husband?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Well, you see I don’t happen to know your husband, and I do know my wife.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Don’t be so stupid. Of course you know your wife.
#DICKIE BIRD.
That’s why I don’t like behaving like an utter cad.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
If you really loved me you would think of nothing but me, nothing, nothing, nothing.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, I say, don’t cry.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I shall cry. I’ve never been treated like this before. If you don’t love me any more, why don’t you say so?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Yes, I do love you. But....
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
But what?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Well - er - I think it would be much better if we - put the trip to Paris off for a bit.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
#DICKIE BIRD.
Penelope’s so blindly confident.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I’ll never speak to you again. I wish I had never met you. Oh, how can you insult me like this!
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord! I say, don’t cry. I didn’t mean to be horrid. I’m awfully sorry.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Don’t touch me. Don’t come near me.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’ll do anything you like if you won’t cry. I say, just think if Penelope came in - I was only thinking of the risk to you. Of course, there’s nothing I’d like so much as a jaunt over the Channel.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Is that true?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Yes.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Do you really want me to come?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Of course I do, if you don’t mind the risk.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, I’ll make that all right.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Why, what are you going to do?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Wait a minute or two and you’ll see.
#DICKIE BIRD.
We might tell Penelope that we’re ready.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Very well. Oh, I quite forgot. I’ve simply got a head like a sieve.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What’s the matter?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Well, I almost forgot the very thing I came to see you about. And all through you making a scene.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Did I make a scene? I wasn’t aware of it.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I want to ask you something. You won’t be angry, will you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I shouldn’t think so.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Of course it’s nothing very important really, but it’s just a little awkward to ask.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, nonsense. Of course I’ll do anything I can.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Well, a friend of mine on the Stock Exchange gave me a splendid tip, and....
#DICKIE BIRD.
It hasn’t come off. I know those splendid tips.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, but it’s bound to be all right, only there are some differences to pay. I don’t quite understand what it all means, but Solly Abrahams....
#DICKIE BIRD.
Is that your friend on the Stock Exchange?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Yes, why?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, nothing. Good old Scotch name, that’s all.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Solly says I must send him a cheque for a hundred and eighty pounds.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
And it’s just a little awkward for me to pay that just now. You see my income is always paid me half - yearly, and I really haven’t got a hundred and eighty pounds in the bank. I never borrow - it’s a thing I can’t bear - and I felt the only person I could come to now was you.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m sure that’s awfully nice of you, not to say flattering.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I knew you’d give it me at once, and, of course, I’ll pay you back out of my profits.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, that’s very good of you. I’ll see what I can do.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Would it be too much trouble if I asked you to write out a cheque now? It’ll be such a weight off my mind.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Of course. I’ll be only too glad. By the way, what are the shares called?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, it’s a gold mine. It’s called the Johannesburg and New Jerusalem.
#DICKIE BIRD.
The name inspires confidence.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Thanks, so much. It’s awfully good of you. Now just write out a little prescription so as to have something to show Penelope.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You forget nothing.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
And I must give you a fee.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, I wouldn’t bother about that.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh yes, I insist. Besides, it makes it look so much more probable.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, how stupid of me! I’ve only got a two - shilling bit in my purse. You don’t happen to have a couple of sovereigns on you.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, yes, I think I have. The only money I’ve earned to - day.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Thank you.... There. That looks a most imposing fee. You must leave it on there for Penelope to see.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Shall I call her?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I will. Penelope, we’ve quite done.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Hulloa, there’s our Uncle Davenport.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, I met him in the park the other day. He made himself so pleasant. He asked me if I was a Fergusson of Glengary. I didn’t know what he meant, but I said I was, and he seemed so pleased.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You’d better not let him know you were a Miss Jones or he’ll have a fit.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, I shall tell him I’m a Jones of Llandudno. I think that sounds rather smart.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You have what one might politely describe as a remarkable power of invention.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I don’t know about that, but I am a womanly woman, and that’s why men like me.
#BARLOW.
Ah, Mrs. Fergusson, this is a delightful surprise.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
You wicked, wicked man, I am told you’re such a rake.
#PENELOPE.
Uncle Davenport?
#BARLOW.
Ah, ah. Tales out of school, Mrs. Fergusson.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
If I’d known what a reputation you had I wouldn’t have let you talk to me for half an hour in the park.
#BARLOW.
Oh, you mustn’t listen to all you hear. man who goes out as much as I do is sure to get talked about. Our world is so small and so censorious.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Dr. O’Farrell has been writing a prescription for me. I haven’t been very well lately.
#BARLOW.
Oh, I’m very sorry to hear that. You look the picture of health and extremely handsome.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, you horrid cruel thing! I wanted you to sympathise with me and tell me how ill I looked.
#BARLOW.
If you will allow me to call on you I can promise to sympathise with you, but I’m afraid I shall never be able to tell you that you look anything but charming.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
That’s too nice of you. You must come and see me the moment I get back from Paris.
#PENELOPE.
Are you going to Paris?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I came on purpose to tell you. Really, I’ve got a head like a sieve. Poor Mrs. Mack has asked me if I would go as far as Paris with her. A most unfortunate thing has happened. Her maid’s mother has suddenly died, and the poor thing naturally wants to go to the funeral. And so....
#PENELOPE.
Mrs. Mack has asked you to go in her maid’s place?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Only for two days, of course. Now, I want to know, dear, tell me honestly, do you mind?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Some women are so funny. I thought you mightn’t like the idea of my going with Dr. O’Farrell as far as Paris, and, of course, we shall be travelling back together.
#PENELOPE.
What nonsense! Of course, I’m only too glad. It’ll be so nice for Dickie to have some one to travel with.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Then that settles it. I like to do everything above board, you know.
#BARLOW.
I see you’ve been raking in the shekels, Dickie.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, that’s my fee. I insisted on paying a fee - I particularly want you to know that, Penelope - I’m so scrupulous about that sort of thing.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, but Dickie can’t accept it. You are a grasping old thing!
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m sure I didn’t want the money.
#PENELOPE.
You really must take it back, Ada.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
No, I couldn’t really. It’s one of my principles.
#PENELOPE.
I know your principles are excellent, but I really shouldn’t like Dickie to accept a fee for seeing my greatest friend.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, well, of course, if you take it like that, I don’t know what to do.
#PENELOPE.
Put it in your purse and say no more about it.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, it’s too good of you.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
And now I must really fly. Good - bye. Don’t forget to come and see me, but, remember, I shall expect to hear all about that little ballet - girl.
#BARLOW.
You mustn’t ask me to be indiscreet.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Good - bye, dear.
#PENELOPE.
I’ll come to the door with you.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I don’t believe you’ve ever known a ballet - girl in your life.
#BARLOW.
No, but it pleases women of our class to think one is hand and glove with persons of that profession.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Central 1234. If they only knew that nine ballet - girls out of ten go home every night to their children and a husband in the suburbs! I just want to ring up my broker. Is that you, Robertson? I say, d’you know anything about a mine called the Johannesburg and New Jerusalem? Rotten? I thought as much. That’s all, thank you. A hundred and eighty pounds gone bang.
#BARLOW.
Look here, Dickie, now that you have a moment to spare you might give me a little professional advice. Of course, I shan’t pay you.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Good Lord! I might as well be a hospital. I’m not even supported by voluntary contributions.
#BARLOW.
The fact is, I’ve noticed lately that I’m not so thin as I was.
#DICKIE BIRD.
It can’t have required great perspicacity to notice that.
#BARLOW.
I’m not asking you for repartee, Dickie, but advice.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You don’t want to bother about a figure at your time of life.
#BARLOW.
To tell you the truth, I have an inkling that I’ve made something of an impression on a very charming lady....
#DICKIE BIRD.
Take my advice and marry her quickly before the impression wears off.
#BARLOW.
Strange as it may appear to you, she’s a married woman.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Then don’t hesitate - do a bolt.
#BARLOW.
What do you mean, Dickie?
#DICKIE BIRD.
My dear Uncle Davenport, I’m young enough to be your son; philandering with a married woman is the most exaggerated form of amusement that’s ever been invented. Take care! That’s all I say. Take care!
#BARLOW.
Why?
#DICKIE BIRD.
She’ll bind you hand and foot, and put a halter round your neck and lead you about by it. She’ll ask you ten times a day if you love her, and each time you get up to go away she’ll make a scene to force you to stay longer. Each time you put on your hat she’ll pin you down to the exact hour of your next visit.
#BARLOW.
But all women do that. It only shows that they like you.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Yes, I suppose all women do that - except Pen. Pen never bothers. She never asks you if you love her. She never keeps you when you want to get away. She never insists on knowing all your movements. And when you leave her she never asks that fatal, fiendish question, at what time will you be back?
#BARLOW.
Well, my boy, if my wife were as indifferent to me as that, I should ask myself who the other feller was.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What the dickens do you mean by that?
#BARLOW.
My dear Dickie, it’s woman’s nature to be exacting. If she’s in love with you she’s always a nuisance, and a very charming nuisance too, to my mind. I like it.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You are not suggesting that Penelope....
#BARLOW.
Now, my dear boy, I didn’t come to talk to you about Penelope, but about my own health.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, you’ve got chronic adiposity. That’s all that’s the matter with you.
#BARLOW.
Good gracious me, that sounds very alarming. And what shall I do for it?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Give up wines, spirits and liqueurs, bread, butter, milk, cream, sugar, potatoes, carrots, cauliflowers, peas, turnips, rice, sago, tapioca, macaroni, jam, honey, and marmalade.
#BARLOW.
But that’s not treatment, that’s homicide!
#DICKIE BIRD.
Put on a sweater and run round the park every morning before breakfast. Let’s have a look at your liver.
#BARLOW.
But, my dear Dickie....
#DICKIE BIRD.
Lie down on that sofa. Now don’t make a fuss about it. I’m not going to kill you. Put your knees up.
#BARLOW.
She’s a fine, dashing woman. There’s no doubt about that.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Let yourself go quite loose. Who’s a fine, dashing woman?
#BARLOW.
Mrs. Fergusson.
#BARLOW.
Dickie, Dickie.
#BARLOW.
Is my liver very wrong?
#DICKIE BIRD.
It’s in a beastly state. I thought it would be.
#BARLOW.
Richard, tell me the worst at once.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Don’t be such an old donkey. Your liver’s as right as mine is. There’s nothing the matter with you except that you do yourself too well, and don’t take enough exercise.
#BARLOW.
I suppose one has to pay for being the most popular diner - out of one’s time.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Is it on Mrs. Fergusson that you’ve made something of an impression?
#BARLOW.
My dear fellow, I am the last man to give a woman away.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Ah!
#BARLOW.
Between ourselves, Dickie, do you think Mrs. Fergusson would find it peculiar if I asked her to lunch with me tête - à - tête at the Carlton?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Peculiar! She’d jump at it.
#BARLOW.
Do you think her husband would mind?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, her husband’s all right. He keeps on bravely serving his country in a foreign land.
#BARLOW.
It shows that she has a nice nature, or she wouldn’t have come to ask Penelope if she minded your going to Paris together.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Yes, she has a charming nature.
#BARLOW.
Lucky dog, I wish I were going to Paris with her.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I wish you were.
#BARLOW.
Ha, ha. Well, well, I must be running away. I’m dining out as usual. These good duchesses, they will not leave me alone. Good - bye.
#PENELOPE.
I say, darling, oughtn’t you to be packing?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Come in and let’s smoke a cigarette together.
#PENELOPE.
All right.
#PENELOPE.
I hope you’ll have a splendid time in Paris.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You never sit on the arm of my chair as you used to.
#PENELOPE.
I’m horribly afraid I’m growing middle - aged. I’ve discovered how much more comfortable it is to have a chair of my own.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Weren’t you rather surprised when Mrs. Fergusson told you she was going to Paris to - night?
#PENELOPE.
Surprised?
#DICKIE BIRD.
What on earth are you laughing at?
#PENELOPE.
Darling, you must think me an old silly. Of course, I knew you were going together.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I don’t know what you’re talking about.
#PENELOPE.
I have tried not to see anything, but you do make it so difficult.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Will you have the goodness to explain yourself?
#PENELOPE.
My dear, of course I know all about it.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I entirely fail to gather your meaning. What do you know all about?
#PENELOPE.
About you and Ada, silly.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Penelope, do you mean to say you suspect me of ...?
#PENELOPE.
Darling!
#DICKIE BIRD.
What d’you know?
#PENELOPE.
Everything.
#PENELOPE.
I’ve been so amused to watch you during the last two months.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Amused?
#PENELOPE.
Upon my word, it’s been as good as a play.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Have you known all along?
#PENELOPE.
My dear, didn’t you see that I did everything in the world to throw you together?
#DICKIE BIRD.
But I assure you there’s not a word of truth in it.
#PENELOPE.
Come, come, Dickie!
#DICKIE BIRD.
But why haven’t you said anything?
#PENELOPE.
I thought it would only embarrass you. I didn’t mean to say anything to - day, but I couldn’t help laughing when you asked me if I was surprised.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Aren’t you angry?
#PENELOPE.
Angry? What about?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Aren’t you jealous?
#PENELOPE.
Jealous? You must think me a little donkey.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You took it as a matter of course? It amused you? It was as good as a play?
#PENELOPE.
Darling, we’ve been married for five years. It’s absurd to think there could be anything between us after all that time.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, is it? I wasn’t aware of that fact.
#PENELOPE.
The whole thing seemed to me of no importance. I was pleased to think you were happy.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Well, I think it’s positively disgraceful, Penelope.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, my dear, don’t exaggerate. It was a harmless peccadillo.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m not talking of my behaviour, but of yours.
#PENELOPE.
Mine?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Yes, scandalous I call it.
#PENELOPE.
And I thought it was so tactful.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Tactful be blowed. You must be entirely devoid of any sense of decency.
#PENELOPE.
My dear, I haven’t done anything.
#DICKIE BIRD.
That’s just it. You ought to have done something. You ought to have kicked up a row; you ought to have made scenes; you ought to have divorced me. But just to sit there and let it go on as if it were nothing at all! It’s too monstrous.
#PENELOPE.
I’m awfully sorry. If I’d known you wanted me to make a scene of course I would have, but really it didn’t seem worth making a fuss about.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’ve never heard anything so callous, anything so cold - blooded, anything so cynical.
#PENELOPE.
You are difficult to please.
#DICKIE BIRD.
But don’t you realise that I’ve treated you abominably.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, no, you’ve always been the best and most discreet of husbands.
#DICKIE BIRD.
No, I’ve been a bad husband. I’m man enough to acknowledge it. And I mean to turn over a new leaf, Penelope; I will give Ada up. I promise you never to see her again.
#PENELOPE.
Darling, why should you cause her needless pain? After all, she’s an old friend of mine. I think the least I can expect is that you should treat her nicely.
#DICKIE BIRD.
D’you mean to say you want it to go on?
#PENELOPE.
It’s an arrangement that suits us all three. It amuses you, Ada has some one to take her about, and I get a lot of new frocks.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Frocks?
#PENELOPE.
Yes, you see, I’ve been consoling my aching heart by replenishing my wardrobe.
#DICKIE BIRD.
So you’re willing to sacrifice our whole happiness to your frocks. Oh, I’ve cherished a viper in my bosom. I may have acted like a perfect beast, but, hang it all, I do know what’s right and wrong. I have a moral sense.
#PENELOPE.
It seems to have displaced your sense of humour.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Do you know that all these weeks I’ve been tortured with remorse? I’ve told myself every day that I was treating you shamefully, I’ve not had a moment’s happiness. I’ve lived on a perfect rack.
#PENELOPE.
It doesn’t seem to have had any serious effect on your health.
#DICKIE BIRD.
And here have you been laughing up your sleeve all the time. It can’t go on.
#PENELOPE.
Upon my word, I don’t see why not?
#DICKIE BIRD.
We’ve been mistaken in one another. I’m not the man to stand such a position with indifference. And I’ve been mistaken in you, Penelope. I thought you cared for me.
#PENELOPE.
I dote upon you.
#DICKIE BIRD.
That’s a jolly nice way of showing it.
#PENELOPE.
That’s just what I thought it was.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You’ve outraged all my better nature.
#PENELOPE.
Then what do you propose to do?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m going to do the only possible thing. Separate.
#PENELOPE.
Here are papa and mamma. They said they were coming back.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I hope they’ll never find out what a wicked, cruel woman you are. It would send down their grey hairs in sorrow to the grave.
#PENELOPE.
But, my dear, they know all about it.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What! Is there any one who doesn’t know?
#PENELOPE.
We didn’t tell Uncle Davenport. He’s such a man of the world, he has no sense of humour.
#PEYTON.
Professor and Mrs. Golightly.
#PENELOPE.
Well, mother ... Papa, Dickie wants to separate from me because I won’t divorce him.
#GOLIGHTLY.
That doesn’t sound very logical.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
What has happened?
#PENELOPE.
Nothing’s happened. I can’t make out why Dickie’s so cross.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Nothing!
#PENELOPE.
I didn’t mean to say anything about it, but Dickie found out that we knew all about his little love affair.
#GOLIGHTLY.
My dear, how tactless of you! A man likes to keep those things from his wife.
#DICKIE BIRD.
And d’you know the attitude Penelope takes up?
#GOLIGHTLY.
She hasn’t been making a scene?
#DICKIE BIRD.
That’s just it. Any woman of feeling would make a scene. There must be something radically wrong about her, or she would have wept and stamped and torn her hair.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Oh, my dear boy, don’t you exaggerate the enormity of your offence?
#DICKIE BIRD.
There are no excuses for me.
#GOLIGHTLY.
It was a mere trifle. It would show a lamentable want of humour in Penelope if she took it seriously.
#DICKIE BIRD.
D’you mean to say you agree with her?
#GOLIGHTLY.
My dear fellow, we’re in the twentieth century.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh! Mrs. Golightly, you spend your time in converting the heathen. Don’t you think your own family needs some of your attention? long acquaintance with savage races has led me to the conclusion that man is naturally a polygamous animal.
#DICKIE BIRD.
My brain reels.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
I confess I was relieved to hear it was a married woman. It seems to make it so much more respectable.
#DICKIE BIRD.
It appears to me I’m the only moral man here.
#PENELOPE.
Dickie, darling, I haven’t been having an affair with the policeman.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I wish you had. I wouldn’t have treated you like this.
#PENELOPE.
I thought of it, but I didn’t like the colour of his moustache.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I know I’m to blame. I’ve behaved like a perfect brute.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, nonsense.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Don’t contradict, Penelope. I’m thoroughly ashamed of myself.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Come, come!
#DICKIE BIRD.
I repeat, there are no excuses for me.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Poor fellow, he seems quite cut up.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I haven’t a leg to stand on, but, by Jove, I’ve got a moral sense, and I tell you all that I’m simply outraged. You’re overthrowing the foundations of society. Whatever I’ve done, I’ve got more respect for the sanctity of the home and the decencies of family life than all of you put together. moral sense. That’s what I’ve got.
#PENELOPE.
Poor darling.
#GOLIGHTLY.
What on earth made you blurt it all out?
#PENELOPE.
She came here to - day, and I saw that he was sick to death of her.... Mamma, you behaved like a heroine of romance.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
I shall never forgive myself for the dreadful things you’ve made me say.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, yes, you will, mother. Fast an extra day all through next Lent. It’ll be equally good for your soul and for your figure.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Penelope!
#PENELOPE.
I suddenly felt the moment had come.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Take care.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I say, what are these two confounded women doing in the hall?
#PENELOPE.
What women? Oh, I know.... Please come in. They’re from Françoise. The Modiste.
#PENELOPE.
You told me I might get a hat or two to console myself for your trip to Paris.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Very nice of you, Dickie. That shows you haven’t a selfish nature.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
You’ve never given me a free hand to buy hats, Charles.
#GOLIGHTLY.
On the other hand, I’ve never taken little jaunts to Paris without you, my dear.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Some women are so lucky in their husbands.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, isn’t this a dream? Oh! oh! Did you ever see anything so lovely? Dickie, you are a dear. I’m so glad you’re going to Paris.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m not going to Paris.
#PENELOPE.
What!
#DICKIE BIRD.
Take all these hats away.
#PENELOPE.
But Mrs. Mack?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Mrs. Mack can go to the devil.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Hulloa, hulloa. Gerrard 1234. Tell Mrs. Fergusson that Mrs. Mack has had a relapse, and will not be able to go to Paris to - night.
#PEYTON.
Professor and Mrs. Golightly.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, my sainted mother!
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
I’ve never climbed up so many stairs in my life.
#PENELOPE.
I told Peyton to bring you up here so that no one should come and bother us. My noble father!
#GOLIGHTLY.
My chiyld!
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Don’t be ridiculous, Pen.
#PENELOPE.
Sit down, mamma, and get your breath back, because I’m just going to take it away again.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
It sounds hardly worth while.
#PENELOPE.
Dickie adores me.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Is that all?
#PENELOPE.
But it’s the most surprising, exquisite, wonderful thing in the world, and I’m in the seventh heaven of delight.
#GOLIGHTLY.
But has he told you so?
#PENELOPE.
Oh, no, we’re not on speaking terms at present.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Ah, I suppose you express your mutual affection in dumb show.
#PENELOPE.
He went out immediately after you left last night, and didn’t come home till past twelve. I heard him stop at my door, so I huddled myself under the bed - clothes and pretended to be fast asleep, but I just let my hand drop carelessly over one side of the bed. Then he gave a tiny little knock, and as I didn’t answer he came in, and he crept up on tip - toe, and he looked at me as if - as if he’d like to eat me up.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Penelope, you’re romancing. How on earth could you know that?
#PENELOPE.
I saw him through the back of my head - there. And then he bent down and just touched my hand with his lips. Look, that’s where he kissed it - just on the knuckle.
#GOLIGHTLY.
It seems to have left no mark.
#PENELOPE.
Don’t be silly. And then he crept softly out again, and I had the first really good sleep I’ve had for a month. And this morning I had my breakfast in bed, and when I got up he’d gone out.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
You haven’t seen him to - day at all?
#PENELOPE.
No, he didn’t come in to luncheon.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Well, Charles, I’m grateful that you never showed your passion for me by keeping systematically out of my way.
#PENELOPE.
But, my dear, it’s so simple. Of course, he’s in a dreadful temper. I’ve made him feel a perfect fool, and he hates it. But, good heavens! after five years I know how to deal with him when I’ve hurt his pride. I’ll just give him a chance of saving his face, and then we’ll fall into one another’s arms and be happy ever afterwards.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
But, darling, don’t waste the precious hours, do it at once.
#PENELOPE.
No, I’m wiser than that. I’m not going to do anything till Ada Fergusson is quite disposed of.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Has anything been seen of her?
#PENELOPE.
No, but I expect her here every minute.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Here?
#PENELOPE.
She rang up last night and spoke in a deep voice, like this, so that I shouldn’t recognise her. She asked if Dickie was at home, and I said he wasn’t. Will you ask him to ring up Mrs. Mack as soon as he comes back? Oh! I said, I think he’s been at Mrs. Mack’s all the evening, and I rang off quickly. And this morning I just took the receiver off, and I think by now Ada must be in a pretty temper.
#PENELOPE.
Two and two don’t make five, father.
#GOLIGHTLY.
I never said they did, darling.
#PENELOPE.
Then why are you writing it down?
#GOLIGHTLY.
You seem to think they do, my dear; and I have the highest respect for your intelligence.
#PENELOPE.
Mamma, if you thought it absolutely necessary to provide a father for your offspring, I wish you had chosen one who wasn’t quite so irritating.
#PENELOPE.
D’you think I’m a perfect fool, father?
#GOLIGHTLY.
Yes, my dear.
#PENELOPE.
Why?
#GOLIGHTLY.
You’re preparing for Dickie once more an uninterrupted diet of strawberry ices.
#PENELOPE.
Put that down, father, and tell me what you’re talking about.
#GOLIGHTLY.
How are you going to keep your husband’s love now you have got it back?
#PENELOPE.
I’m never going to bore him with demonstrations of affection. I’m never going to ask him if he loves me. And when he goes out I’m never going to inquire at what time he’ll be back.
#GOLIGHTLY.
And what will you do when the next pretty little grass - widow throws herself at his head?
#PENELOPE.
I hope he’ll duck and dodge her.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Your mother, from her unrivalled knowledge of heathen races, has told you that man is naturally a polygamous animal.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
I shall never forgive myself.
#PENELOPE.
Do you mean to say I’m to expect Dickie to have flirtations with half a dozen different women?
#GOLIGHTLY.
I only see one way to avoid it.
#PENELOPE.
And what is that?
#GOLIGHTLY.
Be half a dozen different women yourself.
#PENELOPE.
It sounds dreadfully exhausting.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Remember that man is by nature a hunter. But how the dickens can he pursue if you’re always flinging yourself in his arms? Even the barndoor hen gives her lawful mate a run for his money.
#PENELOPE.
It was so easy for me to love, honour, and obey him, and so delightful. It never struck me that I ought to keep watch over my feelings.
#GOLIGHTLY.
We all strive for happiness, but what would happiness be if it clung to us like a poor relation?
#PENELOPE.
Strawberry ice for breakfast, strawberry ice for luncheon, and strawberry ice for tea.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Put a Rembrandt on your walls, and in a week you’ll pass it without a glance.
#PENELOPE.
Papa, don’t batter me with metaphors.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Well, you made your love too cheap, my dear. You should have let your husband beg for it, and you made it a drug in the market. Dole out your riches. Make yourself a fortress that must be freshly stormed each day. Let him never know that he has all your heart. He must think always that at the bottom of your soul there is a jewel of great price that is beyond his reach.
#PENELOPE.
Do you mean to say that I must be always on my guard? wise woman never lets her husband be quite, quite sure of her. The moment he is - Cupid puts on a top - hat and becomes a churchwarden.
#PENELOPE.
D’you think it’s worth all that?
#GOLIGHTLY.
That is a question only you can answer.
#PENELOPE.
I suppose you mean it depends on how much I love Dickie. I love him with all my heart, and if I can keep his love everything is worth while. But, oh, father, why can’t we go back to the beginning when we loved one another without a thought of wisdom or prudence? That was the real love. Why couldn’t it last?
#GOLIGHTLY.
Because you and Dickie are man and woman, my dear.
#PENELOPE.
But my friends have husbands, and they don’t philander with every pretty woman they meet.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Scylla and Charybdis. The price they pay is satiety. Would you rather have the placid indifference of nine couples out of ten, or at the cost of a little trouble and a little common sense keep Dickie loving you passionately to the end of his days?
#PENELOPE.
You and mamma show no signs of being bored to death with one another.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Your sainted mother has been systematically unfaithful to me for twenty years.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Charles!
#GOLIGHTLY.
She has had an affair with the Additional Curates’ Society, and an intrigue with the English Church Mission. She has flirted with Christian Science, made eyes at Homœopathy, and her relations with vegetarianism have left a distinct mark on her figure. How could I help adoring a woman so depraved?
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
It’s monstrous of you to reproach me, Charles, when you have conducted for years a harem of algebraical symbols.
#PENELOPE.
And to think that I never knew how immoral my parents were!
#GOLIGHTLY.
I think we must be the lucky ones, dear. We’ve been married for twenty years....
#PENELOPE.
Make it a quarter of a century, father. I really can’t pass for less than twenty - four.
#GOLIGHTLY.
And we seem to have got on pretty well, don’t we?
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
You’ve been very good to me, Charles, dear.
#GOLIGHTLY.
We’ve clomb the hill together....
#PENELOPE.
Sh! sh! sh! I cannot allow my parents to flirt in my presence. I never heard of such a thing.
#GOLIGHTLY.
We tender our apologies.
#PENELOPE.
Listen. There’s Dickie. Father, quickly - what must I do to make him love me always?
#GOLIGHTLY.
In two words, lead him a devil of a life.
#PENELOPE.
If you only knew how I want to fly into his arms and forget the wretched past!
#GOLIGHTLY.
Don’t, but tell him you’re going for a motor trip.
#PENELOPE.
Supposing he lets me go?
#GOLIGHTLY.
My dear, a merciful providence has given you roguish eyes and a sharp tongue. Make use of them.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Charles, I shall be thankful when you return to your mathematics. The morals of that hussy X are already so bad that you can’t make them much worse.
#PENELOPE.
The fact is, papa, that as a guide for the young you have rather advanced views.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Ungrateful child! And I, like the pelican, have offered you my very heart to dine on.
#DICKIE BIRD.
May I come in?
#PENELOPE.
Yes, do!
#DICKIE BIRD.
How d’you do?
#GOLIGHTLY.
Are you ready?
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Yes.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I hope I’m not driving you away.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Oh no, we only came in for ten minutes to say good - bye to Penelope.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Are you ...?
#GOLIGHTLY.
I hope you’ll enjoy yourself, dear.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, I’m sure I shall.
#MRS. GOLIGHTLY.
Good - bye, darling.
#PENELOPE.
Good - bye.
#GOLIGHTLY.
We can find our way out. Don’t bother about Peyton.
#PENELOPE.
I want to speak to her.
#GOLIGHTLY.
Oh, I see. Good - bye.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, Peyton, you might pack up some things for me in that little flat portmanteau of the doctor’s. Put my green charmeuse in.
#PEYTON.
Very well, ma’am.
#PENELOPE.
You can call a cab in half an hour.
#PEYTON.
Very well, ma’am.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Are you going away?
#PENELOPE.
Oh, yes, didn’t I tell you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
No.
#PENELOPE.
How stupid of me! You see, I was expecting you to spend two or three days in Paris with Ada, and I arranged to motor down to Cornwall with the Hendersons.
#DICKIE BIRD.
But I gave up the trip to Paris so as not to annoy you.
#PENELOPE.
It wouldn’t have annoyed me a bit, darling.
#DICKIE BIRD.
It ought to have annoyed you.
#PENELOPE.
In any case I’m afraid I can’t throw the Hendersons over. They’ve made up a little partie carrée so that we can play bridge in the evenings.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Look here, Pen, let’s make it up.
#PENELOPE.
But we haven’t quarrelled, have we?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I don’t know whether I want to shake you or hug you.
#PENELOPE.
Well, if I were you, I’d do neither.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Pen, I want to talk seriously to you.
#PENELOPE.
Have you time?
#DICKIE BIRD.
What on earth d’you mean?
#PENELOPE.
You generally start off for Mrs. Mack’s about now.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Mrs. Mack’s dead.
#PENELOPE.
Dead! When’s the funeral?
#DICKIE BIRD.
The date hasn’t been settled yet.
#PENELOPE.
Well, now you’ll be able to send in your bill.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Pen, Mrs. Mack never existed.
#PENELOPE.
I never thought she did, darling.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What!
#DICKIE BIRD.
D’you mean to say you knew all the time that I’d invented her?
#PENELOPE.
I thought it was very nice of you to make up a plausible excuse for being away so much.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Then, when you bought all those things because I was making such a pot of money, you were just pulling my leg.
#PENELOPE.
Well....
#DICKIE BIRD.
I say, you have scored us off. Upon my soul, you are a wonderful little woman. I can’t think how I ever saw anything in Ada Fergusson.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, but I think she’s charming.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What nonsense! You know you don’t. If you only knew the life she led me!
#PENELOPE.
I suppose she often asked you if you really loved her?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Ten times a day.
#PENELOPE.
And when you left her, did she want to know exactly at what time you’d come back?
#DICKIE BIRD.
How did you know?
#PENELOPE.
I guessed it.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, Pen, let’s forget and forgive.
#PENELOPE.
There’s nothing to forgive, darling.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I suppose you want me to eat the dust.... I have behaved like a perfect brute. I’m awfully sorry, and I’ll never do it again.
#PENELOPE.
I daresay the game isn’t worth the candle.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Don’t speak of it.
#PENELOPE.
And I was under the impression you were having such a good time.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I was feeling awfully conscience - stricken.
#PENELOPE.
That’s where women have such an advantage over men. Their conscience never strikes them till they’ve lost their figure and their complexion.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I say, what are you running round the room for in that ridiculous fashion?
#PENELOPE.
I thought we were playing touch - last.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Don’t be a little beast, Pen. You know you love me, and I simply dote upon you.... I can’t do more than I have done.
#PENELOPE.
What d’you want me to do?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I want you to kiss and make friends.
#PENELOPE.
I think you’re a little previous, aren’t you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I suppose you’re thinking of Ada Fergusson.
#PENELOPE.
I confess she hadn’t entirely slipped my mind.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Hang Ada Fergusson!
#PENELOPE.
I think that’s rather drastic punishment. After all, she did nothing but succumb to your fatal fascination.
#DICKIE BIRD.
That’s right, put all the blame on me. As if it were men who made the running on these occasions! I never want to see her again.
#PENELOPE.
How changeable you are.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m never going to change again. I’ve had my lesson, and I’m going to be good in future.
#PENELOPE.
Anyhow, don’t you think you’d better be off with the old love before you get on with the new?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Yes, but you might help me.
#PENELOPE.
You don’t want me by any chance to tell Ada Fergusson that you don’t care for her any more?
#DICKIE BIRD.
It’s a devilish awkward thing to say oneself.
#PENELOPE.
I can imagine that the best - tempered woman would take it a little amiss.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I say, can’t you suggest something to help me out?
#PENELOPE.
My dear, since the days of Ariadne there’s only been one satisfactory way of consoling a deserted maiden.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Uncle Davenport!
#PENELOPE.
What about Uncle Davenport?
#DICKIE BIRD.
He told me yesterday he thought she was a devilish fine woman.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, no, Dickie, I’m not going to allow you to sacrifice my only uncle.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’ll just ring him up and tell him she’s not gone to Paris.
#PENELOPE.
No, Dickie. No, Dickie. No, Dickie!
#DICKIE BIRD.
Mayfair 7521. I promise you he shall come to no harm. Before it gets serious we’ll tell him that she’s not a Jones of Llandudno, but a Jones of Notting Hill Gate.
#PENELOPE.
I don’t think it’s quite nice what you’re doing.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I think it’s horrid. I shall blame myself very much afterwards.
#PENELOPE.
With your moral sense too.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Hulloa, can I speak to Mr. Barlow? Hulloa, is that you, Uncle Davenport? No, I didn’t go to Paris after all. Mrs. Mack had a sudden relapse, and couldn’t be moved. No, Mrs. Fergusson hasn’t gone either.
#PEYTON.
Mrs. Fergusson is in the drawing - room, ma’am.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What! Half a minute. Hold on.
#PENELOPE.
I’ve been expecting her all the afternoon. Ask her if she wouldn’t mind coming up here.
#PEYTON.
Very well, ma’am.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I say, there’s no getting out of it. Hulloa. Why don’t you come round? Mrs. Fergusson is calling on Pen, and you can arrange about your luncheon party then.... All right. Good - bye.... I say, I’m going to bolt.
#PENELOPE.
You coward!
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m not a coward, Penelope. I shall be back in two minutes. But I’m thirsty, and I’m going to have a brandy and soda.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I say, hang it all, you needn’t grudge me one kiss.
#PENELOPE.
Wait till you’re off with the old love, my friend.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I think it’s a bit thick that a man shouldn’t be allowed to embrace the wife of his bosom.
#PENELOPE.
You shall afterwards, if you’re good.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I say, she’s just coming. What a blessing this room has two doors!
#PENELOPE.
Dearest ... I hope you don’t mind being dragged up here.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Of course not. I like this room. I always think it’s just the place for a heart - to - heart talk.
#PENELOPE.
How nice you’re looking!
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
D’you like my frock?
#PENELOPE.
I always think it suits you so well.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
It is the first time I have put it on.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, then I suppose I’ve seen one just like it on other people.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
You’ll think I’m coming here a great deal, dearest.
#PENELOPE.
You know that Dickie and I are always glad to see you.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Is Dr. O’Farrell at home? I wanted to ask him something about the medicine he prescribed for me yesterday.
#PENELOPE.
Now don’t say you’ve come to see Dickie. I was hoping you’d come to see me.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I wanted to kill two birds with one stone.
#PENELOPE.
That is a feat of marksmanship which always gives one satisfaction.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I forget if you said that Dr. O’Farrell was at home.
#PENELOPE.
You know, I think you must be the only person who’s known him ten minutes without calling him Dickie.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I should have no confidence in him as a doctor if I did.
#PENELOPE.
I never employ him myself. I always go to Dr. Rogers.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
You look as if you had robust health, dearest.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, I just manage to trip along above ground to save funeral expenses.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Is Dr. O’Farrell quite well?
#PENELOPE.
Tired.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I suppose you haven’t the least idea when he’ll be home?
#PENELOPE.
I didn’t know he was out.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought you said he was out.
#PENELOPE.
No.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I must have misunderstood you.
#PENELOPE.
I think he’s lying down. You see he was with poor Mrs. Mack till twelve o’clock last night.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Was he?
#PENELOPE.
It’s so bad that she should have had a relapse when she seemed to be going on so well.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I was more distressed than I can say.
#PENELOPE.
And it must have been so inconvenient for you after you’d made all your arrangements for going to Paris.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, of course, I didn’t think of my convenience at all.
#PENELOPE.
Dickie says the way you’ve nursed her is beyond all praise.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I think in this life we ought to do what we can for one another. I only did my duty.
#PENELOPE.
So few of us do that.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
When I think of my husband bravely serving his country in a foreign land, I feel that I ought to do anything I can to help others.
#PENELOPE.
Were you there at the end?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
What end?
#PENELOPE.
You don’t mean to say you don’t know?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Penelope, I haven’t an idea what you’re talking about.
#PENELOPE.
But Dickie was with Mrs. Mack all this morning.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
That’s absurd.
#PENELOPE.
I wonder you weren’t sent for.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
But....
#PENELOPE.
Then you really don’t know?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I know nothing.
#PENELOPE.
My poor, dear Ada. I’m distracted that I should have to give you this bitter, bitter blow. Mrs. Mack is - dead.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Dead!
#PENELOPE.
She died in Dickie’s arms, thanking him for all he’d done for her.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Impossible!
#PENELOPE.
I don’t wonder you say that. She was quite frisky a day or two ago.... Sit down, dear. You’re quite upset. You were very fond of her, weren’t you?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Dead!
#PENELOPE.
Why don’t you have a good cry? Can’t you find your handkerchief? Take this. It’s very sad, isn’t it? And after all you’d done for her?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
It’s a great blow.
#PENELOPE.
Oh, I know. I feel for you, dear. Dickie was devoted to her. He said he’d never had such a patient. She died, with a smile on her lips, mentioning her dead husband’s name. Dickie was so moved, he couldn’t eat any lunch, poor boy; and we’re going to have a new landaulette.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I say, what’s up?
#PENELOPE.
I’ve just broken the news to poor Ada.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What news?
#PENELOPE.
She didn’t know that Mrs. Mack was - no more.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I certainly didn’t!
#PENELOPE.
You ought to have let her know, Dickie. She would have liked to be - in at the death.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I wanted to spare you.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
It’s too kind of you.
#PENELOPE.
I knew that was it. Dickie has such a kind heart.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I have already noticed it.
#PENELOPE.
And you were so fond of her, weren’t you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I looked upon her as a real friend.
#PENELOPE.
I’ve told Ada that she expired in your arms, darling.
#DICKIE BIRD.
With a smile on her lips.
#PENELOPE.
That’s just what I said. Murmuring the name of her husband, who’d been dead for forty years. What did you say the name was, Dickie?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Walker, darling.
#PENELOPE.
Tell Ada more. She wants to hear the details.
#DICKIE BIRD.
She asked to be remembered to you. She sent her love to your husband.
#PENELOPE.
She seems to have thought of everything. You must go to the funeral, Dickie.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Yes; I should like to show her that sign of respect.
#PENELOPE.
Wouldn’t you like a glass of sherry, dearest? I can see you’re quite upset.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
The - news has taken me by surprise.
#PENELOPE.
To tell you the truth, I expected it last night. But I quite understand your emotion.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I’m so much obliged for your sympathy.
#PENELOPE.
I’m going to get you some sherry myself.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, let me.
#PENELOPE.
No, stay with Ada, darling. You have such a way with you when one’s in trouble.
#DICKIE BIRD.
On an occasion like this a woman wants another woman with her.
#PENELOPE.
No, you know just the right thing to say. I shall never forget how charming you were when our last cook gave notice.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Now!
#DICKIE BIRD.
Good heavens! You made me positively jump.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
What does all this mean?
#DICKIE BIRD.
It means that Mrs. Mack, like the rest of us, is mortal. The funeral takes place the day after to - morrow at Kensal Green. Friends kindly accept this the only intimation.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
How can Mrs. Mack be dead? You know just as well as I do that she never existed.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Upon my word, I’m beginning to be not quite certain. I’ve talked about her so much that she seems much more real than - than my bank balance, for instance. And I could write a beautiful article for the Lancet on the case.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh!
#DICKIE BIRD.
After all, she did have a rotten time of it, poor old lady. Operation after operation. Life wasn’t worth living. She was bound to die. And I call it a jolly happy release.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Where were you last night?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I was at Mrs. Mack’s - no, of course, I wasn’t. I’m so used to saying that that it slips out quite naturally. I’m awfully sorry.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
How can you tell me such lies?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I don’t know. I suppose it’s growing into a habit.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I recommend you to keep them for Penelope.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I suppose you think, then, they don’t matter?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, she’s your wife. That’s quite another story.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I see.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
What d’you mean by saying, I see?
#DICKIE BIRD.
It was the only reply I could think of at the moment.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I’m sure you meant something by it.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Have a glass of sherry, will you?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
No.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Well, I think I will if you don’t mind. I have an idea that sherry’s coming into fashion again.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Have you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I always think I have a knack of making myself pleasant under difficulties.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Look here, I’ve got something to tell you that I’m afraid you won’t very much like. I daresay you’ll think me an awful brute, but I’m bound to say it. The fact is, I’m not built the proper way for intrigue. All these lies make me awfully uncomfortable. I don’t like to think I’m treating Penelope badly. I may as well tell you the whole truth bang out. I’ve discovered that I’m desperately in love with Penelope.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
And?
#DICKIE BIRD.
And that’s all.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
And how do you imagine that interests me?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I thought - er....
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
You haven’t been under the impression that I ever cared for you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
No, no. Of course a man’s a conceited ass who thinks a woman’s in love with him.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
You amused me when I first met you, but you’ve long ceased to do that.
#DICKIE BIRD.
It’s kind of you to say so.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
It was convenient to have some one to do things for me. I’m a womanly woman and....
#DICKIE BIRD.
You don’t know your way about.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
For the last month you’ve bored me to extinction. I’ve done everything in my power to show you except say it right out.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m afraid I’ve been very dense.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Dreadfully dense.
#DICKIE BIRD.
But it was good of you to spare my feelings.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
D’you think it would be rude if I described you in your own words as a conceited ass?
#DICKIE BIRD.
It might make our future acquaintance rather formal.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
There will be no future acquaintance.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Then there’s nothing more to be said.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Does Penelope adore you as blindly as when first I met you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I venture to think she’s as much in love with me as I am with her.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
What have you done with the letters I wrote to you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I did as we agreed. I burnt them at once.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I didn’t. I kept yours.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I shouldn’t have thought they were interesting enough.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I have an idea that Penelope would find them positively absorbing.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Why don’t you send them to her?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
If you have no objection, I think I will.
#DICKIE BIRD.
They will tell her nothing that she doesn’t know already.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
You don’t mean to say you’ve told her?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Of course not.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Well?
#DICKIE BIRD.
She’s known it all along.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Known what?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Everything. From the beginning.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
How did she find out?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Heaven only knows.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
It’s a trap! I might have known she wasn’t such a fool as she seemed. She wants to divorce you, and she’s used me. My husband will never stand that.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I can imagine that even the most affectionate husband would draw the line there.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, don’t try and be funny now.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I wasn’t. The funny part is yet to come.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
What?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Well, you needn’t get into a state about it. Penelope’s not going to do anything.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
But then, why ...?
#DICKIE BIRD.
She doesn’t care a hang.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I don’t understand.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Don’t you? It’s very simple. It’s a matter of no importance. She’s glad that I’ve been amused. If she only knew how much amusement I’ve got out of it! She looks upon it in the light of a - of a change of air.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh! Oh! Oh! A fortnight’s golf at the seaside, I suppose.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Something like that.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I’d sooner she divorced you.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Thanks, I wouldn’t.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Oh, what a humiliation! I’ve been just a convenience because she had other fish to fry. How sordid it makes the whole thing! And I was yearning for romance. I would never have looked at you if I hadn’t thought she doted on you.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I have an idea that affairs of this sort are only romantic when they happen to other people. When they happen to yourself - well, sordid’s just the word.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
And Mrs. Mack?
#DICKIE BIRD.
She’s known all about that too.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
D’you mean that to - day when we ...?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Mingled your tears? I think hers were about as real as yours.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
And she led me on to say one thing after another.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I think she’s been pulling both our legs successfully.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
How on earth am I going to meet her now?
#DICKIE BIRD.
She’ll be all right. She’ll be just as charming as ever.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
You fool! Don’t you see that if she’s charming to me it’s because she thinks she’s prettier than I am, and cleverer than I am, and more fascinating than I am? She doesn’t even despise me, she’s indifferent to me.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
A change of air.
#PENELOPE.
I’m not disturbing you, am I?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Er....
#PENELOPE.
Yes?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Nothing.
#PENELOPE.
What? Real tears?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I feel so ridiculous.
#PENELOPE.
Don’t. Don’t cry.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I look such a perfect fool.
#PENELOPE.
It’s so tiresome of our little sins to look foolish when they’re found out, instead of wicked.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I shall never respect myself again.
#PENELOPE.
Dry your tears, dear. Uncle Davenport has just come, and he wants to know if it’s respectable to ask you to lunch with him alone.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
He’s so sympathetic. I’d like to have a heart - to - heart talk with him.
#PENELOPE.
You’ll find the Carlton a most suitable place.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Are my eyes red?
#PENELOPE.
Not a bit. I’ll get you some powder.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I like him. He talks of all the duchesses by their Christian names.
#PEYTON.
Mr. Davenport Barlow.
#PENELOPE.
How d’you do?
#BARLOW.
This is a pleasing surprise. I was under the impression you were in Paris.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
No, poor Mrs. Mack was suddenly taken much worse.
#BARLOW.
It is my gain.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
It’s too nice of you to say so, but I’m leaving London at once all the same.
#BARLOW.
But this is very sudden. What shall we do without you?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
You must blame Dr. O’Farrell.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Me?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
He tells me that now I’m quite strong enough for a foreign climate, and, of course, nothing will induce me to remain an hour away from my husband if I’m not obliged to.
#BARLOW.
But I thought he was bravely fighting for his country.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Well, you see, there doesn’t happen to be any fighting for him to do just now, and he’s taken a very nice house at Malta. And I shall start to - morrow.
#BARLOW.
This is more distressing than I can say. And are you going straight through?
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
No, I shall stop a day or two in Paris on my way.
#BARLOW.
How very singular! I had made all arrangements to go to Paris to - morrow myself.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Then would you mind looking after me on the journey? You see, I’m a womanly woman, and I’m quite helpless in the train by myself.
#BARLOW.
I should look upon it as a privilege. And perhaps we might go to one or two plays while you’re there.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
If you’ll promise not to take me to anything risky.
#BARLOW.
Ha, ha, ha.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Well, dear, I must say good - bye to you. I’m afraid we shan’t meet again for some time.
#PENELOPE.
Good - bye.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
Good - bye. If you hear of anything good on the Stock Exchange, you might let me know. I think I shall cut my loss on Johannesburg and New Jerusalems.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I would.
#MRS. FERGUSSON.
I have a cab downstairs. Can I give you a lift anywhere?
#BARLOW.
It would be very kind of you.
#BARLOW.
Charming creature. So dashing and a thorough gentlewoman.
#PENELOPE.
Now, mind, Uncle Davenport, no pranks.
#BARLOW.
My dear, I’m not only the soul of honour, but fifty - two.
#PENELOPE.
I suppose that does induce a platonic state of mind.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Ouf! Well?
#PENELOPE.
I beg your pardon?
#DICKIE BIRD.
You promised to kiss me.
#PENELOPE.
I didn’t. I promised to allow myself to be kissed.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You little beast.
#PENELOPE.
Finished?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Not nearly.
#PENELOPE.
Then I’m afraid you must go on another time. I’ve got a taxi at the door, and it’s costing twopence a minute.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What d’you want a taxi for?
#PENELOPE.
I thought that would chill your ardour.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You’re not going on that beastly motor trip now?
#PENELOPE.
Why on earth not?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Pen!
#PENELOPE.
Good gracious, I’m keeping them waiting.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Now don’t tease me. Go and take those horrid motor things off, and let’s have a comfortable little tea together. And tell Peyton you’re not at home.
#PENELOPE.
I’m dreadfully sorry to disappoint you, but I’m afraid I can’t break an engagement.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You’re not serious?
#PENELOPE.
Abnormally.
#DICKIE BIRD.
But, Pen dear, everything’s different now. Don’t you know that I love you?
#PENELOPE.
It’s very nice of you to say so.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Doesn’t it mean anything to you?
#PENELOPE.
Not much.
#DICKIE BIRD.
But, Pen dear, pull yourself together. I love you just as much as you love me.
#PENELOPE.
But what makes you think I love you?
#DICKIE BIRD.
You - you don’t mean to say that you don’t care for me any more?
#PENELOPE.
I - no longer feel that the world is coming to an end when you go out of the room.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What!... Why don’t you say straight out that you can’t bear the sight of me?
#PENELOPE.
Because it wouldn’t be quite true. I like you very well.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Like me! I don’t want you to like me. I want you to love me.
#PENELOPE.
I wish I could. It would save a lot of bother.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I don’t understand. This is the most extraordinary thing I’ve ever heard in my life. I always thought you adored me.
#PENELOPE.
Why?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Because I adore you.
#PENELOPE.
Since when?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Always, always, always.
#PENELOPE.
Fancy.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, I know I made a fool of myself. I shall never cease to regret it. D’you think I was happy? D’you think I had a jolly time? Not much.... I suppose it’s that. You can’t forgive me?
#PENELOPE.
Nonsense. Of course I forgive you. It doesn’t matter a bit.
#DICKIE BIRD.
The whole thing’s Greek to me. I loved you always, Pen. I never ceased for a moment to love you.
#PENELOPE.
My dear, you need not protest so much. It doesn’t very much interest me either way.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What a fool I was! I ought to have known that if you took it so calmly it could only be because you didn’t care. If a woman doesn’t make scenes it can only mean that she doesn’t love you.... You used to love me?
#PENELOPE.
Yes.
#DICKIE BIRD.
How can you be so fickle? I never thought you’d treat me like this.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What are you looking for?
#PENELOPE.
I fancied you’d lost your sense of humour. I was just seeing if I could find it.
#DICKIE BIRD.
How can I have a sense of humour when I’m suffering?
#PENELOPE.
Suffering?
#DICKIE BIRD.
The tortures of the damned. I want you. I want your love.
#PENELOPE.
Poor darling.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Don’t laugh at me.
#PENELOPE.
I wasn’t. I was quite sorry for you.
#DICKIE BIRD.
D’you think I want your pity?
#PENELOPE.
I’m very unfortunate. I seem quite unable to please you. I think it’s just as well that I’m going away for a week.
#DICKIE BIRD.
No, you’re not going away.
#PENELOPE.
What makes you think that?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Because I forbid you to.
#PENELOPE.
And are you under the delusion that at your command I shall fall flat on my face?
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’m the master of this house, and I mean to make myself respected.
#PENELOPE.
My dear, since you pay the rent and the taxes it’s quite right that you should rule this house with a rod of iron if you wish it. Personally, at the moment I only want to get out of it.
#DICKIE BIRD.
You’re not going out of it.
#PENELOPE.
Do you propose to keep me here against my will?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Certainly, if needful.
#PENELOPE.
H’m.
#PENELOPE.
Brute force.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I think it’s about time I showed you I’m not going to be made a perfect fool of.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I don’t see anything to laugh at.
#PENELOPE.
I do. It’s so mediæval. And are you going to feed me on bread and water?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Ugh. Now, look here, Pen, be reasonable about it. Why the deuce d’you want to go for this stupid trip?
#PENELOPE.
I refuse to discuss the matter till you’ve opened the door.
#DICKIE BIRD.
It’s not the time of year for a motor trip. It’ll rain cats and dogs, and you’ll catch a beastly cold. You’ll probably get pneumonia. I’m feeling awfully run down, and I shouldn’t wonder if I were sickening for something myself. But don’t you see that if I’m preventing you from going, it’s because I can’t bear to let you out of my sight? I want you. I want you always by me. I want you to love me.... Oh, if you only knew how much I love you, you wouldn’t be so heartless.
#PENELOPE.
But surely, if you cared for me, you wouldn’t try to deprive me of a little enjoyment. You’d be willing to sacrifice yourself sometimes. You’d have a certain regard for my wishes. You wouldn’t put every absurd obstacle in the way when the chance offers for me to have some amusement.
#PENELOPE.
What does that mean?
#DICKIE BIRD.
You’re quite right. I’ve simply been beastly selfish. I was only thinking of myself. I dare say I bore you. Perhaps you’ll like me better when you’ve been away for a few days.
#PENELOPE.
Since you locked the door, perhaps you’ll be good enough to unlock it.
#PENELOPE.
Am I to understand that you offer no objection to my trip?
#DICKIE BIRD.
If it’ll give you pleasure to go, I shall be pleased to think you’re happy. I only want you to be happy.
#PENELOPE.
Would you rather I stayed?
#DICKIE BIRD.
No.
#PENELOPE.
Oh!
#DICKIE BIRD.
I don’t know what I shall do without you. I feel as if I were only now getting to know you. It’s as though - oh, I don’t know how to express it.
#PENELOPE.
But you’ve just said you would rather I went.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I don’t want to think of myself any more. I want to think only of you. It makes me so happy to think of you, Pen. I want to sacrifice myself.
#PENELOPE.
Will you go to my room and see if my bag has been taken down?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Yes. Peyton’s taken it.
#PENELOPE.
Then - ring and tell her to bring it up again.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Pen!
#PENELOPE.
Are you pleased?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, you’re much too good to me. I can’t tell you how grateful I am. Oh, Pen, if you only knew how much I adore you!
#DICKIE BIRD.
Is there any chance for me at all? D’you think you’ll ever love me as you used to?
#PENELOPE.
How can I tell?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, why can’t we go back to the beginning? D’you remember how we loved one another then? You used to come down with me every day when I went out, and when I came back you always ran down to kiss me. And d’you remember how you used to sit on my chair in the morning while I smoked my pipe and we read the paper together?
#PENELOPE.
How you must have hated it!
#DICKIE BIRD.
Hate it? I’ve never been so happy in my life.
#PENELOPE.
At all events I hope we shall always continue to be good friends.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Friends! What’s the good of offering me your friendship when I’m starving for your love? How can you make me so unhappy?
#PENELOPE.
But I’m not going to make you unhappy. I hope I shall always be very pleasant and agreeable.
#DICKIE BIRD.
What d’you think I care for that? Pen, promise that you’ll try to love me?
#PENELOPE.
Yes, I’ll try if you like.
#DICKIE BIRD.
I’ll make you love me. I’ll never rest till I’m sure of your love.
#PENELOPE.
And when you are sure of it I suppose you won’t care twopence for me any more?
#DICKIE BIRD.
Try me! Try me!
#DICKIE BIRD.
I never knew that you were so adorable. It fills me with rapture merely to kiss your hands.
#PENELOPE.
Now I must just go to the Hendersons and tell them I can’t come motoring.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Can’t you telephone? I don’t want to let you out of my sight.
#PENELOPE.
They’re not on the telephone. It’ll be more convenient for me to go.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Very well. If you must, I suppose you must.
#DICKIE BIRD.
Oh, Pen!
#PENELOPE.
Yes.
#DICKIE BIRD.
At what time will you be back?
