#MOTHER.
Yes, I should call that a melancholy song, dear.
#DAUGHTER.
It is sung by a melancholy person, Mother.
#MOTHER.
Why are you that, child?
#DAUGHTER.
I want so much that I shall never have.
#MOTHER.
Well, so do we all.
#DAUGHTER.
Oh, why does nothing ever happen? We sit here all day, and we sing or do our embroidery, and we go to bed, and the next day we get up and do the same things over again, and so it goes on. Mother, is that all there is in the world?
#MOTHER.
It's all there is in our world.
#DAUGHTER.
Are we so very poor?
#MOTHER.
We have the house - and very little else.
#DAUGHTER.
Oh, I wish that we were really poor -
#MOTHER.
You needn't wish, child.
#DAUGHTER.
Oh, but I mean so that it wouldn't matter what clothes we wore; so that we could wander over the hills and down into the valleys, and sleep perhaps in a barn and bathe ourselves in the brook next morning, and -
#MOTHER.
I don't think I should like that very much. Perhaps I'm peculiar.
#DAUGHTER.
Oh, if only I were a boy to go out and make my own way in the world. Would you let me go, Mother, if I were a boy?
#MOTHER.
I don't suppose you'd ask me, dear.
#DAUGHTER.
Oh, well! We must make the best of it, I suppose. Perhaps one day something will happen.
#TALKER.
Brava! Brava! A vastly pleasing song, vastly well sung. Mademoiselle Nightingale, permit me to felicitate you. The Mother of the Nightingale also. Mon Dieu, what is voice, of a richness, of a purity! To live with it always! Madame, I felicitate you again.
#MOTHER.
I must ask you, sir, to explain the meaning of this intrusion.
#TALKER.
Intrusion? Oh, fie! Madame, not intrusion. My feet stand upon the highway. The road, Madame, is common to all. I can quote you Rex - What does Rex, cap. 27, para. 198, say? Via, says Rex, meaning the road; communis is common; omnibus to all, meaning thereby - but perchance I weary you?
#DAUGHTER.
Mother, who is he?
#TALKER.
Ah, Mademoiselle Nightingale, you may indeed ask. Who is he? Is he the Pope of Rome? Nay, he is not the Pope of Rome. Is he the Cham of Tartary? Nay, he is not the Cham of Tartary, for an he were the Cham of Tartary -
#MOTHER.
I beg you, sir, to tell us as shortly as you can who you are and what you want.
#TALKER.
Madam, by nature I am a taciturn man; Silent John I am named by my friends. I am a glum body, a reserved creature. These things you will have already noticed. But now I will commit to you it secret, known only to my dearest friends. Uncommunicative as I am by nature , I am still more so when compelled to hold converse with two such ornaments of their sex through a lattice window. Am I getting any nearer the door?
#MOTHER.
Pray, sir, come in and tell us all about it. I see that we must have your tale.
#TALKER.
To be exact, Madame, I have two tails who follow me about everywhere. One is of my own poor sex, a man, a thing of whiskers; the other has the honour to belong to that sex which - have I said it? - you and Mademoiselle so adorn. Have I your ladyship's permission?
#DAUGHTER.
Oh, Mother, let them come.
#MOTHER.
Well, I suppose I must have you all.
#TALKER.
Madame, I shall never forget this. Though I live to be ninety - three, this will always be engraved upon my memory. My grandchildren climbing upon my knee will wonder sometimes of what the old man is thinking. Little will they know - But I will attend you further within.
#DAUGHTER.
Mother, something is going to happen at last.
#MOTHER.
Oh, child, were you as weary as that?
#FIDDLER.
The SINGER is a pleasant - looking man of middle height, the a tall, silent girl. The TALKER himself is short and round, with a twinkling eye. Each wears a cap with a red feather in it.]
#TALKER.
Madame, your humble and most devoted servants. I have the honour to present to you her Royal Sweetness the Princess Carissima, His Flutiness the Duke of Bogota, and myself a mere Marquis.
#DAUGHTER.
Oh, Mother, they're wandering minstrels.
#MOTHER.
I bid you all welcome, sir.
#TALKER.
Permit me to expound further. The Princess - a courtesy title bestowed by myself last Michaelmas Day - plays upon the fiddle with an unerring beauty which makes strong men weep. You shall hear her. I pray you have your handkerchers ready. His Flutiness the Duke - the title was granted last Candlemas - has a voice of a rare richness. He is cursed with a melancholy disposition most pleasing. He suffers from a surfeit of rejected love. A most waggish companion withal.
#DAUGHTER.
Oh, what a shame!
#SINGER.
You must not believe all that Johannes says, ladies.
#MOTHER.
I had already learnt that much, sir.
#TALKER.
For myself, I play upon the pipe. You shall hear.
#SINGER.
The only notes he knows, ladies.
#TALKER.
Oh, fie, Sir, fie! I protest, Madame, he maligns me. Have I not a G of surpassing splendour, of a fruitiness rarely encountered in this vale of tears? Madame, you must hear my G. Now, where is it? I have it.
#SINGER.
Marvellous!
#MOTHER.
I thank you, Sir.
#DAUGHTER.
Oh, Mother, isn't he splendid?
#TALKER.
Would you like my G again, Madame?
#MOTHER.
Not just now, I thank you, sir. Doubtless we shall feel more in need of it a little later on. But tell me, Sir, have you no other talent to match the singing and playing of your friends?
#FIDDLER.
He talks.
#MOTHER.
I had noticed it.
#TALKER.
This gift of talking with which her Royal Sweetness is good enough to credit me, irksome though it is to a man of silent habit like myself, a creature, as you will have noticed, of taciturn disposition; this - I - Madame, I have lost that sentence. Have I your gracious permission to begin again?
#MOTHER.
I think it would be better, Sir.
#TALKER.
Then, to put it shortly, Madame -
#MOTHER.
If you could, sir.
#TALKER.
To be completely frank in this matter, Madame, I - er - go round with the hat. It is a sordid but necessary business.
#DAUGHTER.
Oh, I hope they give you plenty of money.
#TALKER.
Enough to support life, Mademoiselle. The hungry look which you observe upon His Flutiness is, as I have explained, due to melancholy.
#DAUGHTER.
You are going to perform, aren't you?
#TALKER.
Of a surety, Mademoiselle. Perhaps I should add that for myself I am resting just now, and that my part of the performance will be limited to nothing more than a note or two upon the pipe.
#MOTHER.
Sir, you are generous. We shall be glad to hear your friends. song, good Master Duke, a song which her Royal Sweetness will accompany upon the fiddle. Let it end, I pray you, with a G, so that I may bring the thing to a climax upon the last note.
#FIDDLER.
Morland Hill.
#SINGER.
You like that? Very well.
#DAUGHTER.
I'm not sure that I like that last verse.
#TALKER.
Oh, you mustn't believe all he sings. A cursed melancholy fellow by nature. But waggish - waggish withal.
#SINGER.
We have to sing what the poets write for us, Mademoiselle. Had I written a song myself, it had been about one woman only.
#TALKER.
And there would have been a hundred and twenty - five verses to it.
#MOTHER.
Your song was well sung, sir; I thank you for it. Will you not play us something now?
#FIDDLER.
If you wish it.
#TALKER.
You would wish me to accompany her, of course.
#MOTHER.
It is kind of you, sir, but I think perhaps my daughter -
#DAUGHTER.
Yes, of course, I will if I can.
#FIDDLER.
Do you know this?
#DAUGHTER.
Yes, I think so.
#TALKER.
And now, Madame, you have had a sample of all our poor talents, save and except that paltry talent of mine which in other company concludes such a performance. I pray you tell me what you think of the entertainment.
#MOTHER.
I have enjoyed it immensely, good Master Johannes. And if you did wish to exercise that talent of yours, of which so far we have only heard -
#TALKER.
Nay, nay, Madame, I beg you.
#MOTHER.
Then, Sir, I offer you my grateful thanks for your entertainment.
#DAUGHTER.
And I too.
#TALKER.
Ladies, you are too kind - er - er -
#MOTHER.
Yes? TALKER, The fact is, Madame, that now we approach or, so to speak, draw nigh or adjacent - in other words, Madame, we are perilously approximate -
#FIDDLER.
Tell her straight out.
#MOTHER.
Tell her what?
#FIDDLER.
What we've come for.
#SINGER.
Master Johannes, Madam, is so accustomed when he goes round with the hat to disguise under it flow of words the fact that money is as necessary to an artist as applause, that he has lost the habit of saying anything in less than ten sentences.
#TALKER.
And yet I am a taciturn man.
#MOTHER.
Well, will somebody tell me, for I confess I have been wondering what is behind it all.
#FIDDLER.
Tell her, Johannes.
#TALKER.
If you will allow me, Madame. But tell me first, did you notice anything lacking in our performance?
#MOTHER.
No; I don't think so.
#TALKER.
Perhaps you, Mademoiselle?
#DAUGHTER.
It seemed to lack a woman's voice, sir.
#TALKER.
What intelligence! What profundity! Madam, I felicitate you again on your daughter. Unerringly she has laid her finger on the weak joint in our armour. We have no woman's voice.
#MOTHER.
Well, Sir, I don't see how I can help you.
#TALKER.
Madame, you have a nightingale. It has lived in a cage all its life. It looks through the bars sometimes, and sees the great world outside, and sighs and turns back to its business of singing. Madame, it would sing better outside in the open air, with the other birds.
#MOTHER.
I don't understand you, sir. Are you referring to my daughter?
#TALKER.
There is a stream which runs beyond the road, with a green bank to it. We were seated on that bank, I and my two companions, eating our bread and cheese, and washing it down with draughts from that good stream. We were tired, for we had come from over the hills that morning, and it was good to lie on our backs there and watch the little clouds taking shape after shape in the blue, and so to dream our dreams. In a little while the road would take us westward, here through a wood banked with primroses, there across a common or between high spring hedges with the little stream babbling ever at the side of us. And in the evening we would come to an inn, where there would be good company, and we would sing and play to them, and they would reward us. It is a pleasant life.
#DAUGHTER.
Oh, go on!
#MOTHER.
Yes, go on, Sir.
#TALKER.
We were lying on our backs thus, Madame, when we heard the nightingale. "Duke," says I, "it is early yet for the nightingale." His Flutiness removes his cap from his face, takes a squint at the sun, and says "Monstrous early, good Master Johannes," and claps his cap back again. "What says you, Fiddler," says I, "in this matter of nightingales? Is it possible," says I; "the sun being where it is, and nightingales being what they are - to wit, nightingales?" "It's not a nightingale," says Fiddler dreamily, "it's a girl." "Then," says I, jumping up, "it is a girl we want. She must put the red feather in her cap, and come her ways with us." Madame, your humble servant.
#DAUGHTER.
Oh, Mother, you will let me go, won't you? I must, I must! He is quite right. I'm caged here. Oh, you will let me see something of the world before I grow old!
#FIDDLER.
Yes, let her come. If she feels like that, she ought to come.
#SINGER.
We will take great care of her, Madame, as if she were our own sister.
#MOTHER.
What do you think of cider as a drink, Master Johannes?
#TALKER.
Cider - ah, there's a drink! Oh, I can talk to you about cider, glum body as I am by nature, having been as it were taciturn from birth. Yet of cider I could talk you -
#MOTHER.
Ours is considered very good cider. Take them, child, and give them such refreshment as they want. They have deserved it for their entertainment.
#DAUGHTER.
Why, of course, Mother. Come this way please.
#MOTHER.
Master Johannes. A word with you, if you please, sir.
#TALKER.
But certainly, Madame. The cider will be all the better for the expectation.
#MOTHER.
Sit down, please. Master Johannes, who are you, all of you?
#TALKER.
I thought I had explained, Madame. Her Royal Sweetness Princess Carissima, His Flutiness the Duke of Bogota, and myself a humble Marquis. We may be referred to collectively as the Red Feathers. For myself I am sometimes called Silent John, being of a close disposition.
#MOTHER.
Whatever you are called, you are, I think, a man of the world, and you will understand that if I am to trust my daughter to you, for however little a time, I must know something more about you.
#TALKER.
Madame, I will make a confession to you, a confession I have never yet made to man, woman, or child. I am forty - six years of age; it is, in fact, my birthday. Were I to begin to tell you something about myself, starting from that day, forty - six years ago, when I was born - were I to begin - well, Madame, I am only too ready to begin. It is a subject I find vastly pleasant. But, shall I begin?
#MOTHER.
Would you make it so long a story, sir?
#TALKER.
The tongue is an unruly member, and to one who has but three notes on the pipe, and yet desires to express himself, talking is a great comfort.
#MOTHER.
I said you were a man of the world, sir. May I say now that I think you must be a man of our world?
#TALKER.
I am a man of many worlds. But if it would comfort your mother's heart to know that your daughter will be in good company, I think I can give you that comfort.
#MOTHER.
Is that all you can give me?
#TALKER.
Madame, I will tell you a story. No, quite a short one. Once on a time there was a certain noble gentleman, a baron of estates and family. Conceiving himself to be in love, he dared to put it to the touch to win or lose it all. I regret to say that he lost it all. In a fit of melancholy he abjured society, cursed all women and took to the road. A pleasant melancholy gentleman. I made him a duke.
#MOTHER.
You mean he really is -
#TALKER.
We will name no names, madame. I doubt not I have no right to speak of him to another. It is just a story. Cuck - oo!
#MOTHER.
Poor child, she is not happy here. We live so quietly; we have no neighbours. I have wondered what to do - it seemed that I could do so little. If only I could be sure - Master Johannes, do you like the look of this house with its little stream opposite, and the green bank running down, on which one may lie on one's back and look up at the sky?
#TALKER.
Did we not single it out above all others by having our bread and cheese outside it?
#MOTHER.
Will you all stay with me for a little? I think I can find room for you. Before I can lend my daughter to you, I feel that I must know something of you. I think that is the best way, is it not? The cider is good, you know.
#TALKER.
Madame, we need say no more.
#TOGETHER.
The cuckoo comes in April,
#HE.
The cuckoo comes when April's here -
#SHE.
When April's over he begins
#HE.
By June he gets a trifle flat,
#SHE.
Alas! he does not stay for long,
#MOTHER.
Oh!
#TALKER.
Listen!
#EVERYBODY.
What?
#TALKER.
Didn't I hear somebody say "cider"? ***
#SHE.
He does not know I love him,
#HE.
She does not know I love her,
#TOGETHER.
Yet those who sing
#HE.
She does not know I love her -
#SHE.
He cares not that I love him -
#TOGETHER.
For those who sing, etc.
#DAUGHTER.
It is a pretty song.
#SINGER.
The words, I thought, were good. I liked the words.
#DAUGHTER.
Who thinks of the words of a song if the tune be pretty?
#SINGER.
But if the heart of the singer be in the words?
#DAUGHTER.
Tell me about Chloe.
#SINGER.
Chloe?
#DAUGHTER.
Or whatever her name was.
#SINGER.
I am not sure that I understand this conversation.
#DAUGHTER.
I mean the first one.
#SINGER.
I am not sure that I like this conversation.
#DAUGHTER.
She was the first, wasn't she - the one who made you renounce the world and take to the road?
#SINGER.
Her name was not Chloe.
#DAUGHTER.
What was it?
#SINGER.
Why rake up the dead ashes of the past? I was but a boy. It was five months ago. Besides, her name was Penelope.
#DAUGHTER.
You still remember it, though it was so long ago?
#SINGER.
I could have pretended to have forgotten, if it would have pleased you better.
#DAUGHTER.
I? Oh, I am not interested.
#SINGER.
Well, I didn't start the subject. Perhaps, as neither of us is interested, I had better withdraw. Since we are to start this afternoon, I have much to see about. With your permission.
#DAUGHTER.
Don't go. I am sorry. I have been unkind.
#SINGER.
Shall we practise that other song? Our voices agree, if our - our hearts do not.
#DAUGHTER.
Oh, don't say that. We must be friends.
#SINGER.
Only friends?
#DAUGHTER.
Tell me about her.
#SINGER.
There is not much to tell, dear. I thought she loved me. Perhaps that was why I thought I loved her. When I told her, she pretended to be surprised. I don't think she was surprised. She was very pretty.
#DAUGHTER.
And hard?
#SINGER.
It is not for me to say anything against her. It is through her that I came here.
#DAUGHTER.
When you came here the other day, had you forgotten her?
#SINGER.
"Oh, let the wench, the wench be whom she will, so long as I can walk on Morland Hill." Didn't I say so on that first day?
#DAUGHTER.
Of course, I know very little of the world, but I do wonder sometimes if people who sing about the joys of wandering are really enjoying it all the time.
#SINGER.
Is Johannes about?
#DAUGHTER.
No.
#SINGER.
Then I will be frank with you. Just lately I have been wondering too.
#DAUGHTER.
Oh!
#SINGER.
I have a house; you would like my house. I have a park; you would like the park. Horses to ride and jewels to wear. I go to London sometimes and see the King; you would like London.
#DAUGHTER.
I have never been to London.
#SINGER.
Sweetheart, all that I have - Be careful, Fiddler just went past the window.
#SINGER.
Yes, I think we have it pretty well now. 'Tis a good song. Ah, Fiddler, are you there? What do you think of it?
#FIDDLER.
Isn't it time to start?
#SINGER.
To start? Ah yes, we start this afternoon. Well, we have had a pleasant holiday and must get to work again.
#DAUGHTER.
And I am coming with you.
#FIDDLER.
It is settled?
#DAUGHTER.
Oh yes, I think so.
#FIDDLER.
It is the best life. Play something.
#DAUGHTER.
That is all you want? Just you and your fiddle and the open road?
#FIDDLER.
It is the best life.
#TALKER.
Aha! what did I hear? Did I hear our loquacious Fiddler perorating upon Life? "Life," quoth she, with much argument and circumstantial matter; "Life," she continued, making her points singly and one by one, thus keeping the business in its true perspective; "Life is - " Well, what is life?
#FIDDLER.
When do we start, Johannes?
#TALKER.
Are you so eager to be gone?
#FIDDLER.
We have been here eight days.
#TALKER.
Eight days! And Troy was besieged for eleven years! Eight days! Why, I could talk for eight days without taking breath, and I am by nature a glum, silent man. Nay, nay, say not to me "Eight days." Eight days will not make a man grow old or a woman lose her beauty. Or a woman lose her beauty - Madame, I kiss your hands. Were I of less girth I would flit through the window and fall upon my knees at your feet. As it is, I shall enter by the door in the usual way. I have your permission?
#MOTHER.
You asked my permission a week ago. You do not need to ask it now.
#TALKER.
It has been a happy week. The week has liked me well.
#MOTHER.
You take the road again this afternoon. Your plan still holds?
#TALKER.
They say so, lady.
#MOTHER.
Who say so? Is not Master Johannes the master of his company? Who say so?
#TALKER.
The birds. I held converse with a cuckoo - bird this morning. "Cuckoo," he said - in this manner - meaning, as I gathered, "O fool!" I bowed low to him, and "Pardon, bird," said I, - "but I would have you tell me why I am a fool." He answered thus in parables - "Cuckoo."
#MOTHER.
And what did that mean?
#TALKER.
It meant, "There's no fool like an old fool."
#MOTHER.
Well, Sir?
#TALKER.
Madame, I am a man of good family, although - although I quarrelled with my good family. I left them many years ago and took to the road. I have seen something of the world since then, but I think I must always have had at the back of my mind some dim picture of what a home was - some ancient memory, perhaps. That memory has been very strong within me these last days.
#MOTHER.
You have liked my home, Master Johannes?
#TALKER.
I have liked it well. Well, well - we start this afternoon.
#MOTHER.
You want my daughter?
#TALKER.
Not your daughter, Madame.
#MOTHER.
What is it you want? Are you so backward in asking? It is not like the Master Johannes who came to my house eight days ago.
#TALKER.
Madame, though I have wandered about the world, I have saved some pennies in my time. A few trifling coins - enough for middle - age. Since I have had the great honour of knowing you - Oh, God bless that poor young fool! Madame, I entreat you -
#MOTHER.
Another time, dear Johannes - another time you must tell me - all.
#TALKER.
Friend, we are gay.
#SINGER.
Very, very gay, Master Johannes.
#TALKER.
Something is stirring our middle - aged blood. I feel years younger.
#SINGER.
I have only just been born.
#TALKER.
: Shall we take another turn?
#SINGER.
At your pleasure.
#TALKER.
What do you think has happened to us?
#SINGER.
I - I wonder.
#TALKER.
I suppose the fact that we are going off this afternoon - the joy of returning to our old gay life is - is affecting us? suppose so. Yes, that must be it.
#TALKER.
This cauliflower existence, this settled life which even the least enterprising cabbage would find monotonous, we have had more than enough of it, my friend.
#SINGER.
Yes. I sigh to think how we have wasted these eight days.
#TALKER.
Ah! However, Heaven be praised, we are for the road this afternoon.
#SINGER.
Heaven be praised! It is a grand life.
#TALKER.
Of course, if you came to me and said, "Johannes," you said, "I left my home in a fit of melancholy five months agone; the melancholy is cured, I will return home again" - why, I would say, "God bless you, Master Duke; go your way." Well, I can understand such a thing happening to a man of your age, not born to the wandering as I am.
#SINGER.
Bless you, Johannes, you are a true gentleman.
#TALKER.
Say no more, say no more.
#SINGER.
But I cannot accept this sacrifice. I pledged myself to serve you for a year, and I'll keep my pledge.
#TALKER.
Wait a moment, Master Duke; I have myself thought of retiring these many months past. Indeed, it was only for your sake -
#SINGER.
No, no, I cannot allow it. It is only for my sake that you are saying this. We will take the road this afternoon. Indeed, I would infinitely prefer it. I am enamoured of the wandering life.
#TALKER.
It is a great life. It means everything to me.
#TALKER.
I knew it, I knew it! You and the wandering life!
#SINGER.
You, too, Johannes! You've had enough of it!
#SINGER.
Sweetheart!
#DAUGHTER.
Is it all right?
#SINGER.
Everything is all right, beloved.
#DAUGHTER.
You have told him?
#SINGER.
It couldn't have fallen out better. He, too, was tired of wandering and wanted to settle down.
#DAUGHTER.
I told mother. She seemed glad. You know, I think she seems younger about something.
#FIDDLER.
Are we starting this afternoon?
#DAUGHTER.
Oh, Fiddler dear, do you mind very much? We aren't coming at all. We - we -
#SINGER.
We are getting married.
#FIDDLER.
I thought so.
#DAUGHTER.
But you will come and stay with us sometimes. Oh, say you will!
#SINGER.
Of course she will.
#FIDDLER.
There's Johannes. I expect we shall be starting this afternoon.
#TALKER.
Ladies and gentlemen, companions - in - arms, knights and ladies of the road, comrades all, - I have the honour to make an announcement to you. The wandering company of the Red Feathers is determined from this date, likewise disbanded, or, as others would say, dissolved. "What means this, Master Johannes?" I hear you say. "Who has done this thing?" Ladies and gentles all, I answer you that young Cupid has done this thing. With unerring aim he has loosed his arrows. With the same happy arrow he has pierced the hearts of this gracious lady and myself, while yonder gallant gentleman I name no names, but the perspicacious will perceive whom I mean - is about to link his life with the charming maiden who stands so modestly by his side. There is one other noble lady present to whom I have not yet referred -
#FIDDLER.
I think I must go. Good - bye, and thank you.
#MOTHER.
Wait a moment, dear.
#TALKER.
- noble lady to whom I have not yet referred. I will not hide from you the fact that she plays upon the fiddle with an elegance rarely to be heard. It is the earnest wish of my future wife and myself that she should take up her abode with us.
#FIDDLER.
It's very kind of you, but I don't think -
#DAUGHTER.
Mother, she's going to stay with us; she promised.
#MOTHER.
It's sweet of you to ask her, dear, but I think it would be much more suitable that she should live with us.
#SINGER.
We should love to have her, and she could come and see you whenever she liked.
#MOTHER.
I was going to suggest that she should live with us and come and see you sometimes.
#TALKER.
I have it! What say you to this? For six months, making in all twenty - six weeks of the year, she shall live, reside, dwell, or, as one might say, take up her habitation with us; whereas for the other six months - What's that?
