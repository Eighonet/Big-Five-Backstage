#HUBBARD.
I can't understand why an old wheel - horse like Elsworth should kick over the traces that way.
#CHALMERS.
Disgruntled. Thinks he didn't get his fair share of plums out of the Tariff Committee. Besides, it's his last term. He's announced that he's going to retire.
#HUBBARD.
"A Resolution to Investigate the High Cost of Living!" - old Senator Elsworth introducing a measure like that! The old buck! - How are you going to handle it?
#CHALMERS.
It's already handled.
#HUBBARD.
Yes?
#CHALMERS.
Turned it over to the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expenses of the Senate.
#HUBBARD.
And you're chairman. Poor old Elsworth. This way to the lethal chamber, and the bill's on its way.
#CHALMERS.
Elsworth will be retired before it's ever reported. In the meantime, say after a decent interval, Senator Hodge will introduce another resolution to investigate the high cost of living. It will be like Elsworth's, only it won't.
#HUBBARD.
And it will go to the Committee on Finance and come back for action inside of twenty - four hours.
#CHALMERS.
By the way, I see Cartwright's Magazine has ceased muck - raking.
#HUBBARD.
Cartwrights never did muck - rake - that is, not the big Interests - only the small independent businesses that didn't advertise.
#CHALMERS.
Yes, it deftly concealed its reactionary tendencies.
#HUBBARD.
And from now on the concealment will be still more deft. I've gone into it myself. I have a majority of the stock right now.
#CHALMERS.
I thought I had noticed a subtle change in the last two numbers.
#HUBBARD.
We're still going on muck - raking. We have a splendid series on Aged Paupers, demanding better treatment and more sanitary conditions. Also we are going to run "Barbarous Venezuela" and show up thoroughly the rotten political management of that benighted country.
#CHALMERS.
And now concerning Knox. That's what I sent for you about. His speech comes off tomorrow per schedule. At last we've got him where we want him.
#HUBBARD.
I have the ins and outs of it pretty well. Everything's arranged. The boys have their cue, though they don't know just what's going to be pulled off; and this time to - morrow afternoon their dispatches will be singing along the wires.
#CHALMERS.
This man Knox must be covered with ridicule, swamped with ridicule, annihilated with ridicule.
#HUBBARD.
It is to laugh. Trust the great American people for that. We'll make those little Western editors sit up. They've been swearing by Knox, like a little tin god. Roars of laughter for them.
#CHALMERS.
Do you do anything yourself?
#HUBBARD.
Trust me. I have my own article for Cartwright's blocked out. They're holding the presses for it. I shall wire it along hot - footed to - morrow evening. Say - ?
#CHALMERS.
Well?
#HUBBARD.
Wasn't it a risky thing to give him his chance with that speech?
#CHALMERS.
It was the only feasible thing. He never has given us an opening. Our service men have camped on his trail night and day. Private life as unimpeachable as his public life. But now is our chance. The gods have given him into our hands. That speech will do more to break his influence -
#HUBBARD.
Than a Fairbanks cocktail. But don't forget that this Knox is a live wire. Somebody might get stung. Are you sure, when he gets up to make that speech, that he won't be able to back it up?
#CHALMERS.
No danger at all.
#HUBBARD.
But there are hooks and crooks by which facts are sometimes obtained.
#CHALMERS.
Knox has nothing to go on but suspicions and hints, and unfounded assertions from the yellow press. He will make himself a laughing stock. His charges will turn into boomerangs. His speech will be like a sheet from a Sunday supplement, with not a fact to back it up. We'd better be getting out of here. They're going to have tea. Come to the library and have a high - ball.
#HUBBARD.
And to - morrow Ali Baba gets his.
#CHALMERS.
Ali Baba?
#HUBBARD.
That's what your wife calls him - Knox.
#CHALMERS.
Oh, yes, I believe I've heard it before. It's about time he hanged himself, and now we've given him the rope.
#HUBBARD.
Oh, by the way, just a little friendly warning, Senator Chalmers. Not so fast and loose up New York way. That certain lady, not to be mentioned - there's gossip about it in the New York newspaper offices. Of course, all such stories are killed. But be discreet, be discreet If Gherst gets hold of it, he'll play it up against the Administration in all his papers.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Oh - Tom!
#CONNIE.
Oh, brother - in - law! Such excitement! That's what's the matter with mother. We ran into a go - cart. Our chauffeur was not to blame. It was the woman's fault. She tried to cross just as we were turning the corner. But we hardly grazed it. Fortunately the baby was not hurt - only spilled. It was ridiculous. Oh, there you are, Mr. Hubbard. How de do.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Oh, it was terrible! The little child might have been killed. And such persons love their babies, I know.
#CONNIE.
Has father come? We were to pick him up here. Where's Madge?
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Oh, there is Mr. Hubbard. I simply can't get used to these rapid ways of modern life. The motor - car is the invention of the devil. Everything is too quick. When I was a girl, we lived sedately, decorously. There was time for meditation and repose. But in this age there is time for nothing. How Anthony keeps his head is more than I can understand. But, then, Anthony is a wonderful man.
#HUBBARD.
I am sure Mr. Starkweather never lost his head in his life.
#CHALMERS.
Unless when he was courting you, mother.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
I'm not so sure about that.
#CONNIE.
Father probably conferred first with his associates, then turned the affair over for consideration by his corporation lawyers, and, when they reported no flaws, checked the first spare half hour in his notebook to ask mother if she would have him. And looked at his watch at least twice while he was proposing.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Anthony was not so busy then as all that.
#HUBBARD.
He hadn't yet taken up the job of running the United States.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
I'm sure I don't know what he is running, but he is a very busy man - business, politics, and madness; madness, politics, and business. Tea. I should like a cup of tea. Connie, I shall stay for a cup of tea, and then, if your father hasn't come, we'll go home. Where is Tommy?
#CHALMERS.
Out in the car with Madge. She should be back now.
#CONNIE.
Mother, you mustn't stay long. I have to dress.
#CHALMERS.
Oh, yes, that dinner. I wish I could loaf to - night.
#CONNIE.
The Turkish Charge d'Affaires - I never can remember his name. But he's great fun - a positive joy. He's giving the dinner to the British Ambassador.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
There's Tommy, now.
#TOMMY.
But mama.
#MARGARET.
No. Tommy First -
#MARGARET.
No; you must run along to Linda, now, mother's boy. And we'll talk about that some other time.
#TOMMY.
Grandma! to Connie, and a slightly cold handshake to Hubbard.)
#MARGARET.
Now that you're here, Tom, you mustn't run away.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
trifle thin, Margaret.
#MARGARET.
On the contrary, mother -
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Don't you think so, Tom?
#CONNIE.
Mother continually worries about his health. sturdy youngster, I should say.
#TOMMY.
I'm an Indian, aren't I, daddy?
#CHALMERS.
And the stoutest - hearted in the tribe. There's Linda looking for you, young stout heart.
#MARGARET.
Take Tommy, Linda. Run along, mother's boy.
#TOMMY.
Come along, grandma. I want to show you something. Remember, mama, we're going to scout in a little while.
#MARGARET.
No, Tommy. Mama has to go to that horrid dinner to - night. But to - morrow we'll play. Where is my little Indian now?
#HUBBARD.
Be an Indian, Tommy.
#TOMMY.
All right, mama. To - morrow. - if you can't find time to - day.
#CHALMERS.
That high - ball.
#CONNIE.
If you run away, I won't stop for tea.
#MARGARET.
Do stop, Tom. Father will be here in a few minutes. regular family party.
#CHALMERS.
All right. We'll be back. We're just going to have a little talk.
#MARGARET.
I've got to get my things off. Won't you wait here, dear, in case anybody comes? It's nearly time. Madge. I want to speak to you about something, Madge. You don't mind? Just a warning. Not that anybody could believe for a moment, there is anything wrong, but -
#MARGARET.
If it concerns Tom, don't tell me, please. You know he does do ridiculous things at times. But I don't let him worry me any more; so don't worry me about him. Well?
#CONNIE.
It's not about Tom - It's about you.
#MARGARET.
Oh.
#CONNIE.
I don't know how to begin.
#MARGARET.
By coming right out with it, the worst of it, all at once, first.
#CONNIE.
It isn't serious at all, but - well, mother is worrying about it. You know how old - fashioned she is. And when you consider our position - father's and Tom's, I mean - it doesn't seem just right for you to be seeing so much of such an enemy of theirs. He has abused them dreadfully, you know. And there's that dreadful speech he is going to give to - morrow. You haven't seen the afternoon papers. He has made the most terrible charges against everybody - all of us, our friends, everybody.
#MARGARET.
You mean Mr. Knox, of course. But he wouldn't harm anybody, Connie, dear.
#CONNIE.
Oh, he wouldn't? He as good as publicly called father a thief.
#MARGARET.
When did that happen? I never heard of it.
#CONNIE.
Well, he said that the money magnates had grown so unprincipled, sunk so low, that they would steal a mouse from a blind kitten.
#MARGARET.
I don't see what father has to do with that.
#CONNIE.
He meant him just the same.
#MARGARET.
You silly goose. He couldn't have meant father. Father? Why, father wouldn't look at anything less than fifty or a hundred millions.
#CONNIE.
And you speak to him and make much of him when you meet him places. You talked with him for half an hour at that Dugdale reception. You have him here in your own house - Tom's house - when he's such a bitter enemy of Tom's.
#MARGARET.
You are wrong, Connie. He is nobody's enemy. He is the truest, cleanest, most right - seeking man I have ever seen.
#CONNIE.
He is a trouble - maker, a disturber of the public peace, a shallow - pated demagogue -
#MARGARET.
Now you're quoting somebody - father, I suppose. To think of him being so abused - poor, dear Ali Baba -
#STARKWEATHER.
A - hem.
#MARGARET.
And Connie Father!
#STARKWEATHER.
Fine, thank you. Quite well in every particular. This Ali Baba? Who is Ali Baba?
#CONNIE.
Mr. Howard Knox.
#STARKWEATHER.
And why is he called Ali Baba?
#MARGARET.
That is my nickname for him. In the den of thieves, you know. You remember your Arabian Nights.
#STARKWEATHER.
I have been wanting to speak to you for some time, Margaret, about that man. You know that I have never interfered with your way of life since your marriage, nor with your and Tom's housekeeping arrangements. But this man Knox. I understand that you have even had him here in your house -
#MARGARET.
He is very liable to be here this afternoon, any time, now.
#STARKWEATHER.
Your house - you, my daughter, and the wife of Senator Chalmers. As I said, I have not interfered with you since your marriage. But this Knox affair transcends household arrangements. It is of political importance. The man is an enemy to our class, a firebrand. Why do you have him here?
#MARGARET.
Because I like him. Because he is a man I am proud to call "friend." Because I wish there were more men like him, many more men like him, in the world. Because I have ever seen in him nothing but the best and highest. And, besides, it's such good fun to see how one virtuous man can so disconcert you captains of industry and arbiters of destiny. Confess that you are very much disconcerted, father, right now. He will be here in a few minutes, and you will be more disconcerted. Why? Because it is an affair that transcends family arrangements. And it is your affair, not mine.
#STARKWEATHER.
This man Knox is a dangerous character - one that I am not pleased to see any of my family take up with. He is not a gentleman.
#MARGARET.
He is a self - made man, if that is what you mean, and he certainly hasn't any money.
#CONNIE.
He says that money is theft - at least when it is in the hands of a wealthy person.
#STARKWEATHER.
He is uncouth - ignorant.
#MARGARET.
I happen to know that he is a graduate of the University of Oregon.
#STARKWEATHER.
A cow college. But that is not what I mean. He is a demagogue, stirring up the wild - beast passions of the people.
#MARGARET.
Surely you would not call his advocacy of that child labor bill and of the conservation of the forest and coal lands stirring up the wild - beast passions of the people?
#STARKWEATHER.
You don't understand. When I say he is dangerous it is because he threatens all the stabilities, because he threatens us who have made this country and upon whom this country and its prosperity rest.
#MARGARET.
The captains of industry - the banking magnates and the mergers?
#STARKWEATHER.
Call it so. Call it what you will. Without us the country falls into the hands of scoundrels like that man Knox and smashes to ruin.
#MARGARET.
Not a scoundrel, father.
#STARKWEATHER.
He is a sentimental dreamer, a hair - brained enthusiast. It is the foolish utterances of men like him that place the bomb and the knife in the hand of the assassin.
#MARGARET.
He is at least a good man, even if he does disagree with you on political and industrial problems. And heaven knows that good men are rare enough these days.
#STARKWEATHER.
I impugn neither his morality nor his motives - only his rationality. Really, Margaret, there is nothing inherently vicious about him. I grant that. And it is precisely that which makes him such a power for evil.
#MARGARET.
When I think of all the misery and pain which he is trying to remedy - I can see in him only a power for good. He is not working for himself but for the many. That is why he has no money. You have heaven alone knows how many millions - you don't; you have worked for yourself.
#STARKWEATHER.
I, too, work for the many. I give work to the many. I make life possible for the many. I am only too keenly alive to the responsibilities of my stewardship of wealth.
#MARGARET.
But what of the child laborers working at the machines? Is that necessary, O steward of wealth? How my heart has ached for them! How I have longed to do something for them - to change conditions so that it will no longer be necessary for the children to toil, to have the playtime of childhood stolen away from them. Theft - that is what it is, the playtime of the children coined into profits. That is why I like Howard Knox. He calls theft theft. He is trying to do something for those children. What are you trying to do for them?
#STARKWEATHER.
Sentiment. Sentiment. The question is too vast and complicated, and you cannot understand. No woman can understand. That is why you run to sentiment. That is what is the matter with this Knox - sentiment. You can't run a government of ninety millions of people on sentiment, nor on abstract ideas of justice and right.
#MARGARET.
But if you eliminate justice and right, what remains?
#STARKWEATHER.
This is a practical world, and it must be managed by practical men - by thinkers, not by near - thinkers whose heads are addled with the half - digested ideas of the French Encyclopedists and Revolutionists of a century and a half ago. Don't forget, my daughter, that your father knows the books as well as any cow college graduate from Oregon. I, too, in my student days, dabbled in theories of universal happiness and righteousness, saw my vision and dreamed my dream. I did not know then the weakness, and frailty, and grossness of the human clay. But I grew out of that and into a man. Some men never grow out of that stage. That is what is the trouble with Knox. He is still a dreamer, and a dangerous one.
#MARGARET.
What do you mean?
#STARKWEATHER.
He has let himself in to give a speech to - morrow, wherein he will be called upon to deliver the proofs of all the lurid charges he has made against the Administration - against us, the stewards of wealth if you please. He will be unable to deliver the proofs, and the nation will laugh. And that will be the political end of Mr. Ali Baba and his dream.
#MARGARET.
It is a beautiful dream. Were there more like him the dream would come true. After all, it is the dreamers that build and that never die. Perhaps you will find that he is not so easily to be destroyed. But I can't stay and argue with you, father. I simply must go and get my things off. You'll have to receive, dear. I'll be right back. You must forgive me for deserting for a moment.
#RUTLAND.
A family council, I see.
#MARGARET.
No; a discussion on dreams and dreamers. I leave you to bear my part.
#RUTLAND.
With pleasure. The dreamers are the true architects. But - a - what is the dream and who is the dreamer?
#MARGARET.
The dream of social justice, of fair play and a square deal to everybody. The dreamer - Mr. Knox.
#RUTLAND.
That man! He has insulted and reviled the Church - my calling. He -
#CONNIE.
He said the churchmen stole from God. I remember he once said there had been only one true Christian and that He died on the Cross.
#MARGARET.
He quoted that from Nietzsche.
#STARKWEATHER.
He had you there.
#RUTLAND.
Nietzsche is a blasphemer, sir. Any man who reads Nietzsche or quotes Nietzsche is a blasphemer. It augurs ill for the future of America when such pernicious literature has the vogue it has.
#MARGARET.
I leave the quarrel in your hands, sir knight. Remember - the dreamer and the dream.
#RUTLAND.
I cannot understand what is coming over the present generation. Take your daughter, for instance. Ten years ago she was an earnest, sincere lieutenant of mine in all our little charities.
#STARKWEATHER.
Has she given charity up?
#CONNIE.
It's settlement work, now, and kindergartens.
#RUTLAND.
It's writers like Nietzsche, and men who read him, like Knox, who are responsible.
#MRS. DOWSETT.
That's your father, isn't it? I have so wanted to meet him.
#CONNIE.
Softly.) You know he's peculiar. He is liable to ignore everybody here this afternoon, and get up and go away abruptly, without saying good - bye.
#MRS. DOWSETT.
Yes, I know, a man of such large affairs. He must have so much on his mind. He is a wonderful man - my husband says the greatest in contemporary history - more powerful than a dozen presidents, the King of England, and the Kaiser, all rolled into one.
#CONNIE.
Take it to father, please, senator.
#CONNIE.
Tea, father, won't you have a cup of tea?
#STARKWEATHER.
Oh, it's you. Dowsett. A pleasure, Mr. Starkweather, an entirely unexpected pleasure to meet you here. I was not aware you frequented frivolous gatherings of this nature.
#STARKWEATHER.
Why didn't you come when you were sent for this morning?
#DOWSETT.
I was sick - I was in bed.
#STARKWEATHER.
That is no excuse, sir. When you are sent for you are to come. Understand? That bill was reported back. Why was it reported back? You told Dobleman you would attend to it.
#DOWSETT.
It was a slip up. Such things will happen.
#STARKWEATHER.
What was the matter with that committee? Have you no influence with the Senate crowd? If not, say so, and I'll get some one who has.
#DOWSETT.
I refuse to be treated in this manner, Mr. Starkweather. I have some self - respect - Some decency - A position of prominence in my state. You forget, sir, that in our state organization I occupy no mean place.
#STARKWEATHER.
Don't you show your teeth to me. I can make you or break you. That state organization of yours belongs to me. Let it alone! I am talking to you. I bought that state organization, and paid for it. You are one of the chattels that came along with the machine. You were made senator to obey my orders. Understand? Do you understand?
#DOWSETT.
I - I understand.
#STARKWEATHER.
That bill is to be killed.
#DOWSETT.
Yes, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
Quietly, no headlines about it. Now you can go.
#STARKWEATHER.
Tom, I want to see you.
#STARKWEATHER.
Tom, this affair of yours in New York must come to an end. Understand?
#CHALMERS.
Hubbard has been talking.
#STARKWEATHER.
No, it is not Hubbard. I have the reports from other sources.
#CHALMERS.
It is a harmless affair.
#STARKWEATHER.
I happen to know better. I have the whole record. If you wish, I can give you every detail, every meeting. I know. There is no discussion whatever. I want no more of it.
#CHALMERS.
I never dreamed for a moment that I was - er - indiscreet.
#STARKWEATHER.
Never forget that every indiscretion of a man in your position is indiscreet. We have a duty, a great and solemn duty to perform. Upon our shoulders rest the destinies of ninety million people. If we fail in our duty, they go down to destruction. Ignorant demagogues are working on the beast - passions of the people. If they have their way, they are lost, the country is lost, civilization is lost. We want no more Dark Ages.
#CHALMERS.
Really, I never thought it was as serious as all that.
#STARKWEATHER.
After all, why should you? You are only a cog in the machine. I, and the several men grouped with me, am the machine. You are a useful cog - too useful to lose -
#CHALMERS.
Lose? - Me?
#STARKWEATHER.
I have but to raise my hand, any time - do you understand? - any time, and you are lost. You control your state. Very well. But never forget that to - morrow, if I wished, I could buy your whole machine out from under you. I know you cannot change yourself, but, for the sake of the big issues at stake, you must be careful, exceedingly careful. We are compelled to work with weak tools. You are a good liver, a flesh - pot man. You drink too much. Your heart is weak. - Oh, I have the report of your doctor. Nevertheless, don't make a fool of yourself, nor of us. Besides, do not forget that your wife is my daughter. She is a strong woman, a credit to both of us. Be careful that you are not a discredit to her.
#CHALMERS.
All right, I'll be careful. But while we are - er - on this subject, there's something I'd like to speak to you about. It's this man Knox, and Madge. He comes to the house. They are as thick as thieves.
#STARKWEATHER.
Yes?
#CHALMERS.
Oh, not a breath of suspicion or anything of that sort, I assure you. But it doesn't strike me as exactly appropriate that your daughter and my wife should be friendly with this fire - eating anarchist who is always attacking us and all that we represent.
#STARKWEATHER.
I started to speak with her on that subject, but was interrupted. You are her husband. Why don't you take her in hand yourself?
#CHALMERS.
What can I do? She has a will of her own - the same sort of a will that you have. Besides, I think she knows about my - about some of my - indiscretions.
#STARKWEATHER.
Harmless indiscretions?
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Oh, there you are, Anthony. Talking politics, I suppose. Well, as soon as I get a cup of tea we must go. Tommy is not looking as well as I could wish. Margaret loves him, but she does not take the right care of him. I don't know what the world is coming to when mothers do not know how to rear their offspring. There is Margaret, with her slum kindergartens, taking care of everybody else's children but her own. If she only performed her church duties as eagerly! Mr. Rutland is displeased with her. I shall give her a talking to - only, you'd better do it, Anthony. Somehow, I have never counted much with Margaret. She is as set in doing what she pleases as you are. In my time children paid respect to their parents. This is what comes of speed. There is no time for anything. And now I must get my tea and run. Connie has to dress for that dinner.
#STARKWEATHER.
That will do, Tom.
#MARGARET.
I am very timid in offering you this, for I am sure you must be appalled by our barbarous methods of making tea.
#SAKARI.
It is true, your American tea, and the tea of the English, are quite radically different from the tea in my country. But one learns, you know. I served my apprenticeship to American tea long years ago, when I was at Yale. It was perplexing, I assure you - at first, only at first I really believe that I am beginning to have a - how shall I call it? - a tolerance for tea in your fashion.
#MARGARET.
You are very kind in overlooking our shortcomings.
#SAKARI.
On the contrary, I am unaware, always unaware, of any shortcomings of this marvelous country of yours.
#MARGARET.
You are incorrigibly gracious, Mr. Sakari.
#SAKARI.
If I may be allowed, I shall now retire and consume this - tea.
#KNOX.
I don't know why I come here. I do not belong. All the ways are strange.
#MARGARET.
The same Ali Baba - once again in the den of the forty thieves. But your watch and pocket - book are safe here, really they are. Now don't be serious. You should relax sometimes. You live too tensely. There's the arch - anarch over there, the dragon you are trying to slay. The man who handles all the life insurance funds, who controls more strings of banks and trust companies than all the Rothschilds a hundred times over - the merger of iron and steel and coal and shipping and all the other things - the man who blocks your child labor bill and all the rest of the remedial legislation you advocate. In short, my father.
#KNOX.
I should have recognized him from his photographs. But why do you say such things?
#MARGARET.
Because they are true. Now, aren't they? Oh, you don't need to answer. You know the truth, the whole bitter truth. This is a den of thieves. There is Mr. Hubbard over there, for instance, the trusty journalist lieutenant of the corporations.
#KNOX.
I know him. It was he that wrote the Standard Oil side of the story, after having abused Standard Oil for years in the pseudo - muck - raking magazines. He made them come up to his price, that was all. He's the star writer on Cartwright's, now, since that magazine changed its policy and became subsidizedly reactionary. I know him - a thoroughly dishonest man. Truly am I Ali Baba, and truly I wonder why I am here.
#MARGARET.
You are here, sir, because I like you to come.
#KNOX.
We do have much in common, you and I.
#MARGARET.
The future.
#KNOX.
I sometimes fear for more immediate reasons than that. For you.
#MARGARET.
Don't look at me that way. Your eyes are flashing. Some one might see and misunderstand.
#KNOX.
I was unaware that I - that I was looking at you - in any way that -
#MARGARET.
I'll tell you why you are here. Because I sent for you.
#KNOX.
I would come whenever you sent for me, and go wherever you might send me.
#MARGARET.
Please, please - It was about that speech. I have been hearing about it from everybody - rumblings and mutterings and dire prophecies. I know how busy you are, and I ought not to have asked you to come. But there was no other way, and I was so anxious.
#KNOX.
It seems so strange that you, being what you are, affiliated as you are, should be interested in the welfare of the common people.
#MARGARET.
I do seem like a traitor in my own camp. But as father said a while ago, I, too, have dreamed my dream. I did it as a girl - Plato's Republic, Moore's Utopia - I was steeped in all the dreams of the social dreamers. And I dreamed that I, too, might do something to bring on the era of universal justice and fair play. In my heart I dedicated myself to the cause of humanity. I made Lincoln my hero - he still is. But I was only a girl, and where was I to find this cause? - how to work for it? I was shut in by a thousand restrictions, hedged in by a thousand conventions. Everybody laughed at me when I expressed the thoughts that burned in me. What could I do? I was only a woman. I had neither vote nor right of utterance. I must remain silent. I must do nothing. Men, in their lordly wisdom, did all. They voted, orated, governed. The place for women was in the home, taking care of some lordly man who did all these lordly things.
#KNOX.
You understand, then, why I am for equal suffrage.
#MARGARET.
But I learned - or thought I learned. Power, I discovered early. My father had power. He was a magnate - I believe that is the correct phrase. Power was what I needed. But how? I was a woman. Again I dreamed my dream - a modified dream. Only by marriage could I win to power. And there you have the clew to me and what I am and have become. I met the man who was to become my husband. He was clean and strong and an athlete, an outdoor man, a wealthy man and a rising politician. Father told me that if I married him he would make him the power of his state, make him governor, send him to the United States Senate. And there you have it all.
#KNOX.
Yes? - Yes?
#MARGARET.
I married. I found that there were greater forces at work than I had ever dreamed of. They took my husband away from me and molded him into the political lieutenant of my father. And I was without power. I could do nothing for the cause. I was beaten. Then it was that I got a new vision. The future belonged to the children. There I could play my woman's part. I was a mother. Very well. I could do no better than to bring into the world a healthy son and bring him up to manhood healthy and wholesome, clean, noble, and alive. Did I do my part well, through him the results would be achieved. Through him would the work of the world be done in making the world healthier and happier for all the human creatures in it. I played the mother's part. That is why I left the pitiful little charities of the church and devoted myself to settlement work and tenement house reform, established my kindergartens, and worked for the little men and women who come so blindly and to whom the future belongs to make or mar.
#KNOX.
You are magnificent. I know, now, why I come when you bid me come.
#MARGARET.
And then you came. You were magnificent. You were my knight of the windmills, tilting against all power and privilege, striving to wrest the future from the future and realize it here in the present, now. I was sure you would be destroyed. Yet you are still here and fighting valiantly. And that speech of yours to - morrow -
#CHALMERS.
Yes, that speech. How do you do, Mr. Knox. A cup of tea, Madge. For Mrs. Ortega. Two lumps, please. Everybody is excited over that speech. You are going to give us particular fits, to - morrow, I understand.
#KNOX.
Really, no more than is deserved.
#CHALMERS.
The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?
#KNOX.
Precisely.
#CHALMERS.
Believe me, we are not so black as we're painted. There are two sides to this question. Like you, we do our best to do what is right. And we hope, we still hope, to win you over to our side.
#MARGARET.
Oh, Tom, be truthful. You don't hope anything of the sort. You know you are hoping to destroy him.
#CHALMERS.
That is what usually happens to those who are not won over. You might accomplish much good, were you with us. Against us you accomplish nothing, absolutely nothing.
#MARGARET.
You see. That is why I was anxious - why I sent for you. Even Tom admits that they who are not won over are destroyed. This speech is a crucial event. You know how rigidly they rule the House and gag men like you. It is they, and they alone, who have given you opportunity for this speech? Why? - Why?
#KNOX.
I know their little scheme. They have heard my charges. They think I am going to make a firebrand speech, and they are ready to catch me without the proofs. They are ready in every way for me. They are going to laugh me down. The Associated Press, the Washington correspondents - all are ready to manufacture, in every newspaper in the land, the great laugh that will destroy me. But I am fully prepared, I have -
#MARGARET.
The proofs?
#KNOX.
Yes.
#MARGARET.
Now?
#KNOX.
They will be delivered to me to - night - original documents, photographs of documents, affidavits -
#MARGARET.
Tell me nothing. But oh, do be careful! Be careful!
#MRS. DOWSETT.
Do give me some assistance, Mrs. Chalmers. Mr. Sakari is trying to make me ridiculous.
#MARGARET.
Impossible.
#MRS. DOWSETT.
But he is. He has had the effrontery -
#CHALMERS.
Effrontery! - O, Sakari!
#SAKARI.
The dear lady is pleased to be facetious.
#MRS. DOWSETT.
He has had the effrontery to ask me to explain the cause of high prices. Mr. Dowsett says the reason is that the people are living so high.
#SAKARI.
Such a marvelous country. They are poor because they have so much to spend.
#CHALMERS.
Are not high prices due to the increased output of gold?
#MRS. DOWSETT.
Mr. Sakari suggested that himself, and when I agreed with him he proceeded to demolish it. He has treated me dreadfully.
#RUTLAND.
You will find the solution in the drink traffic. It is liquor, alcohol, that is undermining our industry, our institutions, our faith in God - everything. Yearly the working people drink greater quantities of alcohol. Naturally, through resulting inefficiency, the cost of production is higher, and therefore prices are higher.
#DOWSETT.
Partly so, partly so. And in line with it, and in addition to it, prices are high because the working class is no longer thrifty. If our working class saved as the French peasant does, we would sell more in the world market and have better times.
#SAKARI.
Bowing.) As I understand it then, the more thrifty you are the more you save, and the more you save the more you have to sell, the more you sell, the better the times?
#DOWSETT.
Exactly so. Exactly.
#SAKARI.
The less you sell, the harder are the times?
#DOWSETT.
Just so.
#SAKARI.
Then if the people are thrifty, and buy less, times will be harder?
#DOWSETT.
Er - it would seem so.
#SAKARI.
Then it would seem that the present bad times are due to the fact that the people are thrifty, rather than not thrifty?
#MRS. DOWSETT.
Perhaps you can explain to us, Mr. Knox, the reason for this terrible condition of affairs.
#DOLORES ORTEGA.
Please do, Mr. Knox. I am so dreadfully anxious to know why living is so high now. Only this morning I understand meat went up again.
#HUBBARD.
I am sure Mr. Knox can shed new light on this perplexing problem.
#CHALMERS.
Surely you, the whirlwind of oratorical swords in the House, are not timid here - among friends.
#KNOX.
Sparring.) I had no idea that questions of such nature were topics of conversation at affairs like this.
#STARKWEATHER.
What causes the high prices?
#KNOX.
Theft!
#DOLORES ORTEGA.
What a romantic explanation. I suppose everybody who has anything has stolen it.
#KNOX.
Not quite, but almost quite. Take motorcars, for example. This year five hundred million dollars has been spent for motor - cars. It required men toiling in the mines and foundries, women sewing their eyes out in sweat - shops, shop girls slaving for four and five dollars a week, little children working in the factories and cotton - mills - all these it required to produce those five hundred millions spent this year in motor - cars. And all this has been stolen from those who did the work.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
I always knew those motor - cars were to blame for terrible things.
#DOLORES ORTEGA.
But Mr. Knox, I have a motor - car.
#KNOX.
Somebody's labor made that car. Was it yours?
#DOLORES ORTEGA.
Mercy, no! I bought it - and paid for it.
#KNOX.
Then did you labor at producing something else, and exchange the fruits of that labor for the motor - car? You do not answer. Then I am to understand that you have a motor - car which was made by somebody else's labor and for which you gave no labor of your own. This I call theft. You call it property. Yet it is theft.
#STARKWEATHER.
But surely you have intelligence to see the question in larger ways than stolen motor - cars. I am a man of affairs. I don't steal motor - cars.
#KNOX.
Not concrete little motor - cars, no. You do things on a large scale.
#STARKWEATHER.
Steal?
#KNOX.
If you will have it so.
#STARKWEATHER.
I am like a certain gentleman from Missouri. You've got to show me.
#KNOX.
And I'm like the man from Texas. It's got to be put in my hand.
#STARKWEATHER.
I shift my residence at once to Texas. Put it in my hand that I steal on a large scale.
#KNOX.
Very well. You are the great financier, merger, and magnate. Do you mind a few statistics?
#STARKWEATHER.
Go ahead.
#KNOX.
You exercise a controlling interest in nine billion dollars' worth of railways; in two billion dollars' worth of industrial concerns; in one billion dollars' worth of life insurance groups; in one billion dollars' worth of banking groups; in two billion dollars' worth of trust companies. Mind you, I do not say you own all this, but that you exercise a controlling interest. That is all that is necessary. In short, you exercise a controlling interest in such a proportion of the total investments of the United States, as to set the pace for all the rest. Now to my point. In the last few years seventy billions of dollars have been artificially added to the capitalization of the nation's industries. By that I mean water - pure, unadulterated water. You, the merger, know what water means. I say seventy billions. It doesn't matter if we call it forty billions or eighty billions; the amount, whatever it is, is a huge one. And what does seventy billions of water mean? It means, at five per cent, that three billions and a half must be paid for things this year, and every year, more than things are really worth. The people who labor have to pay this. There is theft for you. There is high prices for you. Who put in the water? Who gets the theft of the water? Have I put it in your hand?
#STARKWEATHER.
Are there no wages for stewardship?
#KNOX.
Call it any name you please.
#STARKWEATHER.
Do I not make two dollars where one was before? Do I not make for more happiness than was before I came?
#KNOX.
Is that any more than the duty any man owes to his fellowman?
#STARKWEATHER.
Oh, you unpractical dreamer.
#RUTLAND.
Where do I steal, Mr. Knox? - I who get a mere salary for preaching the Lord's Word.
#KNOX.
Your salary comes out of that water I mentioned. Do you want to know who pays your salary? Not your parishioners. But the little children toiling in the mills, and all the rest - all the slaves on the wheel of labor pay you your salary.
#RUTLAND.
earn it.
#KNOX.
They pay it.
#MRS. DOWSETT.
Why, I declare, Mr. Knox, you are worse than Mr. Sakari. You are an anarchist.
#CHALMERS.
I suppose that's part of your speech to - morrow.
#DOLORES ORTEGA.
A rehearsal! He's trying it out on us!
#SAKARI.
How would you remedy this - er - this theft?
#KNOX.
Very simply. By changing the governmental machinery by which this household of ninety millions of people conducts its affairs.
#SAKARI.
I thought - I was taught so at Yale - that your governmental machinery was excellent, most excellent.
#KNOX.
It is antiquated. It is ready for the scrap - heap. Instead of being our servant, it has mastered us. We are its slaves. All the political brood of grafters and hypocrites have run away with it, and with us as well. In short, from the municipalities up, we are dominated by the grafters. It is a reign of theft.
#HUBBARD.
But any government is representative of its people. No people is worthy of a better government than it possesses. Were it worthier, it would possess a better government.
#KNOX.
That is a lie. And I say to you now that the average morality and desire for right conduct of the people of the United States is far higher than that of the government which misrepresents it. The people are essentially worthy of a better government than that which is at present in the hands of the politicians, for the benefit of the politicians and of the interests the politicians represent. I wonder, Mr. Sakari, if you have ever heard the story of the four aces.
#SAKARI.
I cannot say that I have.
#KNOX.
Do you understand the game of poker?
#SAKARI.
Yes, a marvelous game. I have learned it - at Yale. It was very expensive.
#KNOX.
Well, that story reminds me of our grafting politicians. They have no moral compunctions. They look upon theft as right - eminently right. They see nothing wrong in the arrangement that the man who deals the cards should give himself the best in the deck. Never mind what he deals himself, they'll have the deal next and make up for it.
#DOLORES ORTEGA.
But the story, Mr. Knox. I, too, understand poker.
#KNOX.
It occurred out in Nevada, in a mining camp. A tenderfoot was watching a game of poker, He stood behind the dealer, and he saw the dealer deal himself four aces from the bottom of the deck. The tenderfoot went around to the player on the opposite side of the table. "Say," he says, "I just seen the dealer give himself four aces off the bottom." The player looked at him a moment, and said, "What of it?" "Oh, nothing," said the tenderfoot, "only I thought you might want to know. I tell you I seen the dealer give himself four aces off the bottom." "Look here, Mister," said the player, "you'd better get out of this. You don't understand the game. It's HIS deal, ain't it?"
#MARGARET.
We've talked politics long enough. Dolores, I want you to tell me about your new car.
#KNOX.
And I must be going. Do I have to shake hands with all these people?
#MARGARET.
Dear delightful Ali Baba.
#KNOX.
I suppose I've made a fool of myself.
#MARGARET.
On the contrary, you were delightful. I am proud of you.
#SAKARI.
I, too, must go. I have had a charming half hour, Mrs. Chalmers. But I shall not attempt to thank you.
#STARKWEATHER.
Damnation!
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
I beg your pardon, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
Send Senator Chalmers to me, and Mr. Hubbard.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Yes, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
Dobleman has just forwarded this telegram. It's from New York - from Martinaw. There's been rottenness. My papers and letter - files have been ransacked. It's the confidential stenographer who has been tampered with - you remember that middle - aged, youngish - oldish woman, Tom? That's the one. - Where's that servant? Here! Come here! Go to the telephone and call up Dobleman. Tell him to come here.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
I beg pardon, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
My secretary. At my house. Dobleman. Tell him to come at once.
#CHALMERS.
But who can be the principal behind this theft? blackmailing device most probably. They will attempt to bleed you -
#CHALMERS.
Unless -
#STARKWEATHER.
Yes?
#CHALMERS.
Unless they are to be used to - morrow in that speech of Knox.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Anthony, we must go now. Are you ready? Connie has to dress.
#STARKWEATHER.
I am not going now. You and Connie take the car.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
You mustn't forget you are going to that dinner.
#STARKWEATHER.
Do I ever forget?
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Oh, these everlasting politics! That is what it has been all afternoon - high prices, graft, and theft; theft, graft, and high prices. It is terrible. When I was a girl we did not talk of such things. Well, come on, Connie.
#MRS. DOWSETT.
And we must be going, too.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Mr. Dobleman has already left some time to come here, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
Show him in as soon as he comes.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Yes, sir.
#CHALMERS.
If I were certain Knox had those papers I would take him by the throat and shake them out of him.
#STARKWEATHER.
No foolish talk like that, Tom. This is a serious matter.
#HUBBARD.
But Knox has no money. A Starkweather stenographer comes high.
#STARKWEATHER.
There is more than Knox behind this.
#DOBLEMAN.
You received that telegram, sir? I got the New York office - Martinaw - right along afterward, by long distance. I thought best to follow and tell you.
#STARKWEATHER.
What did Martinaw say?
#DOBLEMAN.
The files seem in perfect order.
#STARKWEATHER.
Thank God!
#DOBLEMAN.
But they are not. The stenographer, Miss Standish, has confessed. For a long time she has followed the practice of taking two or three letters and documents at a time away from the office. Many have been photographed and returned. But the more important ones were retained and clever copies returned. Martinaw says that Miss Standish herself does not know and cannot tell which of the ones she returned are genuine and which are copies.
#HUBBARD.
Knox never did this.
#STARKWEATHER.
Did Martinaw say whom Miss Standish was acting for?
#DOBLEMAN.
Gherst.
#STARKWEATHER.
Gherst!
#HUBBARD.
Then it is not so grave after all. A yellow journal sensation is the best Gherst can make of it. And, documents or not, the very medium by which it is made public discredits it.
#STARKWEATHER.
Trust Gherst for more ability than that. He will certainly exploit them in his newspapers, but not until after Knox has used them in his speech. Oh, the cunning dog! Never could he have chosen a better mode and moment to strike at me, at the Administration, at everything. That is Gherst all over. Playing to the gallery. Inducing Knox to make this spectacular exposure on the floor of the House just at the critical time when so many important bills are pending. Did Martinaw give you any idea of the nature of the stolen documents?
#DOBLEMAN.
Of course I don't know anything about it, but he spoke of the Goodyear letters - the Caledonian letters, all the Black Rider correspondence. He mentioned, too, the Astonbury and Glutz letters. And there were others, many others, not designated.
#STARKWEATHER.
This is terrible! Thank you, Dobleman. Will you please return to the house at once. Get New York again, and fullest details. I'll follow you shortly. Have you a machine? taxi, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
All right, and be careful.
#CHALMERS.
I don't know the import of all these letters, but I can guess, and it does seem serious.
#STARKWEATHER.
Serious! Let me tell you that there has been no exposure like this in the history of the country. It means hundreds of millions of dollars. It means more - the loss of power. And still more, it means the mob, the great mass of the child - minded people rising up and destroying all that I have labored to do for them. Oh, the fools! The fools!
#HUBBARD.
There is no telling what may happen if Knox makes that speech and delivers the proofs.
#CHALMERS.
It is unfortunate. The people are restless and excited as it is. They are being constantly prodded on by the mouthings of the radical press, of the muck - raking magazines and of the demagogues. The people are like powder awaiting the spark.
#STARKWEATHER.
This man Knox is no fool, if he is a dreamer. He is a shrewd knave. He is a fighter. He comes from the West - the old pioneer stock. His father drove an ox - team across the Plains to Oregon. He knows how to play his cards, and never could circumstances have placed more advantageous cards in his hands.
#CHALMERS.
And nothing like this has ever touched you before.
#STARKWEATHER.
I have always stood above the muck and ruck - clear and clean and unassailable. But this - this is too much! It is the spark. There is no forecasting what it may develop into. political turnover.
#STARKWEATHER.
A new party, a party of demagogues, in power. Government ownership of the railways and telegraphs. A graduated income tax that will mean no less than the confiscation of private capital.
#CHALMERS.
And all that mass of radical legislation - the Child Labor Bill, the new Employers' Liability Act, the government control of the Alaskan coal fields, that interference with Mexico. And that big power corporation you have worked so hard to form.
#STARKWEATHER.
It must not be. It is an unthinkable calamity. It means that the very process of capitalistic development is hindered, stopped. It means a setback of ten years in the process. It means work, endless work, to overcome the setback. It means not alone the passage of all this radical legislation with the consequent disadvantages, but it means the fingers of the mob clutching at our grip of control. It means anarchy. It means ruin and misery for all the blind fools and led - cattle of the mass who will strike at the very sources of their own existence and comfort.
#CHALMERS.
Without doubt, Knox is in possession of the letters right now.
#STARKWEATHER.
There is but one thing to do, and that is - get them back.
#HUBBARD.
I'll undertake it.
#STARKWEATHER.
There is little time to waste. In twenty hours from now he will be on the floor making his speech. Try mild measures first. Offer him inducements - any inducement. I empower you to act for me. You will find he has a price.
#HUBBARD.
And if not?
#STARKWEATHER.
Then you must get them at any cost.
#HUBBARD.
You mean - ?
#STARKWEATHER.
I mean just that. But no matter what happens, I must never be brought in. Do you understand?
#HUBBARD.
Thoroughly.
#MARGARET.
What are you three conspiring about?
#CHALMERS.
We are arranging to boost prices a little higher.
#HUBBARD.
And so be able to accumulate more motorcars.
#STARKWEATHER.
I must be going. Hubbard, you have your work cut out for you. Tom, I want you to come with me.
#CHALMERS.
Home?
#STARKWEATHER.
Yes, we have much to do.
#CHALMERS.
Then I'll dress first and follow you. Pick me up on the way to that dinner.
#TOMMY.
Dolefully.) Don't you want to play any more? I was a good Indian.
#MARGARET.
Oh, Tommy! Tommy! Curtain
#HUBBARD.
This is Knox's room all right
#FIRST MAN.
Trust us for that.
#SECOND MAN.
We were lucky the guy with the whiskers moved out of that other room only this afternoon.
#FIRST MAN.
His key hadn't come down yet when I engaged it.
#HUBBARD.
Well, get to work. That must be his bedroom. You know what it is - a bunch of documents and letters. If we find it there is a clean five hundred each for you, in addition to your regular pay.
#SECOND MAN.
Old Starkweather must want them bad.
#HUBBARD.
Sh - h. Don't even breathe his name.
#SECOND MAN.
His nibs is damned exclusive, ain't he?
#FIRST MAN.
I've never got a direct instruction from him, and I've worked for him longer than you.
#SECOND MAN.
Yes, and you worked for him for over two years before you knew who was hiring you.
#HUBBARD.
You'd better go out in the hall and keep a watch for Knox. He may come in any time.
#SECOND MAN.
It's only the phone.
#HUBBARD.
I suppose you've done lots of work for Stark -
#SECOND MAN.
Sh - h. Don't breathe his name.
#HUBBARD.
Hello - Yes. No, this is not Knox. Some mistake. Wrong number - She did hang up quick.
#SECOND MAN.
You seemed to recognize her.
#HUBBARD.
No, I only thought I did.
#SECOND MAN.
I've never spoken a word to his nibs in my life. And I've drawn his pay for years too.
#HUBBARD.
What of it?
#SECOND MAN.
He don't know I exist.
#HUBBARD.
The pay's all right, isn't it?
#SECOND MAN.
It sure is, but I guess I earn every cent of it.
#FIRST MAN.
Somebody just left the elevator and is coming down the hall.
#KNOX.
How did you get in?
#GIFFORD.
I let myself in. The door was unlocked.
#KNOX.
I must have forgotten it.
#GIFFORD.
Well, there they are.
#KNOX.
You are sure they are originals? I can't take any chances, you know. If Gherst changed his mind after I gave my speech and refused to show the originals - such things have happened.
#GIFFORD.
That's what I told him. He was firm on giving duplicates, and for awhile it looked as if my trip to New York was wasted. But I stuck to my guns. It was originals or nothing with you, I said, and he finally gave in.
#KNOX.
I can't tell you what they mean to me, nor how grateful -
#GIFFORD.
That's all right. Don't mention it. Gherst is wild for the chance. It will do organized labor a heap of good. And you are able to say your own say at the same time. How's that compensation act coming on?
#KNOX.
The same old story. It will never come before the House. It is dying in committee. What can you expect of the Committee of Judiciary? - composed as it is of ex - railroad judges and ex - railroad lawyers.
#GIFFORD.
The railroad brotherhoods are keen on getting that bill through.
#KNOX.
Well, they won't, and they never will until they learn to vote right. When will your labor leaders quit the strike and boycott and lead your men to political action?
#GIFFORD.
Well, so long. I've got to trot, and I haven't time to tell you why I think political action would destroy the trade union movement. You're damn careless with those papers. You wouldn't be if you knew how much Gherst paid for them.
#GIFFORD.
You don't appreciate that other crowd. It stops at nothing.
#KNOX.
I won't take my eyes off of them. And I'll take them to bed with me to - night for safety. Besides, there is no danger. Nobody but you knows I have them.
#GIFFORD.
I'd hate to be in Starkweather's office when he discovers what's happened. There'll be some bad half hours for somebody. Give them hell to - morrow, good and plenty. I'm going to be in a gallery. So long.
#KNOX.
Come in.
#HUBBARD.
There is no use beating about the bush with a man like you. I know that. You are direct, and so am I. You know my position well enough to be assured that I am empowered to treat with you.
#KNOX.
Oh, yes; I know.
#HUBBARD.
What we want is to have you friendly.
#KNOX.
That is easy enough. When the Interests become upright and honest -
#HUBBARD.
Save that for your speech. We are talking privately. We can make it well worth your while -
#KNOX.
Angrily.) If you think you can bribe me -
#HUBBARD.
Suavely.) Not at all. Not the slightest suspicion of it. The point is this. You are a congressman. A congressman's career depends on his membership in good committees. At the present you are buried in the dead Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. If you say the word you can be appointed to the livest committee -
#KNOX.
You have these appointments to give?
#HUBBARD.
Surely. Else why should I be here? It can be managed.
#KNOX.
I thought our government was rotten enough, but I never dreamed that House appointments were hawked around by the Interests in this fashion.
#HUBBARD.
You have not given your answer.
#KNOX.
You should have known my answer in advance.
#HUBBARD.
There is an alternative. You are interested in social problems. You are a student of sociology. Those whom I represent are genuinely interested in you. We are prepared, so that you may pursue your researches more deeply - we are prepared to send you to Europe. There, in that vast sociological laboratory, far from the jangling strife of politics, you will have every opportunity to study. We are prepared to send you for a period of ten years. You will receive ten thousand dollars a year, and, in addition, the day your steamer leaves New York, you will receive a lump sum of one hundred thousand dollars.
#KNOX.
And this is the way men are bought
#HUBBARD.
It is purely an educational matter.
#KNOX.
Now it is you who are beating about the bush.
#HUBBARD.
Very well then. What price do you set on yourself?
#KNOX.
You want me to quit - to leave politics, everything? You want to buy my soul?
#HUBBARD.
More than that. We want to buy those documents and letters.
#KNOX.
What documents and letters?
#HUBBARD.
You are beating around the bush in turn. There is no need for an honest man to lie even -
#KNOX.
To you.
#HUBBARD.
Even to me. I watched you closely when I mentioned the letters. You gave yourself away. You knew I meant the letters stolen by Gherst from Starkweather's private files - the letters you intended using to - morrow.
#KNOX.
Intend using to - morrow.
#HUBBARD.
Precisely. It is the same thing. What is the price? Set it.
#KNOX.
I have nothing to sell. I am not on the market.
#HUBBARD.
One moment. Don't make up your mind hastily. You don't know with whom you have to deal. Those letters will not appear in your speech to - morrow. Take that from me. It would be far wiser to sell for a fortune than to get nothing for them and at the same time not use them.
#KNOX.
Come -
#HUBBARD.
Hush. Don't. I cannot be seen here.
#KNOX.
You fear the contamination of my company.
#HUBBARD.
Don't let anybody in. I don't want to be seen here - with you. Besides, my presence will not put you in a good light.
#KNOX.
What I do is always open to the world. I see no one whom I should not permit the world to know I saw.
#KNOX.
Margaret! Mrs. Chalmers!
#MARGARET.
Forgive me, but I had to see you. I could not get you on the telephone. I called and called, and the best I could do was to get the wrong number.
#KNOX.
Yes. I am glad. Hello, Tommy.
#TOMMY.
How do you do?
#MARGARET.
There was no other way, and it was so necessary for me to warn you. I brought Tommy and Linda along to chaperon me. Your laboratory.
#KNOX.
Ah, if I were only as great a sociological wizard as Edison is a wizard in physical sciences.
#MARGARET.
But you are. You labor more mightily than you admit - or dare to think. Oh, I know you - better than you do yourself.
#TOMMY.
Do you read all those books?
#KNOX.
Yes, I am still going to school and studying hard. What are you going to study to be when you grow up? President of these great United States?
#TOMMY.
Father says the President doesn't amount to much.
#KNOX.
Not a Lincoln?
#MARGARET.
But don't you remember what a great good man Lincoln was? You remember I told you?
#TOMMY.
But I don't want to be killed. - I'll tell you what!
#KNOX.
What?
#TOMMY.
I want to be a senator like father. He makes them dance.
#KNOX.
Makes whom dance?
#TOMMY.
Puzzled.) I don't know. But he makes them dance just the same.
#LINDA.
Come, Tommy. Let us look out of the window.
#TOMMY.
I'd rather talk with Mr. Knox.
#MARGARET.
Please do, Tommy. Mamma wants to talk to Mr. Knox.
#MARGARET.
You might ask me to take a seat
#KNOX.
Oh! I beg pardon.
#MARGARET.
I have only a few minutes. Tom is at father's, and I am to pick him up there and go on to that dinner, after I've taken Tommy home.
#KNOX.
But your maid?
#MARGARET.
Linda? Wild horses could not drag from her anything that she thought would harm me. So intense is her fidelity that it almost shames me. I do not deserve it. But this is not what I came to you about. After you left this afternoon, something happened. Father received a telegram. It seemed most important. His secretary followed upon the heels of the telegram. Father called Tom and Mr. Hubbard to him and they held a conference. I think they have discovered the loss of the documents, and that they believe you have them. I did not hear them mention your name, yet I am absolutely certain that they were talking about you. Also, I could tell from father's face that something was terribly wrong. Oh, be careful! Do be careful!
#KNOX.
There is no danger, I assure you.
#MARGARET.
But you do not know them. I tell you you do not know them. They will stop at nothing - at nothing. Father believes he is right in all that he does.
#KNOX.
I know. That is what makes him so formidable. He has an ethical sanction.
#MARGARET.
It is his religion.
#KNOX.
And, like any religion with a narrow - minded man, it runs to mania.
#MARGARET.
He believes that civilization rests on him, and that it is his sacred duty to preserve civilization.
#KNOX.
I know. I know.
#MARGARET.
But you? But you? You are in danger.
#KNOX.
No; I shall remain in to - night. To - morrow, in the broad light of midday, I shall proceed to the House and give my speech.
#MARGARET.
Oh, if anything should happen to you!
#KNOX.
You do care? For Howard Knox, the reformer? Or for me, the man?
#MARGARET.
Oh, why must a woman forever remain quiet? Why should I not tell you what you already know? - what you must already know? I do care for you - for man and reformer, both - for - Linda! Will you take Tommy down to the machine -
#KNOX.
What are you doing?
#MARGARET.
I'll follow you right down.
#TOMMY.
Good evening, Mr. Knox.
#KNOX.
Good evening, Tommy. You take my word for it, and look up this Lincoln question.
#TOMMY.
I shall. I'll ask father about it.
#MARGARET.
You attend to that, Linda. Nobody must know - this.
#KNOX.
Don't! Don't! I can't stand it. Such sight of you fills me with madness. I don't want to think of you as a woman. I must not. Allow me.
#MARGARET.
I want you to see me as a woman. I want you to think of me as a woman. I want you mad for me. I want - don't you see what I want? - Look at me.
#KNOX.
Margaret. Margaret.
#KNOX.
I love you. I do love you. But I had resolved never to speak it, never to let you know.
#MARGARET.
Silly man. I have known long that you loved me. You have told me so often and in so many ways. You could not look at me without telling me.
#KNOX.
You saw?
#MARGARET.
How could I help seeing? I was a woman. Only, with your voice you never spoke a word. Sit down, there, where I may look at you, and let me tell you. I shall do the speaking now. Shall I?
#KNOX.
No, no! As you are. Let me feast my eyes upon you who are mine. I must be dreaming.
#MARGARET.
Oh, you men! As of old, and as forever, you must be wooed through your senses. Did I display the wisdom of an Hypatia, the science of a Madam Curie, yet would you keep your iron control, throttling the voice of your heart with silence. But let me for a moment be Lilith, for a moment lay aside this garment constructed for the purpose of keeping out the chill of night, and on the instant you are fire and aflame, all voluble with love's desire.
#KNOX.
Margaret! It is not fair!
#MARGARET.
I love you - and - you?
#KNOX.
I love you.
#MARGARET.
Then listen. I have told you of my girlhood and my dreams. I wanted to do what you are so nobly doing. And I did nothing. I could do nothing. I was not permitted. Always was I compelled to hold myself in check. It was to do what you are doing, that I married. And that, too, failed me. My husband became a henchman of the Interests, my own father's tool for the perpetuation of the evils against which I desired to fight. It has been a long fight, and I have been very tired, for always did I confront failure. My husband - I did not love him. I never loved him. I sold myself for the Cause, and the cause profited nothing. Often, I have lost faith - faith in everything, in God and man, in the hope of any righteousness ever prevailing. But again and again, by what you are doing, have you awakened me. I came to - night with no thought of self. I came to warn you, to help the good work on. I remained - thank God! - I remained to love you - and to be loved by you. I suddenly found myself, looking at you, very weary. I wanted you - you, more than anything in the world. Come to me. I want you - now.
#KNOX.
But I have been tired at times. I was very tired to - night - and you came. And now I am glad, only glad.
#MARGARET.
I have been wanton to - night. I confess it. I am proud of it. But it was not - professional. It was the first time in my life. Almost do I regret - almost do I regret that I did not do it sooner - it has been crowned with such success. You have held me in your arms - your arms. Oh, you will never know what that first embrace meant to me. I am not a clod. I am not iron nor stone. I am a woman - a warm, breathing woman - Kiss me, my dear lord and lover. Kiss me.
#KNOX.
What shall we do? No. It cannot be. It is impossible. Oh, why could we not have met long ago? We would have worked together. What a comradeship it would have been.
#MARGARET.
But it is not too late.
#KNOX.
I have no right to you.
#MARGARET.
My husband? He has not been my husband for years. He has no rights. Who, but you whom I love, has any rights?
#KNOX.
No; it is not that. That for him. Oh, if I were only the man, and not the reformer! If I had no work to do!
#MARGARET.
We can work together.
#KNOX.
Don't! Don't! You make it so hard. You tempt me so. Listen. It is not your husband. But I have no right to you. Nor have you a right to me.
#MARGARET.
And who but I has any right to you?
#KNOX.
No; it is not that. There is no other woman. You are the one woman for me. But there are many others who have greater rights in me than you. I have been chosen by two hundred thousand citizens to represent them in the Congress of the United States. And there are many more - Yes, please. Cover them up. Help me not to forget. There are many more who have rights in me - the people, all the people, whose cause I have made mine. The children - there are two million child laborers in these United States. I cannot betray them. I cannot steal my happiness from them. This afternoon I talked of theft. But would not this, too, be theft?
#MARGARET.
Howard! Wake up! Has our happiness turned your head?
#KNOX.
Almost - and for a few wild moments, quite. There are all the children. Did I ever tell you of the tenement child, who when asked how he knew when spring came, answered: When he saw the saloons put up their swing doors.
#MARGARET.
But what has all that to do with one man and one woman loving?
#KNOX.
Suppose we loved - you and I; suppose we loosed all the reins of our love. What would happen? You remember Gorki, the Russian patriot, when he came to New York, aflame with passion for the Russian revolution. His purpose in visiting the land of liberty was to raise funds for that revolution. And because his marriage to the woman he loved was not of the essentially legal sort worshiped by the shopkeepers, and because the newspapers made a sensation of it, his whole mission was brought to failure. He was laughed and derided out of the esteem of the American people. That is what would happen to me. I should be slandered and laughed at. My power would be gone.
#MARGARET.
And even if so - what of it? Be slandered and laughed at. We will have each other. Other men will rise up to lead the people, and leading the people is a thankless task. Life is so short. We must clutch for the morsel of happiness that may be ours.
#KNOX.
Ah, if you knew, as I look into your eyes, how easy it would be to throw everything to the winds. But it would be theft.
#MARGARET.
Let it be theft. Life is so short, dear. We are the biggest facts in the world - to each other.
#KNOX.
It is not myself alone, nor all my people. A moment ago you said no one but I had any right to you. You were wrong. Your child -
#MARGARET.
Don't!
#KNOX.
I must. I must save myself - and you. Tommy has rights in you. Theft again. What other name for it if you steal your happiness from him?
#MARGARET.
I have been so lonely - and then you - you came, and the world grew bright and warm - a few short minutes ago you held me - in your arms - a few short minutes ago and it seemed my dream of happiness had come true - and now you dash it from me -
#KNOX.
No; I ask you to dash it from yourself. I am not too strong. You must help me. You must call your child to your aid in helping me. I could go mad for you now - Right now -
#MARGARET.
Wait. Sit down - please. Dear, I do so love you - No! Sit there. I was weak. Yet I am not sorry. You are right. We must forego each other. We cannot be thieves, even for love's sake. Yet I am glad that this has happened - that I have lain in your arms and had your lips on mine. The memory of it will be sweet always. You are right. The future belongs to the children. There lies duty - yours, and mine in my small way. I am going now. We must not see each other ever again. We must work - and forget. But remember, my heart goes with you into the fight. My prayers will accompany every stroke. Dear - will you kiss me - once - one last time? I wish I had something of you to have with me always - a photograph, that little one, you remember, which I liked so. Don't run the risk of sending it by messenger. Just mail it ordinarily.
#MARGARET.
I shall mail it to - morrow. I'll drop it in the box myself.
#KNOX.
Good - bye.
#MARGARET.
But oh, my dear, I am glad and proud for what has happened. I would not erase a single line of it. There must be immortality. There must be a future life where you and I shall meet again. Good - bye.
#HUBBARD.
What the deuce? Everybody gone?
#KNOX.
Where the devil did you come from?
#HUBBARD.
In there. I was in there all the time.
#KNOX.
Oh, I had forgotten about you. Well, my callers are gone.
#HUBBARD.
Honest men are such dubs when they do go wrong.
#KNOX.
The door was closed all the time. You would not have dared to spy upon me.
#HUBBARD.
There was something familiar about the lady's voice.
#KNOX.
You heard! - what did you hear?
#HUBBARD.
Oh, nothing, nothing - a murmur of voices - and the woman's - I could swear I have heard her voice before. Well, so long. You won't reconsider your decision?
#HUBBARD.
And yet it was but a moment ago that it seemed I heard you say there was no one whom you would not permit the world to know you saw. What do you mean?
#HUBBARD.
Good - bye.
#KNOX.
The thief! Curtain
#STARKWEATHER.
All right, though it is an unimportant publication. I'll subscribe.
#DOBLEMAN.
Very well, sir. Two thousand. Then there is Vanderwater's Magazine. Your subscription is due.
#STARKWEATHER.
How much?
#DOBLEMAN.
You have been paying fifteen thousand.
#STARKWEATHER.
It is too much. What is the regular subscription? dollar a year.
#STARKWEATHER.
It is too much.
#DOBLEMAN.
Professor Vanderwater also does good work with his lecturing. He is regularly on the Chautauqua Courses, and at that big meeting of the National Civic Federation, his speech was exceptionally telling.
#STARKWEATHER.
All right - No. I remember there was something in the papers about this Professor Vanderwater - a divorce, wasn't it? He has impaired his authority and his usefulness to me.
#DOBLEMAN.
It was his wife's fault.
#STARKWEATHER.
It is immaterial. His usefulness is impaired. Cut him down to ten thousand. It will teach him a lesson.
#DOBLEMAN.
Very good, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
And the customary twenty thousand to Cartwrights.
#DOBLEMAN.
They have asked for more. They have enlarged the magazine, reorganized the stock, staff, everything.
#STARKWEATHER.
Hubbard's writing for it, isn't he?
#DOBLEMAN.
Yes, sir. And though I don't know, it is whispered that he is one of the heavy stockholders. very capable man. He has served me well. How much do they want?
#DOBLEMAN.
They say that Nettman series of articles cost them twelve thousand alone, and that they believe, in view of the exceptional service they are prepared to render, and are rendering, fifty thousand -
#STARKWEATHER.
All right. How much have I given to University of Hanover this year?
#DOBLEMAN.
Seven - nine millions, including that new library.
#STARKWEATHER.
Education does cost. Anything more this morning?
#DOBLEMAN.
Just one other - Mr. Rutland. His church, you know, sir, and that theological college. He told me he had been talking it over with you. He is anxious to know.
#STARKWEATHER.
He's very keen, I must say. Fifty thousand for the church, and a hundred thousand for the college - I ask you, candidly, is he worth it?
#DOBLEMAN.
The church is a very powerful molder of public opinion, and Mr. Rutland is very impressive. This is what he said in his sermon two weeks ago: "God has given to Mr. Starkweather the talent for making money as truly as God has given to other men the genius which manifests itself in literature and the arts and sciences."
#STARKWEATHER.
He says it well.
#DOBLEMAN.
And this he said about you in last Sunday's sermon: "We are to - day rejoicing in the great light of the consecration of a great wealth to the advancement of the race. This vast wealth has been so consecrated by a man who all through life has walked in accord with the word, The love of Christ constraineth me.'"
#STARKWEATHER.
Dobleman, I have meant well. I mean well. I shall always mean well. I believe I am one of those few men, to whom God, in his infinite wisdom, has given the stewardship of the people's wealth. It is a high trust, and despite the abuse and vilification heaped upon me, I shall remain faithful to it. Very well. See that Mr. Rutland gets what he has asked for.
#DOBLEMAN.
Very good, sir. I shall telephone him. I know he is anxious to hear. Shall I make the checks out in the usual way?
#STARKWEATHER.
Yes: except the Rutland one. I'll sign that myself. Let the others go through the regular channels. We take the 2:10 train for New York. Are you ready?
#DOBLEMAN.
All, except the dispatch box.
#STARKWEATHER.
I'll take care of that myself. Dobleman.
#DOBLEMAN.
Pausing.) Yes, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
Mrs. Chalmers is here, isn't she?
#DOBLEMAN.
Yes, sir. She came a few minutes ago, with her little boy. They are with Mrs. Starkweather.
#STARKWEATHER.
Please tell Mrs. Chalmers I wish to see her.
#DOBLEMAN.
Yes, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
Show him in.
#STARKWEATHER.
I can only tell you that what you did was wonderful. Your telephone last night was a great relief. Where are they?
#HUBBARD.
There they are - the complete set. I was fortunate.
#STARKWEATHER.
You are modest, Mr. Hubbard. - It required more - than fortune. - It required ability - of no mean order. - The time was short. - You had to think - and act - with too great immediacy to be merely fortunate. There is no need for me to tell you how I appreciate your service. I have increased my subscription to Cartwright's to fifty thousand, and I shall speak to Dobleman, who will remit to you a more substantial acknowledgment than my mere thanks for the inestimable service you have rendered. You - ah - you have read the documents?
#HUBBARD.
I glanced through them. They were indeed serious. But we have spiked Knox's guns. Without them, that speech of his this afternoon becomes a farce - a howling farce. Be sure you take good care of them. Gherst has a long arm.
#STARKWEATHER.
He cannot reach me here. Besides, I go to New York to - day, and I shall carry them with me. Mr. Hubbard, you will forgive me - I am very busy.
#HUBBARD.
Yes, I understand. I shall be going now. I have to be at the Club in five minutes.
#STARKWEATHER.
I should like to talk with you some more - in New York. Next time you are in town be sure to see me. I am thinking of buying the Parthenon Magazine, and of changing its policy. I should like to have you negotiate this, and there are other important things as well. Good day, Mr. Hubbard. I shall see you in New York - soon.
#HUBBARD.
Mrs. Chalmers. You needn't be so high and lofty, Mrs. Chalmers.
#MARGARET.
I do not understand.
#HUBBARD.
You always treated me this way, but the time for it is past. I won't stand for your superior goodness any more. You really impressed me with it for a long time, and you made me walk small. But I know better now. A pretty game you've been playing - you, who are like any other woman. Well, you know where you were last night. So do I.
#MARGARET.
You are impudent.
#HUBBARD.
I said I knew where you were last night. Mr. Knox also knows where you were. But I'll wager your husband doesn't.
#MARGARET.
You spy! I suppose you have told - him.
#HUBBARD.
Why should I?
#MARGARET.
You are his creature.
#HUBBARD.
If it will ease your suspense, let me tell you that I have not told him. But I do protest to you that you must treat me with more - more kindness.
#STARKWEATHER.
Good morning, Margaret. I sent for you because we did not finish that talk last night. Sit down. You always were hard to manage, Margaret. You have had too much will for a woman. Yet I did my best for you. Your marriage with Tom was especially auspicious - a rising man, of good family and a gentleman, eminently suitable -
#MARGARET.
I don't think you were considering your daughter at all in the matter. I know your views on woman and woman's place. I have never counted for anything with you. Neither has mother, nor Connie, when business was uppermost, and business always is uppermost with you. I sometimes wonder if you think a woman has a soul. As for my marriage - you saw that Tom could be useful to you. He had the various distinctive points you have mentioned. Better than that he was pliable, capable of being molded to perform your work, to manipulate machine politics and procure for you the legislation you desired. You did not consider what kind of a husband he would make for your daughter whom you did not know. But you gave your daughter to him - sold her to him - because you needed him - In your business.
#STARKWEATHER.
Margaret! You must not speak that way. Ah, you do not change. You were always that way, always bent on having your will -
#MARGARET.
Would to God I had been more successful in having it.
#STARKWEATHER.
This is all beside the question. I sent for you to tell you that this must stop - this association with a man of the type and character of Knox - a dreamer, a charlatan, a scoundrel -
#MARGARET.
It is not necessary to abuse him.
#STARKWEATHER.
It must stop - that is all. Do you understand? It must stop.
#MARGARET.
It has stopped. I doubt that I shall ever see him again. He will never come to my house again, at any rate. Are you satisfied?
#STARKWEATHER.
Perfectly. Of course, you know I have never doubted you - that - that way.
#MARGARET.
How little you know women. In your comprehension we are automatons, puppets, with no hearts nor heats of desire of our own, with no springs of conduct save those of the immaculate and puritanical sort that New England crystallized a century or so ago.
#STARKWEATHER.
You mean that you and this man - ?
#MARGARET.
I mean nothing has passed between us. I mean that I am Tom's wife and Tommy's mother. What I did mean, you have no more understood than you understand me - or any woman.
#STARKWEATHER.
It is well.
#MARGARET.
And it is so easy. The concept is simple. A woman is human. That is all. Yet I do believe it is news to you.
#DOBLEMAN.
This check. You said you would sign it yourself.
#STARKWEATHER.
Yes, that is Rutland's. No; my own pen.
#STARKWEATHER.
This man Knox. I studied him yesterday. A man of great energy and ideals. Unfortunately, he is a sentimentalist. He means right - I grant him that. But he does not understand practical conditions. He is more dangerous to the welfare of the United States than ten thousand anarchists. And he is not practical. Behold, stolen from my private files by a yellow journal sneak thief and turned over to him. He thought to buttress his speech with them this afternoon. And yet, so hopelessly unpractical is he, that you see they are already back in the rightful owner's hands.
#MARGARET.
Then his speech is ruined?
#STARKWEATHER.
Absolutely. The wheels are all ready to turn. The good people of the United States will dismiss him with roars of laughter - a good phrase, that: Hubbard's, I believe. One moment. I must put these away.
#STARKWEATHER.
Has anybody been in the room?
#MARGARET.
No.
#STARKWEATHER.
A most unprecedented thing has occurred. When I went to the safe a moment ago, I left these documents on the cover of the dispatch box. Nobody has been in the room but you. The documents are gone. Give them to me.
#MARGARET.
I have not been out of the room.
#STARKWEATHER.
I know that. Give them to me. You have them. Give them to me
#MARGARET.
I haven't them.
#STARKWEATHER.
That is a lie. Give them to me.
#MARGARET.
I tell you I haven't them -
#STARKWEATHER.
That is a lie.
#MARGARET.
Very well, if you do not believe me -
#STARKWEATHER.
Where are you going?
#MARGARET.
Home.
#STARKWEATHER.
No, you are not. Come back here. You shall not leave this room. Sit down.
#MARGARET.
I prefer to stand.
#STARKWEATHER.
Sit down. Sit down. Before you leave this room you shall return those documents. This is more important than you realize. It transcends all ordinary things of life as you have known it, and you will compel me to do things far harsher than you can possibly imagine. I can forget that you are a daughter of mine. I can forget that you are even a woman. If I have to tear them from you, I shall get them. Give them to me. What are you going to do? What have you to say? What have you to say?
#MARGARET.
Nothing.
#STARKWEATHER.
Let us talk this over quietly. You have no shred of right of any sort to those documents. They are mine. They were stolen by a sneak thief from my private files. Only this morning - a few minutes ago - did I get them back. They are mine, I tell you. They belong to me. Give them back.
#MARGARET.
I tell you I haven't them.
#STARKWEATHER.
You have got them about you, somewhere, concealed in your breast there. It will not save you. I tell you I shall have them. I warn you. I don't want to proceed to extreme measures. Give them to me. Well? I have sent for Dobleman. You have one chance before he comes. Give them to me.
#MARGARET.
Father, will you believe me just this once? Let me go. I tell you I haven't the documents. I tell you that if you let me leave this room, I shall not carry them away with me. I tell you this on my honor. Do you believe me? Tell me that you do believe me.
#STARKWEATHER.
I do believe you. You say they are not on you. I believe you. Now tell me where they are - you have them hidden somewhere - And you can go at once.
#DOBLEMAN.
You rang for me.
#STARKWEATHER.
Yes, I did. Have you been in that other room all the time?
#DOBLEMAN.
Yes, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
Did anybody pass through and enter this room?
#DOBLEMAN.
No, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
Very well. We'll see what the maid has to say. Margaret, I give you one last chance.
#MARGARET.
I have told you that if I leave this room, I shall not take them with me.
#STARKWEATHER.
Has anybody come into this room from the hall in the last few minutes?
#MAID.
No, sir; not since Mrs. Chalmers came in.
#STARKWEATHER.
How do you know?
#MAID.
I was in the hall, sir, dusting all the time.
#STARKWEATHER.
That will do. Dobleman, a very unusual thing has occurred. Mrs. Chalmers and I have been alone in this room. Those letters stolen by Gherst had been returned to me by Hubbard but the moment before. They were on my desk. I turned my back for a moment to go to the safe. When I came back they were gone.
#DOBLEMAN.
Yes, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
Mrs. Chalmers took them. She has them now.
#DOBLEMAN.
Er - er - yes, sir
#STARKWEATHER.
I want them back. What is to be done? Well!
#DOBLEMAN.
S - send for Mr. Hubbard. He got them for you before. good suggestion. Telephone for him. You should find him at the Press Club. Don't leave the room. Use this telephone. From now on no one leaves the room. If my daughter can be guilty of such a theft, it is plain I can trust no one - no one.
#DOBLEMAN.
Red 6 - 2 - 4. Yes, please.
#STARKWEATHER.
Call Senator Chalmers as well. Tell him to come immediately.
#DOBLEMAN.
Yes, sir - immediately.
#STARKWEATHER.
Come over here. Why have you done this? Were you truthful when you said there was nothing between you and this man Knox?
#MARGARET.
Father; don't discuss this before the - - the servants.
#STARKWEATHER.
You should have considered that before you stole the documents.
#MARGARET.
There are certain dignities -
#STARKWEATHER.
Not for a thief. Margaret, it is not too late. Give them back, and no one shall know.
#DOBLEMAN.
Mr. Hubbard says he will be here in three minutes. Fortunately, Senator Chalmers is with him.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
We are just going out, Anthony. You were certainly wrong in making us attempt to take that 2:10 train. I simply can't make it. I know I can't. It would have been much wiser - - Why, what is the matter?
#STARKWEATHER.
Lock the doors.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Mercy me! Anthony! What has happened? Madge! What has happened?
#STARKWEATHER.
You will have to wait here a few minutes, that is all.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
But I must keep my engagements. And I haven't a minute to spare. I do not understand.
#STARKWEATHER.
You will, shortly. I can trust no one any more. When my daughter sees fit to steal -
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Steal! - Margaret! What have you been doing now?
#MARGARET.
Where is Tommy?
#CONNIE.
He is already down in the machine waiting for us. You are coming, aren't you?
#STARKWEATHER.
Let him wait in the machine. Margaret will come when I get done with her.
#STARKWEATHER.
Look here, Tom. You know those letters Gherst stole. Mr. Hubbard recovered them from Knox and returned them to me this morning. Within five minutes Margaret stole them from me - here, right in this room. She has not left the room. They are on her now. I want them.
#CHALMERS.
Madge, is this true?
#MARGARET.
I haven't them. I tell you I haven't them.
#STARKWEATHER.
Where are they, then? If they are in the room we can find them. Search the room. Tom, Mr. Hubbard, Dobleman. They must be recovered at any cost.
#CHALMERS.
There is no place to look for them. They are not in the room. Are you sure you didn't mislay them?
#STARKWEATHER.
Nonsense. Margaret took them. They are a bulky package and not easily hidden. If they aren't in the room, then she has them on her.
#CHALMERS.
Madge, give them up.
#MARGARET.
I haven't them.
#MARGARET.
How dare you!
#HUBBARD.
Possibly it would be better to let me retire, Mr. Starkweather.
#STARKWEATHER.
No; those papers are here in this room. If nobody leaves there will be no possible chance for the papers to get out of the room. What would you recommend doing, Hubbard?
#HUBBARD.
Under the circumstances I don't like to suggest -
#STARKWEATHER.
Go on.
#HUBBARD.
First, I would make sure that she - er - Mrs. Chalmers has taken them.
#STARKWEATHER.
I have made that certain.
#CHALMERS.
But what motive could she have for such an act?
#STARKWEATHER.
You know more about this than would appear. What is it?
#HUBBARD.
I'd rather not. It is too - - er - delicate.
#STARKWEATHER.
This affair has gone beyond all delicacy. What is it?
#MARGARET.
No! No!
#STARKWEATHER.
Go on, Mr. Hubbard.
#HUBBARD.
I'd - I'd rather not.
#STARKWEATHER.
I say go on.
#HUBBARD.
Last night - I saw - I was in Knox's rooms -
#MARGARET.
One moment; please. Let him speak, but first send Connie away.
#STARKWEATHER.
No one shall leave this room till the documents are produced. Margaret, give me the letters, and Connie can leave quietly, and even will Hubbard's lips remain sealed. They will never breathe a word of whatever shameful thing his eyes saw. This I promise you. Go on, Hubbard.
#MARGARET.
No! Don't! I'll tell. I'll give you back the documents. No; I haven't them. Say all you have to say.
#STARKWEATHER.
You see. She has them. She said she would give them back. Go on.
#HUBBARD.
Last night -
#CONNIE.
I won't stay! Let me out! Let me out!
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
I shall die! I shall die! I know I shall die!
#STARKWEATHER.
Go back to your mother.
#CONNIE.
I won't listen! I won't listen!
#STARKWEATHER.
Take your fingers down.
#HUBBARD.
Hang it all, Chalmers, I wish I were out of this. I don't want to testify.
#STARKWEATHER.
Take your fingers down. Now, Hubbard.
#HUBBARD.
I protest. I am being dragged into this.
#CHALMERS.
You can't help yourself now. You have cast black suspicions on my wife.
#HUBBARD.
All right. She - Mrs. Chalmers visited Knox in his rooms last night.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Oh! Oh! My Madge! It is a lie! A lie!
#CHALMERS.
You've got to prove that, Hubbard. If you have made any mistake it will go hard with you.
#HUBBARD.
Look at her. Ask her.
#MARGARET.
Linda was with me. And Tommy. I had to see Mr. Knox on a very important matter. I went there in the machine. I took Linda and Tommy right into Mr. Knox's room.
#CHALMERS.
Ah, that puts a different complexion on it.
#HUBBARD.
That is not all. Mrs. Chalmers sent the maid and the boy down to the machine and remained.
#MARGARET.
But only for a moment
#HUBBARD.
Much longer - much, much longer. I know how long I was kicking my heels and waiting.
#MARGARET.
I say it was but for a moment - a short moment.
#STARKWEATHER.
Where were you?
#HUBBARD.
In Knox's bedroom. The fool had forgotten all about me. He was too delighted with his - er - new visitor.
#STARKWEATHER.
You said you saw.
#HUBBARD.
The bedroom door was ajar. I opened it.
#STARKWEATHER.
What did you see?
#MARGARET.
Have you no mercy? I say it was only a moment.
#STARKWEATHER.
We'll settle the length of that moment Tommy is here, and so is the maid. Connie, Margaret's maid is here, isn't she? Answer me!
#CONNIE.
Yes.
#STARKWEATHER.
Ring for a maid and tell her to fetch Tommy and Mrs. Chalmer's maid.
#MARGARET.
No! Not Tommy!
#STARKWEATHER.
Mrs. Chalmer's maid will do.
#STARKWEATHER.
Lock it.
#CHALMERS.
So you, the immaculate one, have been playing fast and loose.
#MARGARET.
You have no right to talk to me that way, Tom -
#CHALMERS.
I am your husband.
#MARGARET.
You have long since ceased being that.
#CHALMERS.
What do you mean?
#MARGARET.
I mean just what you have in mind about yourself right now.
#CHALMERS.
Madge, you are merely conjecturing. You know nothing against me.
#MARGARET.
I know everything - and without evidence, if you please. I am a woman. It is your atmosphere. Faugh! You have exhaled it for years. I doubt not that proofs, as you would call them, could have been easily obtained. But I was not interested. I had my boy. When he came, I gave you up, Tom. You did not seem to need me any more.
#CHALMERS.
And so, in retaliation, you took up with this fellow Knox.
#MARGARET.
No, no. It is not true, Tom. I tell you it is not true.
#CHALMERS.
You were there, last night, in his rooms, alone - how long we shall soon find out - And now you have stolen your father's private papers for your lover.
#MARGARET.
He is not my lover.
#CHALMERS.
But you have acknowledged that you have the papers. For whom, save Knox, could you have stolen them?
#STARKWEATHER.
That is the woman. Come here. Where were you last night? You know what I mean. Answer me.
#LINDA.
I don't know what you mean, sir - unless -
#STARKWEATHER.
Yes, that's it. Go on.
#LINDA.
But I don't think you have any right to ask me such questions. What if I - if I did go out with my young man -
#STARKWEATHER.
A very faithful young woman you've got. There's nothing to be got out of her. Send for Tommy. Dobleman, ring the bell.
#MARGARET.
No, no; not Tommy. Tell them, Linda. Don't mind me. Tell them the truth.
#CHALMERS.
The whole truth.
#MARGARET.
Yes, Linda, the whole truth.
#STARKWEATHER.
Never mind, Dobleman. Very well. You were at Mr. Knox's rooms last night, with your mistress and Tommy.
#LINDA.
Yes, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
Your mistress sent you and Tommy out of the room.
#LINDA.
Yes, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
You waited in the machine.
#LINDA.
Yes, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
How long?
#MARGARET.
Half an hour - an hour - any length of time your shameful minds dictate. That will do, Linda. You can go.
#STARKWEATHER.
No you don't. Stand over there to one side. The papers are in this room, and I shall keep my mind certain on that point.
#HUBBARD.
I think I have shown the motive.
#CONNIE.
You are a beast!
#CHALMERS.
You haven't told what you saw.
#HUBBARD.
I saw them in each other's arms - several times. Then I found the stolen documents where Knox had thrown them down. So I pocketed them and closed the door.
#CHALMERS.
How long after that did they remain together?
#HUBBARD.
Quite a time, quite a long time.
#CHALMERS.
And when you last saw them?
#HUBBARD.
They were in each other's arms - quite enthusiastically, I may say, in each other's arms.
#MARGARET.
You coward. When are you going to call off this hound of yours?
#STARKWEATHER.
When I get the papers. You see what you've been made to pay for them already. Now listen to me closely. Tom, you listen, too. You know the value of these letters. If they are not recovered they will precipitate a turn - over that means not merely money but control and power. I doubt that even you would be re - elected. So what we have heard in this room must be forgotten - absolutely forgotten. Do you understand?
#CHALMERS.
But it is adultery.
#STARKWEATHER.
It is not necessary for that word to be mentioned. The point is that everything must be as it was formerly.
#CHALMERS.
Yes, I understand.
#STARKWEATHER.
You hear. Tom will make no trouble. Now give me the papers. They are mine, you know.
#MARGARET.
It seems to me the people, who have been lied to, and cajoled, and stolen from, are the rightful owners, not you.
#STARKWEATHER.
Are you doing this out of love for this - this man, this demagogue?
#MARGARET.
For the people, the children, the future.
#STARKWEATHER.
Faugh! Answer me.
#MARGARET.
Almost I do not know. Almost I do not know.
#DOBLEMAN.
Mr. Rutland.
#STARKWEATHER.
Very well. Bring him in. I've paid a lot for the Church, now we'll see what the Church can do for me.
#CONNIE.
Please, please, Madge, give up the papers, and everything will be hushed up. You heard what father said. Think what it means to me if this scandal comes out. Father will hush it up. Not a soul will dare to breathe a word of it. Give him the papers.
#MARGARET.
No; I can't. But Connie, dearest - It is not true, Connie. He - he is not my lover. Tell me that you believe me.
#CONNIE.
I do believe you. But won't you return the papers - for my sake?
#MARGARET.
I can't.
#RUTLAND.
My, what a family gathering. I hastened on at once, my dear Mr. Starkweather, to thank you in person, ere you fled away to New York, for your generously splendid - yes, generously splendid - contribution - theft has been committed, Mr. Rutland. My daughter has stolen something very valuable from me - a package of private papers, so important - well, if she succeeds in making them public I shall be injured to such an extent financially that there won't be any more generously splendid donations for you or anybody else. I have done my best to persuade her to return what she has stolen. Now you try. Bring her to a realization of the madness of what she is doing.
#RUTLAND.
As your spiritual adviser, Mrs. Chalmers - if this be true - I recommend - I suggest - I - ahem - I entreat -
#MARGARET.
Please, Mr. Rutland, don't be ridiculous. Father is only making a stalking horse out of you. Whatever I may have done, or not done, I believe I am doing right. The whole thing is infamous. The people have been lied to and robbed, and you are merely lending yourself to the infamy of perpetuating the lying and the robbing. If you persist in obeying my father's orders - yes, orders - you will lead me to believe that you are actuated by desire for more of those generously splendid donations.
#RUTLAND.
This is, I fear - ahem - too delicate a matter, Mr. Starkweather, for me to interfere. I would suggest that it be advisable for me to withdraw - ahem -
#STARKWEATHER.
So the Church fails me, too. No, you shall stay right here.
#MARGARET.
Father, Tommy is down in the machine alone. Won't you let me go?
#STARKWEATHER.
Give me the papers.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Madge, Madge, it can't be true. I don't believe it. I know you have not done this awful thing. No daughter of mine could be guilty of such wickedness. I refuse to believe my ears -
#STARKWEATHER.
Get up. No; go on. She might listen to you.
#MARGARET.
Don't, mother, don't. Please get up. You don't understand, mother. Please, please, get up.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Madge, I, your mother, implore you, on my bended knees. Give up the papers to your father, and I shall forget all I have heard. Think of the family name. I don't believe it, not a word of it; but think of the shame and disgrace. Think of me. Think of Connie, your sister. Think of Tommy. You'll have your father in a terrible state. And you'll kill me. I'm going to be sick. I know I am going to be sick.
#MARGARET.
Mother, you do not understand. More is at stake than the good name of the family or - God. You speak of Connie and Tommy. There are two millions of Connies and Tommys working as child laborers in the United States to - day. Think of them. And besides, mother, these are all lies you have heard. There is nothing between Mr. Knox and me. He is not my lover. I am not the - the shameful thing - these men have said I am.
#CONNIE.
Madge.
#MARGARET.
Connie. Trust me. I am right. I know I am right.
#STARKWEATHER.
a few minutes ago, when you told me there was nothing between you and this man, you lied to me - lied to me as only a wicked woman can lie.
#MARGARET.
It is clear that you believe the worst.
#STARKWEATHER.
There is nothing less than the worst to be believed. Besides, more heinous than your relations with this man is what you have done here in this room, stolen from me, and practically before my very eyes. Well, you have crossed your will with mine, and in affairs beyond your province. This is a man's game in which you are attempting to play, and you shall take the consequences. Tom will apply for a divorce.
#MARGARET.
That threat, at least, is without power.
#STARKWEATHER.
And by that means we can break Knox as effectually as by any other. That is one thing the good stupid people will not tolerate in a chosen representative. We will make such a scandal of it -
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Anthony!
#STARKWEATHER.
Another thing. Being proven an adulterous woman, morally unfit for companionship with your child, your child will be taken away from you.
#MARGARET.
No, no. That cannot be. I have done nothing wrong. No court, no fair - minded judge, would so decree on the evidence of a creature like that.
#HUBBARD.
My evidence is supported. In an adjoining room were two men. I happen to know, because I placed them there. They were your father's men at that. There is such a thing as seeing through a locked door. They saw.
#MARGARET.
And they would swear to - to anything.
#HUBBARD.
I doubt not they will know to what to swear.
#STARKWEATHER.
Margaret, I have told you some, merely some, of the things I shall do. It is not too late. Return the papers, and everything will be forgotten.
#MARGARET.
You would condone this - this adultery. You, who have just said that I was morally unfit to have my own boy, will permit me to retain him. I had never dreamed, father, that your own immorality would descend to such vile depths. Believing this shameful thing of me, you will forgive and forget it all for the sake of a few scraps of paper that stand for money, that stand for a license to rob and steal from the people. Is this your morality - money?
#STARKWEATHER.
I have my morality. It is not money. I am only a steward; but so highly do I conceive the duties of my stewardship -
#MARGARET.
The thefts and lies and all common little sins like adulteries are not to stand in the way of your high duties - that the end hallows the means.
#STARKWEATHER.
Precisely.
#MARGARET.
There is Jesuitism, Mr. Rutland. I would suggest that you, as my father's spiritual adviser -
#STARKWEATHER.
Enough of this foolery. Give me the papers.
#MARGARET.
I haven't them.
#STARKWEATHER.
What's to be done, Hubbard?
#HUBBARD.
She has them. She has as much as acknowledged that they are not elsewhere in the room. She has not been out of the room. There is nothing to do but search her.
#STARKWEATHER.
Nothing else remains to be done. Dobleman, and you, Hubbard, take her behind the screen. Strip her. Recover the papers.
#CHALMERS.
No; that I shall not permit. Hubbard shall have nothing to do with this.
#MARGARET.
It is too late, Tom. You have stood by and allowed me to be stripped of everything else. A few clothes do not matter now. If I am to be stripped and searched by men, Mr. Hubbard will serve as well as any other man. Perhaps Mr. Rutland would like to lend his assistance.
#CONNIE.
Oh, Madge! Give them up. Then let me search her, father.
#STARKWEATHER.
You are too willing. I don't want volunteers. I doubt that I can trust you any more than your sister.
#CONNIE.
Let mother, then.
#STARKWEATHER.
Margaret could smuggle a steamer - trunk of documents past her.
#CONNIE.
But not the men, father! Not the men!
#STARKWEATHER.
Why not? She has shown herself dead to all shame. Dobleman!
#DOBLEMAN.
Y - y - yes, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
Call in the servants.
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Anthony!
#STARKWEATHER.
Would you prefer her to be searched by the men?
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
I shall die, I shall die. I know I shall die.
#STARKWEATHER.
Dobleman. Ring for the servants. Send in the maids and the housekeeper. Stand over there - in the corner.
#STARKWEATHER.
This is no time for trifling, nor for mawkish sentimentality. Return the papers or take the consequences.
#CHALMERS.
You have taken a hand in a man's game, and you've got to play it out or quit. Give up the papers.
#HUBBARD.
Allow me to point out, my dear Mrs. Chalmers, that you are not merely stealing from your father. You are playing the traitor to your class.
#STARKWEATHER.
And causing irreparable damage.
#MARGARET.
I doubt not he caused irreparable damage when he freed the slaves and preserved the Union. Yet he recognized no classes. I'd rather be a traitor to my class than to him.
#STARKWEATHER.
Demagoguery. Demagoguery.
#HOUSEKEEPER.
Yes, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
Mrs. Middleton, you have the two maids to assist you. Take Mrs. Chalmers behind that screen there and search her. Strip all her clothes from her and make a careful search.
#HOUSEKEEPER.
Yes, sir. What am I to search for?
#STARKWEATHER.
Papers, documents, anything unusual. Turn them over to me when you find them.
#MARGARET.
This is monstrous! This is monstrous!
#STARKWEATHER.
So is your theft of the documents monstrous.
#MARGARET.
You cowards! Will you stand by and permit this thing to be done? Tom, have you one atom of manhood in you?
#CHALMERS.
Doggedly.) Return the papers, then.
#MARGARET.
Mr. Rutland -
#RUTLAND.
My dear Mrs. Chalmers. I assure you the whole circumstance is unfortunate. But you are so palpably in the wrong that I cannot interfere - That I cannot interfere.
#DOBLEMAN.
I cannot stand it. I leave your employ, sir. It is outrageous. I resign now, at once. I cannot be a party to this. I am going at once. You brutes! You brutes!
#CHALMERS.
Ah, another lover, I see.
#STARKWEATHER.
You fool! Shut that door! Shut it! Lock it!
#MARGARET.
Thank you, Mr. Dobleman. Father, you surely will not perpetrate this outrage, when I tell you, I swear to you -
#STARKWEATHER.
Return the documents then.
#MARGARET.
I swear to you that I haven't them. You will not find them on me.
#STARKWEATHER.
You have lied to me about Knox, and I have no reason to believe you will not lie to me about this matter.
#MARGARET.
If you do this thing you shall cease to be my father forever. You shall cease to exist so far as I am concerned.
#STARKWEATHER.
You have too much of my own will in you for you ever to forget whence it came. Mrs. Middleton, go ahead.
#CONNIE.
Father, if you do this I shall never speak to you again.
#STARKWEATHER.
I've wasted enough time on this. Mrs. Middleton, proceed.
#MARGARET.
I will not tamely submit. I will resist, I promise you.
#STARKWEATHER.
Use force, if necessary.
#HOUSEKEEPER.
Come, Mrs. Chalmers.
#MARGARET.
Stand back! Linda! Linda!
#MARGARET.
No! No!
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Anthony! They are taking her clothes off!
#MARGARET.
No! No!
#HUBBARD.
That's not it. It's addressed to Knox.
#STARKWEATHER.
Tear it open. Read it.
#HUBBARD.
It is only a photograph - of Mrs. Chalmers. "For the future - Margaret."
#CHALMERS.
Give it to me.
#STARKWEATHER.
That is not what we wanted, Mrs. Middleton. Go on with the search.
#HOUSEKEEPER.
I find nothing else, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
Is she stripped?
#HOUSEKEEPER.
Yes, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
Every stitch?
#HOUSEKEEPER.
Yes, sir.
#STARKWEATHER.
Nothing?
#HOUSEKEEPER.
Nothing.
#STARKWEATHER.
Throw out her clothes - everything.
#CHALMERS.
Nothing.
#STARKWEATHER.
Are you sure?
#CHALMERS.
Yes; I made certain. She hasn't them.
#STARKWEATHER.
Mrs. Middleton, examine those girls.
#HOUSEKEEPER.
No, sir.
#MARGARET.
May I dress - now? It - it is quite chilly. Will you let Linda come to me, please?
#STARKWEATHER.
You may go.
#DOBLEMAN.
Shall I lock it?
#CONNIE.
May I take mother away?
#MRS. STARKWEATHER.
Let me rest a moment, Connie. I'll be better. Anthony, I am going to bed. This has been too much for me. I shall be sick. I shall never catch that train to - day.
#CHALMERS.
What's to be done?
#HUBBARD.
I'm all at sea. I had just left the letters with him, when Mrs. Chalmers entered the room. What's become of them? She hasn't them, that's certain.
#CHALMERS.
But why? Why should she have taken them?
#HUBBARD.
It seems very clear to me.
#CHALMERS.
You think so? You think so?
#HUBBARD.
I told you what I saw last night at his rooms. There is no other explanation.
#CHALMERS.
And that's the sort he is - vaunting his moral superiority - mouthing phrases about theft - our theft - and himself the greatest thief of all, stealing the dearest and sacredest things -
#RUTLAND.
It is a sad happening - ahem - a sad happening. I am grieved, deeply grieved. I cannot tell you, Mrs. Chalmers, how grieved I am to have been compelled to be present at this - ahem - this unfortunate -
#MARGARET.
After this, father, there is one thing I shall do -
#CHALMERS.
Go to your lover, I suppose.
#MARGARET.
Coldly.) Have it that way if you choose.
#CHALMERS.
And take him what you have stolen -
#STARKWEATHER.
But she hasn't them on her. She hasn't been out of the room. They are not in the room. Then where are they?
#HUBBARD.
It is not locked. It moves noiselessly. There's the explanation. While you were at the safe, with your back turned, she lifted the window, tossed the papers out to somebody waiting - - No; they are not there. Somebody was waiting for them.
#STARKWEATHER.
But how should she know I had them? You had only just recovered them?
#HUBBARD.
Didn't Knox know right away last night that I had taken them? I took the up - elevator instead of the down when I heard him running along the hall. Trust him to let her know what had happened. She was the only one who could recover them for him. Else why did she come here so immediately this morning? To steal the package, of course. And she had some one waiting outside. She tossed them out and closed the window - - You notice it makes no sound. - and sat down again - all while your back was turned.
#STARKWEATHER.
Margaret, is this true?
#MARGARET.
Yes, the window. Why didn't you think of it before? Of course, the window. He - somebody was waiting. They are gone now - miles and miles away. You will never get them. They are in his hands now. He will use them in his speech this afternoon. May I go - now?
#MARGARET.
I knew you would come. Strange that I had to send for you so soon after last night - What is the matter? You are sick. Your hand is cold.
#KNOX.
It is flame or freeze with me. And I'd rather flame.
#MARGARET.
Sit down and tell me what is the matter.
#KNOX.
After you left last night, Hubbard stole those documents back again.
#MARGARET.
Yes; he was in your bedroom while I was there.
#KNOX.
How do you know that? Anyway, he did not know who you were.
#MARGARET.
Oh yes he did.
#KNOX.
And he has dared - ?
#MARGARET.
Yes; not two hours ago. He announced the fact before my father, my mother, Connie, the servants, everybody.
#KNOX.
The cur!
#MARGARET.
Quietly.) I believe, among other things, I told him he was that myself. Oh, it was a pretty family party, I assure you. Mother said she didn't believe it - but that was only hysteria. Of course she believes it - the worst. So does Connie - everybody.
#KNOX.
You don't mean they charged - ?
#MARGARET.
No; I don't mean that. I mean more. They didn't charge. They accepted it as a proven fact that I was guilty. That you were my - lover.
#KNOX.
On that man's testimony?
#MARGARET.
He had two witnesses in an adjoining room.
#KNOX.
All the better. They can testify to nothing more than the truth, and the truth is not serious. In our case it is good, for we renounced each other.
#MARGARET.
You don't know these men. It is easy to guess that they have been well trained. They would swear to anything. They are my father's men, you know, his paid sleuth - hounds.
#KNOX.
How you must have suffered. What a terrible time, what a terrible time! I can see it all - before everybody - your nearest and dearest. Ah, I could not understand, after our parting last night, why you should have sent for me today. But now I know.
#MARGARET.
No you don't, at all.
#KNOX.
What's the difference? I am ruined politically. Their scheme has worked out only too well. Gifford warned me, you warned me, everybody warned me. But I was a fool, blind - with a fool's folly. There is nothing left but you now. Do you know, Margaret, I thank God it has happened as it has. What if my usefulness is destroyed? There will be other men - other leaders. I but make way for another. The cause of the people can never be lost. And though I am driven from the fight, I am driven to you. We are driven together. It is fate. Again I thank God for it.
#MARGARET.
Ah, now you flame. The tables are reversed. Last night it was I. We are fortunate that we choose diverse times for our moods - else there would be naught but one sweet melting mad disaster.
#KNOX.
But it is not as if we had done this thing deliberately and selfishly. We have renounced. We have struggled against it until we were beaten. And now we are driven together, not by our doing but Fate's. After this affair this morning there is nothing for you but to come to me. And as for me, despite my best, I am finished. I have failed. As I told you, the papers are stolen. There will be no speech this afternoon.
#MARGARET.
Yes there will.
#KNOX.
Impossible. I would make a triple fool of myself. I would be unable to substantiate my charges.
#MARGARET.
You will substantiate them. What a chain of theft it is. My father steals from the people. The documents that prove his stealing are stolen by Gherst. Hubbard steals them from you and returns them to my father. And I steal them from my father and pass them back to you.
#KNOX.
Astounded.) You? - You? -
#MARGARET.
Yes; this very morning. That was the cause of all the trouble. If I hadn't stolen them nothing would have happened. Hubbard had just returned them to my father.
#KNOX.
And you did this for me - ?
#MARGARET.
Dear man, I didn't do it for you. I wasn't brave enough. I should have given in. I don't mind confessing that I started to do it for you, but it soon grew so terrible that I was afraid. It grew so terrible that had it been for you alone I should have surrendered. But out of the terror of it all I caught a wider vision, and all that you said last night rose before me. And I knew that you were right. I thought of all the people, and of the little children. I did it for them, after all. You speak for them. I stole the papers so that you could use them in speaking for the people. Don't you see, dear man? Do you know what they cost me? Do you know what was done to me, to - day, this morning, in my father's house? I was shamed, humiliated, as I would never have dreamed it possible. Do you know what they did to me? The servants were called in, and by them I was stripped before everybody - my family, Hubbard, the Reverend Mr. Rutland, the secretary, everybody.
#KNOX.
Stripped - you?
#MARGARET.
Every stitch. My father commanded it
#KNOX.
My God!
#MARGARET.
No; it was not so bad as that. There was a screen. But it fell down in the midst of the struggle.
#KNOX.
But in heaven's name why was this done to you?
#MARGARET.
Searching for the lost letters. They knew I had taken them. So you see, I have earned those papers. And I have earned the right to say what shall be done with them. I shall give them to you, and you will use them in your speech this afternoon.
#KNOX.
I don't want them.
#MARGARET.
Oh yes you do. They are more valuable right now than anything else in the world.
#KNOX.
I wish it hadn't happened.
#MARGARET.
What?
#KNOX.
This morning - your recovering the letters. I had adjusted myself to their loss, and the loss of the fight, and the finding of - you. So - give them back to your father.
#MARGARET.
Send Linda to me.
#KNOX.
What are you doing?
#MARGARET.
I am going to send Linda for them. They are still in my father's house, hidden, of all places, behind Lincoln's portrait. He will guard them safely, I know.
#KNOX.
Margaret! Margaret! Don't send for them. Let them go. I don't want them. I want you - you - you.
#MARGARET.
Dear, dear man, I love to see you so. But it cannot be. No, no, please, please sit down.
#MARGARET.
Where are you going?
#LINDA.
Tommy and the nurse and I were going down town. There is some shopping she wants to do.
#MARGARET.
Very good. But go first to my father's house. Listen closely. In the library, behind the portrait of Lincoln - you know it? You will find a packet of papers. It took me five seconds to put it there. It will take you no longer to get it. Let no one see you. Let it appear as though you had brought Tommy to see his grandmother and cheer her up. You know she is not feeling very well just now. After you get the papers, leave Tommy there and bring them immediately back to me. Step on a chair to the ledge of the bookcase, and reach behind the portrait. You should be back inside fifteen minutes. Take the car.
#LINDA.
Tommy and the nurse are already in it, waiting for me.
#MARGARET.
Be careful. Be quick.
#KNOX.
This is madness. You are sacrificing yourself, and me. I don't want them. I want you. I am tired. What does anything matter except love? I have pursued ideals long enough. Now I want you.
#MARGARET.
Ah, there you have expressed the pith of it. You will now forsake ideals for me - No, no; not that I am less than an ideal. I have no silly vanity that way. But I want you to remain ideal, and you can only by going on - not by being turned back. Anybody can play the coward and assert they are fatigued. I could not love a coward. It was your strength that saved us last night. I could not have loved you as I do, now, had you been weak last night. You can only keep my love -
#KNOX.
By foregoing it - for an ideal. Margaret, what is the biggest thing in the world? Love. There is the greatest ideal of all.
#MARGARET.
Love of man and woman?
#KNOX.
What else?
#MARGARET.
There is one thing greater - love of man for his fellowman.
#KNOX.
Oh, how you turn my preachments back on me. It is a lesson. Nevermore shall I preach. Henceforth -
#MARGARET.
Yes.
#KNOX.
Henceforth I love. Listen.
#MARGARET.
You are overwrought. It will pass, and you will see your path straight before you, and know that I am right. You cannot run away from the fight.
#KNOX.
I can - and will. I want you, and you want me - the man's and woman's need for each other. Come, go with me - now. Let us snatch at happiness while we may. As I have said, the fight will go on just the same. Scores of men, better men, stronger men, than I, will rise to take my place. Why do I talk this way? Because I love you, love you, love you. Nothing else exists in all the world but love of you.
#MARGARET.
Ah, you flame, you flame.
#MARGARET.
No, Tom, no dramatics, please. This excitement of yours is only automatic and conventional. You really don't mean it. You don't even feel it. You do it because it is expected of you and because it is your training. Besides, it is bad for your heart. Remember Dr. West's warning -
#CHALMERS.
My heart! My heart!
#KNOX.
Can I do anything?
#MARGARET.
No; it is all right. He will be better presently.
#KNOX.
I shall go now.
#MARGARET.
No. You will wait until Linda comes back. Besides, you can't run away from this and leave me alone to face it.
#KNOX.
I am not a coward.
#CHALMERS.
Yes; wait I have a word for you. A nice specimen of a reformer, I must say. You, who babbled yesterday about theft. The most high, righteous and noble Ali Baba, who has come into the den of thieves and who is also a thief. "Ah, you flame, you flame!" I should call you; you thief, you thief, you wife - stealer, you.
#MARGARET.
I should scarcely call it theft.
#CHALMERS.
Yes; I forgot. You mean it is not theft for him to take what already belongs to him.
#MARGARET.
Not quite that - but in taking what has been freely offered to him.
#CHALMERS.
You mean you have so forgotten your womanhood as to offer -
#MARGARET.
Just that. Last night. And Mr. Knox did himself the honor of refusing me.
#KNOX.
You see, nothing else remains, Margaret.
#CHALMERS.
Ah, "Margaret."
#KNOX.
The situation is intolerable.
#CHALMERS.
It is intolerable. Don't you think you had better leave this house? Every moment of your presence dishonors it.
#MARGARET.
Don't talk of honor, Tom.
#CHALMERS.
I make no excuses for myself. I fancy I never fooled you very much. But at any rate I never used my own house for such purposes.
#KNOX.
You cur!
#MARGARET.
No; don't. His heart.
#CHALMERS.
No dramatics, please.
#MARGARET.
Men are so strangely and wonderfully made. What am I to do with the pair of you? Why won't you reason together like rational human beings?
#CHALMERS.
Yes; let us come and reason together. Be rational. Sit down and talk it over like civilized humans. This is not the stone age. Be reassured, Mr. Knox. I won't brain you. Margaret - Sit down. Mr. Knox - Sit down. Behold the problem - the ever ancient and ever young triangle of the playwright and the short story writer - two men and a woman.
#KNOX.
True, and yet not true. The triangle is incomplete. Only one of the two men loves the woman.
#CHALMERS.
Yes?
#KNOX.
And I am that man.
#CHALMERS.
I fancy you're right. But how about the woman?
#MARGARET.
She loves one of the two men.
#KNOX.
And what are you going to do about it?
#CHALMERS.
She has not yet indicated the man. Be careful, Madge. Remember who is Tommy's father.
#MARGARET.
Tom, honestly, remembering what the last years have been can you imagine that I love you?
#CHALMERS.
I'm afraid I've not - er - not flamed sufficiently.
#MARGARET.
You have possibly spoken nearer the truth than you dreamed. I married you, Tom, hoping great things of you. I hoped you would be a power for good -
#CHALMERS.
Politics again. When will women learn they must leave politics alone?
#MARGARET.
And also, I hoped for love. I knew you didn't love me when we married, but I hoped for it to come.
#CHALMERS.
And - er - may I be permitted to ask if you loved me?
#MARGARET.
No; but I hoped that, too, would come.
#CHALMERS.
It was, then, all a mistake.
#MARGARET.
Yes; yours, and mine, and my father's.
#KNOX.
We have sat down to reason this out, and we get nowhere. Margaret and I love each other. Your triangle breaks.
#CHALMERS.
It isn't a triangle after all. You forget Tommy.
#KNOX.
Petulantly.) Make it four - sided, then, but let us come to some conclusion.
#CHALMERS.
Reflecting.) Ah, it is more than that. There is a fifth side. There are the stolen letters which Madge has just this morning restolen from her father. Whatever settlement takes place, they must enter into it. Look here, Madge, I am a fool. Let us talk sensibly, you and Knox and I. Knox, you want my wife. You can have her - on one consideration. Madge, you want Knox. You can have him on one consideration, the same consideration. Give up the letters and we'll forget everything.
#MARGARET.
Everything?
#CHALMERS.
Everything. Forgive and forget You know.
#MARGARET.
You will forgive my - I - this - this adultery?
#CHALMERS.
I'll forgive anything for the letters. I've played fast and loose with you, Madge, and I fancy your playing fast and loose only evens things up. Return the letters and you can go with Knox quietly. I'll see to that. There won't be a breath of scandal. I'll give you a divorce. Or you can stay on with me if you want to. I don't care. What I want is the letters. Is it agreed?
#KNOX.
Margaret.
#MARGARET.
Testily.) Am I not giving you each other? What more do you want? Tommy stays with me. If you want Tommy, then stay with me, but you must give up the letters.
#MARGARET.
I shall not go with Mr. Knox. I shall not give up the letters. I shall remain with Tommy.
#CHALMERS.
So far as I am concerned, Knox doesn't count in this. I want the letters and I want Tommy. If you don't give them up, I'll divorce you on statutory grounds, and no woman, so divorced, can keep her child. In any event, I shall keep Tommy.
#MARGARET.
Listen, Tom; and you, too, Howard. I have never for a moment entertained the thought of giving up the letters. I may have led you to think so, but I wanted to see just how low, you, Tom, could sink. I saw how low you - all of you - this morning sank. I have learned - much. Where is this fine honor, Tom, which put you on a man - killing rage a moment ago? You'll barter it all for a few scraps of paper, and forgive and forget adultery which does not exist - - though I know when I say it you will not believe me. At any rate, I shall not give up the letters. Not if you do take Tommy away from me. Not even for Tommy will I sacrifice all the people. As I told you this morning, there are two million Tommys, child - laborers all, who cannot be sacrificed for Tommy's sake or anybody's sake.
#KNOX.
Surely, Margaret, there is a way out for us. Give up the letters. What are they? - only scraps of paper. Why match them against happiness - our happiness?
#MARGARET.
But as you told me yourself, those scraps of paper represent the happiness of millions of lives. It is not our happiness that is matched against some scraps of paper. It is our happiness against millions of lives - like ours. All these millions have hearts, and loves, and desires, just like ours.
#KNOX.
But it is a great social and cosmic process. It does not depend on one man. Kill off, at this instant, every leader of the people, and the process will go on just the same. The people will come into their own. Theft will be unseated. It is destiny. It is the process. Nothing can stop it.
#MARGARET.
But it can be retarded.
#KNOX.
You and I are no more than straws in relation to it. We cannot stop it any more than straws can stop an ocean tide. We mean nothing - except to each other, and to each other we mean all the world.
#MARGARET.
All the world and immortality thrown in.
#CHALMERS.
Nice situation, sitting here and listening to a strange man woo my wife in terms of sociology and scientific slang.
#KNOX.
Dear, I want you so.
#MARGARET.
Oh! It is so hard to do right!
#KNOX.
He wants the letters very badly. Give them up for Tommy. He will give Tommy for them.
#CHALMERS.
No; emphatically no. If she wants Tommy she can stay on; but she must give up the letters. If she wants you she may go; but she must give up the letters.
#KNOX.
Margaret.
#MARGARET.
Howard. Don't tempt me and press me. It is hard enough as it is.
#CHALMERS.
I've had enough of this. The thing must be settled, and I leave it to you, Knox. Go on with your love - making. But I won't be a witness to it. Perhaps I - er - retard the - er - the flame process. You two must make up your minds, and you can do it better without me. I am going to get a drink and settle my nerves. I'll be back in a minute. She will yield, Knox. Be warm, be warm. Ah, you flame! Flame to some purpose.
#MARGARET.
It is hard, I know, dear. And it is hard for me as well.
#KNOX.
It is so unnecessary.
#MARGARET.
No, it is necessary. What you said last night, when I was weak, was wise. We cannot steal from my child -
#KNOX.
But if he gives you Tommy? Margaret Nor can we steal from any other woman's child - from all the children of all the women. And other things I heard you say, and you were right. We cannot live by ourselves alone. We are social animals. Our good and our ill - all is tied up with all humanity.
#KNOX.
I do not follow you. I hear your voice, but I do not know a word you say. Because I am loving your voice - and you. I am so filled with love that there is no room for anything else. And you, who yesterday were so remote and unattainable, are so near and possible, so immediately possible. All you have to do is to say the word, one little word. Say it. - Say it.
#MARGARET.
I should like to. I should like to. But I can't.
#KNOX.
You must.
#MARGARET.
There are other and greater things that say must to me. Oh, my dear, have you forgotten them? Things you yourself have spoken to me - the great stinging things of the spirit, that are greater than you and I, greater even than our love.
#KNOX.
I exhaust my arguments - but still I love you.
#MARGARET.
And I love you for it.
#CHALMERS.
Ah, I see you have taken my advice, and reached a decision. No? Well, I've thought it over, and I've changed my terms. Madge, go with Knox, take Tommy with you. There will be no scandal. I'll give you a proper divorce. And you can have Tommy.
#KNOX.
Margaret!
#CHALMERS.
You and I never hit it off together any too extraordinarily well, Madge; but I'm not altogether a bad sort. I am easy - going. I always have been easy - going. I'll make everything easy for you now. But you see the fix I am in. You love another man, and I simply must regain those letters. It is more important than you realize.
#MARGARET.
You make me realize how important those letters are.
#KNOX.
Give him the letters, Margaret
#CHALMERS.
So she hasn't turned them over to you yet?
#MARGARET.
No; I still have them.
#KNOX.
Give them to him.
#CHALMERS.
Selling out for a petticoat. A pretty reformer.
#KNOX.
Proudly.) better lover.
#MARGARET.
He is weak to - day. What of it? He was strong last night. He will win back his strength again. It is human to be weak. And in his very weakness now, I have my pride, for it is the weakness of love. God knows I have been weak, and I am not ashamed of it. It was the weakness of love. It is hard to stifle one's womanhood always with morality. But do not mistake, Tom. This of mine is no conventional morality. I do not care about nasty gossipy tongues and sensation - mongering sheets; nor do I care what any persons of all the persons I know, would say if I went away with Mr. Knox this instant. I would go, and go gladly and proudly with him, divorce or no divorce, scandal or scandal triple - fold - if - if no one else were hurt by what I did. Howard, I tell you that I would go with you now, in all willingness and joy, with May - time and the songs of all singing birds in my heart - were it not for the others. But there is a higher morality. We must not hurt those others. We dare not steal our happiness from them. The future belongs to them, and we must not, dare not, sacrifice that future nor give it in pledge for our own happiness. Last night I came to you. I was weak - yes; more than that - I was ignorant. I did not know, even as late as last night, the monstrous vileness, the consummate wickedness of present - day conditions. I learned that today, this morning, and now. I learned that the morality of the Church was a pretense. Far deeper than it, and vastly more powerful, was the morality of the dollar. My father, my family, my husband, were willing to condone what they believed was my adultery. And for what? For a few scraps of paper that to them represented only the privilege to plunder, the privilege to steal from the people. Here are you, Tom, not only willing and eager to give me into the arms of the man you believe my lover, but you throw in your boy - your child and mine - to make it good measure and acceptable. And for what? Love of some woman? - any woman? No. Love of humanity? No. Love of God? No. Then for what? For the privilege of perpetuating your stealing from the people - money, bread and butter, hats, shoes, and stockings - for stealing all these things from the people. Now, and at last, do I realize how stern and awful is the fight that must be waged - the fight in which you and I, Howard, must play our parts and play them bravely and uncomplainingly - you as well as I, but I even more than you. This is the den of thieves. I am a child of thieves. All my family is composed of thieves. I have been fed and reared on the fruits of thievery. I have been a party to it all my life. Somebody must cease from this theft, and it is I. And you must help me, Howard.
#CHALMERS.
Strange that you never went into the suffragette business. With such speech - making ability you would have been a shining light.
#KNOX.
The worst of it is, Margaret, you are right. But it is hard that we cannot be happy save by stealing from the happiness of others. Yet it hurts, deep down and terribly, to forego you.
#CHALMERS.
Oh, believe me, I am not too anxious to give up my wife. Look at her. She's a pretty good woman for any man to possess.
#MARGARET.
Tom, I'll accept a quiet divorce, marry Mr. Knox, and take Tommy with me - on one consideration.
#CHALMERS.
And what is that?
#MARGARET.
That I retain the letters. They are to be used in his speech this afternoon.
#CHALMERS.
No they're not.
#MARGARET.
Whatever happens, do whatever worst you can possibly do, that speech will be given this afternoon. Your worst to me will be none too great a price for me to pay.
#CHALMERS.
No letters, no divorce, no Tommy, nothing.
#MARGARET.
Then will you compel me to remain here. I have done nothing wrong, and I don't imagine you will make a scandal. There they are now. Yes; give them to me.
#KNOX.
That you shall not!
#MARGARET.
Tom, don't! Your heart! Be careful! Howard! Stop him! Don't let him ring, or the servants will get the letters away from us. Linda, a glass of water.
#KNOX.
Give them to me.
#CHALMERS.
Bring me a whiskey and soda.
#MARGARET.
You will go now and you will give the speech.
#KNOX.
I will give the speech.
#MARGARET.
And all the forces making for the good time coming will be quickened by your words. Let the voices of the millions be in it. You know where my heart lies. Some day, in all pride and honor, stealing from no one, hurting no one, we shall come together - to be together always.
#KNOX.
And in the meantime?
#MARGARET.
We must wait
#KNOX.
We will wait.
#CHALMERS.
For me to die? eh?
#KNOX.
I hadn't that in mind, but now that you mention it, it seems to the point. That heart of yours isn't going to carry you much farther. You have played fast and loose with it as with everything else. You are like the carter who steals hay from his horse that he may gamble. You have stolen from your heart. Some day, soon, like the horse, it will quit We can afford to wait. It won't be long.
#CHALMERS.
Well, Knox, neither of us wins. You don't get the woman. Neither do I. She remains under my roof, and I fancy that is about all. I won't divorce her. What's the good? But I've got her tied hard and fast by Tommy. You won't get her.
#MARGARET.
Work. Bravely work. You are my knight. Go.
#CHALMERS.
Madge. I say, Madge. That speech is going to make a devil of a row. But I don't think it will be so bad as your father says. It looks pretty dark, but such things blow over. They always do blow over. And so with you and me. Maybe we can manage to forget all this and patch it up somehow. Why don't you speak? Madge.
#MARGARET.
Don't touch me!
