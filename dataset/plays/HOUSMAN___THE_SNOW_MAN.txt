Here we have a snowman, a snowman, a snowman! Oh, where does he come from, and what shall be his name? He says his name is no man, no man, no man! And nowhere and nowhere the land from which he came. Oh, why did you come here, oh, snowman, oh, snowman? And will you now a friend be, or will you be a foe? “Oh, whether I a friend am, or whether I’m a foe - man, It’s here I mean to stay now, until I have to go!” But what should you go for, oh, snowman, oh, snowman? And why would you leave us, when home lies at hand? “Oh, when the sun calls me, then I can wait for no man, But back I must go again, to my own land!” And now we’ve made him, he’ll have to stay, Ha! Ha! Ha! He can’t get away.

#JOAN.
There come a man to a maid, and said, “So thou be mine now let us be wed Said the maid to the man, “If I thee wed Bide ’e at home, and find me bread - They hadn’t been wed, the maid and the man, Before a want in his heart began, “Oh, wife, there’s come a call to my blood, By road and river, by field and flood, Out and away to the world he went, Oh, man of the road, is your heart content? Oh, man of the road, is your heart content? Ah, there be storm, black blasts with icy breath! The night’s gone colder now, aye cold like death, Cold! Who be there? Who is it? Whence do’e come? Have you no word? What, are ye deaf and dumb? No, stop! Not there, not there!
#SNOWMAN.
Why do you touch me?
#JOAN.
Why do you come here? Who are you? Answer! No, you don’t go there! You shan’t, you shan’t come nigh of ’em.
#SNOWMAN.
Take care! My touch is - cold!
#JOAN.
You think I’m feard o’ that? You think them eyes as I be looking at Have any fear for me, or shape of dread? Worse that what life ’ave? Why, if I were dead!
#SNOWMAN.
If you were dead?
#JOAN.
No, no, I say you lie! My little ’uns? God wouldn’t let ’em die. ’A wouldn’t have the heart, ’a wouldn’t have the heart.
#SNOWMAN.
Yet there’s a heart, Which, this same night, To give strength to a lame man’s feet. lame man?
#SNOWMAN.
Gray - headed, bent, He scarce can go, His strength is spent In drifts of snow, And all the icy blasts that blow.
#JOAN.
I don’t know who you mean.
#SNOWMAN.
Give me your hand, And you shall see, Here, close at hand, snow - bound goes he. Give me your hand, And come with me.
#JOAN.
With you? Why do you think I’d come with you? I’ve got my children, I’ve a husband, too, One as I love.
#SNOWMAN.
And he - does he love you?
#JOAN.
That’s no concern o’ yourn! Aye, ’a did once, Aye! and ’a will again, Some day, perhaps. When he first married me, ’A did, - ’a did! We’ve sat here in this room A - kissing by the hour! That were before The children come. Children do make a house No comfort to a man. He had his right To go. He didn’t want ’em, but I did! I did! Aye! and I’ve ’ad ’em now a whole seven years, Worked for ’em, I lived for ’em, starved for ’em, And I’d die So it could better ’em.
#SNOWMAN.
And what - for him?
#JOAN.
I’ve broke my ’eart for ’im; it’s past its work, And now it ain’t no use - no use - to ’im.
#SNOWMAN.
Its use has come. Oh, woman give Your heart to me, I’ll make it live. And what you lend he shall receive.
#JOAN.
You can’t. You can’t do that - You can’t raise up the sun when once it’s set; You can’t put new roots in us, when we’re old, Dried up, and withered.
#SNOWMAN.
Yet within kind earth Dry seed goes sown And springs again to birth.
#JOAN.
I’ve ’ad enough of earth. I’ve sowed, I’ve reaped, I’ve gathered, and I’ve strawed. But me and ’im We won’t meet any more. He ’aven’t come, Nigh me - not for a year. And when he did come back - he went again Next day.
#SNOWMAN.
Went? Where?
#JOAN.
Nowhere. He roves about. Seeing the world, ’e calls it. Roving blood. That’s been ’is curse; and mind, ’is roving blood, it haven’t always roved. He liked his ease, he liked the victuals I give him well enough, he liked his fireside, and he liked his bed when I was by ’im. Ah! And then one day he’d ’ad enough of comfort, and was off, - looking for what? ’Ardship? He might have ’ad that ’ere if he’d but stayed. Aye, that ’e could - for it’s been ’ard enough - with they two there. Ah, you may look at ’em, they ’aven’t known trouble - yet they was with me all the time. Why, there’ve been days when I’ve not ’ad enough to eat myself. And what ’ave fed me? Just to ’ear ’em laugh and think they ’aven’t known. What do you look at me like that for? What do you know? What did you come for? Say!
#SNOWMAN.
To bring you comfort.
#JOAN.
Comfort? I’ve got no place for comfort in me now. It isn’t that I want - it’s rest.
#SNOWMAN.
’Tis rest I bring.
#JOAN.
Where’s ’e?
#SNOWMAN.
Here - near at hand. Come, come and do not be afraid.
#JOAN.
Oh, dearie me. This feels like death. Like death!
#SNOWMAN.
What do you see? waste of snow.
#SNOWMAN.
Anyone there?
#JOAN.
No one I know. No - only you. What? You say you saw him on the road, coming? How do you know that it was ’im? Yes - yes - ’e was like that. But younger, ’andsomer than that, - not lame - No, he was never lame - a young, young man, And strong! - Oh, lost his way? You say ’e’d lost his way? Well, maybe that might tire ’im just a bit, But oh, he’d find it! Oh, trust him for that! He’s been all round the world - and lost his way Through coming ’ome. Yes, yes, he’s coming ’ome. Ah! Now I see ’im. Yes, I’m ’ere, I’m ’ere! Waiting for yer, - waiting - expecting yer. Ah, never mind. Though yer don’t love me, still It’s back to me you come! Yer can’t ’elp that That’s ’ow God made yer. That’s why He made me. No! I can’t reach yer. No, he’s got my hand, Holding it, holding it, - and won’t leave go! I’d ’elp yer, if I could. I’d die for yer! But he won’t let me go. - I’m cold, I’m cold! Can’t see! - I’ve lost my way, And I shan’t - never - any more come home!
#JASPAR.
Home! Home, at last! Who’s there? Anyone there? What? Nobody? No fire? Oh, bitter cold - It feels like death! Here, fool, give me a light! Light, can’t yer? Ah, what’s that, what’s that, what’s that? Who are yer? What for are you lying there? Get up! Get up! What makes ’e be so cold? So clammed? What the, - ! My wife! It be my wife! Wife! Don’t ’e hear me? It be I, come back, Jaspar come back - Jaspar come home again - Jaspar - why don’t ’e answer? There, now there! Have that to warm yer. Oh, ye’ll soon come round, Ye’ve starved yerself, ye - ! Ah - she’s dead, she’s dead! No, she ain’t dead, she can’t be, they’re alive! She wouldn’t leave ’em. No, she can’t be dead. Wife, do ’e hear? The children be alive. You wouldn’t go and leave ’em, no, not you - ’Twouldn’t be like yer. There, my - there, come, come! Take warmth o’ me, - out of my ’eart and soul! I’ll make ye warm. Why, I was coming ’ome. I’d ’a been yere before, but I lost my way, Got buried in the snow. Then I ’eard you A - callin’ me! I thought I saw your face, Then it all went, and then, my feet grew strong, Life come to me, and warmth, and here I be! Can’t ’e speak to me? Be ye gone so far As ’e can’t ’ear me? Not the word I’d say To tell ’e how I loved ’e? Ah, now I be in ’ell, I be in ’ell! And ’a won’t never know. What’s that to say? Oh, the dear hand. Yes, I’ll look after ’em. They shan’t know want - and I won’t go away - The way I’d wish to go. I’ll bear my life And all the burden of it. There, there, my lass, Rest ye in peace, I’ll do my best by ’em! I’ll do my best.
#JOAN.
Who’s that, who’s that got hold o’ me? Let go! I must go to ’im.
#JASPAR.
No, no, bide ’e still. Here’s Jaspar!
#JOAN.
Jaspar!
#JASPAR.
Oh, you be alive!
#JOAN.
So you’ve come back, I knew you’d come - some day. What’s this?
#JASPAR.
My coat. I found you lyin’ there cold, so I put it round yer. But you made no sign - until I thought as yer was dead.
#JOAN.
Dead? Would I leave ’em? Leave my little ’uns?
#JASPAR.
Ah, there you do get home. It’s a true charge. It’s what I done.
#JOAN.
You ’ad the roving blood. You couldn’t ’elp it.
#JASPAR.
It ain’t brought me no joy.
#JOAN.
Jaspar, I think you’ve come here in a dream. Put your arms round me and ’old me. Don’t let go. Help me to dream, I’d like for it to last Just one more hour - put your ’ead on my heart. And don’t you speak - don’t speak - I want to dream, You be come back again! I want to dream.
#MARY.
Mother, what’s that? Get up, get up, it’s light! Oh, come and look! The snow’s all falling - right down off the roof. Look how it’s letting go!

Oh, the snowman. Look at the snowman! Oh!

#JOAN.
The snowman, my dear. He’s come to stay.
