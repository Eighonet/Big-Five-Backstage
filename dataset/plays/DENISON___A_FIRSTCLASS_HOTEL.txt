#LANDLORD.
This is the very best I can do, Mr. Bulger.
#BULGER.
Hang it all, I believe I’ll go over to the Eagle.
#LANDLORD.
Hist! You’ll wake him. No use to go to the Eagle. All full there. It’s County Fair, you know.
#BULGER.
Hang the fair! Landlord, this is no way to treat an old customer. This is a one - horse town anyway.
#LANDLORD.
Very sorry, Mr. Bulger, but I didn’t make the town. It’s the best I can do. Mr. Leggatt’s a very nice quiet gentleman. Why, he’s a littery man!
#BULGER.
Confound literature! It aint in it with trade.
#LANDLORD.
Quite right, but it’s got to be humored same as other things. He’s as quiet as a lamb if you don’t wake him.
#BULGER.
Hum! And if he wakes?
#LANDLORD.
He’s kind o’ restless. He may walk the floor.
#BULGER.
Indeed! Let him try it.
#LANDLORD.
Quiet now. You may wake him. Good night, sir.
#BULGER.
What’s this? A two by three closet. I’ll put my things in the closet, though I don’t suppose this one - horse town can afford even a burglar. I’ll strike this town from my list. Such a snide hotel isn’t to be found this side the Mississippi river.
#BULGER.
Damp, as usual! I’ll catch my death of cold. I always get a cold in this town. The place is so slow, that’s the only thing people can catch. I’ll have the sheets changed, if I have to rouse every chambermaid in the house. I’ll take a liver pill while I think of it. Always have to take a liver pill in this town. It’s so slow that a man’s liver stops business. I am catching cold already. If I sneeze I’ll wake him. There’s a draft somewhere. I’ll wake his literary nibbs, sure. Wide open and stuck fast; windows always stick in this town. When they are up they stay up, when they are down they stay down. And that old hay - seed actually calls this a first - class hotel. He amuses me. Confound that bell. I guess I’ll smoke while I am waiting. Where’s that pipe?
#LEGGATT.
What’s that? Who’s there? Heh? burglar! I’ll shoot, you rascal!
#BULGER.
Don’t shoot! Don’t! It’s only me!
#LEGGATT.
Who’s me? Blow it, where’s that infernal candle? I’ll have to get up.
#BULGER.
Don’t get up! It’s all an accident.
#LEGGATT.
Who the deuce are you, anyway?
#BULGER.
I’m a guest of this beastly hotel, if its victims may be called by so genteel a term as guest.
#LEGGATT.
A guest! I don’t like that.
#BULGER.
Neither do I.
#LEGGATT.
You’ve disturbed me and now I’ll have a night of it.
#BULGER.
I’m very sorry indeed!
#LEGGATT.
So am I.
#BULGER.
Sir, I apologized.
#LEGGATT.
Confound your apology! I was sound asleep.
#BULGER.
You are a nice roommate. The landlord was right when he said you were.
#LEGGATT.
I beg your pardon, stranger. I wasn’t quite polite.
#BULGER.
Don’t mention it. My name is Bulger.
#LEGGATT.
And mine is Leggatt.
#BULGER.
I’m very sorry I disturbed you. I had just rung the bell and was waiting.
#LEGGATT.
That bell hasn’t been connected with the office for a year.
#BULGER.
Oh, what a hotel!
#LEGGATT.
When I want anything I just throw a pop bottle down to the right. It’ll break at the office door and rouse the landlord.
#BULGER.
By George! It takes a literary man, after all, for ideas.
#LEGGATT.
You’ll find some empty pop bottles in the closet. I keep them for that purpose—and the cats.
#BULGER.
I’ll try it. Did you say to the right?
#LEGGATT.
Yes, you can see the glass door if you look out. Hit the pavement so the bottle will crash.
#BULGER.
What a crash for one bottle. I guess that will fetch him.
#LEGGATT.
Now you have done it.
#BULGER.
Done what?
#LEGGATT.
You’ve broken the glass of the hot bed and the tomato plants will all freeze. You threw the wrong way.
#BULGER.
You said to the right.
#LEGGATT.
I meant to my right.
#BULGER.
Well, I’ll be everlastingly—
#LEGGATT.
Hold on, Mr. Bulger, it isn’t worth swearing about. It’s of no consequence. We shall have to wait a month longer for tomatoes, that’s all.
#BULGER.
I’m very sorry, Mr. Leggatt. I’ll turn in now and risk the damp sheets. I hope you will sleep.
#LEGGATT.
But I won’t. I’m in for a night of it.
#BULGER.
What is the cause of your insomnia?
#LEGGATT.
My book!
#BULGER.
Keep away from the races, why don’t you?
#LEGGATT.
I don’t mean that kind of a book. It is the great novel I am writing. It is killing me.
#BULGER.
Ah! When are you going to die?
#LEGGATT.
Die! I’m not going to die.
#BULGER.
You’ll make a long job of it in this town, it’s so slow.
#LEGGATT.
But I’m not here for that purpose, I say. What is your line, by the way?
#BULGER.
Line—cheapest way—I’ll ship your goods by Blue Line, same as before.
#LEGGATT.
Blue Line! Are you drunk? Hang it he’s asleep. I wish I could go to sleep like that. I envy a drummer. That infernal cat again! That settles it! I shant sleep a wink to - night. I’ll read, I guess. Where is that book? This book is simply drivel, such character drawing. There are no great novelists anymore except myself and Tolstoi. That fellow has a wretched style. His cacophony is terrible. The true test of good writing is to read it aloud. All stuff, the poorest kind of slush. I can’t stand any more of that.
#BULGER.
What was that? Heh? Leggatt?
#LEGGATT.
Only my cane, sir. I’m very sorry.
#BULGER.
So am I.
#LEGGATT.
Ah, then we agree. Will you join me in a pipe since you are awake? pipe at midnight! Well, you are cool!
#LEGGATT.
No, I’m not. I am on the contrary slightly feverish.
#BULGER.
Your proposition is cool enough. Smoke at this hour!
#LEGGATT.
I find it soothing. I cultivate repose of mind. It isn’t what we are, you know, in this world but how we like the situation. To like what we can’t mend is the true philosophy.
#BULGER.
Philosophy be blowed! This is a situation that I don’t like.
#LEGGATT.
I can’t say that I actually enjoy it but since—
#BULGER.
Oh those infernal cats. I’d like to murder every cat in creation.
#LEGGATT.
Kindly throw a pop bottle. Straight ahead this time over the shed.
#BULGER.
Throw it yourself.
#LEGGATT.
It was only a suggestion to be acted on or not at your discretion.
#BULGER.
I’d as soon have a room over a boiler shop as in this infernal little hotel. First - class—oh, what a liar this landlord is.
#LEGGATT.
My dear sir, your attitude toward Boniface is hardly justifiable. Landlords indulge in hyperbole.
#BULGER.
Hyperbole! What is that?
#LEGGATT.
It is the faculty of not letting a statement lack strength.
#BULGER.
Well, I must say this landlord’s statements are very robust.
#LEGGATT.
Neatly put, Bulger. I believe you cultivate literature yourself. You should at any rate. Literature—
#BULGER.
Literature be d—d.
#LEGGATT.
My dear sir, you wont sleep at all if you go on at that rate. Since you decline to join me in a pipe let me read a chapter of Squibbs’ last novel to you; that’ll do the business.
#BULGER.
Read Squibbs to me! At midnight, in a strange hotel! Preposterous!
#LEGGATT.
He is very soothing.
#BULGER.
I wont have it
#LEGGATT.
I’m very sorry. I’ll have to read all to myself.
#BULGER.
Are you going to read?
#LEGGATT.
I am.
#BULGER.
And keep that candle burning?
#LEGGATT.
Certainly! I don’t read in the dark. I haven’t cat’s eyes.
#BULGER.
Really, I say—do you know that I have a call for the three o’clock train?
#LEGGATT.
Don’t worry about it, Bulger. I shall be awake and I’ll call you promptly. Will 2:45 be about right?
#BULGER.
That man is crazy. I’ll never get a wink of sleep here. There’s a sofa in the hall, I’ll try that. Next time I come to this town I’ll stop at the roundhouse for a quiet place.
#LEGGATT.
I am disappointed in him. I thought his nerves were sound. He’ll break down if he travels long. He’ll catch cold in the hallway, I’m afraid. My sleepy spell has come on. I didn’t expect it till four o’clock. I believe I shall not pass a white night, as the French say, after all.
#LANDLORD.
Bulger is a strange man. Now, why did he leave his bed and take that sofa in the hall? He’s the hardest customer to please that comes this way. Doesn’t like cats, finicky about drafts, always sends his steak back, objects to two in a room. I s’pose two in a bed ’ud set ’im crazy. There aint a steadier, nicer man in the house than Mr. Leggatt. Where shall I put that Dutchman? The sofa was the last thing. Why, here, of course. I’ll just make up the bed! There, he’ll not notice it has been slept in.
#LANDLORD.
Quietly! There’s a man asleep there.
#SCHNELL.
Oh, dis vas a touble room alretty?
#LANDLORD.
Yes.
#SCHNELL.
Mit single petts. Lantlort, vas dot man safe?
#LANDLORD.
Perfectly safe.
#SCHNELL.
Vel, I mean vas I safe? I know he was safe, alretty.
#LANDLORD.
Why, he’s the peacefulest man in the town. He’s a littery chap.
#SCHNELL.
Littery man! Vat was dot?
#LANDLORD.
He writes books.
#SCHNELL.
Oh, ya, a pookkeeper.
#LANDLORD.
No, he writes for the magazines.
#SCHNELL.
Mackaseens! Ya, powter mackaseens. Ya, ya, dot bin all right. I kess, he wont plow up.
#LANDLORD.
Your name is Schnell, I believe.
#SCHNELL.
Ya! Gus Schnell, of Schnell oont Augenblick.
#LANDLORD.

#SCHNELL.
Sauerkraut oont weinerwurst.
#LANDLORD.
Any call?
#SCHNELL.
Ya, by de Cherman saloons.
#LANDLORD.
I mean shall I call you in the morning?
#SCHNELL.
Yoost leaf me alone till I shleeps out.
#SCHNELL.
Dot man was a goot shleeper, alretty. I hope he ton’t shnore sometimes. Dot man shleep like one little papy. Dunder! dot pett vas warm alretty. Dere moost pe a furnace oonter dot pett. I feels vint.

I yoost shleep in my clodings, I take no shances mit dot preeze plowin. Ach, I forcot to put dot candle out. I plieve I can reach him.
#LEGGATT.
What’s that? Where’s my pistol?
#SCHNELL.
Gott in himmel, ton’t shoot.
#LEGGATT.
Well, what ails you now?
#SCHNELL.
Nodings. I yoost fell out py de pett.
#LEGGATT.
You have disturbed me again! Why in thunder can’t you go to sleep?
#SCHNELL.
Vel, vy tont you gif me some dime alretty? I yoost cot in mine pett, two tree minutes foreby.
#LEGGATT.
That’s a strange voice. Bulger— Bulger—Great heavens! has Bulger been murdered? This comes of putting strangers in the same room. What ails the infernal matches! That isn’t Bulger. Where can Bulger be! That’s a burglar, I’ll bet. I’ll have a crack at him if he resists. Hello there, you!
#SCHNELL.
Vas? Dutchman! Heh, you fellow! Sit up or I’ll shoot.
#SCHNELL.
Mine Gott, meester ton’t shoot! Vat in himmel you want alretty yet?
#LEGGATT.
Who are you? Where is Bulger?
#SCHNELL.
Pulcher! I ton’t know Pulcher. Gott in himmel, put away dot pistol down.
#LEGGATT.
Who are you?
#SCHNELL.
Put dot bistol town. It goes off meppe.
#LEGGATT.
What are you doing here?
#SCHNELL.
Shleeping.
#LEGGATT.
Well, why in the dickens don’t you sleep then? Another man in my room! The landlord is drunk again. He’ll have the whole town in here before morning. Why don’t you go to bed?
#SCHNELL.
Ya, I coes right away. Mine frent.
#LEGGATT.
Well?
#SCHNELL.
Dot lantlort sait you vas a beaceful chentleman. I vas beaceful too oont I vants no more misdakes apout purglars oont bistols. My name vas Schnell, of Schnell oont Augenblick, wholesalers mit sauerkraut. Dat’s my cart.
#LEGGATT.
Confound it man, will you go to bed?
#SCHNELL.
Ya! Ya! He vas not a pit sociable.
#LEGGATT.
And look here, Mr. Wagonblock—
#SCHNELL.
Nine, Schnell! of te firm—
#LEGGATT.
Well, Snell then; you’d better keep pretty quiet. If this racket continues much longer I’ll miss my four o’clock sleeping spell. Now I wont be disturbed.
#SCHNELL.
Ya! Ya! Oh, dem cats! I was afraid of dot beaceful littery chap. He might shoot if he hears dem cats. Vell, I ton’t schleep, dot’s sure, alretty. Dot man was tangerous. I yoost dries to ket a nap by der office.
#LEGGATT.
More noise, somewhere, and I was just going—
#BULGER.
This night will be worse on me than a week’s sickness. I’ll have to take another liver pill. If I had a keg of powder under this old hotel I’d blow it to Kingdom - come, landlord, cats and all. But I mustn’t wake that author or he’ll want to read Squibbs’ novel to me. He’s had a good sleep. I’ve caught cold in that hall. It was like the Cave of the Winds. Why, that bed is warm yet. That’s very strange! The room is as cold as a barn. There’s no blanket here either. I left that in the hall. If I close that window may be I can get along. I’ll wake everybody in the house probably.
#LEGGATT.
What’s that? Who’s there? Hey there! Say! It’s that Dutchman again! He’s worse than Bulger was. Fallen out of that rickety old bed again, I suppose. If he’d only break his neck! Why, he isn’t there. Now, that’s odd! Both gone! A good riddance. I may catch my four o’clock turn yet. My watch! I’ll bet that Dutchman was a thief in disguise. No, it is there all right. I have nothing else to steal. I’m an author. He wouldn’t take Squibbs’ novel. No, nobody would run away with Squibbs. 2:45! It’s just time for Bulger’s train. What’s that? I surely heard a voice. Some one is concealed somewhere. I’ll call the landlord. No bell. I’ll catch cold if I get up to throw a pop bottle. I guess I’ll just fire the pistol. There! I guess that’ll fetch him. I’ll give him a piece of my mind. When I took this room I gave him the privilege of putting in a quiet party occasionally. Quiet! This has been a delightfully quiet night.
#LANDLORD.
Great heavens! Where was that shot?
#SCHNELL.
Himmel! He sound like a cannon. I joomp out o’ my schleep ten feet alretty.
#LANDLORD.
Where was it? The house will be in an uproar. Leggatt, why don’t you speak?
#LEGGATT.
I will speak. Landlord, it is my deliberate opinion that you keep the worst hotel that I ever saw.
#LANDLORD.
That’s a slander, strictly first - class! But the shot?
#LEGGATT.
In the absence of a bell the shot was simply to call you.
#LANDLORD.
Why, you don’t mean to say—
#LEGGATT.
That’s just what I mean to say. You were to put only quiet people in here.
#LANDLORD.
Bulger is all right. Best man on the road.
#LEGGATT.
He has softening of the brain.
#LANDLORD.
Impossible! Bulger is one of the best salesmen on the road.
#LEGGATT.
I’ve had enough of him. I think he’s crazy.
#LANDLORD.
Nonsense! His head is as level as—as mine.
#LEGGATT.
I wont dispute that!
#LANDLORD.
And you mean you fired a pistol and alarmed the whole house just to tell me this.
#LEGGATT.
I’m not done yet. Next thing you bring in an idiotic Dutchman—
#SCHNELL.
Vy, you rascal! dot is me.
#LEGGATT.
Allow me, Wagonblock. I’m talking to the landlord.
#LANDLORD.
Let up and go to sleep. You’ll be all right in the morning. Where is Bulger? It’s train time.
#LEGGATT.
Bulger! What do I know about Bulger? Get out now and leave me alone.
#LANDLORD.
But Bulger— Say, Leggatt!
#SCHNELL.
I tink dot littery chap haf kilt Pulcher.
#LANDLORD.
What? Produce Bulger. The shot—Bulger. Have you murdered him?
#LEGGATT.
I’m ready to murder somebody.
#LANDLORD.
Where is Bulger?
#BULGER.
Here he is! And let me add to what that literary man says. I thought he could use words better in such a case than a plain drummer, but he isn’t in it. Of all the noisy, windy, ill - kept, bad - smelling, disreputable , disorderly, rag - tag - and - bob - tail hotels in creation—
#SCHNELL.
Mine Gott!
#LANDLORD.
Hold on, sir. You’re going too far.
#BULGER.
I’ll go farther next trip. I’ll go to the next town.
#LANDLORD.
Your bill is ready.
#BULGER.
Bill! bill!
#LANDLORD.
I said bill.
#LEGGATT.
Bulger, you’ll miss your train if you stand there quarreling. Now clear out, all of you, or I’ll miss my 4 o’clock sleep. I almost feel as if I should miss it after this. Hi there, landlord, don’t leave that Dutchman here.
#SCHNELL.
Tutchman! dat was me—Mine frent, I was no Tutchman, I was Cherman oont—
#LEGGATT.
Get out before I commit murder. A first - class quiet hotel! Oh!
