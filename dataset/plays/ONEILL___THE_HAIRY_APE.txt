We lives in 'ell, Comrades - and right enough we'll die in it. And who's ter blame, I arsks yer? We ain't. We wasn't born this rotten way. All men is born free and ekal. That's in the bleedin' Bible, maties. But what d'they care for the Bible - them lazy, bloated swine what travels first cabin? Them's the ones. They dragged us down 'til we're on'y wage slaves in the bowels of a bloody ship, sweatin', burnin' up, eatin' coal dust! Hit's them's ter blame - the damned capitalist clarss!

One of us guys could clean up de whole mob wit one mit. Put one of 'em down here for one watch in de stokehole, what'd happen? Dey'd carry him off on a stretcher. Dem boids don't amount to nothin'. Dey're just baggage. Who makes dis old tub run? Ain't it us guys? Well den, we belong, don't we? We belong and dey don't. Dat's all. As for dis bein' hell - aw, nuts! Yuh lost your noive, dat's what. Dis is a man's job, get me? It belongs. It runs dis tub. No stiffs need apply. But yuh're a stiff, see? Yuh're yellow, dat's you.

Righto! man's job! Talk is cheap, Long. He never could hold up his end. Divil take him! Yank's right. We make it go. Py Gott, Yank say right ting! We don't need noone cryin' over us. Makin' speeches. Throw him out! Yellow! Chuck him overboard! I'll break his jaw for him!
#YANK.
Aw, take it easy. Leave him alone. He ain't woith a punch. Drink up. Here's how, whoever owns dis.
#PADDY.
We belong to this, you're saying? We make the ship to go, you're saying? Yerra then, that Almighty God have pity on us! Oh, to be back in the fine days of my youth, ochone! Oh, there was fine beautiful ships them days - clippers wid tall masts touching the sky - fine strong men in them - men that was sons of the sea as if 'twas the mother that bore them. Oh, the clean skins of them, and the clear eyes, the straight backs and full chests of them! Brave men they was, and bold men surely! We'd be sailing out, bound down round the Horn maybe. We'd be making sail in the dawn, with a fair breeze, singing a chanty song wid no care to it. And astern the land would be sinking low and dying out, but we'd give it no heed but a laugh, and never a look behind. For the day that was, was enough, for we was free men - and I'm thinking 'tis only slaves do be giving heed to the day that's gone or the day to come - until they're old like me. Oh, to be scudding south again wid the power of the Trade Wind driving her on steady through the nights and the days! Full sail on her! Nights and days! Nights when the foam of the wake would be flaming wid fire, when the sky'd be blazing and winking wid stars. Or the full of the moon maybe. Then you'd see her driving through the gray night, her sails stretching aloft all silver and white, not a sound on the deck, the lot of us dreaming dreams, till you'd believe 'twas no real ship at all you was on but a ghost ship like the Flying Dutchman they say does be roaming the seas forevermore widout touching a port. And there was the days, too. A warm sun on the clean decks. Sun warming the blood of you, and wind over the miles of shiny green ocean like strong drink to your lungs. Work - aye, hard work - but who'd mind that at all? Sure, you worked under the sky and 'twas work wid skill and daring to it. And wid the day done, in the dog watch, smoking me pipe at ease, the lookout would be raising land maybe, and we'd see the mountains of South Americy wid the red fire of the setting sun painting their white tops and the clouds floating by them! Yerra, what's the use of talking? 'Tis a dead man's whisper. 'Twas them days men belonged to ships, not now. 'Twas them days a ship was part of the sea, and a man was part of a ship, and the sea joined all together and made it one. Is it one wid this you'd be, Yank - black smoke from the funnels smudging the sea, smudging the decks - the bloody engines pounding and throbbing and shaking - wid divil a sight of sun or a breath of clean air - choking our lungs wid coal dust - breaking our backs and hearts in the hell of the stokehole - feeding the bloody furnace - feeding our lives along wid the coal, I'm thinking - caged in by steel from a sight of the sky like bloody apes in the Zoo! Ho - ho, divil mend you! Is it to belong to that you're wishing? Is it a flesh and blood wheel of the engines you'd be?
#YANK.
Sure ting! Dat's me! What about it?
#PADDY.
Me time is past due. That a great wave wid sun in the heart of it may sweep me over the side sometime I'd be dreaming of the days that's gone!
#YANK.
Aw, yuh crazy Mick! Aw, take it easy. Yuh're aw right, at dat. Yuh're bugs, dat's all - nutty as a cuckoo. All dat tripe yuh been pullin' - Aw, dat's all right. On'y it's dead, get me? Yuh don't belong no more, see. Yuh don't get de stuff. Yuh're too old. But aw say, come up for air onct in a while, can't yuh? See what's happened since yuh croaked. Say! Sure! Sure I meant it! What de hell - Say, lemme talk! Hey! Hey, you old Harp! Hey, youse guys! Say, listen to me - wait a moment - I gotter talk, see. I belong and he don't. He's dead but I'm livin'. Listen to me! Sure I'm part of de engines! Why de hell not! Dey move, don't dey? Dey're speed, ain't dey? Dey smash trou, don't dey? Twenty - five knots a hour! Dat's goin' some! Dat's new stuff! Dat belongs! But him, he's too old. He gets dizzy. Say, listen. All dat crazy tripe about nights and days; all dat crazy tripe about stars and moons; all dat crazy tripe about suns and winds, fresh air and de rest of it - Aw hell, dat's all a dope dream! Hittin' de pipe of de past, dat's what he's doin'. He's old and don't belong no more. But me, I'm young! I'm in de pink! I move wit it! It, get me! I mean de ting dat's de guts of all dis. It ploughs trou all de tripe he's been sayin'. It blows dat up! It knocks dat dead! It slams dat off en de face of de oith! It, get me! De engines and de coal and de smoke and all de rest of it! He can't breathe and swallow coal dust, but I kin, see? Dat's fresh air for me! Dat's food for me! I'm new, get me? Hell in de stokehole? Sure! It takes a man to work in hell. Hell, sure, dat's my fav'rite climate. I eat it up! I git fat on it! It's me makes it hot! It's me makes it roar! It's me makes it move! Sure, on'y for me everyting stops. It all goes dead, get me? De noise and smoke and all de engines movin' de woild, dey stop. Dere ain't nothin' no more! Dat's what I'm sayin'. Everyting else dat makes de woild move, somep'n makes it move. It can't move witout somep'n else, see? Den yuh get down to me. I'm at de bottom, get me! Dere ain't nothin' foither. I'm de end! I'm de start! I start somep'n and de woild moves! It - dat's me! - de new dat's moiderin' de old! I'm de ting in coal dat makes it boin; I'm steam and oil for de engines; I'm de ting in noise dat makes yuh hear it; I'm smoke and express trains and steamers and factory whistles; I'm de ting in gold dat makes it money! And I'm what makes iron into steel! Steel, dat stands for de whole ting! And I'm steel - steel - steel! I'm de muscles in steel, de punch behind it! Slaves, hell! We run de whole woiks. All de rich guys dat tink dey're somep'n, dey ain't nothin'! Dey don't belong. But us guys, we're in de move, we're at de bottom, de whole ting is us! Hey, youse guys, take it easy! Wait a moment! De nutty Harp is sayin' someth'n.
#PADDY.
Ho - ho - ho - ho - ho -
#YANK.
Aw! Look out who yuh're givin' the bark!
#YANK.
Dat's de stuff! Now yuh're gettin' wise to somep'n. Care for nobody, dat's de dope! To hell wit 'em all! And nix on nobody else carin'. I kin care for myself, get me! Our watch, yuh old Harp! Come on down in hell. Eat up de coal dust. Drink in de heat. It's it, see! Act like yuh liked it, yuh better - or croak yuhself.
#PADDY.
To the divil wid it! I'll not report this watch. Let thim log me and be damned. I'm no slave the like of you. I'll be sittin' here at me ease, and drinking, and thinking, and dreaming dreams.
#YANK.
Tinkin' and dreamin', what'll that get yuh? What's tinkin' got to do wit it? We move, don't we? Speed, ain't it? Fog, dat's all you stand for. But we drive trou dat, don't we? We split dat up and smash trou - twenty - five knots a hour! Aw, yuh make me sick! Yuh don't belong!
#MILDRED.
How the black smoke swirls back against the sky! Is it not beautiful?
#AUNT.
I dislike smoke of any kind.
#MILDRED.
My great - grandmother smoked a pipe - a clay pipe.
#AUNT.
Vulgar!
#MILDRED.
She was too distant a relative to be vulgar. Time mellows pipes.
#AUNT.
Did the sociology you took up at college teach you that - to play the ghoul on every possible occasion, excavating old bones? Why not let your great - grandmother rest in her grave?
#MILDRED.
With her pipe beside her - puffing in Paradise.
#AUNT.
Yes, you are a natural born ghoul. You are even getting to look like one, my dear.
#MILDRED.
I detest you, Aunt. Do you know what you remind me of? Of a cold pork pudding against a background of linoleum tablecloth in the kitchen of a - but the possibilities are wearisome.
#AUNT.
Merci for your candor. But since I am and must be your chaperone - in appearance, at least - let us patch up some sort of armed truce. For my part you are quite free to indulge any pose of eccentricity that beguiles you - as long as you observe the amenities -
#MILDRED.
The inanities?
#AUNT.
After exhausting the morbid thrills of social service work on New York's East Side - how they must have hated you, by the way, the poor that you made so much poorer in their own eyes! - you are now bent on making your slumming international. Well, I hope Whitechapel will provide the needed nerve tonic. Do not ask me to chaperone you there, however. I told your father I would not. I loathe deformity. We will hire an army of detectives and you may investigate everything - they allow you to see.
#MILDRED.
Please do not mock at my attempts to discover how the other half lives. Give me credit for some sort of groping sincerity in that at least. I would like to help them. I would like to be some use in the world. Is it my fault I don't know how? I would like to be sincere, to touch life somewhere. But I'm afraid I have neither the vitality nor integrity. All that was burnt out in our stock before I was born. Grandfather's blast furnaces, flaming to the sky, melting steel, making millions - then father keeping those home fires burning, making more millions - and little me at the tail - end of it all. I'm a waste product in the Bessemer process - like the millions. Or rather, I inherit the acquired trait of the by - product, wealth, but none of the energy, none of the strength of the steel that made it. I am sired by gold and darned by it, as they say at the race track - damned in more ways than one,
#AUNT.
You seem to be going in for sincerity to - day. It isn't becoming to you, really - except as an obvious pose. Be as artificial as you are, I advise. There's a sort of sincerity in that, you know. And, after all, you must confess you like that better.
#MILDRED.
Yes, I suppose I do. Pardon me for my outburst. When a leopard complains of its spots, it must sound rather grotesque. Purr, little leopard. Purr, scratch, tear, kill, gorge yourself and be happy - only stay in the jungle where your spots are camouflage. In a cage they make you conspicuous.
#AUNT.
I don't know what you are talking about.
#MILDRED.
It would be rude to talk about anything to you. Let's just talk. Well, thank goodness, it's about time for them to come for me. That ought to give me a new thrill, Aunt.
#AUNT.
You don't mean to say you're really going? The dirt - the heat must be frightful -
#MILDRED.
Grandfather started as a puddler. I should have inherited an immunity to heat that would make a salamander shiver. It will be fun to put it to the test.
#AUNT.
But don't you have to have the captain's - or someone's - permission to visit the stokehole?
#MILDRED.
I have it - both his and the chief engineer's. Oh, they didn't want to at first, in spite of my social service credentials. They didn't seem a bit anxious that I should investigate how the other half lives and works on a ship. So I had to tell them that my father, the president of Nazareth Steel, chairman of the board of directors of this line, had told me it would be all right.
#AUNT.
He didn't.
#MILDRED.
How naive age makes one! But I said he did, Aunt. I even said he had given me a letter to them - which I had lost. And they were afraid to take the chance that I might be lying. So it's ho! for the stokehole. The second engineer is to escort me. It's time. And here he comes, I think.
#SECOND ENGINEER.
Miss Douglas?
#MILDRED.
Yes. Are we all ready to start?
#SECOND ENGINEER.
In just a second, ma'am. I'm waiting for the Fourth. He's coming along.
#MILDRED.
You don't care to shoulder this responsibility alone, is that it?
#SECOND ENGINEER.
Two are better than one. A fine day we're having.
#MILDRED.
Is it? nice warm breeze -
#MILDRED.
It feels cold to me.
#SECOND ENGINEER.
But it's hot enough in the sun -
#MILDRED.
Not hot enough for me. I don't like Nature. I was never athletic.
#SECOND ENGINEER.
Well, you'll find it hot enough where you're going.
#MILDRED.
Do you mean hell?
#SECOND ENGINEER.
Ho - ho! No, I mean the stokehole.
#MILDRED.
My grandfather was a puddler. He played with boiling steel.
#SECOND ENGINEER.
Is that so? Hum, you'll excuse me, ma'am, but are you intending to wear that dress.
#MILDRED.
Why not?
#SECOND ENGINEER.
You'll likely rub against oil and dirt. It can't be helped.
#MILDRED.
It doesn't matter. I have lots of white dresses.
#SECOND ENGINEER.
I have an old coat you might throw over -
#MILDRED.
I have fifty dresses like this. I will throw this one into the sea when I come back. That ought to wash it clean, don't you think?
#SECOND ENGINEER.
There's ladders to climb down that are none too clean - and dark alleyways -
#MILDRED.
I will wear this very dress and none other.
#SECOND ENGINEER.
No offence meant. It's none of my business. I was only warning you -
#MILDRED.
Warning? That sounds thrilling.
#SECOND ENGINEER.
- There's the Fourth now. He's waiting for us. If you'll come -
#MILDRED.
Go on. I'll follow you. An oaf - but a handsome, virile oaf.
#AUNT.
Poser!
#MILDRED.
Take care. He said there were dark alleyways -
#AUNT.
Poser!
#MILDRED.
You are right. But would that my millions were not so anemically chaste!
#AUNT.
Yes, for a fresh pose I have no doubt you would drag the name of Douglas in the gutter!
#MILDRED.
From which it sprang. Good - by, Aunt. Don't pray too hard that I may fall into the fiery furnace.
#AUNT.
Poser!
#MILDRED.
Old hag!
#AUNT.
I said poser!
#PADDY.
Yerra, will this divil's own watch nivir end? Me back is broke. I'm destroyed entirely.

Love, hell! Hate, dat's what. I've fallen in hate, get me?
#PADDY.
'Twould take a wise man to tell one from the other. But I'm telling you it's love that's in it. Sure what else but love for us poor bastes in the stokehole would be bringing a fine lady, dressed like a white quane, down a mile of ladders and steps to be havin' a look at us?
#LONG.
Hinsultin' us! Hinsultin' us, the bloody cow! And them bloody engineers! What right 'as they got to be exhibitin' us 's if we was bleedin' monkeys in a menagerie? Did we sign for hinsults to our dignity as 'onest workers? Is that in the ship's articles? You kin bloody well bet it ain't! But I knows why they done it. I arsked a deck steward 'o she was and 'e told me. 'Er old man's a bleedin' millionaire, a bloody Capitalist! 'E's got enuf bloody gold to sink this bleedin' ship! 'E makes arf the bloody steel in the world! 'E owns this bloody boat! And you and me, comrades, we're 'is slaves! And the skipper and mates and engineers, they're 'is slaves!

#PADDY.
And there she was standing behind us, and the Second pointing at us like a man you'd hear in a circus would be saying: In this cage is a queerer kind of baboon than ever you'd find in darkest Africy. We roast them in their own sweat - and be damned if you won't hear some of thim saying they like it!
#YANK.
Aw!
#PADDY.
And there was Yank roarin' curses and turning round wid his shovel to brain her - and she looked at him, and him at her -
#YANK.
She was all white. I tought she was a ghost. Sure.
#PADDY.
'Twas love at first sight, divil a doubt of it! If you'd seen the endearin' look on her pale mug when she shrivelled away with her hands over her eyes to shut out the sight of him! Sure, 'twas as if she'd seen a great hairy ape escaped from the Zoo!
#YANK.
Aw!
#PADDY.
And the loving way Yank heaved his shovel at the skull of her, only she was out the door! 'Twas touching, I'm telling you! It put the touch of home, swate home in the stokehole.
#YANK.
Aw, choke dat off, see!
#PADDY.
And her grabbin' at the Second's arm for protection. Kiss me, Engineer dear, for it's dark down here and me old man's in Wall Street making money! Hug me tight, darlin', for I'm afeerd in the dark and me mother's on deck makin' eyes at the skipper!
#YANK.
Say! What yuh tryin' to do, kid me, yuh old Harp?
#PADDY.
Divil a bit! Ain't I wishin' myself you'd brained her?
#YANK.
I'll brain her! I'll brain her yet, wait 'n' see! Say, is dat what she called me - a hairy ape?
#PADDY.
She looked it at you if she didn't say the word itself.
#YANK.
Hairy ape, huh? Sure! Dat's de way she looked at me, aw right. Hairy ape! So dat's me, huh? Yuh skinny tart! Yuh white - faced bum, yuh! I'll show yuh who's a ape! Say, youse guys. I was bawlin' him out for pullin' de whistle on us. You heard me. And den I seen youse lookin' at somep'n and I tought he'd sneaked down to come up in back of me, and I hopped round to knock him dead wit de shovel. And dere she was wit de light on her! Christ, yuh coulda pushed me over with a finger! I was scared, get me? Sure! I tought she was a ghost, see? She was all in white like dey wrap around stiffs. You seen her. Kin yuh blame me? She didn't belong, dat's what. And den when I come to and seen it was a real skoit and seen de way she was lookin' at me - like Paddy said - Christ, I was sore, get me? I don't stand for dat stuff from nobody. And I flung de shovel - on'y she'd beat it. I wished it'd banged her! I wished it'd knocked her block off!

No chance, Yank. You scared her out of a year's growth.
#YANK.
I scared her? Why de hell should I scare her? Who de hell is she? Ain't she de same as me? Hairy ape, huh? I'll show her I'm better'n her, if she on'y knew it. I belong and she don't, see!

Yuh could see de bones trough 'em. And her mush, dat was dead white, too. And her eyes, dey was like dey'd seen a ghost. Me, dat was! Sure! Hairy ape! Ghost, huh? Look at dat arm! I coulda took her wit dat, wit' just my little finger even, and broke her in two. Say, who is dat skoit, huh? What is she? What's she come from? Who made her?

Let her come down again and I'll fling her in de furnace! She'll move den! She won't shiver at nothin', den! Speed, dat'll be her! She'll belong den!

#YANK.
Yuh tink I made her sick, too, do yuh? Just lookin' at me, huh? Hairy ape, huh? I'll fix her! I'll tell her where to git off! She'll git down on her knees and take it back or I'll bust de face offen her! I'll find yuh! I'm comin', d'yuh hear? I'll fix yuh, God damn yuh!

When dey got trough dere wasn't a chair or table wit a leg under it. Or else dey bot' jumped on me for somep'n. Dat was where I loined to take punishment. I'm a chip offen de old block, get me?
#LONG.
Did yer old man follow the sea?
#YANK.
Naw. Worked along shore. I runned away when me old lady croaked wit de tremens. I helped at truckin' and in de market. Den I shipped in de stokehole. Sure. Dat belongs. De rest was nothin'.

#LONG.
Not bad? Well, we pays for it wiv our bloody sweat, if yer wants to know!
#YANK.

Yer wants to get back at her, don't yer? That's what yer been saying' every bloomin' 'our since she hinsulted yer.
#YANK.

Dat woulda made me even, see? But no chanct. Dere was a whole army of plain clothes bulls around. Dey spotted me and gimme de bum's rush. I never seen her. But I'll git square wit her yet, you watch!

#LONG.
Ain't that why I brought yer up 'ere - to show yer? Yer been lookin' at this 'ere 'ole affair wrong. Yer been actin' an' talkin' 's if it was all a bleedin' personal matter between yer and that bloody cow. I wants to convince yer she was on'y a representative of 'er clarss. I wants to awaken yer bloody clarss consciousness. Then yer'll see it's 'er clarss yer've got to fight, not 'er alone. There's a 'ole mob of 'em like 'er, Gawd blind 'em!
#YANK.

#LONG.
Yer'll see 'em in arf a mo', when that church lets out. Blimey! Look at that, will yer? Just look at this 'ere bloomin' mess! Just look at it! Look at the bleedin' prices on 'em - more'n our 'old bloody stokehole makes in ten voyages sweatin' in 'ell! And they - her and her bloody clarss - buys 'em for toys to dangle on 'em! One of these 'ere would buy scoff for a starvin' family for a year!

#YANK.
Take a slant at dat! Give it de once - over! Monkey fur - two t'ousand bucks! Is dat straight goods - monkey fur? What de hell - ?

#YANK.
Trowin' it up in my face! Christ! I'll fix her!
#LONG.

#YANK.
Naw. What is it? gang of blokes - a tough gang. I been readin' about 'em to - day in the paper. The guard give me the Sunday Times. There's a long spiel about 'em. It's from a speech made in the Senate by a guy named Senator Queen. Wait'll I see if I got light enough and I'll read you. Listen. "There is a menace existing in this country to - day which threatens the vitals of our fair Republic - as foul a menace against the very life - blood of the American Eagle as was the foul conspiracy of Cataline against the eagles of ancient Rome!"
#HANK.
Aw hell! Tell him to salt de tail of dat eagle!
#HANK.
"I refer to that devil's brew of rascals, jailbirds, murderers and cutthroats who libel all honest working men by calling themselves the Industrial Workers of the World; but in the light of their nefarious plots, I call them the Industrious WRECKERS of the World!"
#YANK.
Wreckers, dat's de right dope! Dat belongs! Me for dem!

#HANK.
Democracy, hell! Give him the boid, fellers - the raspberry!
#HANK.
Ssshh! "Like Cato I say to this senate, the I. W.
#WELBY.
must be destroyed! For they represent an ever - present dagger pointed at the heart of the greatest nation the world has ever known, where all men are born free and equal, with equal opportunities to all, where the Founding Fathers have guaranteed to each one happiness, where Truth, Honor, Liberty, Justice, and the Brotherhood of Man are a religion absorbed with one's mother's milk, taught at our father's knee, sealed, signed, and stamped upon in the glorious Constitution of these United States!"
#VOICES.

#HANK.
Ssshh! Here's where he gits down to cases on the Wobblies. "They plot with fire in one hand and dynamite in the other. They stop not before murder to gain their ends, nor at the outraging of defenceless womanhood. They would tear down society, put the lowest scum in the seats of the mighty, turn Almighty God's revealed plan for the world topsy - turvy, and make of our sweet and lovely civilization a shambles, a desolation where man, God's masterpiece, would soon degenerate back to the ape!"
#HANK.
Hey, you guy. There's your ape stuff again.

Sow the seed, only go about it right. Don't get caught and fired. We got plenty out of work. What we need is men who can hold their jobs - and work for us at the same time.

No, by God, you're such a bonehead I'll bet you're in the Secret Service! Well, you dirty spy, you rotten agent provocator, you can go back and tell whatever skunk is paying you blood - money for betraying your brothers that he's wasting his coin. You couldn't catch a cold. And tell him that all he'll ever get on us, or ever has got, is just his own sneaking plots that he's framed up to put us in jail. We are what our manifesto says we are, neither more or less - and we'll give him a copy of that any time he calls. And as for you - Oh, hell, what's the use of talking? You're a brainless ape.
#YANK.

Now I ain't steel, and de woild owns me. Aw, hell! I can't see - it's all dark, get me? It's all wrong! Say, youse up dere, Man in de Moon, yuh look so wise, gimme de answer, huh?

Ain't we both members of de same club - de Hairy Apes? So yuh're what she seen when she looked at me, de white - faced tart! I was you to her, get me? On'y outa de cage - broke out - free to moider her, see? Sure! Dat's what she tought. She wasn't wise dat I was in a cage, too - worser'n yours - sure - a damn sight - 'cause you got some chanct to bust loose - but me - Aw, hell! It's all wrong, ain't it? I s'pose yuh wanter know what I'm doin' here, huh? I been warmin' a bench down to de Battery - ever since last night. Sure. I seen de sun come up. Dat was pretty, too - all red and pink and green. I was lookin' at de skyscrapers - steel - and all de ships comin' in, sailin' out, all over de oith - and dey was steel, too. De sun was warm, dey wasn't no clouds, and dere was a breeze blowin'. Sure, it was great stuff. I got it aw right - what Paddy said about dat bein' de right dope - on'y I couldn't get IN it, see? I couldn't belong in dat. It was over my head. And I kept tinkin' - and den I beat it up here to see what youse was like. And I waited till dey was all gone to git yuh alone. Say, how d'yuh feel sittin' in dat pen all de time, havin' to stand for 'em comin' and starin' at yuh - de white - faced, skinny tarts and de boobs what marry 'em - makin' fun of yuh, laughin' at yuh, gittin' scared of yuh - damn 'em! Sure! Dat's de way it hits me, too. On'y yuh're lucky, see? Yuh don't belong wit 'em and yuh know it. But me, I belong wit 'em - but I don't, see? Dey don't belong wit me, dat's what. Get me? Tinkin' is hard - It's dis way, what I'm drivin' at. Youse can sit and dope dream in de past, green woods, de jungle and de rest of it. Den yuh belong and dey don't. Den yuh kin laugh at 'em, see? Yuh're de champ of de woild. But me - I ain't got no past to tink in, nor nothin' dat's comin', on'y what's now - and dat don't belong. Sure, you're de best off! Yuh can't tink, can yuh? Yuh can't talk neider. But I kin make a bluff at talkin' and tinkin' - a'most git away wit it - a'most! - and dat's where de joker comes in. I ain't on oith and I ain't in heaven, get me? I'm in de middle tryin' to separate 'em, takin' all de woist punches from bot' of 'em. Maybe dat's what dey call hell, huh? But you, yuh're at de bottom. You belong! Sure! Yuh're de on'y one in de woild dat does, yuh lucky stiff! And dat's why dey gotter put yuh in a cage, see? Sure! Yuh get me. It beats it when you try to tink it or talk it - it's way down - deep - behind - you 'n' me we feel it. Sure! Bot' members of dis club! What de hell! T' hell wit it! A little action, dat's our meat! Dat belongs! Knock 'em down and keep bustin' 'em till dey croaks yuh wit a gat - wit steel! Sure! Are yuh game? Dey've looked at youse, ain't dey - in a cage? Wanter git even? Wanter wind up like a sport 'stead of croakin' slow in dere? Sure! Yuh're reg'lar! Yuh'll stick to de finish! Me 'n' you, huh? - bot' members of this club! We'll put up one last star bout dat'll knock 'em offen deir seats! Dey'll have to make de cages stronger after we're trou! Pardon from de governor! Step out and shake hands! I'll take yuh for a walk down Fif' Avenoo. We'll knock 'em offen de oith and croak wit de band playin'. Come on, Brother. Shake - de secret grip of our order. Hey, I didn't say, kiss me. Say - dey oughter match him - wit Zybszko. He got me, aw right. I'm trou. Even him didn't tink I belonged. Christ, where do I get off at? Where do I fit in? Aw, what de hell! No squakin', see! No quittin', get me! Croak wit your boots on! In de cage, huh? Ladies and gents, step forward and take a slant at de one and only - one and original - Hairy Ape from de wilds of -
