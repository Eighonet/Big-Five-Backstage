#THE CLERGYMAN.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here together in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is commended by God to be honorable among men, and therefore is not to be entered into inadvisedly or carelessly, or without due surgical precautions, but reverently, cleanly, sterilely, soberly, scientifically, and with the nearest practicable approach to bacteriological purity. Into this laudable and non - infectious state these two persons present come now to be joined and quarantined. If any man can show just cause, either clinically or microscopically, why they may not be safely sutured together, let him now come forward with his charts, slides and cultures, or else hereafter forever hold his peace.
#THE CLERGYMAN.
: I require and charge both of you, as ye will answer in the dreadful hour of autopsy, when the secrets of all lives shall be disclosed, that if either of you know of any lesion, infection, malaise, congenital defect, hereditary taint or other impediment, why ye may not be lawfully joined together in eugenic matrimony, ye do now confess it. For be ye well assured that if any persons are joined together otherwise than in a state of absolute chemical and bacteriological innocence, their marriage will be septic, unhygienic, pathogenic and toxic, and eugenically null and void.
#THE CLERGYMAN.

So much for the reading of the minutes. : Now for yours, my dear.
#THE CLERGYMAN.
Very good. Very creditable. You must see some good oculist about your astigmatism, my dear. Surely you want to avoid glasses. Come to my study on your return and I'll give you the name of a trustworthy man. And now let us proceed with the ceremony of marriage. : John, wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife, to live together in the holy state of eugenic matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort her, protect her from all protozoa and bacteria, and keep her in good health; and, forsaking all other, keep thee unto her only, so long as ye both shall live? If so, hold out your tongue.
#THE CLERGYMAN.
Fair. I have seen worse.... Do you smoke?
#THE BRIDEGROOM.
Not much.
#THE CLERGYMAN.
Well, how much?
#THE BRIDEGROOM.
Say ten cigarettes a day.
#THE CLERGYMAN.
And the stain noted on your right posterior phalanx by the learned medical examiners?
#THE BRIDEGROOM.
Well, say fifteen.
#THE CLERGYMAN.
Or twenty to be safe. Better taper off to ten. At all events, make twenty the limit. How about the booze?
#THE BRIDEGROOM.
Never!
#THE CLERGYMAN.
What! Never?
#THE BRIDEGROOM.
Well, never again!
#THE CLERGYMAN.
So they all say. The answer is almost part of the liturgy. But have a care, my dear fellow! The true eugenist eschews the wine cup. In every hundred children of a man who ingests one fluid ounce of alcohol a day, six will be left - handed, twelve will be epileptics and nineteen will suffer from adolescent albuminuria, with delusions of persecution.... Have you ever had anthrax?

Wilt them have this woman et cetera? Answer yes or no.
#THE BRIDEGROOM.
I will.
#THE CLERGYMAN.
Mary, wilt thou have this gentleman to be thy wedded husband, to live together in the holy state of aseptic matrimony? Wilt thou love him, serve him, protect him from all adulterated victuals, and keep him hygienically clothed; and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto him, so long as ye both shall live? If so -
#THE BRIDE.
I will.
#THE CLERGYMAN.
Not so fast! First, there is the little ceremony of the clinical thermometers. Open your mouth, my dear. Now hold it there while you count one hundred and fifty. And you, too. I had almost forgotten you.
#THE CLERGYMAN.
Ninety - nine point nine. Considering everything, not so bad. Ninety - eight point six. Exactly normal. Cool, collected, at ease. The classical self - possession of the party of the second part. And now, my dear, may I ask you to hold out your tongue?
#THE CLERGYMAN.
Perfect.... There; that will do. Put it back.... And now for a few questions - just a few. First, do you use opiates in any form?
#THE BRIDE.
No.

#THE CLERGYMAN.
What did your maternal grandfather die of?
#THE BRIDE.
Of chronic interstitial nephritis.
#THE CLERGYMAN.
Ah, our old friend Bright's! A typical case, I take, with the usual polyuria, oedema of the glottis, flame - shaped retinal hemorrhages and cardiac dilatation?
#THE BRIDE.
Exactly.
#THE CLERGYMAN.
And terminating, I suppose, with the classical uræmic symptoms - dyspnoea, convulsions, uræmic amaurosis, coma and collapse?
#THE BRIDE.
Including Cheyne - Stokes breathing.
#THE CLERGYMAN.
Ah, most interesting! A protean and beautiful malady! But at the moment, of course, we can't discuss it profitably. Perhaps later on.... Your father, I assume, is alive?
#THE BRIDE.
Yes.
#THE CLERGYMAN.
Well, then, let us proceed. Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?

#THE CLERGYMAN.
That is to say, you have had more than one child?
#THE BRIDE'S FATHER.
No.
#THE CLERGYMAN.
How sad! You will miss her!
#THE BRIDE'S FATHER.
One job like this is en -
#THE CLERGYMAN.
But let us proceed. The ceremony must not be lengthened unduly, however interesting. We now approach the benediction.
#THE CLERGYMAN.
Repeat after me: "I, John, take thee, Mary, to be my wedded and aseptic wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness, convalescence, relapse and health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part; and thereto I plight thee my troth."
#THE CLERGYMAN.
Repeat after me: "I, Mary, take thee, John, to be my aseptic and eugenic husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, to love, to cherish and to nurse, till death do us part; and thereto I give thee my troth."
#THE CLERGYMAN.
Repeat after me: "With this sterile ring I thee wed, and with all my worldly goods I thee endow."
#THE CLERGYMAN.
Those whom God hath joined together, let no pathogenic organism put asunder. Forasmuch as John and Mary have consented together in aseptic wedlock, and have witnessed the same by the exchange of certificates, and have given and pledged their troth, and have declared the same by giving and receiving an aseptic ring, I pronounce that they are man and wife. In the name of Mendel, of Galton, of Havelock Ellis and of David Starr Jordan. Amen.
