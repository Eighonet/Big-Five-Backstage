#DAVID.
Aw - but, Lizzie -
#LIZZIE.
It's nae use, feyther. I'm no' gaein' to gie in to the wean. Ye've been tellin' yer stories to him nicht after nicht for dear knows how long, and he's gettin' to expect them.
#DAVID.
Why should he no' expect them?
#LIZZIE.
It disna do for weans to count on things so. He's layin' up a sad disappointment for himself yin o' these days.
#DAVID.
He's gettin' a sad disappointment the noo. Och, come on, Lizzie. I'm no' gaein' to dee just yet, an' ye can break him off gradually when I begin to look like to.
#LIZZIE.
Who's talkin' o' yer deein', feyther?
#DAVID.
Ye were speakin' o' the disappointment he was layin' up for himself if he got to count on me -
#LIZZIE.
I wasna thinkin' o' yer deein', feyther - only - it's no guid for a bairn -
#DAVID.
Where's the harm in my giein' him a bit story before he gangs tae his bed?
#LIZZIE.
I'm no sayin' there's ony harm in it this yinst, feyther; but it's no richt to gae on nicht after nicht wi' never a break -
#DAVID.
Whit wey is it no richt if there's nae harm in it?
#LIZZIE.
It's giein' in to the wean.
#DAVID.
Whit wey should ye no' gie in to him if there's nae harm in it?
#LIZZIE.
Because it gets him into the habit.
#DAVID.
But why should he no' get into the habit if there's nae harm in it?
#LIZZIE.
Really, feyther, ye micht be a wean yerself, ye're that persistent.
#DAVID.
No, Lizzie, I'm no' persistent, I'm reasoning wi' ye. Ye said there was nae harm in my tellin' him a bit story, an' now ye say I'm not to because it'll get him into the habit; an' what I'm askin' ye is, where's the harm o' his gettin' into the habit if there's nae harm in it?
#LIZZIE.
Oh, aye; ye can be gey clever, twistin' the words in my mouth, feyther; but richt is richt, an' wrang's wrang, for all yer cleverness.
#DAVID.
I'm no bein' clever ava, Lizzie, - no' the noo, - I'm just tryin' to make ye see that, if ye admit there's nae harm in a thing, ye canna say there's ony harm in it, an' I'm wantin' to tell wee Alexander a bit story before he gangs to his bed.
#JOHN GALE.
Och, wumman -
#LIZZIE.
T'ts, John; ye'd gie in tae onybody if they were just persistent enough.
#JOHN GALE.
He's an auld man.
#LIZZIE.
I ken fine he's an auld man, John, and ye're a young yin, an' Alexander's gaein' to be anither, an' I'm a lone wumman among the lot o' ye, but I'm no' gaein' to gie in to -
#JOHN GALE.
Efter a', Lizzie, there's nae harm -
#LIZZIE.
Och, now you've stairted, have you? Harm. Harm. Harm. You're talkin' about harm, and I'm talking about richt an' wrang. You'd see your son grow up a drunken keelie, an' mebbe a thief an' a murderer, so long as you could say there was nae harm in it.
#DAVID.
But I cudna say there was nae harm in that, Lizzie, an' I wudna. Only when there's nae harm -
#LIZZIE.
Och. Are ye in yer bed yet, Alexander?
#DAVID.
She's no reasonable, ye ken, John; she disna argue fair. I'm no complaining o' her mither, but it's a wee thing hard that the only twa women I've known to be really chatty an' argumentative with should ha' been just like that. An' me that fond o' women's society.
#JOHN GALE.
They're all like it.
#DAVID.
I wudna go sae far as to say that, John. Ye see, I've only kent they twa to study carefully - an' it's no fair to judge the whole sex by just the twa examples, an' it were - But it's gey hard, an' I was wantin' to tell wee Alexander a special fine story the nicht. Aweel.
#JOHN GALE.
Mebbe the morn -
#DAVID.
If it's no richt the nicht, it'll no be richt the morn's nicht.
#JOHN GALE.
Ye canna say that, feyther. It wasna wrang last nicht.
#DAVID.
Mebbe it was, an' Lizzie had no' foun' it out.
#JOHN GALE.
Aw, noo, feyther, dinna get saurcastic.
#DAVID.
I canna help it. I'm black affrontit. I was wantin' to tell wee Alexander a special fine story the nicht, an' now here's Lizzie wi' her richt's richt an' wrang's wrang - Och, there's nae reason in the women.
#JOHN GALE.
We has to gie in to them though.
#DAVID.
Aye. That's why.
#DAVID.
Thank ye, John. Do ye hear him?
#JOHN GALE.
Who?
#DAVID.
Wee Alexander.
#JOHN GALE.
No.
#DAVID.
Greetin' his heart out.
#JOHN GALE.
Och, he's no greetin'. Lizzie's wi' him.
#DAVID.
I ken fine Lizzie's wi' him, but he's greetin' for a' her. He was wantin' to hear yon story o' the kelpies up to Cross Hill wi' the tram - Och.
#JOHN GALE.
It's gettin' dark gey early. We'll shin be haein' tea by the gas.
#DAVID.
Aye - There never was a female philosopher, ye ken, John.
#JOHN GALE.
Was there no'?
#DAVID.
No. An'there never will be! An' yet there's an' awful lot o' philosophy about women, John.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye?
#DAVID.
Och, aye. They're that unreasonable, an' yet ye canna reason them down; an' they're that weak, an' yet ye canna make them gie in tae ye. Of course, ye'll say ye canna reason doon a stane, or make a clod o' earth gie in tae ye.
#JOHN GALE.
Will I?
#DAVID.
Aye. An' ye'll be richt. But then I'll tell ye a stane will na answer ye back, an' a clod of earth will na try to withstand ye, so how can ye argue them down?
#JOHN GALE.
Ye canna.
#DAVID.
Richt! Ye canna! But a wumman will answer ye back, an' she will stand against ye, an' yet ye canna argue her down though ye have strength an' reason on your side an' she's talkin' naething but blether about richt's richt an' wrang's wrang, an' sendin' a poor bairn off t' his bed i' the yin room an' leavin' her auld feyther all alone by the fire in anither an' - ye ken - Philosophy -
#JOHN GALE.
Lizzie.
#JOHN GALE.
Yer feyther's greetin'.
#LIZZIE.
Och, I'm no heedin'! There's another wean in there greetin' too, an' I'm no heedin' him neither, an' he's greetin' twicet as loud as the auld yin.
#JOHN GALE.
Ye're heartless, wumman.
#LIZZIE.
No, I'm no' heartless, John; but there's too much heart in this family, an' someone's got to use their heid.
#LIZZIE.
I'm vexed ye should be disappointed, feyther, but ye see, don't ye -
#LIZZIE.
Mercy! The neighbors will think we're murderin' him.
#DAVID.
Ye hear that, John?
#JOHN GALE.
Whit?
#DAVID.
She's vexed I should be disappointed. The wumman thinks she's richt! Women always think they're richt - mebbe it's that that makes them that obstinate. She's feart o' the neighbors, though.
#JOHN GALE.
A' women are feart o' the neighbors.
#DAVID.
Puir wee man. I telt ye he was greetin', John. He's disappointed fine. D' ye ken whit I'm thinkin', John?
#JOHN GALE.
Whit?
#DAVID.
I'm thinkin' he's too young to get his ain way, an' I'm too auld, an' it's a fine thocht!
#JOHN GALE.
Aye?
#DAVID.
Aye. I never thocht of it before, but that's what it is. He's no' come to it yet, an' I'm past it. What's the most important thing in life, John?
#DAVID.
Ye ken perfectly well. What is it ye're wantin' a' the time?
#JOHN GALE.
Different things.
#DAVID.
Aye - different things! But ye want them a', do ye no'?
#JOHN GALE.
Aye.
#DAVID.
If ye had yer ain way ye'd hae them a', eh?
#JOHN GALE.
I wud that.
#DAVID.
Then is that no' what ye want: yer ain way?
#JOHN GALE.
Losh!
#DAVID.
That's what life is, John - gettin' yer ain way. First ye're born, an' ye canna dae anything but cry; but God's given yer mither ears an' ye get yer way by just cryin' for it. I ken that's no exactly in keeping with what I've been saying aboot Alexander - but a new - born bairnie's an awfu' delicate thing, an' the Lord gets it past its infancy by a dispensation of Providence very unsettling to oor poor human understandings. Ye'll notice the weans cease gettin' their wey by juist greetin' for it as shin as they're old enough to seek it otherwise.
#JOHN GALE.
The habit hangs on to them whiles.
#DAVID.
It does that. An' mebbe, if God's gi'en yer neighbors ears an' ye live close, ye'll get yer wey by a dispensation o' Providence a while longer. But there's things ye'll hae to do for yerself gin ye want to - an' ye will. Ye'll want to hold oot yer hand, an' ye will hold oot yer hand; an' ye 'll want to stand up and walk, and ye will stand up and walk; an' ye'll want to dae as ye please, and ye will dae as ye please; and then ye are practised an' lernt in the art of gettin' yer ain way - and ye're a man!
#JOHN GALE.
Man, feyther - ye're wonderful!
#DAVID.
I'm a philosopher, John. But it goes on mebbe.
#JOHN GALE.
Aye? David. Aye: mebbe ye think ye'd like to make ither folk mind ye an' yer way, an' ye try, an' if it comes off ye're a big man an' mebbe the master o' a vessel wi' three men an' a boy under ye, as I was, John. An then ye come doon the hill.
#JOHN GALE.
Doon the hill?
#DAVID.
Aye - doon to mebbe wantin' to tell a wean a bit story before he gangs tae his bed, an' ye canna dae even that. An' then a while more an' ye want to get to yer feet an' walk, and ye canna; an' a while more an' ye want to lift up yer hand, an' ye canna - an' in a while more ye're just forgotten an' done wi'.
#JOHN GALE.
Aw, feyther!
#DAVID.
Dinna look sae troubled, John. I'm no' afraid to dee when my time comes. It's these hints that I'm done wi' before I'm dead that I dinna like.
#JOHN GALE.
What'n hints?
#DAVID.
Well - Lizzie an' her richt's richt and wrang's wrang when I think o' tellin' wee Alexander a bit story before he gangs tae his bed.
#JOHN GALE.
Ye are a wee thing persistent, feyther.
#DAVID.
No, I'm no' persistent, John. I've gied in. I'm a philosopher, John, an' a philosopher kens when he's done wi'.
#JOHN GALE.
Aw, feyther!
#DAVID.
It's gey interesting, philosophy, John, an' the only philosophy worth thinkin' about is the philosophy of growing old - because that's what we're a' doing, a' living things. There's nae philosophy in a stane, John; he's juist a stane, an' in a hundred years he'll be juist a stane still - unless he's broken up, an' then he'll be juist not a stane, but he'll no' ken what's happened to him, because he didna break up gradual and first lose his boat an' then his hoose, an' then hae his wee grandson taken away when he was for tellin' him a bit story before he gangs tae his bed. - It's yon losing yer grip bit by bit and kennin' that yer losin' it that makes a philosopher, John.
#JOHN GALE.
If I kennt what ye meant by philosophy, feyther, I'd be better able to follow ye.
#JOHN GALE.
Is he asleep?
#LIZZIE.
No, he's no' asleep, but I've shut both doors, and the neighbors canna hear him.
#JOHN GALE.
Aw, Lizzie -
#LIZZIE.
John -
#DAVID.
Whit was I tellin' ye, John, about weans gettin' their ain way if the neighbors had ears an' they lived close? Was I no' richt?
#LIZZIE.
Aye, ye were richt, feyther, nae doot; but we dinna live that close here, an' the neighbors canna hear him at the back o' the hoose.
#DAVID.
Mebbe that's why ye changed Alexander into the parlor an' gied me the bed in here when it began to get cold -
#LIZZIE.
Aw, no, feyther; I brought ye in here to be warmer -
#DAVID.
I believe ye, wumman - but it's turned oot luckily, has it no'?
#DAVID.
Puir wee man! If he was in here you'd no' be letting him greet his heart oot where onybody could hear him. Wud ye?
#LIZZIE.
Mebbe I'd no'.
#JOHN GALE.
Ye ken fine ye'd no', wumman.
#LIZZIE.
John, thread my needle an' dinna take feyther's part against me.
#JOHN GALE.
I'm no'.
#LIZZIE.
No, I ken ye're no meanin' to, but you men are that thrang -
#LIZZIE.
Mercy, feyther, whit's wrang wi' ye?
#DAVID.
There's naethin' wrang wi' me, Lizzie, except that I'm wantin' to tell wee Alexander a bit story -
#LIZZIE.
But ye're no' goin' to -
#DAVID.
Ye mind whit I was saying aboot the dispensation o' Providence to help weans till they could try for theirselves, John?
#JOHN GALE.
Aye.
#DAVID.
Did it no' occur to ye then that there ought to be some sort of dispensation to look after the auld yins who were past it?
#JOHN GALE.
No.
#DAVID.
Aweel - it didna occur to me at the time -
#LIZZIE.
Shsh! Feyther! The neighbors will hear ye!!!
#DAVID.
I ken fine; I'm no' at the back of the hoose.
#LIZZIE.
They'll be coming to ask.
#DAVID.
Let them. They'll no'ask me.
#LIZZIE.
Feyther - ye're no'behaving well. John -
#JOHN GALE.
Aye?
#LIZZIE.
Naething - feyther, stop it. They'll think ye're clean daft.
#DAVID.
I ken it fine, Lizzie; an' it's no easy for a man who has been respeckit an' lookit up to a' his life to be thought daft at eighty - three; but the most important thing in life is to get yer ain way.
#LIZZIE.
Whit's that?
#JOHN GALE.
It's his philosophy that he was talking aboot.
#DAVID.
An' I'm gaein' to tell wee Alexander yon bit story, tho' they think me daft for it.
#LIZZIE.
But it's no' for his ain guid, feyther. I've telt ye so, but ye wudna listen.
#DAVID.
I wudna listen, wumman! It was you wudna listen to me when I axed ye whit harm - No! I'm no gaein' to hae that ower again. I've gied up arguing wi' women. I'm juist gaein' tae greet loud an' sair till wee Alexander's brought in here to hae his bit story; an' if the neighbors -
#LIZZIE.
He's fair daft!
#JOHN GALE.
Ye'd no send him to -
#LIZZIE.
John!
#LIZZIE.
He'll be - We'll - He'll - Och!!! John, go and bring wee Alexander in here.
#LIZZIE.
There you are! That's the kind o' boy he is. Greet his heart oot for a thing an' stop the moment he gets it.
#DAVID.
Dae ye expect him to gae on after he's got it? Ah, but, Alexander, ye didna get it yer lane this time; it took the twa o' us. An' hard work it was for the Auld Yin! Man! I doot I've enough voice left for a - Aweel! Whit's it gaein' to be - eh?
