#MRS. SELWYN.
Polly! Polly!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Now, Polly, this afternoon you must be my little maid.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Do you think I can trust you?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
You see, Sukey hasn't come in yet, and some people are coming to tea, so you must put the kettle on to boil, and make the tea when they come.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Do you think you can?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Do you know how to make the tea?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
How do you make it?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
With water, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Anything else?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
No, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, Polly! you are hopeless.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
What do you make the tea with, stupid?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
The kettle, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
And what else?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
The teapot, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
And what inside the teapot?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Water, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Anything else?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Tea, ma'am!
#MRS. SELWYN.
Of course. Now mind you don't forget, and have everything ready, as the party will be here in a minute: and I'll go and put on my best cap.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Let me see ... Oh yes, the tea.
#MRS. SELWYN.
I see them coming across the green! Quick, Polly, put the kettle on, we'll all have tea. Good afternoon, Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Crabstick!
#MRS. JENKINS.
Good afternoon to you, I'm sure.
#MRS. BANKS.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Smiler.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Afternoon.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Smiler, and hoping you keep well.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Yes, thank you. I have my worries, of course, like the rest of us.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
We all have. It's a weary world.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Oh, Mrs. Crabstick, cheer up, just when we've come to such a nice tea - party.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
I depend on my tea.
#MRS. BANKS.
Oh, of course; so do I.
#MRS. JENKINS.
We all do.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Well, I hope you'll get it as you like it to - day.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
One doesn't get what one's used to out of their own house, but if you come out to tea one must make the best of it.
#MRS. JENKINS.
And your little maid, Sukey, makes such good tea.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Yes, she does, but to - day she's out. I'm afraid she must have had a tumble off her bicycle.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Bicycle indeed! In my young days feet were good enough.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Quite true, Mrs. Crabstick. If we had been meant to go on bicycles we should be born with wheels instead of legs.
#MRS. BANKS.
Ah, it's a weary world.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh dear me, Mrs. Crabstick, don't be so gloomy. I've got another little maid to take Sukey's place this afternoon. You'll get your tea all the same. The kettle's boiling now. Polly, is everything ready?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Now, I'll help you first, Mrs. Crabstick. I know you depend so much on your tea.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh!
#MRS. JENKINS.
There's only water in the teapot.
#MRS. BANKS.
There's no tea in it.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh dear, what can have happened? Polly!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
There's no tea in the teapot.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
No, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
But I told you to put in some tea, and I gave you the tea - caddy.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Then what did you do with the tea?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Put it into the kettle, ma'am.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Into the kettle! Give me the kettle at once.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, ma'am. For this brew plenty of blacking should be mixed with water;
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh! what a way of making tea!
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
You'll excuse me if I go away, Mrs. Smiler. I'm so afraid of being taken worse if I stay here after what has happened.
#THE OTHERS.
And we really feel we had better do the same. Good afternoon, Mrs. Smiler.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, Sukey! There you are at last.
#ALL THE GUESTS.
At last!
#SUKEY.
I'm so sorry, ma'am; I fell off my bicycle, and it's broken.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
What did I say!
#SUKEY.
I did so want to be here to make the tea.
#MRS. SELWYN.
You had better have been. Look!
#SUKEY.
Oh dear! I'll get another. I'll soon make it boil.
#MRS. BANKS.
I don't think we'll wait for any more tea - makings, thank you. Good afternoon.
#ALL.
Good afternoon.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh dear! Oh dear! My tea - party has not been a success. Sukey, take it off again, they've all gone away.
