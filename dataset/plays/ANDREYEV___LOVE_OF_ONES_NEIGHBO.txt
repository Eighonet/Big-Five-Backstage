#POLICEMAN.
Get away, you loafer! The man'll fall on your head and then your mother and father will be making a hullabaloo about it.
#BOY.
Will he fall here?
#POLICEMAN.
Yes, here.
#BOY.
Suppose he drops farther?
#SECOND POLICEMAN.
The boy is right. He may get desperate and jump, land beyond the rope and hit some people in the crowd. I guess he weighs at least about two hundred pounds.
#FIRST POLICEMAN.
Move on, move on, you! Where are you going? Is that your daughter, lady? Please take her away! The young man will soon fall.
#LADY.
Soon? Did you say he is going to fall soon? Oh, heavens, and my husband's not here!
#LITTLE GIRL.
He's in the café, mamma.
#LADY.
Yes, of course. He's always in the café. Go call him, Nellie. Tell him the man will soon drop. Hurry! Hurry!
#VOICES.
Waiter! - Garçon - Kellner - Three beers out here! - No beer? - What? - Say, that's a fine bar - We'll have some in a moment - Hurry up - Waiter! - Waiter! - Garçon!
#FIRST POLICEMAN.
Say, boy, you're here again?
#BOY.
I wanted to take the stone away.
#POLICEMAN.
What for?
#BOY.
So he shouldn't get hurt so badly when he falls.
#SECOND POLICEMAN.
The boy is right. We ought to remove the stone. We ought to clear the place altogether. Isn't there any sawdust or sand about?
#FIRST TOURIST.
He's young.
#SECOND TOURIST.
How old?
#FIRST TOURIST.
Twenty - eight.
#SECOND TOURIST.
Twenty - six. Fright has made him look older.
#FIRST TOURIST.
How much will you bet?
#SECOND TOURIST.
Ten to a hundred. Put it down.
#FIRST TOURIST.
How did he get up there? Why don't they take him off?
#POLICEMAN.
They tried, but they couldn't. Our ladders are too short.
#SECOND TOURIST.
Has he been here long?
#POLICEMAN.
Two days.
#FIRST TOURIST.
Aha! He'll drop at night.
#SECOND TOURIST.
In two hours. A hundred to a hundred.
#FIRST TOURIST.
Put it down. How are you feeling? What? I can't hear you.
#UNKNOWN MAN.
Bad, very bad.
#LADY.
Oh, heavens, and my husband is not here!
#LITTLE GIRL.
Papa said he'll get here in plenty of time. He's playing chess.
#LADY.
Oh, heavens! Nellie, tell him he must come. I insist. But perhaps I had rather - Will he fall soon, Mr. Policeman? No? Nellie, you go. I'll stay here and keep the place for papa.
#TOURIST.
But, lady, it is my place. I have been standing here for two hours.
#MILITARY WOMAN.
What do I care how long you have been standing here. I want this place. Do you understand? It offers a good view, and that's just what I want. Do you understand?
#TOURIST.
It's what I want, too.
#MILITARY WOMAN.
I beg your pardon, what do you know about these things anyway?
#TOURIST.
What knowledge is required? A man will fall. That's all.
#MILITARY WOMAN.
"A man will fall. That's all." Won't you have the goodness to tell me whether you have ever seen a man fall? No? Well, I did. Not one, but three. Two acrobats, one rope - walker and three aëronauts.
#TOURIST.
That makes six.
#MILITARY WOMAN.
"That makes six." Say, you are a mathematical prodigy. And did you ever see a tiger tear a woman to pieces in a zoo, right before your eyes? Eh? What? Yes, exactly. Now, I did - Please! Please!
#MILITARY WOMAN.
You will tire yourself out, dear. Why don't you sit down?
#LADY.
Oh, my, don't talk about it. My legs are as stiff as that rock there.
#MILITARY WOMAN.
Men are so rude nowadays. They will never give their place to a woman. Have you brought peppermints with you?
#LADY.
No. Why? Is it necessary?
#MILITARY WOMAN.
When you keep looking up a long time you are bound to get sick. Sure thing. Have you spirits of ammonia? No? Good gracious, how thoughtless! How will they bring you back to consciousness when he falls? You haven't any smelling salts either, I dare say. Of course not. Have you anybody to take care of you, seeing that you are so helpless yourself?
#LADY.
I will tell my husband. He is in the café.
#MILITARY WOMAN.
Your husband is a brute.
#POLICEMAN.
Whose coat is this? Who threw this rag here?
#BOY.
It's mine. I spread my coat there so that he doesn't hurt himself so badly when he falls.
#POLICEMAN.
Take it away.
#FIRST TOURIST.
I wanted this place.
#SECOND TOURIST.
You wanted it, but I got it.
#FIRST TOURIST.
You just came here. I have had this place for two days.
#SECOND TOURIST.
Then why did you go without even leaving your shadow?
#FIRST TOURIST.
I wasn't going to starve myself to death.
#COMB-VENDER.
Tortoise - shell.
#TOURIST.
Well?
#VENDOR.
Genuine tortoise - shell.
#TOURIST.
Go to the devil. TOURIST, PHOTOGRAPHER. For heaven's sake, lady, you're sitting on my camera!
#LITTLE LADY.
Oh! Where is it?
#TOURIST.
Under you, under you, lady.
#LITTLE LADY.
I am so tired. What a wretched camera you have. I thought it felt uncomfortable and I was wondering why. Now I know; I am sitting on your camera.
#TOURIST.
Lady!
#LITTLE LADY.
I thought it was a stone. I saw something lying there and I thought: A queer - looking stone; I wonder why it's so black. So that's what it was; it was your camera. I see.
#TOURIST.
Lady, for heaven's sake!
#LITTLE LADY.
Why is it so large, tell me. Cameras are small, but this one is so large. I swear I never had the faintest suspicion it was a camera. Can you take my picture? I would so much like to have my picture taken with the mountains here for a background, in this wonderful setting.
#TOURIST.
How can I take your picture if you are sitting on my camera?
#LITTLE LADY.
Is it possible? You don't say so. Why didn't you tell me so? Does it take pictures?
#VOICES.

#STUDENT.
Here she is, papa.
#TOURIST.
Where is she? Mary!
#MARY.
Here I am, papa.
#TOURIST.
Where in the world are you? Ah, there! What are you standing back of me for? Look, look! For goodness' sake, where are you looking?
#MARY.
I don't know, papa.
#TOURIST.
No, that's impossible. Imagine! She never once saw a lightning flash. She always keeps her eyes open as wide as onions, but the instant it flashes she closes them. So she never saw lightning, not once. Mary, you are missing it again. There it is! You see!
#STUDENT.
She sees, papa.
#TOURIST.
Keep an eye on her. Ah, poor young man. Imagine! He'll fall from that high rock. Look, children, see how pale he is! That should be a lesson to you how dangerous climbing is.
#STUDENT.
He won't fall to - day, papa!
#SECOND GIRL.
Papa, Mary has closed her eyes again.
#FIRST STUDENT.
Let us sit down, papa! Upon my word, he won't fall to - day. The porter told me so. I can't stand it any more. You've been dragging us about every day from morning till night visiting art galleries.
#TOURIST.
What's that? For whose benefit am I doing this? Do you think I enjoy spending my time with a dunce?
#SECOND GIRL.
Papa, Mary is blinking her eyes.
#SECOND STUDENT.
I can't stand it, either. I have terrible dreams. Yesterday I dreamed of garçons the whole night long.
#TOURIST.
Jimmie.
#FIRST STUDENT.
I have gotten so thin I am nothing but skin and bones. I can't stand it any more, father. I'd rather be a farmer, or tend pigs.
#TOURIST.
Aleck.
#FIRST STUDENT.
If he were really to fall - but it's a fake. You believe every lie told you! They all lie. Baedeker lies, too. Yes, your Baedeker lies!
#MARY.
Papa, children, he's beginning to fall.
#PHOTOGRAPHER.
Oh, hang it! What is the matter with me? The devil! When a man's in a hurry -
#SECOND PHOTOGRAPHER.
Brother, your camera is closed.
#PHOTOGRAPHER.
The devil take it.
#VOICES.
Hush! He's getting ready to fall. - No, he's saying something. - No, he's falling. - Hush!
#UNKNOWN MAN ON THE ROCK.
Save me! Save me!
#TOURIST.
Ah, poor young man. Mary, Jimmie, there's a tragedy for you. The sky is clear, the weather is beautiful, and has he to fall and be shattered to death? Can you realize how dreadful that is, Aleck?
#STUDENT.
Yes, I can realize it.
#TOURIST.
Mary, can you realize it? Imagine. There is the sky. There are people enjoying themselves and partaking of refreshments. Everything is so nice and pleasant, and he has to fall. What a tragedy! Do you remember Hamlet?
#SECOND GIRL.
Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, of Elsinore.
#JAMES.
Of Helsingfors, I know. Don't bother me, father!
#MARY.
He dreamed about garçons all night long.
#ALECK.
Why don't you order sandwiches, father.
#COMB-VENDER.
Tortoise - shell. Genuine tortoise - shell.
#TOURIST.
Stolen?
#VENDOR.
Why, sir, the idea!
#TOURIST.
Do you mean to tell me it's genuine if it isn't stolen? Go on. Not much.
#MILITARY WOMAN.
Are all these your children?
#TOURIST.
Yes, madam. A father's duty. You see, they are protesting. It is the eternal conflict between fathers and children. Here is such a tragedy going on, such a heart - rending tragedy - Mary, you are blinking your eyes again.
#MILITARY WOMAN.
You are quite right. Children must be hardened to things. But why do you call this a terrible tragedy? Every roofer, when he falls, falls from a great height. But this here - what is it? A hundred, two hundred feet. I saw a man fall plumb from the sky.
#TOURIST.
You don't say?
#ALECK.
Children, listen. Plumb from the sky.
#MILITARY WOMAN.
Yes, yes. I saw an aëronaut drop from the clouds and go crash upon an iron roof.
#TOURIST.
How terrible!
#MILITARY WOMAN.
That's what I call a tragedy. It took two hours to bring me back to consciousness, and all that time they pumped water on me, the scoundrels. I was nearly drowned. From that day on I never step out of the door without taking spirits of ammonia with me.
#MARY.
Papa, children, look. He is beginning to wave his hands.
#TOURIST.
Is that the effect the music has upon him?
#MILITARY WOMAN.
Quite possible. Music usually goes with such things. But that'll make him fall sooner than he should. Musicians, go away from here! Go!
#TALL TOURIST.
It's scandalous. Why don't they save him? Ladies and gentlemen, you all heard him shout: "Save me." Didn't you?
#THE CURIOUS.
Yes, yes, we heard him.
#TALL TOURIST.
There you are. I distinctly heard these words: "Save me! Why don't they save me?" It's scandalous. Policemen, policemen! Why don't you save him? What are you doing there?
#POLICEMEN.
We are cleaning up the place for him to fall.
#TALL TOURIST.
That's a sensible thing to do, too. But why don't you save him? You ought to save him. If a man asks you to save him, it is absolutely essential to save him. Isn't it so, ladies and gentlemen?
#THE CURIOUS.
True, absolutely true. It is essential to save him.
#TALL TOURIST.
We are not heathens, we are Christians. We should love our neighbors. When a man asks to be saved every measure which the government has at its command should be taken to save him. Policemen, have you taken every measure?
#POLICEMAN.
Every one!
#TALL TOURIST.
Every one without exception? Gentleman, every measure has been taken. Listen, young man, every measure has been taken to save you. Did you hear?
#UNKNOWN MAN.
Save me!
#TALL TOURIST.
Gentlemen, did you hear? He again asked to be saved. Policemen, did you hear?
#ONE OF THE CURIOUS.
It is my opinion that it is absolutely necessary to save him.
#TALL TOURIST.
That's right. Exactly. Why, that's what I have been saying for the last two hours. Policemen, do you hear? It is scandalous.
#ONE OF THE CURIOUS.
It is my opinion that an appeal should be made to the highest authority.
#THE REST.
Yes, yes, a complaint should be made. It is scandalous. The government ought not to leave any of its citizens in danger. We all pay taxes. He must be saved.
#TALL TOURIST.
Didn't I say so? Of course we must put up a complaint. Young man! Listen, young man. Do you pay taxes? What? I can't hear.
#TOURIST.
Jimmie, Katie, listen! What a tragedy! Ah, the poor young man! He is soon to fall and they ask him to pay a domiciliary tax.
#KATE.
That can hardly be called a domicile, father. The meaning of domicile is -
#JAMES.
Lickspittle.
#MARY.
Papa, children, look! He's again beginning to fall.
#TALL TOURIST.
We must hurry, ladies and gentlemen. He must be saved at any cost. Who's going with me?
#THE CURIOUS.
We are all going! We are all going?
#TALL TOURIST.
Policemen, did you hear? Come, ladies and gentlemen!

#UNKNOWN MAN.
Yes, it's bad. I am sick and tired of it.
#DRUNKEN MAN.
Can't you get a drink?
#UNKNOWN MAN.
No, how can I?
#SECOND DRUNKEN MAN.
Say, what are you talking about? How can he get a drink? The man is about to die and you tempt him and try to get him excited. Listen, up there, we have been drinking your health right along. It won't hurt you, will it?
#FIRST DRUNKEN MAN.
Ah, go on! What are you talking about? How can it hurt him? Why, it will only do him good. It will encourage him. Listen, honest to God, we are very sorry for you, but don't mind us. We are going to the café to have another drink. Good - by.
#SECOND DRUNKEN MAN.
Look, what a crowd.

Come, or he'll fall and then they'll close the café.

Mary, dear, again you are not looking.
#ALECK.
I wish you would order some sandwiches for us. I can't stand it any longer. A human being has to eat.

It is quieter in the café.
#CORRESPONDENT.
Permit me to introduce myself. I am the chief correspondent of the European press. I have been sent here at the special request of the editors. I should like to ask you several questions concerning your situation. What is your name? What is your general position? How old are you?
#CORRESPONDENT.
I can't hear a thing. Has he been that way all the time?
#HANK.
Yes, it's impossible to hear a word he says.
#CORRESPONDENT.
Fine! Are you a bachelor?
#CORRESPONDENT.
I can't hear you. Are you married? Yes?
#TOURIST.
He said he was a bachelor.
#SECOND TOURIST.
No, he didn't. Of course, he's married.
#CORRESPONDENT.
You think so? All right. We'll put down, married. How many children have you? Can't hear. It seems to me he said three. Hm! Anyway, we'll put down five.
#TOURIST.
Oh, my, what a tragedy. Five children! Imagine!
#MILITARY WOMAN.
He is lying.
#CORRESPONDENT.
How did you get into this position? What? I can't hear? Louder! Repeat. What did you say? What did he say? The fellow has a devilishly weak voice.
#FIRST TOURIST.
It seems to me he said that he lost his way.
#SECOND TOURIST.
No, he doesn't know himself how he got there.
#VOICES.
He was out hunting. - He was climbing up the rocks. - No, no! He is simply a lunatic!

I beg your pardon, I beg your pardon, ladies and gentlemen! Anyway, he didn't drop from the sky. However - Unhappy young man - suffering from childhood with attacks of lunacy. - The bright light of the full moon - the wild rocks. - Sleepy janitor - didn't notice -
#FIRST TOURIST.
But it's a new moon now.
#SECOND TOURIST.
Go, what does a layman know about astronomy.
#TOURIST.
Mary, pay attention to this! You have before you an ocular demonstration of the influence of the moon on living organisms. What a terrible tragedy to go out walking on a moonlit night and find suddenly that you have climbed to a place where it is impossible to climb down or be taken down.
#CORRESPONDENT.
What feelings are you experiencing? I can't hear. Louder! Ah, so? Well, well! What a situation!
#CROWD.
Listen, listen! Let's hear what his feelings are. How terrible!
#CORRESPONDENT.
Mortal terror, numbs his limbs. - A cold shiver goes down his spinal column. - No hope. - Before his mental vision rises a picture of family bliss: Wife making sandwiches; his five children innocently lisping their love. - Grandma in the armchair with a tube to her ear, that is, grandpa in the arm - chair, with a tube to his ear and grandma. - Deeply moved by the sympathy of the public. - His last wish before his death that the words he uttered with his last breath should be published in our newspapers -
#MILITARY WOMAN.
My! He lies like a salesman.

Papa, children, look, he is starting to fall again.

Don't bother me. Such a tragedy is unfolding itself right before your very eyes - and you - What are you making such big eyes for again?

Hold on fast. That's it! My last question: What message do you wish to leave for your fellow citizens before you depart for the better world?
#UNKNOWN MAN.
That they may all go to the devil.

The air is shaken with the people's groans. The minister of the church exhorts the criminal, that is, the unfortunate man, in touching language. - The unfortunate creature with tears in his eyes thanks him in a faint voice -

Come, let's go away from here.
#FIRST ENGLISH TOURIST.
One minute. Listen, won't you hurry up and fall?
#SECOND ENGLISH TOURIST.
What are you saying, Sir William?

See? It's true. Aleck, Jimmie, it's true. What a tragedy!

Wait a while, wait a while.

Do you expect me to stay here until the Second Advent? The agreement was till twelve o'clock. What time is it now?
#TALL TOURIST.
Do you hear, ladies and gentlemen? This scoundrel, this man here in the white vest hired that other scoundrel up there and just simply tied him to the rock.
#VOICES.
Is he tied?
#TALL TOURIST.
Yes, he is tied and he can't fall. We are excited and worrying, but he couldn't fall even if he tried.
#UNKNOWN MAN.
What else do you want? Do you think I am going to break my neck for your measly ten dollars? Boss, I can't stand it any more. One man wanted to shoot me. The pastor preached me for two hours. This is not in the agreement.
#ALECK.
Father, I told you that Baedeker lies. You believe everything anybody tells you and drag us about without eating.
#MAN IN THE WHITE VEST.
The people were bored. My only desire was to amuse the people.
#MILITARY WOMAN.
What is the matter? I don't understand a thing. Why isn't he going to fall? Who, then, is going to fall?
#TOURIST.
I don't understand a thing either. Of course he's got to fall!
#JAMES.
You never understand anything, father. Weren't you told that he's tied to the rock?
#ALECK.
You can't convince him. He loves every Baedeker more than his own children. nice father!
#TOURIST.
Silence!
#MILITARY WOMAN.
What is the matter? He must fall.
#TALL TOURIST.
The idea! What a deception. You'll have to explain this.

Well, I should say so. You think I'd be hanging here nights, too!
#HOTEL OWNER.
Then you can stand it a few minutes longer. The people are bored -
#TALL TOURIST.
Say, have you any idea of what you have done? Do you realize the enormity of it? You are scoundrels, who for your own sordid personal ends have impiously exploited the finest human sentiment, love of one's neighbor. You have caused us to undergo fear and suffering. You have poisoned our hearts with pity. And now, what is the upshot of it all? The upshot is that this scamp, your vile accomplice, is bound to the rock and not only will he not fall as everybody expects, but he can't.
#MILITARY WOMAN.
What is the matter? He has got to fall.

Policeman! Policeman!

I spoiled three films photographing that scamp. You will have to answer for this, sir. I will hold you responsible.
#TOURIST.
An official report! An official report! Such a bare - faced deception. Mary, Jimmie, Aleck, Charlie, call a policeman.
#HOTEL KEEPER.
But, I can't make him fall if he doesn't want to. I did everything in my power, ladies and gentlemen!
#MILITARY WOMAN.
I will not allow it.
#HOTEL KEEPER.
Excuse me. I promise you on my word of honor that the next time he will fall. But he doesn't want to, to - day.
#UNKNOWN MAN.
What's that? What did you say about the next time?
#HOTEL KEEPER.
You shut up there!
#UNKNOWN MAN.
For ten dollars?
#PASTOR.
Pray, what impudence! I just made his peace with heaven when he was in danger of his life. You have heard him threatening to fall on my head, haven't you? And still he is dissatisfied. Adulterer, thief, murderer, coveter of your neighbor's ass -
#PHOTOGRAPHER.
Ladies and gentlemen, an ass!
#SECOND PHOTOGRAPHER.
Where, where is an ass?
#PHOTOGRAPHER.
I thought I heard one.
#SECOND PHOTOGRAPHER.
It is you who are an ass. I have become cross - eyed on account of your shouting: "An ass! An ass!"
#MARY.
Papa, children, look! A policeman is coming.
#TOURIST.
Policeman, there he is, the fakir, the swindler.
#PASTOR.
Policeman, there he is, the adulterer, the murderer, the coveter of his neighbor's ass -
#POLICEMAN.
Excuse me, excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. We will bring him to his senses in short order and make him confess.
#HOTEL KEEPER.
I can't make him fall if he doesn't want to.
#POLICEMAN.
Hey, you, young man out there! Can you fall or can't you? Confess!
#UNKNOWN MAN.
I don't want to fall!
#VOICES.
Aha, he has confessed. What a scoundrel!
#TALL TOURIST.
Write down what I dictate, policeman - "Desiring - for the sake of gain to exploit the sentiment of love of one's neighbor - the sacred feeling - a - a - a - "
#TOURIST.
Listen, children, they are drawing up an official report. What exquisite choice of language!
#TALL TOURIST.
The sacred feeling which -

Love of one's neighbor - the sacred feeling which -
#MARY.
Papa, children, look! An advertisement is coming.
#UNKNOWN MAN.
Too late. They are drawing up a report here. You had better skidoo!
#THE MAN CARRYING THE POLE.
I had been bald from the day of my birth and for a long time thereafter. That miserable growth, which in my tenth year covered my scalp was more like wool than real hair. When I was married my skull was as bare as a pillow and my young bride -
#TOURIST.
What a tragedy! Newly married and with such a head! Can you realize how dreadful that is, children?
#THE MAN CARRYING THE POLE.
And the time came when my matrimonial happiness literally hung by a hair. All the medicines recommended by quacks to make my hair grow -
#TOURIST.
Your note - book, Jimmie.
#MILITARY WOMAN.
But when is he going to fall?
#HOTEL KEEPER.
The next time, lady, the next time. I won't tie him so hard - you understand?
