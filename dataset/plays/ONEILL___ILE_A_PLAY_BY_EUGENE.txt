#THE STEWARD.
Oh, 'tis you, is it? What're ye shiverin' 'bout? Stay by the stove where ye belong and ye'll find no need of chatterin'.
#BEN.
It's c - c - cold. Who d'ye think it were - the Old Man?
#THE STEWARD.
None o' your lip, young un, or I'll learn ye. Where was it ye've been all o' the time - the fo'c's'tle?
#BEN.
Yes.
#THE STEWARD.
Let the Old Man see ye up for'ard monkeyshinin' with the hands and ye'll get a hidin' ye'll not forget in a hurry.
#BEN.
Aw, he don't see nothin'. He jest walks up and down like he didn't notice nobody - and stares at the ice to the no'the'ard.
#THE STEWARD.
He's always starin' at the ice. Ice, ice, ice! Damn him and damn the ice! Holdin' us in for nigh on a year - nothin' to see but ice - stuck in it like a fly in molasses!
#BEN.
Ssshh! He'll hear ye.
#THE STEWARD.
Aye, damn, and damn the Arctic seas, and damn this rotten whalin' ship of his, and damn me for a fool to ever ship on it! He's a hard man - as hard a man as ever sailed the seas.
#BEN.
Aye.
#THE STEWARD.
The two years we all signed up for are done this day! Two years o' this dog's life, and no luck in the fishin', and the hands half starved with the food runnin' low, rotten as it is; and not a sign of him turnin' back for home! Home! I begin to doubt if ever I'll set foot on land again. What is it he thinks he's goin' to do? Keep us all up here after our time is worked out till the last man of us is starved to death or frozen? We've grub enough hardly to last out the voyage back if we started now. What are the men goin' to do 'bout it? Did ye hear any talk in the fo'c's'tle?
#BEN.
They said if he don't put back south for home to - day they're goin' to mutiny.
#THE STEWARD.
Mutiny? Aye, 'tis the only thing they can do; and serve him right after the manner he's treated them - 's if they weren't no better nor dogs.
#BEN.
The ice is all broke up to s'uth'ard. They's clear water s'far 's you can see. He ain't got no excuse for not turnin' back for home, the men says.
#THE STEWARD.
He won't look nowheres but no'the'ard where they's only the ice to see. He don't want to see no clear water. All he thinks on is gettin' the ile - 's if it was our fault he ain't had good luck with the whales. I think the man's mighty nigh losin' his senses.
#BEN.
D'you really think he's crazy?
#THE STEWARD.
Aye, it's the punishment o' God on him. Did ye ever hear of a man who wasn't crazy do the things he does? Who but a man that's mad would take his woman - and as sweet a woman as ever was - on a rotten whalin' ship to the Arctic seas to be locked in by the ice for nigh on a year, and maybe lose her senses forever - for it's sure she'll never be the same again.
#BEN.
She useter be awful nice to me before - she got - like she is.
#THE STEWARD.
Aye, she was good to all of us. 'Twould have been hell on board without her; for he's a hard man - a hard, hard man - a driver if there ever was one. I hope he's satisfied now - drivin' her on till she's near lost her mind. And who could blame her? 'Tis a God's wonder we're not a ship full of crazed people - with the ice all the time, and the quiet so thick you're afraid to hear your own voice.
#BEN.
She don't never speak to me no more - jest looks at me 's if she didn't know me.
#THE STEWARD.
She don't know no one - but him. She talks to him - when she does talk - right enough.
#BEN.
She does nothin' all day long now but sit and sew - and then she cries to herself without makin' no noise. I've seen her.
#THE STEWARD.
Aye, I could hear her through the door a while back.
#BEN.
She's cryin' now.
#THE STEWARD.
God send his soul to hell for the devil he is!
#KEENEY.
'Twould be like hitting a worm. It is nigh on two bells, Mr. Steward, and this truck not cleared yet.
#THE STEWARD.
Y - y - yes, sir.
#KEENEY.
Instead of doin' your rightful work ye've been below here gossipin' old women's talk with that boy. Get out o' this you! Clean up the chart room. Pick up that dish, Mr. Steward!
#THE STEWARD.
Yes, sir.
#KEENEY.
The next dish you break, Mr. Steward, you take a bath in the Behring Sea at the end of a rope.
#THE STEWARD.
Yes, sir.
#MATE.
I warn't 'specially anxious the man at the wheel should catch what I wanted to say to you, sir. That's why I asked you to come below.
#KEENEY.
Speak your say, Mr. Slocum.
#MATE.
I'm afeared there'll be trouble with the hands by the look o' things. They'll likely turn ugly, every blessed one o' them, if you don't put back. The two years they signed up for is up to - day.
#KEENEY.
And d'you think you're tellin' me something new, Mr. Slocum? I've felt it in the air this long time past. D'you think I've not seen their ugly looks and the grudgin' way they worked?
#KEENEY.
Well, Annie?
#MRS. KEENEY.
David, I -
#KEENEY.
Wait!
#MATE.
Yes, sir.
#KEENEY.
D'you want anything, Annie?
#MRS. KEENEY.
I thought maybe - I'd go up on deck, David, to get a breath of fresh air.
#KEENEY.
It's too cold, Annie. You'd best stay below. There's nothing to look at on deck - but ice.
#MRS. KEENEY.
I know - ice, ice, ice! But there's nothing to see down here but these walls.
#KEENEY.
You can play the organ, Annie.
#MRS. KEENEY.
I hate the organ. It puts me in mind of home.
#KEENEY.
I got it jest for you!
#MRS. KEENEY.
I know. Ah, water! Clear water! As far as I can see! How good it looks after all these months of ice! Ah, now I must go up on deck and look at it, David!
#KEENEY.
Best not to - day, Annie. Best wait for a day when the sun shines.
#MRS. KEENEY.
But the sun never shines in this terrible place.
#KEENEY.
Best not to - day, Annie.
#MRS. KEENEY.
Very well, David.
#KEENEY.
Annie!
#MRS. KEENEY.
Yes, David.
#KEENEY.
Me and Mr. Slocum has business to talk about - ship's business.
#MRS. KEENEY.
Very well, David.
#KEENEY.
Best not have her on deck if they's goin' to be any trouble.
#MATE.
Yes, sir.
#KEENEY.
And trouble they's going to be. I feel it in my bones. Got your'n?
#MATE.
Yes, sir.
#KEENEY.
Not that we'll have to use 'em - not if I know their breed of dog - jest to frighten 'em up a bit. I ain't never been forced to use one yit; and trouble I've had by land and by sea s'long as I kin remember, and will have till my dyin' day, I reckon.
#MATE.
Then you ain't goin' - to turn back?
#KEENEY.
Turn back! Mr. Slocum, did you ever hear o' me pointin' s'uth for home with only a measly four hundred barrel of ile in the hold?
#MATE.
But the grub's gittin' low.
#KEENEY.
They's enough to last a long time yit, if they're careful with it; and they's plenty of water.
#MATE.
They say it's not fit to eat - what's left; and the two years they signed on fur is up to - day. They might make trouble for you in the courts when we git home.
#KEENEY.
Let them make what law trouble they kin! I don't give a damn 'bout the money. I've got to git the ile! You ain't turnin' no sea lawyer, be you, Mr. Slocum?
#MATE.
Not by a hell of a sight, sir.
#KEENEY.
What do the fools want to go home fur now? Their share o' the four hundred barrel wouldn't keep them in chewin' terbacco.
#MATE.
They wants to git back to their old folks an' things, I s'pose.
#KEENEY.
'N you want to turn back too. Don't lie, Mr. Slocum. It's writ down plain in your eyes. I hope, Mr. Slocum, you ain't agoin' to jine the men agin me.
#MATE.
That ain't fair, sir, to say sich things.
#KEENEY.
I warn't much afeard o' that, Tom. You been with me nigh on ten year and I've learned ye whalin'. No man kin say I ain't a good master, if I be a hard one.
#MATE.
I warn't thinkin' of myself, sir - 'bout turnin' home, I mean. But Mrs. Keeney, sir - seems like she ain't jest satisfied up here, ailin' like - what with the cold an' bad luck an' the ice an' all.
#KEENEY.
That's my business, Mr. Slocum. I'll thank you to steer a clear course o' that. The ice'll break up soon to no'the'ard. I could see it startin' to - day. And when it goes and we git some sun Annie'll pick up. It ain't the damned money what's keepin' me up in the Northern seas, Tom. But I can't go back to Homeport with a measly four hundred barrel of ile. I'd die fust. I ain't never come back home in all my days without a full ship. Ain't that true?
#MATE.
Yes, sir; but this voyage you been ice - bound, an' -
#KEENEY.
And d'you s'pose any of 'em would believe that - any o' them skippers I've beaten voyage after voyage? Can't you hear 'em laughin' and sneerin' - Tibbots n' Harris n' Simms and the rest - and all o' Homeport makin' fun o' me? "Dave Keeney, what boasts he's the best whalin' skipper out o' Homeport, comin' back with a measly four hundred barrel of ile!" I got to git the ile, I tell you! How could I figger on this ice? It's never been so bad before in the thirty year I been acomin' here. And now it's breakin' up. In a couple o' days it'll be all gone. And they's whale here, plenty of 'em. I know they is and I ain't never gone wrong yit. I got to git the ile! I got to git it in spite of all hell, and by God, I ain't agoin' home till I do git it!
#KEENEY.
Don't be standin' there like a hawk, Harpooner. Speak up!
#OLD JOE.
We want - the men, sir - they wants to send a depitation aft to have a word with you.
#KEENEY.
Tell 'em to go to - Tell 'em to come. I'll see 'em.
#OLD JOE.
Aye, aye, sir.
#KEENEY.
Here it comes, the trouble you spoke of, Mr. Slocum, and we'll make short shift of it. It's better to crush such things at the start than let them make headway.
#MATE.
Shall I wake up the First and Fourth, sir? We might need their help.
#KEENEY.
No, let them sleep. I'm well able to handle this alone, Mr. Slocum.
#KEENEY.
Well? Who's to speak fur ye?
#OLD JOE.
I be.
#KEENEY.
So you be. Then speak your say and be quick about it.
#OLD JOE.
The time we signed up for is done to - day.
#KEENEY.
You're tellin' me nothin' I don't know.
#OLD JOE.
You ain't p'intin' fur home yit, far s'we kin see.
#KEENEY.
No, and I ain't agoin' to till this ship is full of ile.
#OLD JOE.
You can't go no further no'the with the ice before ye.
#KEENEY.
The ice is breaking up.
#OLD JOE.
The grub we're gittin' now is rotten.
#KEENEY.
It's good enough fur ye. Better men than ye are have eaten worse.
#OLD JOE.
We ain't agoin' to work no more less you puts back for home.
#KEENEY.
You ain't, ain't you?
#OLD JOE.
No; and the law courts'll say we was right.
#KEENEY.
To hell with your law courts! We're at sea now and I'm the law on this ship! And every mother's son of you what don't obey orders goes in irons.
#OLD JOE.
Then we're agoin' to mutiny and take the old hooker home ourselves. Ain't we, boys?
#KEENEY.
Hold still! You's found out it ain't safe to mutiny on this ship, ain't you? And now git for'ard where ye belong, and - drag him with you. And remember, the first man of ye I see shirkin' I'll shoot dead as sure as there's a sea under us, and you can tell the rest the same. Git for'ard now! Quick! Best get up on deck, Mr. Slocum, and see to it they don't try none of their skulkin' tricks. We'll have to keep an eye peeled from now on. I know 'em.
#MATE.
Yes, sir.
#KEENEY.
There, there, Annie. Don't be feared. It's all past and gone.
#MRS. KEENEY.
Oh, I can't bear it! I can't bear it any longer!
#KEENEY.
Can't bear what, Annie?
#MRS. KEENEY.
All this horrible brutality, and these brutes of men, and this terrible ship, and this prison cell of a room, and the ice all around, and the silence.
#KEENEY.
Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage, Annie.
#MRS. KEENEY.
I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these last six years since we were married - waiting, and watching, and fearing - with nothing to keep my mind occupied - not able to go back teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold - and brutality!
#KEENEY.
I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.
#MRS. KEENEY.
Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see, I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in the story books and I thought you were one of them.
#KEENEY.
I done my best to make it as cozy and comfortable as could be. I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was dull like.
#MRS. KEENEY.
Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that. : I won't stand it - I can't stand it - pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!
#KEENEY.
Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.
#MRS. KEENEY.
It's the ice and the cold and the silence - they'd make any one look strange.
#KEENEY.
In a month or two, with good luck, three at the most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything she'll stand and p'int for home.
#MRS. KEENEY.
But we can't wait for that - I can't wait. I want to get home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse. There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've got to turn back.
#KEENEY.
I can't, Annie.
#MRS. KEENEY.
Why can't you? woman couldn't rightly understand my reason.
#MRS. KEENEY.
Because it's a stubborn reason. Oh, I heard you talking with the second mate. You're afraid the other captains will sneer at you because you didn't come back with a full ship. You want to live up to your silly reputation even if you do have to beat and starve men and drive me mad to do it.
#KEENEY.
It ain't that, Annie. Them skippers would never dare sneer to my face. It ain't so much what any one'd say - but - you see - I've always done it - since my first voyage as skipper. I always come back - with a full ship - and - it don't seem right not to - somehow. I been always first whalin' skipper out o' Homeport, and - don't you see my meanin', Annie? Annie! Best turn in, Annie, there's a good woman. You ain't well.
#MRS. KEENEY.
David! Won't you please turn back?
#KEENEY.
I can't, Annie - not yet awhile. You don't see my meanin'. I got to git the ile.
#MRS. KEENEY.
It'd be different if you needed the money, but you don't. You've got more than plenty.
#KEENEY.
It ain't the money I'm thinkin' of. D'you think I'm as mean as that?
#MRS. KEENEY.
No - I don't know - I can't understand. Oh, I want to be home in the old house once more, and see my own kitchen again, and hear a woman's voice talking to me and be able to talk to her. Two years! It seems so long ago - as if I'd been dead and could never go back.
#KEENEY.
Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't well.
#MRS. KEENEY.
I used to be lonely when you were away. I used to think Homeport was a stupid, monotonous place. Then I used to go down on the beach, especially when it was windy and the breakers were rolling in, and I'd dream of the fine, free life you must be leading. I used to love the sea then. But now - I don't ever want to see the sea again.
#KEENEY.
'Tis no fit place for a woman, that's sure. I was a fool to bring ye.
#MRS. KEENEY.
How long would it take us to reach home - if we started now?
#KEENEY.
'Bout two months, I reckon, Annie, with fair luck.
#MRS. KEENEY.
That would be August, the latter part of August, wouldn't it? It was on the twenty - fifth of August we were married, David, wasn't it?
#KEENEY.
Don't you remember?
#MRS. KEENEY.
My memory is leaving me - up here in the ice. It was so long ago. It's June now. The lilacs will be all in bloom in the front yard - and the climbing roses on the trellis to the side of the house - they're budding -
#KEENEY.
Go in and rest, Annie. You're all worn out cryin' over what can't be helped.
#MRS. KEENEY.
You love me, don't you, David?
#KEENEY.
Love you? Why d'you ask me such a question, Annie?
#MRS. KEENEY.
But you do, don't you, David? Tell me!
#KEENEY.
I'm your husband, Annie, and you're my wife. Could there be aught but love between us after all these years?
#MRS. KEENEY.
Then you do love me. Say it!
#KEENEY.
I do, Annie.
#MRS. KEENEY.
: I sometimes think if we could only have had a child - And I've always been a good wife to you, haven't I, David?
#KEENEY.
No man has ever had a better, Annie.
#MRS. KEENEY.
And I've never asked for much from you, have I, David? Have
#KEENEY.
You know you could have all I got the power to give ye, Annie.
#MRS. KEENEY.
Then do this, this once, for my sake, for God's sake - take me home! It's killing me, this life - the brutality and cold and horror of it. I'm going mad. I can feel the threat in the air. I can't bear the silence threatening me - day after gray day and every day the same. I can't bear it. I'll go mad, I know I will. Take me home, David, if you love me as you say. I'm afraid. For the love of God, take me home!
#KEENEY.
I'll do it, Annie - for your sake - if you say it's needful for ye.
#MRS. KEENEY.
God bless you for that, David!
#MATE.
The ice is breakin' up to no'the'ard, sir. There's a clear passage through the floe, and clear water beyond, the lookout says.
#KEENEY.
A clear passage? To no'the'ard?
#MATE.
Yes, sir.
#KEENEY.
Then get her ready and we'll drive her through.
#MATE.
Aye, aye, sir.
#MRS. KEENEY.
David! David!
#KEENEY.
Will the men turn to willin' or must we drag 'em out?
#MATE.
They'll turn to willin' enough. You put the fear o' God into 'em, sir. They're meek as lambs.
#KEENEY.
Then drive 'em - both watches. They's whale t'other side o' this floe and we're agoin' to git 'em.
#MATE.
Aye, aye, sir.
#KEENEY.
And I was agoin' home like a yaller dog!
#MRS. KEENEY.
David!
#KEENEY.
Woman, you ain't adoin' right when you meddle in men's business and weaken 'em. You can't know my feelin's. I got to prove a man to be a good husband for ye to take pride in. I got to git the ile, I tell ye.
#MRS. KEENEY.
David! Aren't you going home?
#KEENEY.
You ain't well. Go and lay down a mite. I got to git on deck.
#KEENEY.
Woman, what foolish mockin' is this? Annie! What is it? Don't you know me, Annie?
#KEENEY.
You said - you was agoin' mad - God!
#MATE.
Whales, sir - a whole school of 'em - off the star - b'd quarter 'bout five miles away - big ones!
#KEENEY.
Are you lowerin' the boats?
#MATE.
Yes, sir.
#KEENEY.
I'm acomin' with ye.
#MATE.
Aye, aye, sir. You'll git the ile now right enough, sir.
#KEENEY.
Annie! Did you hear him? I'll git the ile. I know you're foolin' me, Annie. You ain't out of your mind - be you? I'll git the ile now right enough - jest a little while longer, Annie - then we'll turn home'ard. I can't turn back now, you see that, don't you? I've got to git the ile. Answer me! You ain't mad, be you?
#MATE.
All ready, sir.
#MATE.
Comin', sir?
#KEENEY.
Aye. Curtain falls.]
