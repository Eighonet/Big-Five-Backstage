#BOLETTA.
Well, Ballested,—can you get it to run?
#BALLESTED.
Oh yes, Miss Boletta. It’s easy enough.—May I ask if you are expecting visitors to - day?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, we expect Mr. Arnholm this morning. He came to town last night.
#BALLESTED.
Arnholm? Wait a moment—wasn’t Arnholm the name of the tutor you had here some years ago?
#BOLETTA.
Yes; it is he that is coming.
#BALLESTED.
Ah, indeed. So he is in these parts again?
#BOLETTA.
That is why we want the flag run up.
#BALLESTED.
Ah, I see, I see.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Good morning.
#BALLESTED.
Ah—good morning. So - ho!—up goes the balloon! I take off my hat to you, sir—though I don’t think I have the pleasure——
#LYNGSTRAND.
You are a painter, are you not?
#BALLESTED.
Yes, certainly. Why should I not be a painter?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Ah, I can see you are.—Should you mind my coming in for a moment?
#BALLESTED.
Do you want to have a look at it?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I should like to extremely.
#BALLESTED.
Oh there’s nothing much to see as yet. But pray come in—you’re quite welcome.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Many thanks.
#BALLESTED.
It’s the inner part of the fiord, among the islands, that I am working at.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I see.
#BALLESTED.
But I haven’t put in the figure yet. There is no such thing as a model to be had in the town.
#LYNGSTRAND.
There is to be a figure, is there?
#BALLESTED.
Yes. By the rock in the foreground here, I mean to have a half - dead mermaid lying.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Why half - dead?
#BALLESTED.
She has strayed in from the sea, and can’t find her way out again. So she lies here dying by inches in the brackish water, you understand.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh, that is the idea?
#BALLESTED.
It was the lady of this house that suggested it to me.
#LYNGSTRAND.
What will you call the picture when it is finished?
#BALLESTED.
I think of calling it “The Mermaid’s End.”
#LYNGSTRAND.
Capital.—You are sure to make something good out of this.
#BALLESTED.
An artist yourself, perhaps? painter, you mean?
#BALLESTED.
Yes.
#LYNGSTRAND.
No, I am not. But I am going to be a sculptor. My name is Hans Lyngstrand.
#BALLESTED.
Going to be a sculptor, are you? Well, well, sculpture, too, is a fine, gentleman - like art.—I fancy I’ve seen you in the street once or twice. Have you been staying here long?
#LYNGSTRAND.
No, I have only been here a fortnight. But I hope I may be able to stay the whole summer.
#BALLESTED.
To enjoy the gaieties of the season, eh?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Well, rather to get up my strength a bit.
#BALLESTED.
Not an invalid, I hope?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Well, I’m what you might call a little bit of an invalid. Nothing to speak of, you know. It’s only a sort of short - windedness in my chest.
#BALLESTED.
Pooh—a mere trifle. Still, I would consult a good doctor, if I were you.
#LYNGSTRAND.
I thought, if I could find an opportunity, I might speak to Dr. Wangel.
#BALLESTED.
Yes, do. Here comes another steamer. Chock full of passengers. It’s extraordinary how the tourist business has increased here during the last few years.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, there seems to be a continual coming and going.
#BALLESTED.
The place is full of summer visitors too. I’m sometimes afraid that our good town may lose its character with all this foreign invasion.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Are you a native of the place?
#BALLESTED.
No, I am not. But I have accla—acclimatised myself. I have become attached to the place by the bonds of time and habit.
#LYNGSTRAND.
You have lived here a long time, then?
#BALLESTED.
Well, seventeen or eighteen years. I came here with Skive’s dramatic company. But we got into financial difficulties; so the company broke up and was scattered to the winds.
#LYNGSTRAND.
But you remained?
#BALLESTED.
I remained. And I have had no cause to regret it. You see in those days I was mainly employed as a scene - painter. comes out with a rocking - chair, which she places in the verandah.
#BOLETTA.
Hilda,—see if you can find the embroidered footstool for father.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Good morning, Miss Wangel.
#BOLETTA.
Ah, is that you, Mr. Lyngstrand? Good morning. Excuse me one moment.
#BALLESTED.
Do you know the family here?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Very slightly. I have met the young ladies once or twice at other houses. And I had a little talk with Mrs. Wangel the last time the band played up at the Prospect. She said I might come and see them.
#BALLESTED.
I’ll tell you what,—you ought to cultivate their acquaintance.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I’ve been thinking of paying them a visit—I mean calling on them, you know. If I could only find some pretext——
#BALLESTED.
Oh nonsense,—a pretext—— Confound it all! The steamer’s alongside the pier already. I must be off to the hotel. Perhaps some of the new arrivals may require my services. For I practise as a hair - cutter and friseur, too, I must tell you.
#LYNGSTRAND.
You seem to be very versatile.
#BALLESTED.
One must know how to ac—climatise oneself to various professions in these small places. If you should ever require anything in the hair line—pomade or what not—you have only to ask for Dancing - Master Ballested.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Dancing - Master——
#BALLESTED.
President of the Musical Society, if you prefer it. We give a concert up at the Prospect this evening. Good - bye, good - bye.
#HILDA.
Boletta said you had ventured in to - day.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I took the liberty of coming into the garden.
#HILDA.
Have you been out for your morning walk?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Well, no,—I haven’t had much of a walk to - day.
#HILDA.
Have you been bathing then?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I had a little dip. I saw your mother down there. She was just going into her bathing - house.
#HILDA.
Who was?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Your mother.
#HILDA.
Oh indeed.
#BOLETTA.
Did you see anything of my father’s boat out on the fiord?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I saw a sailing - boat that seemed to be standing inwards.
#BOLETTA.
That must have been father. He has been out visiting patients on the islands.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Why, what a splendid show of flowers you have here——!
#BOLETTA.
Yes, doesn’t it look nice?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh, charming. It looks as if the day were some family festival.
#HILDA.
So it is.
#LYNGSTRAND.
I guessed as much. Your father’s birthday, I suppose?
#BOLETTA.
H’m,—h’m!
#HILDA.
No, mother’s.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh indeed,—your mother’s, is it?
#BOLETTA.
Now, Hilda——!
#HILDA.
Let me alone! I suppose you’re going home to lunch now?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I suppose I must see about getting something to eat.
#HILDA.
I daresay you live on the fat of the land at the hotel.
#LYNGSTRAND.
I am not staying at the hotel now. It was too expensive for me.
#HILDA.
Where are you now, then?
#LYNGSTRAND.
I have a room at Madam Jensen’s.
#HILDA.
Which Madam Jensen’s?
#LYNGSTRAND.
The midwife’s.
#HILDA.
Excuse me, Mr. Lyngstrand, but I really have no time to——
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh, I suppose I oughtn’t to have said that.
#HILDA.
Said what?
#LYNGSTRAND.
What I said just now.
#HILDA.
I don’t in the least understand you.
#LYNGSTRAND.
No, no. Well, I must bid you good - bye for the present, ladies.
#BOLETTA.
Good - bye, good - bye, Mr. Lyngstrand. You must please excuse us for to - day.—But another time, when you have nothing better to do—and when you feel inclined,—I hope you’ll look in and see father and—and the rest of us.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Many thanks. I shall be only too delighted.
#HILDA.
Adieu, Mossyoo! My love to Mother Jensen.
#BOLLETTA.
Hilda——! You naughty child! Are you mad? He might easily hear you!
#HILDA.
Pooh,—do you think I care?
#BOLETTA.
Here comes father. WANGEL, in travelling dress, and carrying a hand - bag, comes along the foot - path from the right.
#WANGEL.
Well, here I am again, little girls!
#BOLETTA.
Oh, I’m so glad you have come.
#HILDA.
Have you finished for the day now, father?
#WANGEL.
Oh no, I must go down to the surgery for a little while by - and - by.—Tell me,—do you know whether Arnholm has arrived?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, he came last night. We sent to the hotel to inquire.
#WANGEL.
Then you haven’t seen him yet?
#BOLETTA.
No. But he’s sure to look in this forenoon.
#WANGEL.
Yes, of course he will.
#HILDA.
Father you must look about you now.
#WANGEL.
Yes, yes, my child, I see.—There is quite an air of festivity about the place.
#BOLETTA.
Don’t you think we have arranged it prettily?
#WANGEL.
Yes, you have indeed—Is—are we alone in the house?
#HILDA.
Yes, she has gone to——
#BOLETTA.
Mother is bathing.
#WANGEL.
Then he says, with some hesitation:] Look here, little girls—do you intend to keep up this display all day? And the flag flying too?
#HILDA.
Why, of course we do, father!
#WANGEL.
H’m—yes. But you see——
#BOLETTA.
Of course you understand that it’s all in honour of Mr. Arnholm. When such an old friend comes to pay his first visit to you——
#HILDA.
Remember—wasn’t he Boletta’s tutor, father?
#WANGEL.
You are a pair of young rogues.—Well well,—after all, it’s only natural that we should remember her who is no longer among us. But all the same——. Look here, Hilda. This must go down to the surgery.—No, little girls,—I don’t like all this—the manner of it, I mean. That we should make a practice every year of——. Well, what can one say? I suppose there is no other way of doing it.
#HILDA.
Look at that gentleman coming along the road. I believe it’s Mr. Arnholm.
#BOLETTA.
He! What an absurd idea! To take that middle - aged man for Mr Arnholm.
#WANGEL.
Wait a bit, child. Upon my life, I believe it’s he!—Yes, I am sure of it!
#BOLETTA.
Yes, I do believe it is! ARNHOLM, in elegant morning dress, with gold spectacles and a light cane, appears on the road, coming from the left. He looks somewhat over - worked. On seeing the party in the garden, he bows in a friendly way, and comes through the gate.
#WANGEL.
Welcome my dear Arnholm! Heartily welcome to your old haunts again.
#ARNHOLM.
Thank you, thank you, Doctor Wangel. A thousand thanks. And here are the children! These two I should scarcely have known again.
#WANGEL.
No, I daresay not.
#ARNHOLM.
Oh well,—perhaps Boletta.—Yes, I should have known Boletta.
#WANGEL.
Scarcely, I think. Let me see, it’s eight or nine years since you saw her last. Ah yes, there has been many a change here since then.
#ARNHOLM.
I should hardly say so. Except that the trees have grown a bit—and you have planted a new arbour there——
#WANGEL.
Oh no, outwardly I daresay.
#ARNHOLM.
And now, of course, you have two grown - up daughters in the house.
#WANGEL.
Oh, only one grown - up, surely.
#HILDA.
Just listen to father!
#WANGEL.
And now suppose we sit in the verandah. It’s cooler there than here. Come along.
#ARNHOLM.
Thanks, thanks, my dear Doctor.
#WANGEL.
That’s right. Now you shall just sit quiet and have a good rest. You are looking rather tired after your journey.
#ARNHOLM.
Oh, that’s nothing. Now that I am here again——
#BOLETTA.
Shall we bring a little soda - water and syrup into the garden - room? It will soon be too warm out here.
#WANGEL.
Yes do, little girls. Soda - water and syrup. And perhaps a little cognac.
#BOLETTA.
Cognac too?
#WANGEL.
Just a little. In case any one should care for it.
#BOLETTA.
Very well. Hilda, will you take the hand - bag down to the surgery?
#ARNHOLM.
What a splendid girl—what splendid girls they have grown into!
#WANGEL.
Yes, don’t you think so?
#ARNHOLM.
Boletta quite astonishes me—and Hilda too, for that matter.—But you yourself, my dear Doctor—do you intend to remain here for the rest of your days?
#WANGEL.
Oh yes, that’s what it will come to, I suppose. I was born and bred here, you see. Here I lived very very happily with her who was so early taken from us—with her whom you knew when you were here before, Arnholm.
#ARNHOLM.
Yes—yes.
#WANGEL.
And now I live here so happily with one who has come to me in her stead. I must say that, take it all in all, the fates have been kind to me.
#ARNHOLM.
You have no children by your second marriage?
#WANGEL.
We had a little boy, two or two and a half years ago. But we did not keep him long. He died when he was four or five months old.
#ARNHOLM.
Is your wife not at home to - day?
#WANGEL.
Oh yes, she’ll be here very soon. She has gone to bathe. She never misses a day at this season; no matter what the weather may be.
#ARNHOLM.
Is she out of health?
#WANGEL.
No, not exactly; but she has been curiously nervous the last couple of years or so—off and on, you know. I can’t quite make out what is wrong with her. But to get into the sea is life and happiness to her.
#ARNHOLM.
I remember that of old.
#WANGEL.
Yes, to be sure, you knew Ellida when you were tutor out at Skioldvik.
#ARNHOLM.
Of course. She often visited at the parsonage. And I used generally to see her when I went to the lighthouse to have a talk with her father.
#WANGEL.
Her life out there has left a deep impression upon her, as you may imagine. In town here people can’t understand it at all. They call her “the lady from the sea.”
#ARNHOLM.
Do they?
#WANGEL.
Yes. And look here—speak to her about the old days, my dear Arnholm. I am sure it will do her good.
#ARNHOLM.
Have you any particular reason to think so?
#WANGEL.
Yes, certainly I have.
#ELLIDA’S VOICE.
Are you there, Wangel?
#WANGEL.
Yes, dear.
#MRS.
WANGEL, with a large light cloak round her, and with wet hair hanging loose over her shoulders, comes from among the trees beside the arbour. ARNHOLM rises.
#WANGEL.
Ah, here comes the mermaid!
#ELLIDA.
Thank heaven, you’re safe home again! When did you come?
#WANGEL.
Just now—a few moments ago. But have you nothing to say to an old acquaintance——?
#ELLIDA.
So you have really come then? Welcome! And forgive my not being at home——
#ARNHOLM.
Oh, don’t mention it. Pray don’t stand on ceremony——
#WANGEL.
Was the water nice and cool to - day?
#ELLIDA.
Cool! Why, the water never is cool here—so tepid and flat. Pah! the water is sickly in here in the fiords.
#ARNHOLM.
Sickly?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, sickly. And I believe it makes one sickly too.
#WANGEL.
A nice testimonial for a sea - bathing place.
#ARNHOLM.
I should rather say that you, Mrs. Wangel, stand in a peculiar relation to the sea and all that belongs to it.
#ELLIDA.
Well, you may be right. I almost think so myself. But do you see how the girls have been decorating the place in your honour?
#WANGEL.
H’m. I’m afraid I must be going——
#ARNHOLM.
Is it really in my honour?
#ELLIDA.
Why, of course it is. We’re not so fine as this every day.—Pah! How suffocatingly hot it is under this roof! Come over here! Here there’s a breath of air to be had at any rate.
#ARNHOLM.
Now I should say the air was distinctly fresh here.
#ELLIDA.
Yes, you are used to the close air of Christiania. I’m told it is perfectly dreadful there in summer.
#WANGEL.
Ellida dear, I must leave you to entertain our good friend here for a while.
#ELLIDA.
Have you work to do?
#WANGEL.
Yes, I must go down to the surgery: and then I must change my clothes. But I shan’t be long——
#ARNHOLM.
Don’t hurry, my dear Doctor. Your wife and I will manage to pass the time.
#WANGEL.
Ah yes—I’m sure of that. Well, good - bye for the present then?
#ELLIDA.
Don’t you think it is nice sitting here?
#ARNHOLM.
I think it is very nice.
#ELLIDA.
This is called my summer - house; for it was I that had it built. Or rather Wangel—to please me.
#ARNHOLM.
And you sit here a good deal?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, I pass most of the day here.
#ARNHOLM.
With the girls, I suppose.
#ELLIDA.
No, the girls—they keep to the verandah.
#ARNHOLM.
And Wangel?
#ELLIDA.
Oh, Wangel goes to and fro. Sometimes he is here with me, and sometimes over there with the children.
#ARNHOLM.
Is it you that have arranged things so?
#ELLIDA.
I think it’s the arrangement that suits us all best. We can speak across to each other now and again—whenever we happen to have anything to say.
#ARNHOLM.
When last I crossed your path—out at Skioldvik, I mean——. H’m—that’s a long time ago——
#ELLIDA.
It is a good ten years since you were out there with us.
#ARNHOLM.
Yes, about that. But when I remember you out at the lighthouse——! “The heathen,” as the old pastor used to call you, because he said your father had had you christened with the name of a ship and not of a Christian——
#ELLIDA.
Well, what then?
#ARNHOLM.
The last thing I should have expected was to meet you again, here, as Mrs. Wangel.
#ELLIDA.
No, at that time Wangel was not yet a—— The girls’ first mother was living then—their own mother, I mean——
#ARNHOLM.
Of course, of course. But even if it had not been so—even if he had had no ties—I should never have expected this to come to pass.
#ELLIDA.
Nor I. Never in this world—at that time.
#ARNHOLM.
Wangel is such a fine fellow; so upright so genuinely good - hearted, and kind to every one——
#ELLIDA.
Yes, indeed he is!
#ARNHOLM.
——but he must be so utterly different from you, I should think.
#ELLIDA.
You are right there too; we are different.
#ARNHOLM.
Well then, how did it come about? How was it?
#ELLIDA.
You mustn’t ask me, my dear Arnholm. I shouldn’t be able to explain it to you. And even if I did, you could never really understand a word of my explanation.
#ARNHOLM.
H’m—— Have you ever told your husband anything about me? I mean, of course, about the unsuccessful step which—I was once rash enough to take.
#ELLIDA.
No. How can you think I would? I have never said a word to him—about what you allude to.
#ARNHOLM.
I am glad of that. I felt a little embarrassed at the thought that——
#ELLIDA.
You need not at all. I have only told him what is true—that I liked you very much, and that you were the truest and best friend I had out there.
#ARNHOLM.
Thank you for that. But now tell me—why have you never written to me since I left?
#ELLIDA.
I thought it might perhaps be painful to you to hear from one who—who could not meet your wishes. It would have been like opening an old wound, I thought.
#ARNHOLM.
H’m—— Well, well, I daresay you were right.
#ELLIDA.
But why did you never write?
#ARNHOLM.
I? I begin? And perhaps be suspected of wishing to reopen the attack? After meeting with such a rebuff?
#ELLIDA.
Oh no, I can understand that too.—Have you never thought of forming some other tie?
#ARNHOLM.
Never. I have remained faithful to my memories.
#ELLIDA.
Oh, nonsense! Let those sad old memories go. I am sure you had much better think about getting happily married.
#ARNHOLM.
Then I have no time to lose, Mrs. Wangel. Remember—I blush to say it—I shall never see seven - and - thirty again.
#ELLIDA.
Well then, all the more reason to make haste. But listen now, my dear Arnholm,—I am going to tell you something I could not have told you at that time, to save my life.
#ARNHOLM.
What may that be?
#ELLIDA.
When you took—that unsuccessful step, as you said just now,—I could not answer you otherwise than I did.
#ARNHOLM.
I know that. You had nothing but friendship to offer me. I quite understand that.
#ELLIDA.
But you do not know that my whole mind and all my thoughts were centred elsewhere at that time?
#ARNHOLM.
At that time?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, just then.
#ARNHOLM.
But that is impossible! You are mistaking the time! I don’t believe you knew Wangel then.
#ELLIDA.
It is not Wangel that I am speaking of.
#ARNHOLM.
Not Wangel? But at that time—out at Skioldvik—I don’t remember another creature that I could conceive your caring for.
#ELLIDA.
No, no,—I daresay not. For the whole thing was such utter madness.
#ARNHOLM.
Do tell me more about this!
#ELLIDA.
Oh, it is enough for you to know that I was not free at that time. And now you do know it.
#ARNHOLM.
And if you had been free at that time?
#ELLIDA.
What then? Arnholm. Would your answer to my letter have been different?
#ELLIDA.
How can I tell? When Wangel came, my answer was different.
#ARNHOLM.
Then what is the use of telling me that you were not free?
#ELLIDA.
Because I must have some one I can speak to about it. No, no, don’t rise.
#ARNHOLM.
Your husband, then, knows nothing of the matter?
#ELLIDA.
I told him from the first that my thoughts had once been drawn elsewhere. He has never wanted to know more. We have never touched upon the subject since. After all, it was nothing but a piece of madness; and then it all came to an end so quickly. At least,—in a way.
#ARNHOLM.
Only in a way? Not entirely?
#ELLIDA.
Oh yes, of course! My dear good Arnholm, it is not at all as you suppose. It’s something quite incomprehensible. I don’t think I could find words to tell you of it. You would only think I was ill—or else that I was stark mad.
#ARNHOLM.
My dear Mrs. Wangel—now you must and shall tell me the whole story.
#ELLIDA.
Well then—I suppose I must try. How should you, with your common sense, ever be able to understand that—— Wait—another time—here is some one coming. appears on the road, from the left, and enters the garden. He has a flower in his button - hole, and carries a large handsome bouquet, wrapped round with paper and tied with ribbons. He stops, hesitating a little, in front of the verandah.
#ELLIDA.
Is it the girls you are looking for, Mr. Lyngstrand?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Ah, are you there, Mrs. Wangel? No, not exactly—it wasn’t the young ladies. It was you yourself, Mrs. Wangel. You gave me permission to come and see you——
#ELLIDA.
Yes, of course I did. You are always welcome here.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Many thanks. I fortunately happened to hear that this was a day of rejoicing in the family——
#ELLIDA.
Ah, so you know that?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes; and so I make so bold as to offer you this, Mrs. Wangel——
#ELLIDA.
But, my dear Mr. Lyngstrand, ought you not to give your beautiful flowers to Mr. Arnholm himself? For it’s in his honour that——
#LYNGSTRAND.
I beg your pardon—I don’t know this gentleman. It’s only——. I meant them for a birthday gift, Mrs. Wangel. birthday gift? Then you have made a mistake, Mr. Lyngstrand. To - day is not the birthday of any one in this house.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh, I know all about it. But I didn’t know it was such a secret.
#ELLIDA.
What is it you know?
#LYNGSTRAND.
That it’s your birthday, Mrs. Wangel——
#ELLIDA.
Mine?
#ARNHOLM.
To - day? No, surely not.
#ELLIDA.
What has put that into your head?
#LYNGSTRAND.
It was Miss Hilda that let it out. I happened to look in a little while ago, and I asked the young ladies why they had made such a grand display of flowers and flags——
#ELLIDA.
Well?
#LYNGSTRAND.
——and Miss Hilda answered: “Oh, because it’s mother’s birthday.”
#ELLIDA.
Mother’s——! Oh indeed.
#ARNHOLM.
Aha!
#ARNHOLM.
Well, since the young man has found it out, Mrs. Wangel——
#ELLIDA.
Yes, since you have found it out——
#LYNGSTRAND.
May I be permitted to offer my congratulations——?
#ELLIDA.
Many thanks.—Won’t you sit down a moment, Mr. Lyngstrand?
#ELLIDA.
All this about—about my birthday—was to have been a secret, Mr. Arnholm.
#ARNHOLM.
So I see. It was not to have been mentioned to us outsiders.
#ELLIDA.
No, just so. Not to outsiders.
#LYNGSTRAND.
I promise faithfully I won’t mention it to a living creature.
#ELLIDA.
Oh, I didn’t mean it in that way.—But how are you now? I think you are looking better than you did.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I think I am getting on quite well. And next year, if I can get to the south——
#ELLIDA.
The girls tell me you hope to manage it.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes; you see I have a patron in Bergen who provides for me; and he has promised to let me go next year.
#ELLIDA.
How did you come across him?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh, it was a great stroke of luck. I once went a voyage in one of his ships.
#ELLIDA.
Did you? Then at that time you wanted to be a sailor?
#LYNGSTRAND.
No, not in the least. But after my mother died, my father wouldn’t have me hanging about at home; so he sent me to sea. On the voyage home, we were wrecked in the English Channel; and that was a grand thing for me.
#ARNHOLM.
How do you mean?
#LYNGSTRAND.
It was in the wreck that I got my lesion—this weakness in my chest, you know. I was in the ice - cold water so long before they came and rescued me. So then I had to give up the sea—Oh yes, it was a great stroke of luck.
#ARNHOLM.
Indeed? You think so?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes; for the lesion is nothing to speak of; and now I am to have my heart’s desire, and to be a sculptor. Only think—to be able to model in the delicate clay that yields so exquisitely under your fingers!
#ELLIDA.
And what are you going to model? Mermen and mermaids? Or is it to be old vikings——?
#LYNGSTRAND.
No, nothing of that kind. As soon as I can manage it, I mean to have a try at a big piece of work—a group, as they call it.
#ELLIDA.
I see. And what is the group to represent?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh, I thought of something out of my own experience.
#ARNHOLM.
Yes yes,—by all means stick to that.
#ELLIDA.
But what is it to be?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Well, I had thought of a young woman, a sailor’s wife, lying and sleeping in a strange unrest, and dreaming as she sleeps. I think I can make it so that any one can see she is dreaming.
#ARNHOLM.
And is that all?
#LYNGSTRAND.
No. There is to be one other figure—a kind of shape you might call it. It is the husband she has been unfaithful to while he was away. And now he is drowned.
#ARNHOLM.
Why, what do you mean——?
#ELLIDA.
Drowned you say?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, he is drowned at sea. But the strange thing is that he has come home nevertheless. It’s in the night - time; and there he stands by her bedside and looks at her. He must be dripping wet, just as when they haul you up out of the sea.
#ELLIDA.
What a strange idea! Oh, I can see it livingly before my eyes.
#ARNHOLM.
But in the name of all that’s wonderful, Mr. ——! Mr. ——! You said it was to be something out of your own experience?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes,—this is out of my own experience; in a sense, that’s to say.
#ARNHOLM.
You have seen a dead man come——?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Well, I don’t mean to say I have actually seen it; not outwardly, of course. But all the same——
#ELLIDA.
Tell me all you know about this! I want to understand it thoroughly.
#ARNHOLM.
Yes, of course this is quite in your line—anything with the glamour of the sea about it.
#ELLIDA.
How was it then, Mr. Lyngstrand?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Well, you see, when we were starting for home in the brig, from a town they call Halifax, we had to leave our boatswain behind us in the hospital; so we shipped an American in his place. This new boatswain——
#ELLIDA.
The American?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes;—one day he borrowed from the captain a bundle of old newspapers, and was perpetually poring over them, he wanted to learn Norwegian, he said.
#ELLIDA.
Well; and then?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Well, one evening it was blowing great guns. All hands were on deck—all except the boatswain and me. For he had sprained his ankle and couldn’t walk; and I wasn’t very well, and was lying in my bunk. Well, there he sat in the fo’c’sle, reading away as usual at one of the old papers——
#ELLIDA.
Well? well?
#LYNGSTRAND.
When all of a sudden, I heard him give a kind of a roar; and when I looked at him I saw that his face was as white as chalk. Then he set to work to crumple and crush the paper up, and tear it into a thousand little pieces; but that he did quietly, quietly.
#ELLIDA.
Did he say nothing at all? Did he not speak?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Not at first. But presently he said, as if to himself: “Married—to another man—while I was away.”
#ELLIDA.
Did he say that?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes; and would you believe it—he said it in perfectly good Norwegian. He must have had a great gift for languages, that man.
#ELLIDA.
And what then? What happened next?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Now comes the wonderful part of it—a thing I shall never forget to my dying day. For he added,—and this quite quietly too: “But mine she is, and mine she shall remain. And follow me she shall, though I should have to go home and fetch her, as a drowned man from the bottom of the sea.”
#ELLIDA.
Pah—how close it is to - day——!
#LYNGSTRAND.
And he said it with such force of will that I felt he was the man to do it too.
#ELLIDA.
Do you know at all—what has become of this man?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh he’s dead, Mrs. Wangel, beyond a doubt.
#ELLIDA.
What makes you think that?
#LYNGSTRAND.
We were shipwrecked afterwards in the Channel, you know. I got off in the long - boat with the captain and five others; but the mate went in the dingey, and with him was the American and one man besides.
#ELLIDA.
And nothing has been heard of them since?
#LYNGSTRAND.
No, not a word, Mrs. Wangel. My patron wrote me so, only the other day. And that is the very reason I am so anxious to make a group of it. I can see the sailor’s faithless wife so life - like before me; and then the avenger, who is drowned, but nevertheless comes home from sea. I have them both before my eyes as distinctly as possible.
#ELLIDA.
So have I. Come,—let us go in. Or rather down to Wangel! It seems to me so stifling here.
#LYNGSTRAND.
I think I must be going now. I only just looked in to wish you many happy returns of the day.
#ELLIDA.
Well, if you must go—— Good - bye, and thanks for the flowers.
#ARNHOLM.
I can see that this has pained you deeply, my dear Mrs. Wangel.
#ELLIDA.
Oh yes, I suppose you may put it so, although——
#ARNHOLM.
But after all, it is only what you must have been prepared for.
#ELLIDA.
Prepared for?
#ARNHOLM.
Yes, so I should think.
#ELLIDA.
Prepared for his returning——? Returning in such a way?
#ARNHOLM.
Why, what in the world——! Is it that crazy sculptor’s cock - and - bull story——?
#ELLIDA.
Ah, my dear Arnholm, he is perhaps not so crazy as you think.
#ARNHOLM.
Can it be this nonsense about the dead man that has moved you so much? I thought it was——
#ELLIDA.
What did you think?
#ARNHOLM.
Of course, I thought that was only a blind on your part. I fancied you were pained by the discovery that a family anniversary was being celebrated without your knowledge—that your husband and his children are living a life of memories in which you have no share.
#ELLIDA.
Oh no, no; that must be as it may. I have no right to claim my husband for myself alone.
#ARNHOLM.
Yet it seems to me you ought to have that right.
#ELLIDA.
Yes; but as a matter of fact I haven’t. That is the thing. I too live a life—in which the others have no part.
#ARNHOLM.
You! Am I to understand that—you—you do not really love your husband?
#ELLIDA.
Oh yes, yes—I have come to love him with my whole heart! And that is just why it is so terrible—so inexplicable—so absolutely inconceivable——!
#ARNHOLM.
Now you must tell me all your troubles without reserve! Will you not, Mrs. Wangel?
#ELLIDA.
I cannot, dear friend—not now, at any rate. Sometime, perhaps.
#BOLETTA.
Father is coming from the surgery now. Shan’t we all sit together in the garden - room?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, let us. WANGEL, who has changed his clothes, comes with HILDA from the left, behind the house.
#WANGEL.
Well now, here I am, a free man! A glass of something cool wouldn’t come amiss now.
#ELLIDA.
Wait a moment.
#HILDA.
Oh I say! All those lovely flowers! Where did you get them?
#ELLIDA.
I got them from Lyngstrand the sculptor, my dear Hilda.
#HILDA.
From Lyngstrand?
#BOLETTA.
Has Lyngstrand been here—again?
#ELLIDA.
Yes. He came to bring this bouquet,—a birthday offering, you know.
#BOLETTA.
Oh——!
#HILDA.
The beast!
#WANGEL.
H’m——. Well, you see—I must tell you, my darling Ellida——
#ELLIDA.
Come along, girls! Let us put my flowers in water, with the others.
#BOLETTA.
She is really good after all, you see.
#HILDA.
Monkey - tricks! She’s only putting it on to please father.
#WANGEL.
Thank you—thank you——! I thank you from my heart for this, Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
Oh, nonsense,—why should I not join with you in keeping—mother’s birthday?
#ARNHOLM.
H’m——!
#BALLESTED.
Sehen Sie, meine Herrschaften—over dort liegt eine andere height. Das willen wir besteigen too, un herunter——
#BOLETTA.
My dear Hilda, why should we run away from Lyngstrand?
#HILDA.
Because I can’t endure to walk up hill so slowly. Look—look at him crawling up.
#BOLETTA.
Oh, you know how ill he is.
#HILDA.
Do you think it’s very serious?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, I am sure it is.
#HILDA.
He consulted father this afternoon. I wonder what father thinks of him.
#BOLETTA.
Father told me that he has a hardening of the lungs—or something of that sort. He won’t last very long, father says.
#HILDA.
Did he really say so? Well now, that’s exactly what I’ve been thinking.
#BOLETTA.
But for heaven’s sake don’t let him suspect anything.
#HILDA.
Oh, how can you think I would. There!—now Hans has managed to clamber up. Hans——! Can’t you see by the look of him that his name is Hans?
#BOLETTA.
Do be good now! I warn you! enters from the right, a parasol in his hand.
#LYNGSTRAND.
I must beg your pardon, young ladies, for not being able to keep up with you.
#HILDA.
So you have got a parasol now?
#LYNGSTRAND.
It’s your mother’s. She said I might use it for a stick, as I hadn’t brought one with me.
#BOLETTA.
Are they still down there? Father and the others?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes. Your father went into the restaurant for a moment, and the others are sitting outside listening to the music; but they’ll come up by - and - by, your mother said.
#HILDA.
I suppose you are very tired now?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I almost think I am a little tired. I really believe I must sit down a bit.
#HILDA.
Do you know that there’s to be dancing presently, down by the band - stand?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I heard something of it.
#HILDA.
I suppose you are very fond of dancing!
#BOLETTA.
Oh, Hilda—let Mr. Lyngstrand get his breath.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, Miss Hilda, I should like very much to dance—if only I could.
#HILDA.
Oh I see; you have never learned.
#LYNGSTRAND.
No, I haven’t. But that was not what I meant. I meant that I can’t dance on account of my chest.
#HILDA.
On account of that “lesion” you spoke of?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, that’s it.
#HILDA.
Does this “lesion” make you very unhappy?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh no, I can’t say it does. For I believe it is that which makes everybody so kind and friendly and helpful to me.
#HILDA.
Yes; and of course it’s not a bit serious.
#LYNGSTRAND.
No, not serious in the least. I could see quite well that your father thought so too.
#HILDA.
And it will pass off as soon as you go abroad?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes; it will pass off.
#BOLETTA.
Look at these, Mr. Lyngstrand—here is one for your button - hole.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh, a thousand thanks, Miss Wangel! You are really too kind.
#HILDA.
Here they are, coming up the path.
#BOLETTA.
I hope they know where to turn off. No, they are going the wrong way.
#LYNGSTRAND.
I’ll run down to the turning and call out to them.
#HILDA.
You’ll have to call very loud then.
#BOLETTA.
No, you had better not. You’ll only tire yourself again.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh, it’s so easy going downhill.
#HILDA.
Yes, downhill. Now he’s jumping too! And it never occurs to him that he will have to come up again.
#BOLETTA.
Poor creature——!
#HILDA.
If Lyngstrand were to propose to you, would you have him?
#BOLETTA.
Are you out of your senses?
#HILDA.
Oh I mean, of course, if he hadn’t this “lesion”—and if he weren’t going to die so soon. Would you have him then?
#BOLETTA.
I think you had better have him.
#HILDA.
No, I’m bothered if I would. He hasn’t a rap. He hasn’t enough to live upon himself.
#BOLETTA.
Why are you always so much taken up with him then?
#HILDA.
Oh, that’s only on account of his “lesion.”
#BOLETTA.
I have never noticed that you pity him a bit.
#HILDA.
No more I do. But it’s so tempting to me——
#BOLETTA.
What is?
#HILDA.
To look at him, and get him to say that it’s not serious, and that he’s going abroad and going to be an artist. He’s perfectly convinced of all that, and as happy as possible about it. And to know that nothing will come of it after all; nothing whatever; that he won’t live long enough——I find that so thrilling to think of.
#BOLETTA.
Thrilling!
#HILDA.
Yes. I find it thrilling—I take that liberty.
#BOLETTA.
Fie Hilda, you are really a horrid child!
#HILDA.
Well, that’s what I want to be—just for spite! Ah, at last! Arnholm doesn’t seem to enjoy climbing. Oh, by - the - bye—what do you think I noticed about Arnholm while we were at dinner?
#BOLETTA.
What?
#HILDA.
Only think, he’s beginning to turn bald—right on the crown of his head.
#BOLETTA.
Oh rubbish! I’m sure he isn’t.
#HILDA.
Yes he is. And he has wrinkles here, round both his eyes. Good heavens, Boletta, how could you be so gone on him when he was your tutor?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, can you understand it? I remember once shedding bitter tears because he said he thought Boletta an ugly name.
#HILDA.
Think of that! I say! Look there! Just look!—There’s “the lady from the sea” walking with him—not with father—and jabbering away to him. I wonder whether those two aren’t a bit sweet on each other.
#BOLETTA.
You ought really to be ashamed of yourself. How dare you say such things about her? We were beginning to get on so well together——
#HILDA.
Oh, indeed!—Don’t you believe it, my girl! I tell you we shall never get on well with her. She doesn’t suit us, nor we her. Heaven knows what tempted father to drag her into the house!—I shouldn’t wonder a bit if she were to go mad on our hands some fine day.
#BOLETTA.
Mad? What makes you think such a thing?
#HILDA.
Oh, there would be nothing so wonderful about it. Didn’t her mother go mad? She died mad, I know.
#BOLETTA.
Yes, I should like to know what you don’t poke your nose into. All I say is, don’t go chattering about it. Be good now—for father’s sake. Do you hear, Hilda?
#ELLIDA.
It lies out there.
#ARNHOLM.
Yes, of course; it must be in that direction.
#ELLIDA.
Out there lies the sea.
#BOLETTA.
Don’t you think it’s pretty up here?
#ARNHOLM.
I should rather say grand—a glorious view!
#WANGEL.
I daresay you have never been up here before?
#ARNHOLM.
No, never. In my time I doubt if it was accessible. There wasn’t even a footpath.
#WANGEL.
And no grounds laid out either. We have done all that in the last few years.
#BOLETTA.
Over there, on the Pilot’s Knoll, the view is even finer.
#WANGEL.
Shall we go there, Ellida?
#ELLIDA.
Thank you, I won’t go. But you others ought to. I shall stay here in the meantime.
#WANGEL.
Very well; then I’ll stay with you. The girls can do the honours for Arnholm.
#BOLETTA.
Do you care to come with us, Mr. Arnholm?
#ARNHOLM.
Yes, I should like to. Is there a path up there too?
#BOLETTA.
Oh yes; a good broad path.
#HILDA.
There’s plenty of room for two people to go arm - in - arm.
#ARNHOLM.
I wonder if there is, little Miss Hilda? Shall we two try if she is right?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, if you like. Let us.
#HILDA.
Shall we go too——?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Arm - in - arm——?
#HILDA.
Why not? I don’t mind.
#LYNGSTRAND.
This is great fun, isn’t it?
#HILDA.
Great fun——?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Why, it looks exactly as if we were engaged.
#HILDA.
I suppose you have never given a lady your arm before, Mr. Lyngstrand.
#WANGEL.
Dear Ellida, now we have a little time to ourselves——
#ELLIDA.
Yes, come and sit here beside me.
#WANGEL.
It’s so open and peaceful here. Now let us have a little talk.
#ELLIDA.
What about?
#WANGEL.
About you; and about our relation to each other, Ellida. I see well enough that this state of things cannot continue.
#ELLIDA.
What would you have in its place?
#WANGEL.
Full confidence, dear. A life in common—such as we used to live.
#ELLIDA.
Oh, if that could only be! But it’s so utterly impossible!
#WANGEL.
I think I understand you. From certain things you have let fall now and then, I believe I do.
#ELLIDA.
No you don’t! Don’t say that you understand——!
#WANGEL.
Oh yes. Yours is an upright nature, Ellida. You have a loyal heart.
#ELLIDA.
Yes, I have.
#WANGEL.
Any relation in which you can feel secure and happy must be a full and perfect one.
#ELLIDA.
Well,—and then?
#WANGEL.
You are not fitted to be a man’s second wife.
#ELLIDA.
What makes you think of that now?
#WANGEL.
The suspicion has often crossed my mind; but to - day I saw it clearly. The children’s little commemoration—you looked on me as a sort of accomplice.—Well yes; a man’s memories are not to be wiped out—not mine, at all events. It is not in my nature.
#ELLIDA.
I know that. Oh, I know it so well.
#WANGEL.
But you are mistaken, none the less. It seems to you almost as though the children’s mother were still alive. You feel her invisible presence in our midst. You think that my heart is equally divided between you and her. It is this idea that revolts you. You see, as it were, something immoral in our relation; and that is why you cannot, or will not, live with me any more as my wife.
#ELLIDA.
Have you seen all this, Wangel? Seen through all this?
#WANGEL.
Yes, to - day I have at last seen through it—into the very depths.
#ELLIDA.
Into the very depths, you say. Oh, you mustn’t think that.
#WANGEL.
I know very well that there is more than this, dear Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
You know that there is more?
#WANGEL.
Yes. There is this: that you cannot endure your surroundings here. The mountains oppress you and weigh upon your spirits. There is not light enough for you here—the horizon is not wide enough—the air not strong and stimulating enough for you.
#ELLIDA.
There you are quite right. Night and day, winter and summer, it is upon me—this haunting home - sickness for the sea.
#WANGEL.
I know it well, dear Ellida. And therefore the poor sick child must go to its own home again.
#ELLIDA.
How do you mean?
#WANGEL.
Quite literally. We will move.
#ELLIDA.
Move!
#WANGEL.
Yes. Out somewhere by the open sea,—to some place where you may find a real home, after your own heart.
#ELLIDA.
Oh, my dear, you mustn’t think of that! It’s quite impossible. You could never live happily anywhere in the world but here.
#WANGEL.
That must be as it may. And besides—do you think I can live happily here—without you?
#ELLIDA.
But here I am; and here I will remain. Am I not yours?
#WANGEL.
Are you mine, Ellida?
#ELLIDA.
Oh, please say no more of that scheme. Here you have all that is life and breath to you. Your whole life - work lies here, and here only.
#WANGEL.
That must be as it may, I say. We will move from here—move seaward somewhere. My mind is made up beyond recall, dear Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
Oh, but what do you suppose we shall gain by that?
#WANGEL.
You will regain your health and peace of mind.
#ELLIDA.
I doubt it. But you yourself! Think of yourself too. What would you gain?
#WANGEL.
I should regain you, my dearest.
#ELLIDA.
But that you cannot do! No, no, you cannot, Wangel! That is just the terrible, the heart - breaking part of it.
#WANGEL.
That remains to be seen. If you are haunted by such thoughts here, then assuredly there is nothing for it but to get you away from here. And the sooner the better. My mind is made up beyond recall, I tell you.
#ELLIDA.
No! Rather than that,—Heaven help me—I will tell you everything without reserve, exactly as it is.
#WANGEL.
Yes, yes—do!
#ELLIDA.
You shall not make yourself unhappy for my sake; especially as it would do us no good, after all.
#WANGEL.
You have promised to tell me everything—exactly as it stands.
#ELLIDA.
I will tell you as well as I can,—and as far as I understand things.—Come here and sit by me.
#WANGEL.
Well, Ellida? Well——?
#ELLIDA.
That day when you came out there and asked me if I could and would be yours—you spoke to me frankly and openly about your first marriage. You said it had been very happy.
#WANGEL.
And so it was.
#ELLIDA.
Yes, yes; I do not doubt it, dear. That is not why I speak of it now. I only want to remind you that I, on my side, was frank with you. I told you quite openly that I had once in my life cared for some one else. That it had come to—a sort of betrothal between us. sort of——?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, something of the kind. Well, it lasted only a very short time. He went away; and afterwards I broke it off. All this I told you.
#WANGEL.
But, dear Ellida, why go back upon all this? After all, it did not really concern me. I have never even asked you who he was.
#ELLIDA.
No, you have not. You are always so considerate to me.
#WANGEL.
Well, in this case,—I scarcely needed to be told his name.
#ELLIDA.
His name?
#WANGEL.
Out at Skioldvik and in those parts there were not many to choose from. Or rather, there was only one man——
#ELLIDA.
I suppose you think it was—Arnholm.
#WANGEL.
Yes—was it not?
#ELLIDA.
No.
#WANGEL.
It was not? Well then I am certainly at a loss.
#ELLIDA.
Do you remember that, in the late autumn one year, a large American ship came into Skioldvik for repairs?
#WANGEL.
Yes, I remember it well. It was on board her that the captain was found murdered in his cabin one morning. I remember going to make the post - mortem.
#ELLIDA.
Yes, you did.
#WANGEL.
It was said to be the second mate who had killed him.
#ELLIDA.
No one can tell that! It was never proved.
#WANGEL.
No; but I think there is no doubt about it. Else why should he have gone and drowned himself?
#ELLIDA.
He did not drown himself. He escaped in a vessel bound for the north.
#WANGEL.
How do you know that?
#ELLIDA.
Because, Wangel—because it was that second mate to whom I—was betrothed.
#WANGEL.
What do you say? Can this be possible?
#ELLIDA.
Yes,—he was the man.
#WANGEL.
But how in the world, Ellida——? How could you do such a thing! Go and engage yourself to such a man as that! A man you knew nothing on earth about!—What was his name?
#ELLIDA.
He called himself Friman then. Afterwards, in his letters, he signed himself Alfred Johnston.
#WANGEL.
And where did he come from?
#ELLIDA.
From Finmark, he said. He was born over in Finland though. He had come across the frontier as a child,—with his father I think.
#WANGEL.
He was a Quæn, then.
#ELLIDA.
Yes, I believe they are called so.
#WANGEL.
What more do you know of him?
#ELLIDA.
Only that he went to sea very young, and that he had made long voyages. Nothing else?
#ELLIDA.
No; we never talked about such things.
#WANGEL.
What did you talk about then?
#ELLIDA.
Mainly about the sea.
#WANGEL.
Ah——! About the sea?
#ELLIDA.
About storm and calm. About dark nights at sea. About the sea in the glittering sunshine, too. But we talked most about the whales, and the porpoises, and the seals that lie out upon the reefs and bask in the midday sun. And then we spoke of the gulls and the eagles, and all the other sea - birds, you know. And—is it not strange?—when we talked of such things, it seemed to me as though both the sea - animals and the sea - birds were akin to him.
#WANGEL.
And you yourself——?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, I almost thought that I, too, was akin to all of them.
#WANGEL.
Yes, yes.—And that was how you came to betroth yourself to him?
#ELLIDA.
Yes; he said I was to do it.
#WANGEL.
Was to? Had you no will of your own?
#ELLIDA.
Not when he was near. Oh—afterwards it all seemed so utterly inexplicable to me.
#WANGEL.
Did you see him often?
#ELLIDA.
No, not very often. He went over the lighthouse one day; that is how I came to know him. And afterwards we used to meet occasionally. But then came this affair about the captain; and he had to go away.
#WANGEL.
Oh yes, let me hear about that!
#ELLIDA.
It was in the dusk of the early morning that I got a line from him. It said that I must come out to him at Bratthammer—you know, the headland between the lighthouse and Skioldvik.
#WANGEL.
Yes, yes—I know it well.
#ELLIDA.
I must come there immediately, the note said for he wanted to speak to me.
#WANGEL.
And you went?
#ELLIDA.
Yes. I could not help it. Well—he told me that he had stabbed the captain in the night.
#WANGEL.
He told you himself! Said it straight out!
#ELLIDA.
Yes. But he had only done what was right and just, he said.
#WANGEL.
Right and just? What reason did he give, then, for stabbing him?
#ELLIDA.
He would not tell me the reason. He said it was not a thing for me to hear about.
#WANGEL.
And you believed him, on his bare word?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, I never thought of doubting him. Well, at all events he had to go away. But when he was on the point of saying good - bye to me——No, you could never imagine what he did.
#WANGEL.
Well, tell me then.
#ELLIDA.
He took a key - ring out of his pocket, and drew off his finger a ring he used to wear. Then he took from me a little ring that I had, and these two he slipped together on the key - ring. And then he said that now we two should together be wedded to the sea.
#WANGEL.
Wedded——?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, so he said. And then he flung the large ring and the two small ones as far as ever he could into the deep water.
#WANGEL.
And you, Ellida? Did you agree to that?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, would you believe it, I thought at the time that it was all as it should be.—But, thank heaven, then he went away!
#WANGEL.
And when once he was away?
#ELLIDA.
Oh, you may be sure I soon came to my senses again. I saw how utterly stupid and meaningless the whole thing had been.
#WANGEL.
But you said something about letters. Did you hear from him afterwards?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, I heard from him. First, I got a line or two from Archangel. He said nothing but that he was going over to America; and he told me where to address an answer.
#WANGEL.
Did you write?
#ELLIDA.
Immediately. I said, of course, that all must be over between us—that he must never think of me again, as I meant never to think any more of him.
#WANGEL.
And did he write again, in spite of that?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, he wrote again.
#WANGEL.
And what was his answer to what you had said?
#ELLIDA.
Not a word. He wrote just as if I had never broken with him. He told me quite calmly that I must wait for him. When he was ready for me he would let me know, and then I was to come to him at once.
#WANGEL.
Then he would not release you?
#ELLIDA.
No. So I wrote again, almost word for word the same as before: only more strongly.
#WANGEL.
And did he give way then?
#ELLIDA.
Oh no, far from it. He wrote as calmly as before. Never a word about my having broken with him. Then I saw it was useless, so I wrote to him no more.
#WANGEL.
And did not hear from him either?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, I have had three letters from him since. Once he wrote from California and once from China. The last letter I got from him was from Australia. He said he was going to the goldmines; and since then I have heard nothing from him.
#WANGEL.
That man must have had an extraordinary power over you, Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
Oh yes, yes. That terrible man!
#WANGEL.
But you must not think any more about it. Never! Promise me that, my dear, my precious Ellida! We will try another cure for you now—a fresher air than this of the inner fiord. The salt - laden, sweeping sea - breezes, dear! What do you say to that?
#ELLIDA.
Oh, don’t speak of it! Don’t think of such a thing! There is no help for me in that! I know, I feel, that I should not be able to throw it off out there either.
#WANGEL.
To throw what off, dear? What do you mean?
#ELLIDA.
I mean the terror of him. His unfathomable power over my soul——
#WANGEL.
But you have thrown it off! Long ago; when you broke with him. It is all over, long ago.
#ELLIDA.
No, that is just what it is not!
#WANGEL.
Not over!
#ELLIDA.
No, Wangel—it is not over! And I am afraid it never will be over. Never in this life.
#WANGEL.
Do you mean to say that you have never in your heart of hearts been able to forget that strange man?
#ELLIDA.
I had forgotten him. But then, all at once, he seemed to come again.
#WANGEL.
How long ago is that?
#ELLIDA.
It is about three years ago now, or a little more. It was whilst—before the child was born.
#WANGEL.
Ah! It was then, was it? In that case, Ellida—I begin to understand much more clearly.
#ELLIDA.
You are wrong, dear! This thing that has come over me—oh, I don’t think it can ever be understood.
#WANGEL.
To think that for all these three years your heart has been given to another man. To another! Not to me,—but to another!
#ELLIDA.
Oh, you utterly misunderstand me. I love no one but you.
#WANGEL.
How is it, then, that for all that time you have refused to live with me as my wife?
#ELLIDA.
That is because of the dread the strange man has cast over me.
#WANGEL.
Dread——?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, dread. Such a dread, such a terror, as can arise only from the sea. For now I must tell you, Wangel——
#LYNGSTRAND. BOLETTA.
What! Still up here?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, it’s so delightfully cool up here on the heights.
#ARNHOLM.
For our part, we are going down to have a dance.
#WANGEL.
Very well. We will come too, in a little while.
#HILDA.
Good - bye for the present then.
#ELLIDA.
Mr. Lyngstrand—will you please wait a moment?
#ELLIDA.
Are you going to dance too?
#LYNGSTRAND.
No, Mrs. Wangel, I’m afraid I must not.
#ELLIDA.
No, you ought to be careful. That weakness in your chest—you have not quite got over it yet.
#LYNGSTRAND.
No, not thoroughly.
#ELLIDA.
How long is it now since you made that voyage——?
#LYNGSTRAND.
When I got the lesion?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, that voyage you were telling us about this morning.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh well, it must be about—wait a bit—yes, it was just three years ago.
#ELLIDA.
Three years?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Or a little more. We left America in February, and we were wrecked in March. We got into the equinoctial gales.
#ELLIDA.
You see that was the time——
#WANGEL.
But, my dear Ellida——?
#ELLIDA.
Well, don’t let us detain you, Mr. Lyngstrand, Go; but don’t dance.
#LYNGSTRAND.
No, I shall only look on.
#WANGEL.
Dear Ellida—why did you cross - question him about that voyage?
#ELLIDA.
Johnston was in the same ship. Of that I am perfectly certain.
#WANGEL.
What makes you think so?
#ELLIDA.
He came to know, during the voyage, that I had married some one else, while he was away. And then—at the very same moment, this came upon me!
#WANGEL.
This dread?
#ELLIDA.
Yes. Sometimes, without the smallest warning, I suddenly see him stand bodily before me. Or rather a little to one side. He never looks at me; he is only there.
#WANGEL.
How does he appear to you?
#ELLIDA.
Just as I saw him last.
#WANGEL.
Ten years ago?
#ELLIDA.
Yes. Out at Bratthammer. I see his scarf - pin most distinctly of all, with a large, bluish - white pearl in it. That pearl is like a dead fish’s eye. And it seems to glare at me.
#WANGEL.
Good God——! You are more ill than I thought; more ill than you know yourself, Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
Yes, yes,—help me if you can! For I feel it closing round me more and more.
#WANGEL.
And you have been in this state for three whole years. You have suffered this secret anguish without confiding in me!
#ELLIDA.
Oh I could not! Not till now, when it became necessary for your own sake. If I had told you all this—then I must also have told you—the unspeakable.
#WANGEL.
The unspeakable——?
#ELLIDA.
No, no, no! Do not ask! Only one thing more, and I have done.—Wangel—how shall we fathom the mystery—of the child’s eyes——?
#WANGEL.
My own dear Ellida, I assure you it was pure imagination on your part. The child had exactly the same eyes as other normal children.
#ELLIDA.
No, it had not! How could you help seeing it? The child’s eyes changed colour with the sea. If the fiord lay in a sunny calm, the eyes were calm and sunny. And the same way in storms.—Oh, I saw it well enough, if you did not.
#WANGEL.
H’m,—perhaps so. But even if it were? What then?
#ELLIDA.
I have seen eyes like that before.
#WANGEL.
When? And where——?
#ELLIDA.
Out at Bratthammer. Ten years ago.
#WANGEL.
What do you——!
#ELLIDA.
The child had the strange man’s eyes.
#WANGEL.
Ellida——!
#ELLIDA.
Now you can surely understand why I never will,—never dare live with you as your wife!
#WANGEL.
Ellida! Ellida! My poor unhappy Ellida!
#HILDA.
Stand still. I see a big one there.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Where is it?
#HILDA.
Can’t you see—down there. And look! I declare there’s another! Ugh—there he comes to frighten them away!
#BOLETTA.
Who is coming?
#HILDA.
Your tutor, miss!
#BOLETTA.
My——?
#HILDA.
Yes; thank goodness he was never mine! comes forward among the trees on the right.
#ARNHOLM.
Are there fish in the pond now?
#HILDA.
Yes, there are some very old carp.
#ARNHOLM.
Ah, so the old carp are still alive?
#HILDA.
Yes; they’re tough, I can tell you. But now we’re going to put an end to some of them.
#ARNHOLM.
You ought rather to try the fiord.
#LYNGSTRAND.
No, the pond—the pond is more mysterious, as you might call it.
#HILDA.
Yes, it’s more thrilling here.—Have you just been having a bathe?
#ARNHOLM.
Precisely. I’ve come straight from the bathing - house.
#HILDA.
I suppose you kept within the enclosure?
#ARNHOLM.
Yes, I’m no great swimmer.
#HILDA.
Can you swim on your back?
#ARNHOLM.
No.
#HILDA.
I can. Let us try over there on the other side.
#ARNHOLM.
You are all alone, Boletta?
#BOLETTA.
Oh yes, I generally am.
#ARNHOLM.
Is not your mother in the garden?
#BOLETTA.
No; I think she is out walking with father.
#ARNHOLM.
How is she this afternoon?
#BOLETTA.
I don’t quite know. I forgot to ask.
#ARNHOLM.
What are the books you have there?
#BOLETTA.
Oh, one is a botanical book, and the other a descriptive geography.
#ARNHOLM.
Are you fond of that kind of reading?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, when I can find time for it——But of course the housekeeping must come first.
#ARNHOLM.
But does not your mother—your stepmother—help you with that?
#BOLETTA.
No, it is my work. I had to look after it during the two years father was alone; and so it has continued ever since.
#ARNHOLM.
But you are as fond as ever of reading?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, I read all the useful books I can get hold of. One wants to know a little about the world. Here we live so entirely outside of everything,—or almost entirely.
#ARNHOLM.
No, my dear Boletta, don’t say that.
#BOLETTA.
But I do say so. I don’t see much difference between our life and the life of the carp in the pond there. They have the fiord close beside them, where the great free shoals of fish sweep out and in. But the poor tame house - fishes know nothing of all that; and they can never join in.
#ARNHOLM.
I don’t think it would agree with them at all if they did get out into the fiord.
#BOLETTA.
Oh, they might take their chance of that, I should think.
#ARNHOLM.
Besides, you can’t say that you are so utterly out of the world here. Not in summer, at all events. This place is a sort of local centre, nowadays, in the life of the world—a point of convergence for many passing streams.
#BOLETTA.
Oh, you are in the passing stream yourself; it is easy for you to make game of us.
#ARNHOLM.
I make game——? What puts that into your head?
#BOLETTA.
Why, all this about a centre, and a point of convergence for the life of the world, is simply what you have heard people say in the town. They are always talking like that.
#ARNHOLM.
Yes, frankly, I have noticed as much.
#BOLETTA.
But there’s really not a word of truth in it, you know—not for us who live here constantly. What is it to us that the great outside world passes our doors on its way to the midnight sun? We cannot join in the stream. There is no midnight sun for us. Oh no; we must be content to linger our lives out, here in our carp - pond.
#ARNHOLM.
Tell me now, dear Boletta—I wonder if there is not something or other,—some particular thing I mean—that you are all the time longing for, here at home?
#BOLETTA.
Well, perhaps there may be.
#ARNHOLM.
Then what is it? What are you longing for?
#BOLETTA.
Chiefly to get away.
#ARNHOLM.
That before everything?
#BOLETTA.
Yes. And next to learn a little more; to gain some real insight into things in general.
#ARNHOLM.
When I used to read with you, your father often said that he would let you go to college.
#BOLETTA.
Oh yes, poor father,—he says so many things. But when it comes to the point, then——. There is no real energy in father.
#ARNHOLM.
No, unfortunately—I suppose there is not. But have you ever talked to him about this? Put serious pressure on him, I mean?
#BOLETTA.
No, I can’t say that I have.
#ARNHOLM.
Well now really, Boletta, you ought to do so, before it is too late. Why don’t you?
#BOLETTA.
Oh, because there is no real energy in me either, I suppose. I probably take after father in that.
#ARNHOLM.
H’m—I wonder whether you don’t do yourself injustice there?
#BOLETTA.
Oh no, I’m sorry to say. And then father has so little time to think about me and my future—and not much inclination either. He puts things of that sort aside as much as he can; he is so entirely taken up with Ellida——
#ARNHOLM.
With whom——? How——?
#BOLETTA.
I mean that he and my stepmother—— Father and mother lead a life of their own, you see.
#ARNHOLM.
Well, so much the more reason for you to see about getting away.
#BOLETTA.
Yes, but at the same time I don’t feel as if I had the right to go away—to leave father.
#ARNHOLM.
But, my dear Boletta, you will have to leave him some time, in any case; and since that is so, why delay——?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, I suppose there is nothing else for it. Of course I ought to think of myself too, and try to find a position of some sort. When once father is gone I shall have no one to depend on.—But poor father,—I dread the thought of leaving him.
#ARNHOLM.
Dread——?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, for his own sake.
#ARNHOLM.
But, bless me, what about your stepmother? She will still be with him.
#BOLETTA.
Yes, that’s true. But she is not at all fitted for all that mother knew so well how to do. There are so many things she doesn’t see—or perhaps will not see—or trouble herself about. I don’t know which way to put it.
#ARNHOLM.
H’m,—I think I understand what you mean?
#BOLETTA.
Poor father,—he is weak in certain ways. I daresay you have noticed that yourself. You see he hasn’t enough work to fill up his whole time; and then she is quite incapable of being any support to him.—That is partly his own fault, however.
#ARNHOLM.
How so?
#BOLETTA.
Oh, father always likes to see cheerful faces around him; there must be sunshine and contentment in the house, he says. So I am afraid he often lets her have medicine that does her no good in the long run.
#ARNHOLM.
Do you really think so?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, I can’t get rid of the idea. She is so strange at times. But it does seem hard, does it not, that I should have to stay on at home here? It does not in reality help father at all; and I can’t but feel that I have duties towards myself too.
#ARNHOLM.
I’ll tell you what, my dear Boletta,—we must talk all this over more thoroughly.
#BOLETTA.
Oh, that won’t help much; I daresay I was created to pass my life here in the carp - pond.
#ARNHOLM.
Not at all. It depends entirely upon yourself.
#BOLETTA.
Do you think so?
#ARNHOLM.
Yes, believe me; it lies wholly and solely in your own hands.
#BOLETTA.
Oh, if it only did——! Do you mean that you will put in a good word for me with father?
#ARNHOLM.
I will do that too. But first of all I want to speak frankly and without reserve to you yourself, my dear Boletta. Hush! Let no one notice anything; we’ll finish our talk by - and - by. enters from the left. She wears no hat, but has a light shawl thrown over her head and shoulders.
#ELLIDA.
How nice it is here! How delightful!
#ARNHOLM.
Have you been out walking?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, a long, long splendid walk with Wangel. And now we are going out for a sail.
#BOLETTA.
Won’t you sit down?
#ELLIDA.
No thank you; I couldn’t sit.
#BOLETTA.
There’s plenty of room.
#ELLIDA.
No no no, I couldn’t sit; I couldn’t sit.
#ARNHOLM.
Your walk has surely done you good; it seems to have exhilarated you.
#ELLIDA.
Oh, I feel so thoroughly well. I feel so unspeakably happy! So safe! So safe—— What large steamer is that coming in?
#BOLETTA.
It must be the big English boat.
#ARNHOLM.
They are mooring her to the buoy. Does she generally stop here?
#BOLETTA.
Only for half an hour; she goes farther up the fiord.
#ELLIDA.
And then outward again—to - morrow; out on the great open sea; right over the sea. Think of going with her! If one only could! If one only could!
#ARNHOLM.
Have you never taken a long sea - voyage, Mrs. Wangel?
#ELLIDA.
Never in my life; only little trips in the fiords.
#BOLETTA.
Oh no, we have to put up with the dry land.
#ARNHOLM.
Well, at any rate, that is our natural element.
#ELLIDA.
No, I don’t think so at all.
#ARNHOLM.
Not dry land?
#ELLIDA.
No, I don’t believe it. I believe that if men had only accustomed themselves from the first to live their life on the sea—or even in the sea—we should by this time have been far more perfect than we are;—both better and happier.
#ARNHOLM.
Do you really believe that?
#ELLIDA.
Well, at any rate, it is a theory of mine. I have often talked of it with Wangel.
#ARNHOLM.
Indeed! And he——?
#ELLIDA.
Oh, he thinks there may be something in it.
#ARNHOLM.
Well, who knows? But what’s done is done. We have once for all taken the wrong turning and become land animals instead of sea animals. All things considered, I’m afraid it is too late now to rectify the error.
#ELLIDA.
Yes, that is the mournful truth. And I believe people have an instinctive feeling of it themselves—it haunts them like a secret sorrow and regret. Believe me, this lies at the very root of the melancholy of mankind. I am sure it does.
#ARNHOLM.
But my dear Mrs. Wangel,—I have never noticed that people are so profoundly melancholy. I should say, on the contrary, that most people take life cheerfully and lightly—with a great, calm, unconscious joy.
#ELLIDA.
Oh no, that is not so. That joy—it is just like our joy in the long, light summer days. It has in it the foreboding of the darkness to come. And this foreboding casts its shadow over the joy of mankind,—just as the driving scud casts its shadow over the fiord. There it lies all blue and shining; and then all of a sudden——
#BOLETTA.
You shouldn’t let yourself dwell on such sad thoughts. You were so bright and cheerful a moment ago——
#ELLIDA.
Yes yes, so I was. All this is—it’s so stupid of me. If only Wangel would come down here. He promised me so faithfully; and yet he doesn’t come. He must have forgotten. Dear Mr. Arnholm, won’t you go and find him for me?
#ARNHOLM.
Yes, with pleasure.
#ELLIDA.
Tell him that he really must come at once; for now I cannot see him——
#ARNHOLM.
Not see him——?
#ELLIDA.
Oh, you don’t understand me. When he is not present, I often can’t remember what he looks like; and then it seems as though I had lost him utterly.—It’s so terribly painful. Do go!
#BOLETTA.
I will go with you; you don’t know——
#ARNHOLM.
Oh don’t trouble; I shall manage——
#BOLETTA.
No no, I am uneasy. I’m afraid he is on board the steamer.
#ARNHOLM.
Afraid?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, he generally goes to see if there is any one he knows among the passengers; and there’s a refreshment bar on board——
#ARNHOLM.
Ah! Come along then.
#THE STRANGER.
Good evening, Ellida!
#ELLIDA.
Oh my dear—have you come at last!
#THE STRANGER.
Yes, at last.
#ELLIDA.
Who are you? Are you looking for some one here?
#THE STRANGER.
You know I am.
#ELLIDA.
What is this? How strangely you speak to me! Who is it you are looking for?
#THE STRANGER.
You know I am looking for you.
#ELLIDA.
Ah——! The eyes!—The eyes!
#THE STRANGER.
Well,—are you beginning to recognise me at last? I knew you at once, Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
The eyes. Don’t look at me like that! I will call for help.
#THE STRANGER.
Hush, hush! Don’t be afraid. I will do you no harm.
#ELLIDA.
Don’t look at me like that, I say!
#THE STRANGER.
I came with the English steamer.
#ELLIDA.
What do you want with me?
#THE STRANGER.
I promised I would come again, as soon as I could——
#ELLIDA.
Go! Go away again! Never—never come here any more! I wrote to you that everything must be at end between us! Everything! You know I did!
#THE STRANGER.
I wanted to come to you sooner, but I could not. At last I saw my way; and here I am, Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
What do you want with me? What are you thinking of? What have you come here for?
#THE STRANGER.
You know quite well that I have come to take you away.
#ELLIDA.
To take me away! Is that what you intend?
#THE STRANGER.
Yes, of course.
#ELLIDA.
But surely you know that I am married!
#THE STRANGER.
Yes, I know it.
#ELLIDA.
And yet——! In spite of that, you have come to—to—take me away!
#THE STRANGER.
Yes, you see I have.
#ELLIDA.
Oh this fearful——! Oh this terror, this terror——!
#THE STRANGER.
Perhaps you do not wish to come!
#ELLIDA.
Don’t look at me like that!
#THE STRANGER.
Do you not wish to come, I ask?
#ELLIDA.
No, no, no! I will not! Never to the end of time! I will not, I say! I neither can, nor will! I dare not, either.
#THE STRANGER.
Very well then, Ellida—let me just say one single thing before I go.
#ELLIDA.
Do not touch me! Do not come near me! Stay where you are! Do not touch me, I say!
#THE STRANGER.
You must not be so afraid of me, Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
Do not look at me like that!
#THE STRANGER.
Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid. comes through the garden from the left.
#WANGEL.
Well, I’ve kept you waiting a nice time.
#ELLIDA.
Oh Wangel,—save me! Save me—if you can!
#WANGEL.
Ellida,—what in heaven’s name——!
#ELLIDA.
Save me, Wangel! Don’t you see him? There he stands!
#WANGEL.
That man there? Who are you, may I ask? And why have you come into this garden?
#THE STRANGER.
I want to speak to her.
#WANGEL.
Indeed. Then I suppose it was you——? I hear a stranger called at the house and asked for you.
#THE STRANGER.
Yes, it was I.
#WANGEL.
And what do you want with my wife? Do you know him, Ellida?
#ELLIDA.
Do I know him? Yes, yes, yes!
#WANGEL.
Well?
#ELLIDA.
Oh, it is he, Wangel! It is he himself! He,—you know——!
#WANGEL.
What? What do you say? Are you the man Johnston, who was——?
#THE STRANGER.
Well—you can call me Johnston if you like. It is not my name though.
#WANGEL.
Is it not?
#THE STRANGER.
Not now, it isn’t.
#WANGEL.
And what can you want with my wife? For of course you know that the lighthouse keeper’s daughter has been married for years. And you must know, too, who her husband is.
#THE STRANGER.
I have known that for more than three years.
#ELLIDA.
How did you come to know it?
#THE STRANGER.
I was on my way home to you. I came across an old newspaper—one from these parts; and in it was the notice of your marriage.
#ELLIDA.
My marriage——So it was that——
#THE STRANGER.
It came upon me very strangely. For the linking of the rings—that was a marriage, too, Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
Oh——!
#WANGEL.
How dare you——?
#THE STRANGER.
Had you forgotten it?
#ELLIDA.
Do not stand looking at me like that!
#WANGEL.
Be so good as to address yourself to me, and not to her. Briefly now—since you understand the situation—what can you have to do here? Why do you come here and seek out my wife?
#THE STRANGER.
I had promised Ellida that I would come to her as soon as I could.
#WANGEL.
Ellida——! Again!
#THE STRANGER.
And Ellida had promised faithfully to wait for me till I came.
#WANGEL.
I observe that you call my wife by her first name. That sort of familiarity is not usual here.
#THE STRANGER.
I know that very well. But as she belongs first of all to me——
#WANGEL.
To you! Still——!
#ELLIDA.
Oh——! He will never set me free!
#WANGEL.
To you! You say she belongs to you!
#THE STRANGER.
Has she told you about the two rings? My ring and Ellida’s?
#WANGEL.
Yes, certainly. But what then? She broke it off again afterwards. You received her letters; so you know it perfectly well.
#THE STRANGER.
Ellida and I were fully agreed that the linking of the rings was to be in every way as valid and binding as a marriage.
#ELLIDA.
But I refuse, I tell you! Never in this world will I have anything more to do with you! Do not look at me like that! I will not, I tell you!
#WANGEL.
You must be out of your senses if you think you can come here and found any claim upon such a piece of child’s - play as that.
#THE STRANGER.
That is true. In the way you mean, I have certainly no claim upon her.
#WANGEL.
What do you want to do then? You cannot imagine that you can take her from me by force,—against her own will!
#THE STRANGER.
No. What would be the use of that? If Ellida is to be mine, she must come of her own free will.
#ELLIDA.
Of my own free will——.
#WANGEL.
And can you suppose——!
#ELLIDA.
My own free will——!
#WANGEL.
You must be out of your mind. Take yourself off! We have nothing more to do with you.
#THE STRANGER.
It will soon be time for me to go on board again. Well well, Ellida—now I have done what I had to do. I have kept the word I gave you.
#ELLIDA.
Oh, do not touch me!
#THE STRANGER.
I give you till to - morrow night to think it over——
#WANGEL.
There is nothing to think over. Leave this place at once!
#THE STRANGER.
I am going up the fiord in the steamer now; to - morrow night I shall return, and then I will see you again. You must wait for me here in the garden; for I prefer to settle the matter with you alone, you understand.
#ELLIDA.
Oh, do you hear that, Wangel?
#WANGEL.
Do not be alarmed. We shall find means to prevent this visit.
#THE STRANGER.
Good - bye for the present, Ellida. To - morrow night then.
#ELLIDA.
Oh, no, no,—do not come to - morrow night! Never come again!
#THE STRANGER.
And if by that time you should be of a mind to come with me over the sea——
#ELLIDA.
Oh, do not look at me like that——
#THE STRANGER.
I only mean that in that case you must be ready to start.
#WANGEL.
Go into the house, Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
I cannot. Oh, help me! Save me, Wangel!
#THE STRANGER.
For you must remember this, that if you do not come with me to - morrow, it will all be over.
#ELLIDA.
Will it all be over? For ever——?
#THE STRANGER.
Beyond recall, Ellida! I shall never return to this country; you will never see me any more, nor hear from me either. I shall be as though dead and gone from you, for evermore.
#ELLIDA.
Oh——!
#THE STRANGER.
So think carefully what you do. Good - bye. Well, Ellida,—be ready to start to - morrow night; for then I will come and take you away.
#ELLIDA.
Of my own free will, he said! Think of that—he said that I should go with him of my own free will.
#WANGEL.
Be calm, be calm. He is gone now, and you shall never see him again.
#ELLIDA.
Oh, how can you say that? He is coming again to - morrow night.
#WANGEL.
Let him come; I will see that he does not meet you.
#ELLIDA.
Oh Wangel, do not think that you can prevent him.
#WANGEL.
Yes I can, dearest—rely upon me.
#ELLIDA.
When he has been here—to - morrow night——? And when he has gone away in the steamer, over the sea——?
#WANGEL.
Well, what then?
#ELLIDA.
I wonder whether he will never—never come again?
#WANGEL.
No, dear Ellida, you may feel absolutely secure on that point. What could he do here after this? He has heard now, from your own lips, that you will have nothing to do with him. That ends the whole thing.
#ELLIDA.
To - morrow then—or never.
#WANGEL.
And even if he should take it into his head to come again——
#ELLIDA.
What then——?
#WANGEL.
Why, we know how to make him harmless.
#ELLIDA.
Oh, do not think that.
#WANGEL.
We know what to do, I say! If nothing else will make him leave you in peace, then he shall answer for the murder of the captain.
#ELLIDA.
No, no, no——! Never that! We know nothing about the murder of the captain! Absolutely nothing!
#WANGEL.
We know nothing! Why, he himself confessed it to you!
#ELLIDA.
No, nothing about that! If you say anything, I will deny it. He shall not be caged! His place is out on the open sea. That is his home.
#WANGEL.
Ah, Ellida—Ellida!
#ELLIDA.
Oh dear one, faithful one—save me from that man!
#WANGEL.
Come! Come with me! and HILDA, both with fishing - tackle, appear from the right beside the pond.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh, what do you think, Mrs. Wangel—I have something wonderful to tell you!
#WANGEL.
What is it?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Just fancy—we have seen the American!
#WANGEL.
The American?
#HILDA.
Yes, I saw him too.
#LYNGSTRAND.
He went round by the back of the garden, and then on board the big English steamer.
#WANGEL.
Where have you known that man?
#LYNGSTRAND.
I was at sea with him once. I was quite sure he was drowned; and here he appears as large as life.
#WANGEL.
Do you know anything more about him?
#LYNGSTRAND.
No; but I’m sure he has come back to be revenged on his faithless wife.
#WANGEL.
What do you mean?
#HILDA.
Mr. Lyngstrand is going to make a statue of him.
#WANGEL.
I don’t understand a word——
#ELLIDA.
You shall hear all about it by - and - by. and BOLETTA enter from the left along the footpath outside the garden fence.
#BOLETTA.
Come and look! The English steamer is going up the fiord.
#LYNGSTRAND.
I am sure he will come down upon her to - night.
#HILDA.
Upon his faithless wife—yes.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Fancy,—just at midnight.
#HILDA.
I think it will be thrilling.
#ELLIDA.
To - morrow then——
#WANGEL.
And after that, never again.
#ELLIDA.
Oh Wangel—save me from myself.
#WANGEL.
Ellida! I feel it—there is something behind all this.
#ELLIDA.
All that allures is behind it.
#WANGEL.
All that allures——?
#ELLIDA.
That man is like the sea.
#LYNGSTRAND.
It must be very difficult to sew edging like that, Miss Wangel.
#BOLETTA.
Oh no, it’s not so difficult, if only you are careful to count right——
#LYNGSTRAND.
Count? Have you to count?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, the stitches. Look here.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Why, so you must! Fancy! It’s almost a kind of art. Can you draw too?
#BOLETTA.
Oh yes, when I have a copy before me.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Not unless?
#BOLETTA.
No, not unless.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Then it’s not really art after all.
#BOLETTA.
No, it’s more of a—a knack.
#LYNGSTRAND.
But I should think, now, that you could probably learn art?
#BOLETTA.
Even though I have no turn for it?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, in spite of that—if you could be always with a real born artist——
#BOLETTA.
Do you think I could learn from him?
#LYNGSTRAND.
I don’t mean “learn” in the ordinary sense. But I think it would come to you by degrees—by a sort of miracle, Miss Wangel.
#BOLETTA.
That is a strange idea.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Have you thought much—I mean—have you thought at all deeply and seriously about marriage, Miss Wangel?
#BOLETTA.
About——? No.
#LYNGSTRAND.
I have.
#BOLETTA.
Indeed; have you?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes. I very often think about things of that sort; and particularly about marriage. And then I have read a good deal on the subject too. I think marriage may be counted a sort of miracle: the woman is transformed, as it were, by degrees, and comes to resemble her husband.
#BOLETTA.
Acquires his interests, you mean?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, that’s just it!
#BOLETTA.
Well, but what about his abilities?—his talent and skill?
#LYNGSTRAND.
H’m—well—I wonder whether they, too, wouldn’t——
#BOLETTA.
Then do you think that what a man has mastered by reading—or by his own thought—can be passed on in this way to his wife?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, that too; by degrees; as if by a miracle. But of course I know that this could only happen in a marriage that is faithful, and loving, and really happy.
#BOLETTA.
Has it never occurred to you that perhaps a husband might be absorbed in the same way into his wife? Might come to resemble her, I mean. husband? No, I have never thought of that.
#BOLETTA.
But why not the one as well as the other?
#LYNGSTRAND.
No; a man has his vocation to live for, you know. And that is what makes a man so strong and resolute, Miss Wangel. He has his life - work.
#BOLETTA.
Every man?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh no. I was thinking mainly of artists.
#BOLETTA.
Do you think it right for an artist to marry?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Most certainly; if he can find some one he really loves——
#BOLETTA.
Even then it seems to me that he should rather live for his art alone.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Of course he must; but he can quite well do that even if he marries.
#BOLETTA.
But what about her, then?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Her? Who——?
#BOLETTA.
The woman he marries. What is she to live for?
#LYNGSTRAND.
She too must live for his art. I should think that must be such happiness for a woman.
#BOLETTA.
H’m,—I am not so sure——
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh yes, Miss Wangel, believe me. It is not only all the honour and glory she enjoys through him; that, I should say, is almost the least part of it. But that she can help him to create,—that she can lighten his labour by being ever at his side, and tending him, and making life thoroughly comfortable for him. It seems to me that must be such a delight for a woman.
#BOLETTA.
Oh, you don’t realise how selfish you are!
#LYNGSTRAND.
Am I selfish? Good heavens——! Oh, if you only knew me a little better——. Miss Wangel,—when I am gone,—and I shall be soon——
#BOLETTA.
Oh don’t get such melancholy thoughts into your head.
#LYNGSTRAND.
I don’t see that it is so very melancholy.
#BOLETTA.
How do you mean?
#LYNGSTRAND.
I shall be starting in about a month, first for home, and soon afterwards for the South.
#BOLETTA.
Oh, I see. Yes, yes.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Will you think of me now and then, Miss Wangel?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, gladly.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh, do you promise me that?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, I promise.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Solemnly, Miss Boletta?
#BOLETTA.
Solemnly. Oh, but what is the use of all this? Nothing can ever come of it.
#LYNGSTRAND.
How can you say that? It would be such a joy to me to know that you were at home here thinking of me.
#BOLETTA.
Yes, but what more?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Well, I am not quite certain about anything more——
#BOLETTA.
Nor I. So many things stand in the way; every possible thing stands in the way, it seems to me.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Oh, some miracle or other might happen. A happy turn of fate—or something of that sort. For I am convinced that fortune is on my side.
#BOLETTA.
Yes, that is right! Surely you think so!
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I am perfectly convinced of it. And then—in a few years—when I come home again a famous sculptor, with plenty of money, and as well as possible——
#BOLETTA.
Yes, yes; let us hope you will.
#LYNGSTRAND.
You may be quite sure of it—if only you think faithfully and warmly of me while I am away in the South. And that you have promised to do.
#BOLETTA.
Yes, I have. But nothing will ever come of this, all the same.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, Miss Boletta, this at least will come of it, that I shall make the easier and quicker progress with my group.
#BOLETTA.
Do you think so?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I feel it within me. And I think it will be stimulating for you too,—here in this out - of - the - way place—to know that you are, as it were, helping me to create.
#BOLETTA.
Well—but you, on your side?
#BOLETTA.
Hush! Let us talk of something else; here comes Mr. Arnholm.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Are you fond of your old teacher, Miss Boletta?
#BOLETTA.
Am I fond of him?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I mean do you like him?
#BOLETTA.
Oh yes, I do indeed; he is such a good friend and adviser. And he is always so ready to help you whenever he can.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Is it not strange that he has never married?
#BOLETTA.
Do you think it so strange?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes; they say he is well off.
#BOLETTA.
I suppose he is. But it may not have been very easy for him to find any one who would have him.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Why?
#BOLETTA.
Oh, he has been the teacher of nearly every girl he knows. He says so himself.
#LYNGSTRAND.
But what does that matter?
#BOLETTA.
Why, of course, one doesn’t marry a man who has been one’s teacher!
#LYNGSTRAND.
Don’t you think a girl could possibly love her teacher?
#BOLETTA.
Not after she is quite grown up.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Dear me! How odd!
#BOLETTA.
Hush, hush!
#ARNHOLM.
Good morning, my dear Boletta. Good morning Mr.——Mr.——h’m!
#BOLETTA.
Good morning, Mr. Arnholm.
#ARNHOLM.
How are you all here to - day?
#BOLETTA.
Thanks, very well.
#ARNHOLM.
Has your step - mother gone to bathe to - day again?
#BOLETTA.
No, she is up in her room.
#ARNHOLM.
Not quite well?
#BOLETTA.
I don’t know. She has locked herself in.
#ARNHOLM.
H’m—has she?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Mrs. Wangel seemed very much upset about that American yesterday.
#ARNHOLM.
What do you know about it?
#LYNGSTRAND.
I told Mrs. Wangel that I had seen him in the flesh, going round behind the garden.
#ARNHOLM.
Oh indeed.
#BOLETTA.
You and father sat up late last night, did you not?
#ARNHOLM.
Yes, pretty late. We had an important question to discuss.
#BOLETTA.
Did you get in a word with him about me and my affairs?
#ARNHOLM.
No, my dear Boletta. I could not manage it; he was so absorbed in something else.
#BOLETTA.
Ah yes,—he always is.
#ARNHOLM.
But remember, you and I are to have another talk about these things, presently.—Where is your father now? Has he gone out?
#BOLETTA.
I think he must be down at the surgery. I’ll go and fetch him.
#ARNHOLM.
No thank you, don’t do that. I would rather go down to him.
#BOLETTA.
Wait a moment, Mr. Arnholm. I think I hear father coming downstairs. Yes. He must have been up attending to her. enters by the door on the left.
#WANGEL.
Ah, my dear friend, are you here already? It’s good of you to come so early; there are still several things I want to discuss with you.
#BOLETTA.
Shall we join Hilda in the garden for a little while?
#LYNGSTRAND.
With all the pleasure in life, Miss Wangel.
#ARNHOLM.
Do you know much about that young man?
#WANGEL.
No, very little.
#ARNHOLM.
Then do you like him to be so much with the girls?
#WANGEL.
Is he much with them? I really hadn’t noticed it.
#ARNHOLM.
Don’t you think you ought to keep an eye on that sort of thing?
#WANGEL.
Yes, no doubt you are right. But, bless my soul, what is a poor fellow to do? The girls have got so accustomed to look after themselves; they will not listen to a word, either from me or from Ellida.
#ARNHOLM.
Not even from her?
#WANGEL.
No. And besides, I cannot expect her to interfere in such matters; it is not at all in her way. But that was not what we were going to talk about. Tell me—have you given any more thought to it?—to all that I told you last night?
#ARNHOLM.
I have thought of nothing else, ever since we parted.
#WANGEL.
And what do you think I ought to do in the matter?
#ARNHOLM.
My dear Doctor, I think that you, as a physician, ought to know better than I.
#WANGEL.
Oh, if you only knew how difficult it is for a physician to form a valid judgment in the case of a patient he loves so dearly! And this is no common disorder either—no case for an ordinary physician, or for ordinary remedies.
#ARNHOLM.
How is she to - day?
#WANGEL.
I have just been up to see her, and she appeared to me quite calm. But behind all her moods something seems to be hidden that eludes me entirely. And then she is so variable—so incalculable—so subject to sudden changes.
#ARNHOLM.
No doubt that is due to her morbid state of mind.
#WANGEL.
Not entirely. The germ of it all is innate in her. Ellida belongs to the sea - folk; that is the trouble.
#ARNHOLM.
What do you mean precisely, my dear Doctor?
#WANGEL.
Have you not noticed that the people who live out by the open sea are like a race apart? They seem almost to live the life of the sea itself. There is the surge of the sea—and its ebb and flow too—both in their thoughts and in their feelings. And they never bear transplantation. No, I should have thought of that before. It was a positive sin against Ellida to take her away from the sea and bring her in here!
#ARNHOLM.
Have you come to look at it in that light?
#WANGEL.
Yes, more and more; but I ought to have known it from the first. Oh, I did really know it then too, but I would not acknowledge it to myself. I loved her so much, you see! And consequently I thought first of myself. In fact, I was utterly and unpardonably selfish.
#ARNHOLM.
H’m,—I am afraid every man is a trifle selfish under those circumstances. But I can’t say that I have noticed that vice in you, Dr. Wangel.
#WANGEL.
Oh yes! And I have been so since, as well. I am so much, much older than she; I ought to have been to her like a father and a guide in one. I ought, to have done my best to develop and clarify her intelligence. But unfortunately I have done nothing of the sort. I have not had energy enough, you see! And in fact I preferred to have her just as she was. But then she grew worse and worse, and I was at my wits’ end to know what to do That is why I turned to you in my perplexity, and asked you to come to us.
#ARNHOLM.
What! Was that why you wrote to me?
#WANGEL.
Yes; but don’t say anything about it.
#ARNHOLM.
My dear Doctor,—what in the world—what good did you suppose I could do? I don’t understand.
#WANGEL.
No, of course you do not; I had got upon a wrong scent. I fancied that Ellida had once cared for you, and that she still had a secret leaning in your direction. So I thought it might perhaps do her good to see you again, and have a talk with you about home and old times.
#ARNHOLM.
Then it was your wife you meant when you wrote that some one here was waiting and—and perhaps longing for me!
#WANGEL.
Yes; who else?
#ARNHOLM.
Of course, of course.—But I did not understand you.
#WANGEL.
Naturally not, as I said before. I was on an entirely wrong scent.
#ARNHOLM.
And you call yourself selfish!
#WANGEL.
Oh, I had such a great error to atone for. I felt I had no right to reject any expedient that could possibly ease her mind a little.
#ARNHOLM.
What do you take to be the real explanation of the power this stranger exercises over her?
#WANGEL.
H’m, my dear friend—there may be sides to that question that don’t admit of explanation.
#ARNHOLM.
Something inexplicable in itself, do you mean? Entirely inexplicable?
#WANGEL.
Inexplicable for the present, at any rate.
#ARNHOLM.
Do you believe in such things?
#WANGEL.
I neither believe nor disbelieve. I simply do not know. So I suspend my judgment.
#ARNHOLM.
But tell me one thing: that strange, uncanny idea of hers about the child’s eyes——
#WANGEL.
I don’t in the least believe that about the eyes! I will not believe any such thing! It must be pure imagination on her part; nothing else.
#ARNHOLM.
Did you notice the man’s eyes when you saw him yesterday?
#WANGEL.
Yes, certainly I did.
#ARNHOLM.
And you found no sort of likeness?
#WANGEL.
H’m—upon my soul I don’t know what to say. It was not quite light when I saw him; and besides, Ellida had talked so much about this likeness beforehand—I don’t think it was possible for me to observe him without any bias.
#ARNHOLM.
No, no; very likely not. But then the other point: that all this dread and unrest came upon her just at the very time when this stranger would seem to have been on his way home?
#WANGEL.
Well you see—that again is a belief she must have imagined and dreamt herself into, since the day before yesterday. It did not come upon her at all so suddenly—so instantaneously—as she now maintains. But since she heard from this young Lyngstrand that Johnston or Friman—or whatever he is called—was on his way home three years ago—in March—she has evidently persuaded herself that her mental trouble came on in the very same month.
#ARNHOLM.
And did it not?
#WANGEL.
Not at all. There had been unmistakable symptoms of it long before that.—It is true she happened—by chance—to have a rather severe attack precisely in the month of March, three years ago——
#ARNHOLM.
Well then——!
#WANGEL.
Oh, but that is quite easily accounted for by the circumstances—the condition—she happened to be in at that time.
#ARNHOLM.
The indications may be read in either way, then.
#WANGEL.
And to be powerless to help her! To be at the end of one’s resources! To see no sort of remedy——!
#ARNHOLM.
What if you made up your mind to a change of residence—to move to some other place, where she might live under conditions that seemed to her more home - like?
#WANGEL.
My dear fellow, do you think I haven’t suggested that to her? I proposed that we should move out to Skioldvik. But she will not.
#ARNHOLM.
Not that either?
#WANGEL.
No. She thinks it would be useless; and I daresay she is right too.
#ARNHOLM.
H’m—do you think so?
#WANGEL.
Yes; and besides—on considering the matter more closely—I really don’t see how I could manage it. I scarcely think I should be justified, on the girls’ account, in moving to such an out - of - the - way corner. After all, they must live where there is at least some chance of their one day being able to marry.
#ARNHOLM.
To marry? Have you that so much on your mind already?
#WANGEL.
Why, yes, of course; I must think of that too! But then—on the other hand—the thought of my poor suffering Ellida——! Oh, my dear Arnholm—wherever I turn, I seem to stand between fire and water!
#ARNHOLM.
There may, perhaps, be no need for you to trouble about Boletta—— I wonder where she—where they have gone?
#WANGEL.
Oh I should be so glad to make any possible sacrifice—for all three of them.—If only I knew what! enters by the door on the left.
#ELLIDA.
Be sure you do not go out this morning.
#WANGEL.
No no, certainly not; I will stay at home with you. But you haven’t said good morning to our friend?
#ELLIDA.
Oh, are you there, Mr. Arnholm? Good morning.
#ARNHOLM.
Good morning, Mrs. Wangel. You have not gone for your bathe to - day as usual?
#ELLIDA.
No, no, no! I couldn’t think of it to - day. Won’t you sit down for a moment?
#ARNHOLM.
No thank you—not just now. I promised the girls I would join them in the garden.
#ELLIDA.
Heavens knows whether you’ll find them in the garden. I never know where they may have got to.
#WANGEL.
Oh yes, they are probably down by the pond.
#ARNHOLM.
I daresay I shall find them.
#ELLIDA.
What o’clock is it, Wangel?
#WANGEL.
It’s a little past eleven. little past; and at eleven or half - past to - night the steamer will be here. Oh, if it only were over!
#WANGEL.
Dear Ellida, there is one thing I should like to ask you about.
#ELLIDA.
What is it?
#WANGEL.
The night before last—up at the Prospect—you said that during the past three years you had often seen him bodily before you.
#ELLIDA.
So I have. I assure you I have.
#WANGEL.
Well, but how did you see him?
#ELLIDA.
How did I see him?
#WANGEL.
I mean—what did he look like when you appeared to see him before you?
#ELLIDA.
Why, my dear Wangel,—you know yourself now what he looks like.
#WANGEL.
And he looked like that when you seemed to see him?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, he did.
#WANGEL.
Exactly as you saw him in reality last evening?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, exactly.
#WANGEL.
Then how did it happen that you did not at once recognise him?
#ELLIDA.
Did I not?
#WANGEL.
No. You yourself told me afterwards that at first you did not in the least know who the stranger was.
#ELLIDA.
Yes, I really believe you are right! Was not that strange, Wangel? Think of my not knowing him at once!
#WANGEL.
It was only by his eyes, you said——
#ELLIDA.
Oh yes—his eyes! His eyes!
#WANGEL.
Well, but up at the Prospect you said that he had always appeared to you just as he was when you parted, ten years ago.
#ELLIDA.
Did I say that?
#WANGEL.
Yes.
#ELLIDA.
Then he must have looked at that time much as he does now.
#WANGEL.
No. You gave quite another description of him on the way home, the night before last. Ten years ago he had no beard, you said. He was quite differently dressed too. And the breast - pin with the pearl in it——? He wore nothing of the sort yesterday.
#ELLIDA.
No, he didn’t.
#WANGEL.
Now think a little, dear Ellida. Perhaps you cannot remember now what he looked like when you parted from him at Bratthammer?
#ELLIDA.
Not quite distinctly. No—I can’t at all to - day. Isn’t that strange?
#WANGEL.
Not so very strange. A new and real figure has presented itself to you, and that obscures the old one—so that you can no longer see it.
#ELLIDA.
Do you think so, Wangel?
#WANGEL.
Yes; and it obscures your morbid illusions too; so it is a good thing the reality has shown itself.
#ELLIDA.
Good! Do you call it a good thing?
#WANGEL.
Yes; its coming—may be your salvation.
#ELLIDA.
Wangel—come here and sit by me. I must tell you all my thoughts.
#WANGEL.
Yes do, dear Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
It was really a great misfortune—for both of us—that we two, of all people, should come together.
#WANGEL.
What do you say?
#ELLIDA.
Oh yes it was—and it could not but be. It could lead to nothing but unhappiness—especially considering the way we came together.
#WANGEL.
Why, what was wrong with the way——?
#ELLIDA.
Listen now, Wangel,—it is useless for us to go on any longer lying to ourselves—and to each other.
#WANGEL.
Are we doing so? Lying do you say?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, lying. Or at any rate—concealing the truth. The truth—the sheer unvarnished truth is this: you came out there and—bought me.
#WANGEL.
Bought——Did you say—bought?
#ELLIDA.
Oh, I was not a bit better than you. I joined in the bargain. I went and sold myself to you.
#WANGEL.
Ellida,—have you the heart to say so?
#ELLIDA.
Why, what else can you call it? You could not bear the void in your house; you looked about for a new wife——
#WANGEL.
And for a new mother for the children, Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
That too, perhaps—incidentally, as it were. Although—you did not in the least know whether I was fit to be a mother to them. You had only seen me and spoken with me once or twice. But you took a fancy to me, and so——
#WANGEL.
Well, you may give it what name you please.
#ELLIDA.
And I, for my part——. There was I, helpless and forlorn, and utterly alone. What more natural than that I should accept the bargain—when you came and offered to maintain me all my life.
#WANGEL.
I assure you I did not think of it in that light, my dear Ellida. I asked you honestly if you would share with me and the children the little I could call my own.
#ELLIDA.
Yes, you did. But, little or much, I ought not to have accepted! I should never have accepted at any price! I should never have sold myself! Better the meanest labour—better the deepest poverty—of my own free will—by my own choice!
#WANGEL.
Then have the five or six years we have lived together been utterly wasted for you?
#ELLIDA.
Oh, you must not think that, Wangel! I have had all from you that any one could possibly desire. But I did not come into your home of my own free will,—that is the thing.
#WANGEL.
Not of your free will?
#ELLIDA.
No; it was not of my own free will that I cast in my lot with yours.
#WANGEL.
Ah, I remember—the phrase he used yesterday.
#ELLIDA.
The whole secret lies in that phrase. It has thrown a new light on things for me; so that I see it all now.
#WANGEL.
What do you see?
#ELLIDA.
I see that the life we two lead with each other—is really no marriage at all.
#WANGEL.
There you are right. The life we now lead is no marriage at all.
#ELLIDA.
Nor the life we led before; never; not from the outset. The first—that might have been a real and true marriage.
#WANGEL.
The first? What “first” do you mean?
#ELLIDA.
Mine,—with him.
#WANGEL.
I cannot understand you at all!
#ELLIDA.
Oh my dear Wangel,—do not let us lie to each other; nor to ourselves.
#WANGEL.
No, of course not! But what then?
#ELLIDA.
Why, don’t you see—we can never get away from this—that a voluntary promise is to the full as binding as a marriage.
#WANGEL.
Why, what in the world——!
#ELLIDA.
Let me leave you, Wangel!
#WANGEL.
Ellida——! Ellida——!
#ELLIDA.
Yes, yes—you must let me! I can assure you there will be nothing else for it in the end—after the way we two came together.
#WANGEL.
So it has come to this!
#ELLIDA.
It had to come to this; no other end was possible.
#WANGEL.
So even in our daily life together I have not won you. You have never, never been wholly mine.
#ELLIDA.
Oh Wangel—if only I could love you as I gladly would! As tenderly as you deserve! But I feel quite clearly—it will never be. divorce then? It is a divorce,—a formal, legal divorce,—that you want?
#ELLIDA.
My dear, you do not understand me at all. It is not the forms that I care about. These external things seem to me to matter nothing. What I wish is that we two should agree, of our own free will, to release each other.
#WANGEL.
To cancel the bargain,—yes.
#ELLIDA.
Precisely! To cancel the bargain.
#WANGEL.
And after that, Ellida? Afterwards? Have you thought of the outlook for both of us? What shape will our lives take—both yours and mine?
#ELLIDA.
We must not let that influence us. The future must shape itself as best it can. This that I am begging of you, Wangel,—this is the chief thing! Set me free! Give me back my full freedom.
#WANGEL.
Ellida—this is a terrible demand you make upon me. Let me at least have time to collect myself and come to a resolve. Let us discuss the matter more thoroughly. And do you, too, give yourself time to reflect what you are doing!
#ELLIDA.
But there is no time to waste on all that. You must give me back my freedom this very day.
#WANGEL.
Why to - day?
#ELLIDA.
Because it is to - night that he is coming.
#WANGEL.
Coming! He! What has the stranger to do with this?
#ELLIDA.
I want to meet him in full freedom.
#WANGEL.
And what—what do you intend to do then?
#ELLIDA.
I do not want to take refuge in the plea that I am another man’s wife—or that I have no choice left me. For then my decision would decide nothing.
#WANGEL.
You talk of choice! Choice, Ellida! Choice in this matter!
#ELLIDA.
Yes, choose I must—freely choose either course. I must be free to let him go away alone—or—to go with him.
#WANGEL.
Do you understand what you are saying? Go with him! Place your whole fate in his hands!
#ELLIDA.
Did I not place my whole fate in your hands? And that—without thinking twice.
#WANGEL.
That may be. But he! He! A total stranger! A man you know so little about!
#ELLIDA.
I knew perhaps even less of you; and yet I went with you.
#WANGEL.
At least you knew pretty well what kind of life you were entering upon. But now? Now? Reflect! What do you know now? Nothing whatever: not even who he is—or what he is.
#ELLIDA.
That is true. But that is just the terrible thing.
#WANGEL.
Yes, terrible indeed——
#ELLIDA.
And that is why I feel as if I must give way to it.
#WANGEL.
Because it seems to you terrible?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, just because of that.
#WANGEL.
Tell me, Ellida—what do you really mean by “terrible”?
#ELLIDA.
I call a thing terrible—when it both frightens and fascinates me.
#WANGEL.
Fascinates?
#ELLIDA.
Most of all when it fascinates me—I think.
#WANGEL.
You are akin to the sea.
#ELLIDA.
There is terror in that too.
#WANGEL.
And in yourself no less. You both frighten and fascinate.
#ELLIDA.
Do you think so, Wangel?
#WANGEL.
I see that I have never really known you; never thoroughly. I am beginning to understand that now.
#ELLIDA.
And therefore you must set me free! Loose me from every tie to you and yours! I am not the woman you took me for; you see that now yourself. Now we can part in mutual understanding—and of our own free will.
#WANGEL.
It would perhaps be best for us both—to part. But for all that, I cannot! To me it is you that are “terrible,” Ellida. And fascinating—that you are above all things.
#ELLIDA.
Do you say so?
#WANGEL.
Let us try to get through this day with no false step—to act calmly and collectedly. I cannot release you and let you go to - day. I must not—for your own sake, Ellida. I assert my right and my duty to protect you.
#ELLIDA.
Protect? What is there to protect me against? It is not any outward force or violence that threatens me. The terrible thing lies deeper, Wangel! The terrible thing is—the fascination I feel in my own mind; and what can you do against that?
#WANGEL.
I can strengthen and support you in resisting it.
#ELLIDA.
Yes—if I had the will to resist it.
#WANGEL.
Have you not the will?
#ELLIDA.
Oh, that is just what I don’t know!
#WANGEL.
To - night all will be decided, dear Ellida——
#ELLIDA.
Yes, think of it——! The decision so near! The decision for all time!
#WANGEL.
——and then to - morrow——
#ELLIDA.
Yes, to - morrow! Perhaps I shall have forfeited my true future!
#WANGEL.
Your true——? whole, full life of freedom forfeited—forfeited for me! And perhaps—for him too.
#WANGEL.
Ellida,—do you love this stranger?
#ELLIDA.
Do I——? Oh how can I tell! I only know that to me he is terrible, and that——
#WANGEL.
——and that——?
#ELLIDA.
——and that I feel as though my place were with him.
#WANGEL.
I begin to understand.
#ELLIDA.
And what help, what remedy have you to offer me?
#WANGEL.
To - morrow—he will be gone. Then you will be safe from disaster; and then I promise to release you and let you go. We will cancel the bargain, Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
Oh Wangel——! To - morrow—it will be too late——!
#WANGEL.
] The children! The children——! Let us at least spare them—for the present. ARNHOLM, BOLETTA, HILDA, and LYNGSTRAND appear in the garden. LYNGSTRAND takes leave without entering the house, and goes out to the left. The others come into the room.
#ARNHOLM.
Ah, I can tell you we have been laying great plans——
#HILDA.
We want to go out on the fiord this evening, and——
#BOLETTA.
No, no, don’t tell!
#WANGEL.
We two have also been laying plans.
#ARNHOLM.
Ah—really?
#WANGEL.
To - morrow Ellida is going to Skioldvik—for a time.
#BOLETTA.
Going away——?
#ARNHOLM.
That is very wise, Mrs. Wangel.
#WANGEL.
Ellida wants to go home again; home to the sea.
#HILDA.
Are you going away? Going away from us!
#ELLIDA.
Why, Hilda! What is the matter with you?
#HILDA.
Oh, nothing at all. Go by all means!
#BOLETTA.
Father, I can see—you are going away too—to Skioldvik!
#WANGEL.
No, certainly not! I shall perhaps run out now and then——
#BOLETTA.
And home again——?
#WANGEL.
Yes, home——
#BOLETTA.
——now and then, I suppose!
#WANGEL.
My dear child, it must be so.
#ARNHOLM.
I have something to say to you by - and - by, Boletta.
#ELLIDA.
What was the matter with Hilda? She seemed quite beside herself!
#BOLETTA.
Have you never seen what Hilda has been thirsting for, day after day?
#ELLIDA.
Thirsting for?
#BOLETTA.
Ever since you came into the house!
#ELLIDA.
No, no,—what is it?
#BOLETTA.
One word of affection from you.
#ELLIDA.
Ah——! What if there were work for me to do here!
#BOLETTA.
Well, father dear—dinner is on the table,——
#WANGEL.
Is it, child? That’s right. Come along, Arnholm! We will drink a parting cup with—with “the lady from the sea.”
#HILDA.
Look, we can easily jump ashore here!
#ARNHOLM.
No no, don’t do it!
#LYNGSTRAND.
I can’t jump, Miss Hilda.
#HILDA.
Can’t you jump either, Mr. Arnholm?
#ARNHOLM.
I would rather not.
#BOLETTA.
Let us land at the bathing - house steps.
#BALLESTED.
What do you say?—Yes of course it’s in honour of the English steamer. It’s her last trip this year. But if you want to enjoy the music you mustn’t put off too long. What? Can’t hear what you say!
#WANGEL.
But, my dear Ellida, I assure you there is ample time.
#ELLIDA.
No, no,—there is not! He may come at any moment.
#BALLESTED.
Ah, good evening, Doctor! Good evening, Mrs. Wangel!
#WANGEL.
Oh, are you there? Is there to be music to - night again?
#BALLESTED.
Yes. The Musical Society proposes to show what it can do. There’s no lack of festive occasions at this season. To - night it’s in honour of the Englishman.
#ELLIDA.
The English steamer! Is it in sight already?
#BALLESTED.
Not yet; but you see it comes down the fiord among the islands. It is on you before you know where you are.
#ELLIDA.
Yes,—that is true.
#WANGEL.
This is the last trip. After to - night we shall see no more of it. melancholy thought, Doctor. But that’s why we are turning out in its honour, as I said before. Ah yes, ah yes! The happy summer - time is drawing to a close. “Soon will all the straits be ice - bound,” as they say in the tragedy.
#ELLIDA.
All the straits ice - bound,—yes.
#BALLESTED.
Mournful reflection! For weeks and months now we have been joyful children of the summer; it is hard to reconcile oneself to the dark days. At first, that is to say; for people can alcli—ac—climatise themselves, Mrs. Wangel. Yes they can indeed.
#ELLIDA.
Oh this torturing suspense! This intolerable last half - hour before the decision!
#WANGEL.
Then you are still bent on speaking with him yourself?
#ELLIDA.
I must speak with him myself; for I must make my choice of my own free will.
#WANGEL.
You have no choice, Ellida. You cannot be allowed to choose—I will not allow you.
#ELLIDA.
You can never prevent my choosing; neither you nor any one else. You can forbid me to go away with him—to cast in my lot with him—if I should choose that. You can forcibly detain me here, against my will. That you can do. But the choice in my innermost soul—my choice of him and not of you,—in case I should and must choose so,—that you cannot prevent.
#WANGEL.
No, you are right; I cannot prevent that.
#ELLIDA.
And then I have nothing to help me to resist! At home here there is nothing whatever to attach and bind me. I am utterly without root in your house, Wangel. The children are not mine—their hearts, I mean. They have never been mine.—When I go away—if I do go away—either with him to - night or out to Skioldvik to - morrow,—I have not a key to give up, not a direction to leave behind me, about anything in the world. You see how utterly without root I am in your house; how I have stood entirely outside of everything from the very first moment.
#WANGEL.
You yourself willed it so.
#ELLIDA.
No, I did not. I had no will one way or the other. I have merely let everything remain as I found it the day I came. It is you—and no one else—who have willed it so.
#WANGEL.
I meant to do what was best for you.
#ELLIDA.
Oh yes, Wangel, I know that so well! But now all this must be paid for; it will have its revenge. There is nothing here now that has any binding power over me—nothing to support—nothing to help me. There is no counter - fascination for me in what should have been the dearest treasure of our common life.
#WANGEL.
I see that well enough, Ellida; and so from to - morrow you shall have your freedom again. Hereafter you shall live your own life.
#ELLIDA.
You call that my own life! Oh no, my own true life slid into a wrong groove when I joined it to yours. And now—to - night—in half an hour—the man I have forsaken will be here—the man to whom my faith should have been inviolable, as his has been to me! Now he is coming to offer me—for the last and only time—a chance of beginning life afresh—of living my own real life—the life that at once frightens and fascinates me—and that I cannot forgo. Not of my own free will!
#WANGEL.
That is just why you require your husband—and your physician also—to take the power out of your hands, and to act on your behalf.
#ELLIDA.
Yes, Wangel, I understand that very well. Oh, there are times, you may be sure, when I feel as though there would be safety and peace in clinging close to you, and trying to defy all the powers that frighten and fascinate me. But I cannot do it. No, no,—I cannot do it!
#WANGEL.
Come, Ellida—let us walk up and down a little.
#ELLIDA.
I should like to; but I dare not. You know he said that I was to wait for him here.
#WANGEL.
Do come. You have plenty of time yet.
#ELLIDA.
Do you think so?
#WANGEL.
Ample time, I assure you.
#ELLIDA.
Let us walk a little then.
#BOLETTA.
Look there——!
#ARNHOLM.
Hush! Let them go.
#BOLETTA.
Can you understand what has been passing between them these last few days?
#ARNHOLM.
Have you noticed anything?
#BOLETTA.
Have I noticed——!
#ARNHOLM.
Anything particular?
#BOLETTA.
Oh yes; many things. Have you not?
#ARNHOLM.
Well, I don’t quite know——
#BOLETTA.
Yes, I am sure you have; only you won’t admit it.
#ARNHOLM.
I think it will do your stepmother good to take this little trip.
#BOLETTA.
Do you?
#ARNHOLM.
Yes; I fancy it would be a good thing for every one if she were to get away a little now and then.
#BOLETTA.
If she goes home to Skioldvik to - morrow, she will certainly never come back again.
#ARNHOLM.
Why, my dear Boletta, what have you got into your head?
#BOLETTA.
I am perfectly convinced of it. Just you wait! You shall see—she won’t return. Not while Hilda and I are at home, at any rate.
#ARNHOLM.
Hilda too?
#BOLETTA.
Well, perhaps Hilda might not matter so much. She is hardly more than a child yet; and I believe in her heart she worships Ellida. But with me it is different, you see; a stepmother who is not so very much older than oneself——
#ARNHOLM.
My dear Boletta—you may not have so very long to wait before leaving home.
#BOLETTA.
Do you think so? Have you spoken to father about it?
#ARNHOLM.
Yes, I have done that too.
#BOLETTA.
Well—and what did he say?
#ARNHOLM.
H’m—your father is so absorbed in other thoughts just now— -
#BOLETTA.
Yes, yes, that is just what I told you.
#ARNHOLM.
But so much I ascertained from him, that you must not count upon any help from that quarter.
#BOLETTA.
Not——?
#ARNHOLM.
He put his position quite clearly before me, and showed that anything of the kind was a sheer impossibility for him.
#BOLETTA.
Then how could you have the heart to stand there and make game of me?
#ARNHOLM.
Indeed I did not, dear Boletta. It depends entirely upon yourself whether you will leave home or not.
#BOLETTA.
Depends upon me, you say?
#ARNHOLM.
Whether you will go out into the world and learn all that your heart desires. Whether you will take part in all that, at home here, you so long for. Whether you will live your life under happier conditions, Boletta. What do you say?
#BOLETTA.
Oh how glorious——! But all this is utterly impossible. If father neither will nor can——There is no one else in the whole world that I can turn to.
#ARNHOLM.
Could you not let your old—your former tutor come to your aid?
#BOLETTA.
You, Mr. Arnholm? Would you really——?
#ARNHOLM.
Stand by you? Yes, with the greatest of pleasure, both in word and deed; that you may rely upon. Do you accept my offer then? Tell me! Do you consent?
#BOLETTA.
Do I consent? To leave home—to see the world—to learn something really worth knowing—to do everything that has seemed to me most delightful and impossible——?
#ARNHOLM.
Yes, all this is now within your reach, if only you will.
#BOLETTA.
And you will help me to this unspeakable happiness. Oh—but tell me—can I accept so great a gift from a stranger?
#ARNHOLM.
You can quite well accept it from me, Boletta. From me you may accept anything.
#BOLETTA.
Yes, I really think I may. I don’t know how it is, but—— Oh—I could both laugh and cry for joy!—for sheer happiness! Oh—to think that I shall learn what life is, after all; I was beginning to be so afraid that it would slip away from me.
#ARNHOLM.
You need not be afraid of that, dear Boletta. But now you must tell me quite frankly whether there is anything—any tie that binds you here?
#BOLETTA.
Any tie? No, none.
#ARNHOLM.
None at all?
#BOLETTA.
No, none whatever. That is,—of course father is a tie—in a way. And Hilda too. But——
#ARNHOLM.
Well—your father you will have to leave sooner or later; and Hilda too will one day take her own path in life; that is only a question of time. But otherwise there is nothing to bind you, Boletta? No engagement of any sort?
#BOLETTA.
No, nothing of the kind. So far as that is concerned, I can quite well go wherever I please.
#ARNHOLM.
Well then, if that is the case, my dear Boletta—you shall come away with me.
#BOLETTA.
Oh great heavens—what a joy to think of!
#ARNHOLM.
I hope you have full confidence in me?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, indeed I have.
#ARNHOLM.
And you can place yourself and your future fully and fearlessly in my hands, Boletta? You feel you can, do you not?
#BOLETTA.
Oh yes, certainly! Why should I not? Can you doubt it? You, my old tutor—my tutor in the old days, I mean.
#ARNHOLM.
Not only because of that. I do not lay so much stress on that side of the matter. But—well—since you are free then, Boletta—since there is no tie that binds you,—I ask you—if you would be willing—willing to unite yourself to me—for life?
#BOLETTA.
Oh—what are you saying?
#ARNHOLM.
For your whole life, Boletta. Will you be my wife?
#BOLETTA.
No, no, no! This is impossible! Utterly impossible!
#ARNHOLM.
Is it so utterly impossible for you to——?
#BOLETTA.
You surely cannot mean what you are saying, Mr. Arnholm? Or——Perhaps——Was this what you had in mind when—when you proposed to do so much for me?
#ARNHOLM.
Now you must listen to me a little, Boletta. It appears I have taken you quite by surprise.
#BOLETTA.
Oh, how could such an offer—from you,—how could it fail to—to surprise me?
#ARNHOLM.
No doubt you are right. You did not know, of course,—you could not know, that it was for your sake I came here just now.
#BOLETTA.
Did you come here for—for my sake?
#ARNHOLM.
Yes, I did, Boletta. I got a letter from your father this spring—and in it was a phrase which led me to believe—h’m—that you had kept your former tutor in—in a little more than friendly remembrance.
#BOLETTA.
How could father say such a thing?
#ARNHOLM.
It appears that was not what he meant at all. But in the meantime I had accustomed myself to the thought that here was a young girl waiting and longing for me to come again.—No, you mustn’t interrupt me, dear Boletta! And, you see,—when a man, like myself, is no longer in the first flush of youth, such a belief—or illusion—makes an exceedingly strong impression. A vivid—a grateful affection for you grew up within me. I felt I must come to you; see you again; tell you that I shared the feelings which I imagined you entertained for me.
#BOLETTA.
But now, when you know that it was not so! That it was a mistake!
#ARNHOLM.
That makes no difference, Boletta. Your image—as it dwells in my heart—will always remain coloured and thrown into relief by the feeling that mistake aroused in me. Perhaps you cannot understand this; but so it is.
#BOLETTA.
I never dreamed that anything of the kind was possible.
#ARNHOLM.
But now that you see it is——? What do you say, Boletta? Can you not make up your mind to—to be my wife?
#BOLETTA.
Oh, it seems so utterly impossible, Mr. Arnholm. You, who have been my teacher! I cannot imagine myself standing in any other kind of relation to you.
#ARNHOLM.
Well, well—if you feel absolutely sure that you cannot—then the relation between us remains unaltered, my dear Boletta.
#BOLETTA.
How do you mean?
#ARNHOLM.
Of course I stand to my proposition, none the less. I will take care that you get away from home and see something of the world. I will enable you to learn what you really want to, and live in security and independence. Your more distant future, too, I will provide for, Boletta. In me you will always have a firm, steadfast friend to rely upon. Be sure of that!
#BOLETTA.
Oh dear—Mr. Arnholm—all this has become quite impossible now.
#ARNHOLM.
Is this impossible too?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, surely you can see it is! After what you have said to me—and after the answer I have given you——. Oh, you must surely understand that I cannot accept such great favours from you! I can accept nothing in the world from you; never after this!
#ARNHOLM.
Then would you rather stay at home here and let life slip away from you?
#BOLETTA.
Oh, it is torture to think of it!
#ARNHOLM.
Will you renounce all hope of seeing something of the outer world? Renounce your chance of taking part in all that you say you are thirsting for? Can you know that life has such infinite possibilities—and yet be content to realise no single one of them? Think well, Boletta.
#BOLETTA.
Yes, yes—you are quite right, Mr. Arnholm.
#ARNHOLM.
And then—when your father is no longer with you—you might find yourself helpless and alone in the world. Or you might have to give yourself to another man—whom you—possibly—might not be able to care for, any more than for me.
#BOLETTA.
Oh yes,—I see quite well how true it is—all that you say. But still—!——Or perhaps, after all——
#ARNHOLM.
Well!
#BOLETTA.
Perhaps it might not be utterly impossible after all——
#ARNHOLM.
What, Boletta?
#BOLETTA.
That I might—perhaps agree to—what—what you proposed to me.
#ARNHOLM.
Do you mean that perhaps you might——? That at least you would grant me the happiness of coming to your aid as a faithful friend?
#BOLETTA.
No, no, no! Never that! That would be absolutely impossible now. No—Mr. Arnholm—I had rather you should take me——
#ARNHOLM.
Boletta! Will you——!
#BOLETTA.
Yes,—I think—I will.
#ARNHOLM.
You will be my wife?
#BOLETTA.
Yes; if you still think you—ought to take me.
#ARNHOLM.
If I think——! Oh thanks, thanks, Boletta! What you have been saying—your hesitation at first—that does not alarm me. If I do not fully possess your heart as yet, I shall know how to win it. Oh Boletta, how I will treasure you!
#BOLETTA.
And I am to see the world; to take part in its life; you have promised me that.
#ARNHOLM.
And I hold to it.
#BOLETTA.
And I am to learn everything I want to.
#ARNHOLM.
I myself will be your teacher, as in the old days, Boletta. Think of the last year you were my pupil——
#BOLETTA.
Fancy,—to know oneself free—to go out into the unknown world! And then to have no care for the future; no constant fears about miserable money——
#ARNHOLM.
No, you shall never have to waste a thought on such things. And, my dear Boletta, that is a good thing too, in its way—isn’t it now?
#BOLETTA.
Yes, it is indeed. I know it is.
#ARNHOLM.
Oh you shall see how cosily and comfortably we will arrange our life! And what peace and confidence there will be between us, Boletta!
#BOLETTA.
Yes, I begin to——. I really think—that we ought to get on together. Ah! Please don’t say anything about it!
#ARNHOLM.
What is the matter, dear?
#BOLETTA.
Oh, it’s that poor—— Over there.
#ARNHOLM.
Is it your father——?
#BOLETTA.
No, it’s the young sculptor. He is walking over there with Hilda.
#ARNHOLM.
Oh, Lyngstrand. Why should you trouble about him?
#BOLETTA.
Oh you know how delicate and ill he is.
#ARNHOLM.
Yes, if it isn’t all his imagination.
#BOLETTA.
No, it is real; he cannot live long. But perhaps it is best for him.
#ARNHOLM.
How best for him, my dear?
#BOLETTA.
Well because,—because I don’t think much would come of his art in any case.—Let us go before they come.
#ARNHOLM.
By all means, my dear Boletta.
#HILDA.
Hi! Hi! Won’t you condescend to wait for us?
#ARNHOLM.
Boletta and I would rather go on ahead.
#LYNGSTRAND.
It is quite amusing here just now; everybody goes in couples; always two and two together.
#HILDA.
I could almost swear that he is making love to her.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Really? Have you seen anything to make you think so?
#HILDA.
Oh yes. It’s easy to see it—if you keep your eyes about you.
#LYNGSTRAND.
But Miss Boletta will not have him. I am sure of that.
#HILDA.
No. She thinks he looks so frightfully old; and she’s afraid he’ll soon be bald too.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Ah, I don’t mean only because of that. She would not have him in any case.
#HILDA.
How can you know that?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Well, because there is some one else she has promised to keep in her thoughts.
#HILDA.
Only to keep in her thoughts?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, while he is away.
#HILDA.
Oh, then I suppose it’s you she is to keep in her thoughts.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Possibly.
#HILDA.
Has she promised you that?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, only think—she has promised me that! But please, please don’t tell her that you know about it.
#HILDA.
Oh, don’t be afraid: I am as silent as the grave.
#LYNGSTRAND.
I think it is so tremendously kind of her.
#HILDA.
And then, when you come home again—is it to be an engagement? Are you going to marry her?
#LYNGSTRAND.
No, I scarcely think that would do. You see, marriage is out of the question for me for a few years yet; and then, when I have made my way, she will be a bit too old for me, I fancy.
#HILDA.
And yet you want her to go on thinking of you?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes; for it would help me so much; as an artist, you understand. And she, having no special vocation of her own in life, can so easily do it.—But it is kind of her, all the same.
#HILDA.
Do you think, then, that you can get on quicker with your group if you know that Boletta is thinking of you at home here?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I imagine so. You see, the knowledge that somewhere in the world a young, exquisite, silent woman is secretly dreaming of one—I think it must be so—so——. Well, I scarcely know what to call it.
#HILDA.
Do you mean—thrilling?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Thrilling? Oh yes. It is thrilling I mean; or something of that sort. You are so bright, Miss Hilda; really you are very bright, you know. When I come home again you will be just about as old as your sister is now. Perhaps you will look as she looks now; and perhaps you will have grown like her in mind as well. Very likely you will be, as it were, both yourself and her—in one body, so to speak.
#HILDA.
Would that please you?
#LYNGSTRAND.
I don’t quite know. Yes, I almost think so. But now—for this summer—I prefer you to be like yourself alone—just exactly as you are.
#HILDA.
Do you like me best so?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I like you exceedingly as you are.
#HILDA.
H’m,—tell me,—as an artist—do you think I do right in always wearing light summer dresses?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, I think you do perfectly right.
#HILDA.
Then you think bright colours suit me?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, charmingly, to my taste.
#HILDA.
But tell me—as an artist—how do you think I should look in black?
#LYNGSTRAND.
In black, Miss Hilda?
#HILDA.
Yes, all in black. Do you think I should look nice?
#LYNGSTRAND.
Black is scarcely the thing for the summer - time. But for that matter I am sure you would look extremely well in black too. Yes, you have just the figure for it.
#HILDA.
In black right up to the neck—a black ruffle—black gloves and a long black veil behind.
#LYNGSTRAND.
If you were dressed like that, Miss Hilda, I should long to be a painter—so that I might paint a young, lovely, broken - hearted widow.
#HILDA.
Or a young girl mourning for her betrothed.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, that would suit you still better. But you can’t wish to dress yourself like that?
#HILDA.
I don’t know; I think it is thrilling.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Thrilling?
#HILDA.
Thrilling to think of, yes. Oh, look there!
#LYNGSTRAND.
The big English steamer! And right in at the pier! and ELLIDA appear by the pond.
#WANGEL.
No, I assure you, my dear Ellida, you are mistaken. What, are you two here? She is not in sight yet, is she, Mr. Lyngstrand?
#LYNGSTRAND.
The big English boat?
#WANGEL.
Yes.
#LYNGSTRAND.
There she lies already, Doctor.
#ELLIDA.
Ah—! I knew it.
#WANGEL.
She is come!
#LYNGSTRAND.
Come like a thief in the night, you might say—softly and noiselessly——
#WANGEL.
You must take Hilda down to the pier. Make haste! I’m sure she would like to hear the music.
#LYNGSTRAND.
Yes, we were just going, Doctor.
#WANGEL.
We will perhaps come afterwards. We’ll come presently.
#HILDA.
Another pair, you see.
#ELLIDA.
He has come! He is here! Yes, yes—I feel it.
#WANGEL.
You had better go in, Ellida. Let me see him alone.
#ELLIDA.
Oh—it is impossible! Impossible, I say! Ah—do you see him Wangel! enters from the left and stops on the footpath, outside the garden fence.
#THE STRANGER.
Good evening. I have come again you see, Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
Yes, yes, yes,—the hour has come.
#THE STRANGER.
Are you ready to go with me? Or are you not?
#WANGEL.
You can see for yourself that she is not.
#THE STRANGER.
I was not thinking of travelling - clothes and trunks and that sort of thing. I have on board with me everything she requires for the voyage; and I have taken a cabin for her. I ask you, then, if you are ready to come with me—to come with me of your own free will?
#ELLIDA.
Oh, do not ask me! Do not tempt me so!
#THE STRANGER.
There goes the warning bell. Now you must say yes or no.
#ELLIDA.
To have to decide! To decide for all time! To do what can never be undone!
#THE STRANGER.
Never. In half an hour it will be too late.
#ELLIDA.
What makes you hold to me so persistently?
#THE STRANGER.
Do you not feel, as I do, that we two belong to each other?
#ELLIDA.
Do you mean because of that promise?
#THE STRANGER.
Promises bind no one: neither man nor woman. If I hold to you persistently, it is because I cannot do otherwise.
#ELLIDA.
Why did you not come sooner?
#WANGEL.
Ellida!
#ELLIDA.
Oh—what is it that tempts and allures and seems to drag me into the unknown! The whole might of the sea is centred in this one thing!
#ELLIDA.
What is it? What do you want?
#THE STRANGER.
I see it—I hear it in your voice, Ellida—it is me you will choose in the end.
#WANGEL.
My wife has no choice in the matter. I am here to choose for her and—to protect her. Yes, protect her! If you do not get away from here—out of the country—and never come back—do you know what you expose yourself to?
#ELLIDA.
No, no, Wangel! Not that!
#THE STRANGER.
What will you do to me?
#WANGEL.
I will have you arrested—as a felon! At once! Before you can get on board! I know all about the murder out at Skioldvik.
#ELLIDA.
Oh Wangel,—how can you——?
#THE STRANGER.
I was prepared for that move; and therefore,—,—I have provided myself with this.
#ELLIDA.
No, no—do not kill him! Rather kill me!
#THE STRANGER.
Neither you nor him; be easy on that score. This is for myself; I will live and die a free man!
#ELLIDA.
Wangel! Let me tell you this—tell you in his hearing! I know you can keep me here! You have the power, and no doubt you will use it! But my mind—all my thoughts—all my irresistible longings and desires—these you cannot fetter! They will yearn and strain—out into the unknown—that I was created for—and that you have barred against me!
#WANGEL.
I see it clearly, Ellida! Step by step you are gliding away from me. Your craving for the limitless and the infinite—and for the unattainable—will drive your mind quite out into the darkness at last.
#ELLIDA.
Oh yes, yes,—I feel it—like black soundless wings hovering over me!
#WANGEL.
It shall not come to that. There is no other way of deliverance for you; at least I see none. And therefore—therefore I—cancel our bargain on the spot.—Now you can choose your own path—in full—full freedom.
#ELLIDA.
Is this true—true—what you say? Do you mean it—from your inmost heart?
#WANGEL.
Yes,—from the inmost depths of my tortured heart, I mean it.
#ELLIDA.
And can you do it? Can you carry out your purpose?
#WANGEL.
Yes, I can. I can—because of my great love for you.
#ELLIDA.
And I have come to be so near—so dear to you!
#WANGEL.
The years of our marriage have made you so.
#ELLIDA.
And I,—I have been blind to it!
#WANGEL.
Your thoughts went in other directions. But now,—now you are set wholly free from me and mine. Now your own true life can return to its—its right grove again. For now you can choose in freedom; and on your own responsibility, Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
In freedom—and on my own responsibility? Responsibility! This—this transforms everything.
#THE STRANGER.
Do you hear, Ellida? The bell is ringing for the last time. Come away!
#ELLIDA.
I can never go with you after this.
#THE STRANGER.
You will not go?
#ELLIDA.
Oh—after this I can never leave you!
#WANGEL.
Ellida,—Ellida.
#THE STRANGER.
It is all over then?
#ELLIDA.
Yes. Over for all time!
#THE STRANGER.
I see it. There is something here that is stronger than my will.
#ELLIDA.
Your will has no longer a feather’s weight with me. For me you are a dead man, who has come home from the sea—and who is returning to it again. But I am no longer in terror of you: you fascinate me no more.
#THE STRANGER.
Good - bye, Mrs. Wangel! Henceforth you are nothing but—a bygone shipwreck in my life.
#WANGEL.
Ellida—your mind is like the sea: it has its ebb and flow. What brought the transformation?
#ELLIDA.
Oh, do you not understand that the transformation came,—that it had to come—when I could choose in freedom.
#WANGEL.
And the unknown,—it fascinates you no longer?
#ELLIDA.
It neither fascinates nor frightens me. I could have seen into it—gone into it—if I had wished to. I was free to choose it; and therefore I was able to reject it.
#WANGEL.
I begin to understand you—by degrees. You think and conceive in images—in visible pictures. Your longing and yearning for the sea—the fascination that he—the stranger—possessed for you—must have been the expression of an awakening and growing need for freedom within you—nothing else.
#ELLIDA.
Oh, I don’t know what to say to that. But you have been a good physician for me. You found,—and you had the courage to use,—the right remedy—the only one that could help me.
#WANGEL.
Yes, in the last extremity of danger, we physicians have courage for much.—But now you will come to me again, will you not, Ellida?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, my dear, faithful Wangel—now I will come to you again. I can now, for now I come to you in freedom—of my own will—and on my own responsibility.
#WANGEL.
Ellida! Ellida! Oh,—to think that we two can now live wholly for each other——
#ELLIDA.
——and with all our memories in common. Yours—as well as mine.
#WANGEL.
Yes, all in common, dearest!
#ELLIDA.
And our two children, Wangel——
#WANGEL.
Ours you call them!
#ELLIDA.
They are not mine yet—but I shall win them.
#WANGEL.
Ours——! Oh, I thank you for that word more than I can tell. HILDA, BALLESTED, LYNGSTRAND, ARNHOLM, and BOLETTA come from the left into the garden. At the same time a number of young townspeople and summer visitors pass along the footpath.
#HILDA.
Just look,—don’t she and father look like an engaged couple!
#BALLESTED.
It is summer time, little miss.
#ARNHOLM.
The English steamer is under way.
#BOLETTA.
You can see her best from here.
#LYNGSTRAND.
The last trip of the season.
#BALLESTED.
“Soon will all the straits be ice - bound,” as the poet says. It is sad, Mrs. Wangel! And I hear we are to lose you too for a time: you go out to Skioldvik to - morrow, I am told.
#WANGEL.
No—that plan has come to nothing; this evening we two have changed our minds.
#ARNHOLM.
Ah,—really!
#BOLETTA.
Father—is this true?
#HILDA.
Are you going to stay with us after all?
#ELLIDA.
Yes, dear Hilda—if you will have me.
#HILDA.
Oh,—can you ask—if I will——!
#ARNHOLM.
This is really quite a surprise!
#ELLIDA.
Well, you see, Mr. Arnholm——. Do you remember what we were speaking of yesterday? When you have once for all become a land - animal—you can never find the way back again—out to the sea. Nor to the sea - life either.
#BALLESTED.
Why, that’s just the case of my mermaid!
#ELLIDA.
Very like it, yes.
#BALLESTED.
Only with this difference, that the mermaid—she dies of it. Human beings, on the contrary—they can acclam—accli—matise themselves. Yes, I assure you, Mrs. Wangel, they can ac - cli - matise themselves.
#ELLIDA.
Yes, in freedom they can, Mr. Ballested.
#WANGEL.
And under full responsibility, dear Ellida.
#ELLIDA.
That is the secret.
