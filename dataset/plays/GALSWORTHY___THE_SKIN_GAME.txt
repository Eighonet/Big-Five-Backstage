#JILL.
You know, Dodo, it's all pretty good rot in these days.
#HILLCRIST.
Cads are cads, Jill, even in these days.
#JILL.
What is a cad? self - assertive fellow, without a sense of other people.
#JILL.
Well, Old Hornblower I'll give you.
#HILLCRIST.
I wouldn't take him.
#JILL.
Well, you've got him. Now, Charlie - Chearlie - I say - the importance of not being Charlie -
#HILLCRIST.
Good heavens! do you know their Christian names?
#JILL.
My dear father, they've been here seven years.
#HILLCRIST.
In old days we only knew their Christian names from their tombstones.
#JILL.
Charlie Hornblower isn't really half a bad sport.
#HILLCRIST.
About a quarter of a bad sport I've always thought out hunting.
#JILL.
Now, his wife - Chloe -
#HILLCRIST.
Gad! your mother'd have a fit if she knew you called her Chloe.
#JILL.
It's a ripping name.
#HILLCRIST.
Chloe! H'm! I had a spaniel once -
#JILL.
Dodo, you're narrow. Buck up, old darling, it won't do. Chloe has seen life, I'm pretty sure; THAT'S attractive, anyway. No, mother's not in the room; don't turn your uneasy eyes.
#HILLCRIST.
Really, my dear, you are getting -
#JILL.
The limit. Now, Rolf -
#HILLCRIST.
What's Rolf? Another dog?
#JILL.
Rolf Hornblower's a topper; he really is a nice boy.
#HILLCRIST.
Oh! He's a nice boy?
#JILL.
Yes, darling. You know what a nice boy is, don't you?
#HILLCRIST.
Not in these days.
#JILL.
Well, I'll tell you. In the first place, he's not amorous.
#HILLCRIST.
What! Well, that's some comfort.
#JILL.
Just a jolly good companion.
#HILLCRIST.
To whom?
#JILL.
Well, to anyone - me.
#HILLCRIST.
Where?
#JILL.
Anywhere. You don't suppose I confine myself to the home paddocks, do you? I'm naturally rangey, Father.
#HILLCRIST.
You don't say so!
#JILL.
In the second place, he doesn't like discipline.
#HILLCRIST.
Jupiter! He does seem attractive.
#JILL.
In the third place, he bars his father.
#HILLCRIST.
Is that essential to nice girls too?
#JILL.
Fish not! Fourthly, he's got ideas.
#HILLCRIST.
I knew it!
#JILL.
For instance, he thinks - as I do -
#HILLCRIST.
Ah! Good ideas.
#JILL.
Careful! He thinks old people run the show too much. He says they oughtn't to, because they're so damtouchy. Are you damtouchy, darling?
#HILLCRIST.
Well, I'm - ! I don't know about touchy.
#JILL.
He says there'll be no world fit to live in till we get rid of the old. We must make them climb a tall tree, and shake them off it.
#HILLCRIST.
Oh! he says that!
#JILL.
Otherwise, with the way they stand on each other's rights, they'll spoil the garden for the young.
#HILLCRIST.
Does his father agree?
#JILL.
Oh! Rolf doesn't talk to him, his mouth's too large. Have you ever seen it, Dodo?
#HILLCRIST.
Of course.
#JILL.
It's considerable, isn't it? Now yours is - reticent, darling.
#HILLCRIST.
It won't be in a minute. Do you realise that I've got gout?
#JILL.
Poor ducky! How long have we been here, Dodo?
#HILLCRIST.
Since Elizabeth, anyway.
#JILL.
It has its drawbacks. D'you think Hornblower had a father? I believe he was spontaneous. But, Dodo, why all this - this attitude to the Hornblowers?
#HILLCRIST.
Because they're pushing.
#JILL.
That's only because we are, as mother would say, and they're not - yet. But why not let them be?
#HILLCRIST.
You can't.
#JILL.
Why?
#HILLCRIST.
It takes generations to learn to live and let live, Jill. People like that take an ell when you give them an inch.
#JILL.
But if you gave them the ell, they wouldn't want the inch. Why should it all be such a skin game?
#HILLCRIST.
Skin game? Where do you get your lingo?
#JILL.
Keep to the point, Dodo.
#HILLCRIST.
Well, Jill, all life's a struggle between people at different stages of development, in different positions, with different amounts of social influence and property. And the only thing is to have rules of the game and keep them. New people like the Hornblowers haven't learnt those rules; their only rule is to get all they can.
#JILL.
Darling, don't prose. They're not half as bad as you think.
#HILLCRIST.
Well, when I sold Hornblower Longmeadow and the cottages, I certainly found him all right. All the same, he's got the cloven hoof. His influence in Deepwater is thoroughly bad; those potteries of his are demoralising - the whole atmosphere of the place is changing. It was a thousand pities he ever came here and discovered that clay. He's brought in the modern cutthroat spirit.
#JILL.
Cut our throat spirit, you mean. What's your definition of a gentleman, Dodo?
#HILLCRIST.
Can't describe - only feel it.
#JILL.
Oh! Try!
#HILLCRIST.
Well - er - I suppose you might say - a man who keeps his form and doesn't let life scupper him out of his standards.
#JILL.
But suppose his standards are low?
#HILLCRIST.
I assume, of course, that he's honest and tolerant, gentle to the weak, and not self - seeking.
#JILL.
Ah! self - seeking? But aren't we all, Dodo? I am.
#HILLCRIST.
You!
#JILL.
Oh! yes - too young to know.
#HILLCRIST.
Nobody knows till they're under pretty heavy fire, Jill.
#JILL.
Except, of course, mother.
#HILLCRIST.
How do you mean - mother?
#JILL.
Mother reminds me of England according to herself - always right whatever she does.
#HILLCRIST.
Ye - es. Your mother it perhaps - the perfect woman.
#JILL.
That's what I was saying. Now, no one could call you perfect, Dodo. Besides, you've got gout.
#HILLCRIST.
Yes; and I want Fellows. Ring that bell.
#JILL.
Shall I tell you my definition of a gentleman? A man who gives the Hornblower his due. And I think mother ought to call on them. Rolf says old Hornblower resents it fearfully that she's never made a sign to Chloe the three years she's been here.
#HILLCRIST.
I don't interfere with your mother in such matters. She may go and call on the devil himself if she likes.
#JILL.
I know you're ever so much better than she is.
#HILLCRIST.
That's respectful.
#JILL.
You do keep your prejudices out of your phiz. But mother literally looks down her nose. And she never forgives an "h." They'd get the "hell" from her if they took the "hinch."
#HILLCRIST.
Jill - your language!
#JILL.
Don't slime out of it, Dodo. I say, mother ought to call on the Hornblowers. Well?
#HILLCRIST.
My dear, I always let people have the last word. It makes them - feel funny. Ugh! My foot! Fellows, send into the village and get another bottle of this stuff.
#JILL.
I'll go, darling.
#HILLCRIST.
And tell cook I've got to go on slops. This foot's worse.
#FELLOWS.
Indeed, sir.
#HILLCRIST.
My third go this year, Fellows.
#FELLOWS.
Very annoying, sir.
#HILLCRIST.
Ye - es. Ever had it?
#FELLOWS.
I fancy I have had a twinge, sir.
#HILLCRIST.
Have you? Where?
#FELLOWS.
In my cork wrist, sir.
#HILLCRIST.
Your what?
#FELLOWS.
The wrist I draw corks with.
#HILLCRIST.
You'd have had more than a twinge if you'd lived with my father. H'm!
#FELLOWS.
Excuse me, sir - Vichy water corks, in my experience, are worse than any wine.
#HILLCRIST.
Ah! The country's not what it was, is it, Fellows?
#FELLOWS.
Getting very new, sir.
#HILLCRIST.
You're right. Has Dawker come?
#FELLOWS.
Not yet, sir. The Jackmans would like to see you, sir.
#HILLCRIST.
What about?
#FELLOWS.
I don't know, sir.
#HILLCRIST.
Well, show them in.
#FELLOWS.
Yes, sir.
#HILLCRIST.
Good morning, Mrs. Jackman! Morning, Jackman! Haven't seen you for a long time. What can I do?
#HILLCRIST.
We've had notice to quit, sir.
#HILLCRIST.
What!
#JACKMAN.
Got to be out this week.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Yes, sir, indeed.
#HILLCRIST.
Well, but when I sold Longmeadow and the cottages, it was on the express understanding that there was to be no disturbance of tenancies:
#MRS. JENKINS.
Yes, sir; but we've all got to go. Mrs. 'Arvey, and the Drews, an' us, and there isn't another cottage to be had anywhere in Deepwater.
#HILLCRIST.
I know; I want one for my cowman. This won't do at all. Where do you get it from?
#JACKMAN.
Mr. 'Ornblower, 'imself, air. Just an hour ago. He come round and said: "I'm sorry; I want the cottages, and you've got to clear."
#MRS. JENKINS.
He's no gentleman, sir; he put it so brisk. We been there thirty years, and now we don't know what to do. So I hope you'll excuse us coming round, sir.
#HILLCRIST.
I should think so, indeed! H'm! The cloven hoof. By George! this is a breach of faith. I'll write to him, Jackman. Confound it! I'd certainly never have sold if I'd known he was going to do this.
#MRS. JENKINS.
No, sir, I'm sure, sir. They do say it's to do with the potteries. He wants the cottages for his workmen.
#HILLCRIST.
That's all very well, but he shouldn't have led me to suppose that he would make no change.
#JACKMAN.
They talk about his havin' bought the Centry to gut up more chimneys there, and that's why he wants the cottages.
#HILLCRIST.
The Centry! Impossible!
#HILLCRIST.
The Centry! Mrs. J. I'm glad you're goin' to stop it, sir. It does put us about. We don't know where to go. I said to Mr. Hornblower, I said, "I'm sure Mr. Hillcrist would never 'eve turned us out." An' 'e said: "Mr. Hillcrist be - " beggin' your pardon, sir. "Make no mistake," 'e said, "you must go, missis." He don't even know our name; an' to come it like this over us! He's a dreadful new man, I think, with his overridin notions. And sich a heavyfooted man, to look at. But he's from the North, they say.
#HILLCRIST.
Ask Mrs. Hillcrist if she'll come.
#FELLOWS.
Very good, sir.
#HILLCRIST.
Is Dawker here?
#FELLOWS.
Not yet, sir.
#HILLCRIST.
I want to see him at once.
#JACKMAN.
Mr. Hornblower said he was comin' on to see you, sir. So we thought we'd step along first.
#HILLCRIST.
Quite right, Jackman.
#MRS. JENKINS.
I said to Jackman: "Mr. Hillcrist'll stand up for us, I know. He's a gentleman," I said. "This man," I said, "don't care for the neighbourhood, or the people; he don't care for anything so long as he makes his money, and has his importance. You can't expect it, I suppose," I said; "havin' got rich so sudden." The gentry don't do things like that.
#HILLCRIST.
Quite, Mrs. Jackman, quite! The Centry! No! Oh! Amy! Mr. and Mrs. Jackman turned out of their cottage, and Mrs. Harvey, and the Drews. When I sold to Hornblower, I stipulated that they shouldn't be.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Our week's up on Saturday, ma'am, and I'm sure I don't know where we shall turn, because of course Jackman must be near his work, and I shall lose me washin' if we have to go far.
#HILLCRIST.
You leave it to me, Mrs. Jackman. Good morning! Morning, Jackman! Sorry I can't move with this gout.
#MRS. JENKINS.
I'm sure we're very sorry, sir. Good morning, sir. Good morning, ma'am; and thank you kindly.
#HILLCRIST.
Turning people out that have been there thirty years. I won't have it. It's a breach of faith.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Do you suppose this Hornblower will care two straws about that Jack?
#HILLCRIST.
He must, when it's put to him, if he's got any decent feeling.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
He hasn't.
#HILLCRIST.
The Jackmans talk of his having bought the Centry to put up more chimneys.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Never! Impossible! It would ruin the place utterly; besides cutting us off from the Duke's. Oh, no! Miss Mullins would never sell behind our backs.
#HILLCRIST.
Anyway I must stop his turning these people out. Mrs. H. You might have known he'd do something of the sort. You will imagine people are like yourself, Jack. You always ought to make Dawker have things in black and white.
#HILLCRIST.
I said quite distinctly: "Of course you won't want to disturb the tenancies; there's a great shortage of cottages." Hornblower told me as distinctly that he wouldn't. What more do you want? Mrs. H. A man like that thinks of nothing but the short cut to his own way. If he buys the Centry and puts up chimneys, we simply couldn't stop here.
#HILLCRIST.
My father would turn in his grave.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
It would have been more useful if he'd not dipped the estate, and sold the Centry. This Hornblower hates us; he thinks we turn up our noses at him.
#HILLCRIST.
As we do, Amy.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Who wouldn't? A man without traditions, who believes in nothing but money and push.
#HILLCRIST.
Suppose he won't budge, can we do anything for the Jackmans?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
There are the two rooms Beaver used to have, over the stables.
#FELLOWS.
Mr. Dawker, sir.
#HILLCRIST.
Ah! Dawker, I've got gout again.
#DAWKER.
Very sorry, sir. How de do, ma'am?
#HILLCRIST.
Did you meet the Jackmans?
#DAWKER.
Yeh.
#HILLCRIST.
Then you heard?
#DAWKER.
Smart man, Hornblower; never lets grass grow.
#HILLCRIST.
Smart?
#DAWKER.
Don't do to underrate your neighbours. cad - I call him.
#DAWKER.
That's it, ma'am - got all the advantage.
#HILLCRIST.
Heard anything about the Centry, Dawker?
#DAWKER.
Hornblower wants to buy.
#HILLCRIST.
Miss Mullins would never sell, would she?
#DAWKER.
She wants to.
#HILLCRIST.
The deuce she does!
#DAWKER.
He won't stick at the price either.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
What's it worth, Dawker?
#DAWKER.
Depends on what you want it for.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
He wants it for spite; we want it for sentiment.
#DAWKER.
Worth what you like to give, then; but he's a rich man.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Intolerable!
#DAWKER.
Give me your figure, sir. I'll try the old lady before he gets at her.
#HILLCRIST.
I don't want to buy, unless there's nothing else for it. I should have to raise the money on the estate; it won't stand much more. I can't believe the fellow would be such a barbarian. Chimneys within three hundred yards, right in front of this house! It's a nightmare.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
You'd much better let Dawker make sure, Jack.
#HILLCRIST.
Jackman says Hornblower's coming round to see me. I shall put it to him.
#DAWKER.
Make him keener than ever. Better get in first.
#HILLCRIST.
Ape his methods! - Ugh! Confound this gout! Look here, Dawker, I wanted to see you about gates -
#FELLOWS.
Mr. Hornblower.
#HORNBLOWER.
Good morning! good morning! How are ye, Dawker? Fine morning! Lovely weather! Haven't seen ye for a long time, Hillcrist.
#HILLCRIST.
Not since I sold you Longmeadow and those cottages, I believe.
#HORNBLOWER.
Dear me, now! that's what I came about.
#HILLCRIST.
Forgive me! Won't you sit down?
#HORNBLOWER.
Have ye got gout? That's unfortunate. I never get it. I've no disposition that way. Had no ancestors, you see. Just me own drinkin' to answer for.
#HILLCRIST.
You're lucky.
#HORNBLOWER.
I wonder if Mrs. Hillcrist thinks that! Am I lucky to have no past, ma'am? Just the future?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
You're sure you have the future, Mr. Hornblower?
#HORNBLOWER.
That's your aristocratic rapier thrust. You aristocrats are very hard people underneath your manners. Ye love to lay a body out. But I've got the future all right.
#HILLCRIST.
I've had the Dackmans here, Mr. Hornblower.
#HORNBLOWER.
Who are they - man with the little spitfire wife?
#HILLCRIST.
They're very excellent, good people, and they've been in that cottage quietly thirty years.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ah! ye've wanted me to stir ye up a bit. Deepwater needs a bit o' go put into it. There's generally some go where I am. I daresay you wish there'd been no "come."
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
We certainly like people to keep their word, Mr. Hornblower.
#HILLCRIST.
Amy!
#HORNBLOWER.
Never mind, Hillcrist; takes more than that to upset me.
#HILLCRIST.
You promised me, you know, not to change the tenancies.
#HORNBLOWER.
Well, I've come to tell ye that I have. I wasn't expecting to have the need when I bought. Thought the Duke would sell me a bit down there; but devil a bit he will; and now I must have those cottages for my workmen. I've got important works, ye know.
#HILLCRIST.
The Jackmans have their importance too, sir. Their heart's in that cottage.
#HORNBLOWER.
Have a sense of proportion, man. My works supply thousands of people, and my, heart's in them. What's more, they make my fortune. I've got ambitions - I'm a serious man. Suppose I were to consider this and that, and every little potty objection - where should I get to? - nowhere!
#HILLCRIST.
All the same, this sort of thing isn't done, you know.
#HORNBLOWER.
Not by you because ye've got no need to do it. Here ye are, quite content on what your fathers made for ye. Ye've no ambitions; and ye want other people to have none. How d'ye think your fathers got your land?
#HILLCRIST.
Not by breaking their word.
#HORNBLOWER.
Don't ye believe it. They got it by breaking their word and turnin' out Jackmans, if that's their name, all over the place.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
That's an insult, Mr. Hornblower.
#HORNBLOWER.
No; it's a repartee. If ye think so much of these Jackmans, build them a cottage yourselves; ye've got the space.
#HILLCRIST.
That's beside the point. You promised me, and I sold on that understanding.
#HORNBLOWER.
And I bought on the understandin' that I'd get some more land from the Duke.
#HILLCRIST.
That's nothing to do with me.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ye'll find it has; because I'm going to have those cottages.
#HILLCRIST.
Well, I call it simply -
#HORNBLOWER.
Look here, Hillcrist, ye've not had occasion to understand men like me. I've got the guts, and I've got the money; and I don't sit still on it. I'm going ahead because I believe in meself. I've no use for sentiment and that sort of thing. Forty of your Jackmans aren't worth me little finger.
#HILLCRIST.
Of all the blatant things I ever heard said!
#HORNBLOWER.
Well, as we're speaking plainly, I've been thinkin'. Ye want the village run your oldfashioned way, and I want it run mine. I fancy there's not room for the two of us here.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
When are you going?
#HORNBLOWER.
Never fear, I'm not going.
#HILLCRIST.
Look here, Mr. Hornblower - this infernal gout makes me irritable - puts me at a disadvantage. But I should be glad if you'd kindly explain yourself.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ca' canny; I'm fra' the North.
#HILLCRIST.
I'm told you wish to buy the Centry and put more of your chimneys up there, regardless of the fact that it would utterly ruin the house we've had for generations, and all our pleasure here.
#HORNBLOWER.
How the man talks! Why! Ye'd think he owned the sky, because his fathers built him a house with a pretty view, where he's nothing to do but live. It's sheer want of something to do that gives ye your fine sentiments, Hillcrist.
#HILLCRIST.
Have the goodness not to charge me with idleness. Dawker - where is he? - When you do the drudgery of your works as thoroughly as I do that of my estate - Is it true about the Centry?
#HORNBLOWER.
Gospel true. If ye want to know, my son Chearlie is buyin' it this very minute.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
What do you say?
#HORNBLOWER.
Ay, he's with the old lady she wants to sell, an' she'll get her price, whatever it is.
#HILLCRIST.
If that isn't a skin game, Mr. Hornblower, I don't know what is.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ah! Ye've got a very nice expression there. "Skin game!" Well, bad words break no bones, an' they're wonderful for hardenin' the heart. If it wasn't for a lady's presence, I could give ye a specimen or two.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Oh! Mr. Hornblower, that need not stop you, I'm sure.
#HORNBLOWER.
Well, and I don't know that it need. Ye're an obstruction - the like of you - ye're in my path. And anyone in my path doesn't stay there long; or, if he does, he stays there on my terms. And my terms are chimneys in the Centry where I need 'em. It'll do ye a power of good, too, to know that ye're not almighty.
#HILLCRIST.
And that's being neighbourly!
#HORNBLOWER.
And how have ye tried bein' neighbourly to me? If I haven't a wife, I've got a daughter - in - law. Have Ye celled on her, ma'am? I'm new, and ye're an old family. Ye don't like me, ye think I'm a pushin' man. I go to chapel, an' ye don't like that. I make things and I sell them, and ye don't like that. I buy land, and ye don't like that. It threatens the view from your windies. Well, I don't lie you, and I'm not goin' to put up with your attitude. Ye've had things your own way too long, and now ye're not going to have them any longer.
#HILLCRIST.
Will you hold to your word over those cottages?
#HORNBLOWER.
I'm goin' to have the cottages. I need them, and more besides, now I'm to put up me new works.
#HILLCRIST.
That's a declaration of war.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ye never said a truer word. It's one or the other of us, and I rather think it's goin' to be me. I'm the risin' and you're the settin' sun, as the poet says.
#HILLCRIST.
We shall see if you can ride rough - shod like this. We used to have decent ways of going about things here. You want to change all that. Well, we shall do our damnedest to stop you. Are the Jackmans still in the house? Ask them to be good enough to come in.
#HORNBLOWER.
I've seen these people. I've nothing more to say to them. I told 'em I'd give 'em five pounds to cover their moving.
#HILLCRIST.
It doesn't occur to you that people, however humble, like to have some say in their own fate?
#HORNBLOWER.
I never had any say in mine till I had the brass, and nobody ever will. It's all hypocrisy. You county folk are fair awful hypocrites. Ye talk about good form and all that sort o' thing. It's just the comfortable doctrine of the man in the saddle; sentimental varnish. Ye're every bit as hard as I am, underneath.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
You flatter us.
#HORNBLOWER.
Not at all. God helps those who 'elp themselves - that's at the bottom of all religion. I'm goin' to help meself, and God's going to help me.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I admire your knowledge.
#HILLCRIST.
We are in the right, and God helps -
#HORNBLOWER.
Don't ye believe it; ye 'aven't got the energy.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Nor perhaps the conceit.
#HORNBLOWER.
No, no; 'tisn't conceit to believe in yourself when ye've got reason to.
#HILLCRIST.
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Jackman, but I just wanted you to realise that I've done my best with this gentleman.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Yes, sir. I thought if you spoke for us, he'd feel different - like.
#HORNBLOWER.
One cottage is the same as another, missis. I made ye a fair offer of five pounds for the moving.
#JACKMAN.
We wouldn't take fifty to go out of that 'ouse. We brought up three children there, an' buried two from it.
#MRS. JENKINS.
We're attached to it like, ma'am.
#HILLCRIST.
How would you like being turned out of a place you were fond of?
#HORNBLOWER.
Not a bit. But little considerations have to give way to big ones. Now, missis, I'll make it ten pounds, and I'll send a wagon to shift your things. If that isn't fair - ! Ye'd better accept, I shan't keep it open.
#MRS. JENKINS.
We won't take it; eh, George?
#JACKMAN.
Not a farden. We come there when we was married.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ye're very improvident folk.
#HILLCRIST.
Don't lecture them, Mr. Hornblower; they come out of this miles above you.
#HORNBLOWER.
Well, I was going to give ye another week, but ye'll go out next Saturday; and take care ye're not late, or your things'll be put out in the rain.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
We'll send down for your things, and you can come to us for the time being.
#JACKMAN.
You're no gentleman! Don't put temptation in my way, that's all.
#HILLCRIST.
Jackman!
#HORNBLOWER.
Ye hear that? That's your protegee! Keep out o' my way, me man, or I'll put the police on to ye for utterin' threats.
#HILLCRIST.
You'd better go now, Jackman.
#MRS. JENKINS.
Maybe you'll repent it some day, sir.
#HORNBLOWER.
We - ell, I'm sorry they're such unreasonable folk. I never met people with less notion of which side their bread was buttered.
#HILLCRIST.
And I never met anyone so pachydermatous.
#HORNBLOWER.
What's that, in Heaven's name? Ye needn' wrap it up in long words now your good lady's gone.
#HILLCRIST.
I'm not going in for a slanging match. I resent your conduct much too deeply.
#HORNBLOWER.
Look here, Hillcrist, I don't object to you personally; ye seem to me a poor creature that's bound to get left with your gout and your dignity; but of course ye can make yourself very disagreeable before ye're done. Now I want to be the movin' spirit here. I'm full of plans. I'm goin' to stand for Parliament; I'm goin' to make this a prosperous place. I'm a good - matured man if you'll treat me as such. Now, you take me on as a neighbour and all that, and I'll manage without chimneys on the Centry. Is it a bargain?
#HILLCRIST.
I thought you said you didn't keep your word when it suited you to break it?
#HORNBLOWER.
Now, don't get on the high horse. You and me could be very good friends; but I can be a very nasty enemy. The chimneys will not look nice from that windie, ye know.
#HILLCRIST.
Mr. Hornblower, if you think I'll take your hand after this Jackman business, you're greatly mistaken. You are proposing that I shall stand in with you while you tyrannise over the neighbourhood. Please realise that unless you leave those tenancies undisturbed as you said you would, we don't know each other.
#HORNBLOWER.
Well, that won't trouble me much. Now, ye'd better think it over; ye've got gout and that makes ye hasty. I tell ye again: I'm not the man to make an enemy of. Unless ye're friendly, sure as I stand here I'll ruin the look of your place. There's my car. I sent Chearlie and his wife in it to buy the Centry. And make no mistake - he's got it in his packet. It's your last chance, Hillcrist. I'm not averse to you as a man; I think ye're the best of the fossils round here; at least, I think ye can do me the most harm socially. Come now!
#HILLCRIST.
Not if you'd bought the Centry ten times over. Your ways are not mine, and I'll have nothing to do with you.
#HORNBLOWER.
Really! Is that so? Very well. Now ye're goin' to learn something, an' it's time ye did. D'ye realise that I'm 'very nearly round ye? I'm at Uphill, the works are here, here's Longmeadow, here's the Centry that I've just bought, there's only the Common left to give ye touch with the world. Now between you and the Common there's the high road. I come out on the high road here to your north, and I shall come out on it there to your west. When I've got me new works up on the Centry, I shall be makin' a trolley track between the works up to the road at both ends, so any goods will be running right round ye. How'll ye like that for a country place?
#JILL.
Look, Dodo, I've brought the lot! Isn't it a treat, dear Papa? And here's the stuff. Hallo!
#HORNBLOWER.
Well, Chearlie?
#CHARLES.
Not got it.
#HORNBLOWER.
Not!
#CHARLES.
I'd practically got her to say she'd sell at three thousand five hundred, when that fellow Dawker turned up.
#HORNBLOWER.
That bull - terrier of a chap! Why, he was here a while ago. Oh - ho! So that's it!
#CHARLES.
I heard him gallop up. He came straight for the old lady, and got her away. What he said I don't know; but she came back looking wiser than an owl; said she'd think it over, thought she had other views.
#HORNBLOWER.
Did ye tell her she might have her price?
#CHARLES.
Practically I did.
#HORNBLOWER.
Well?
#CHARLES.
She thought it would be fairer to put it up to auction. There were other enquiries. Oh! She's a leery old bird - reminds me of one of those pictures of Fate, don't you know.
#HORNBLOWER.
Auction! Well, if it's not gone we'll get it yet. That damned little Dawker! I've had a row with Hillcrist.
#CHARLES.
I thought so.
#JILL.
That's not a bit sporting of you, Mr. Hornblower.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ye should hear both sides before ye say that, missy.
#JILL.
There isn't another side to turning out the Jackmans after you'd promised.
#HORNBLOWER.
Oh! dear me, yes. They don't matter a row of gingerbread to the schemes I've got for betterin' this neighbourhood.
#JILL.
I had been standing up for you; now I won't.
#HORNBLOWER.
Dear, dear! What'll become of me?
#JILL.
I won't say anything about the other thing because I think it's beneath, dignity to notice it. But to turn poor people out of their cottages is a shame.
#HORNBLOWER.
Hoity me!
#ROLF.
You haven't been doing that, father?
#CHARLES.
Shut up, Rolf!
#HORNBLOWER.
Ha! Here's a league o' Youth! My young whipper - snapper, keep your mouth shut and leave it to your elders to know what's right.
#ROLF.
I hate it!
#HORNBLOWER.
Oh! Ye hate it? Ye can get out of my house, then.
#JILL.
Free speech, Mr. Hornblower; don't be violent.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ye're right, young lady. Ye can stay in my house, Rolf, and learn manners. Come, Chearlie!
#JILL.
Mr. Hornblower!
#HILLCRIST.
Jill!
#JILL.
Well, what's the good of it? Life's too short for rows, and too jolly!
#ROLF.
Bravo!
#HORNBLOWER.
Now, look here! I will not have revolt in my family. Ye'll just have to learn that a man who's worked as I have, who's risen as I have, and who knows the world, is the proper judge of what's right and wrong. I'll answer to God for me actions, and not to you young people.
#JILL.
Poor God!
#HORNBLOWER.
Ye blasphemous young thing!
#HILLCRIST.
Jill, I wish you would kindly not talk.
#JILL.
I can't help it.
#CHARLES.
Come along, father! Deeds, not words.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ay! Deeds!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Quite right!
#HORNBLOWER.
Ah! So ye put your dog on to it. Very smart, that - I give ye credit.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
May I ask who this lady is?
#HORNBLOWER.
No, ma'am, ye may not, for ye know perfectly well.
#JILL.
I brought her in, mother
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Will you take her out again, then.
#HILLCRIST.
Amy, have the goodness to remember -
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
That this is my house so far as ladies are concerned.
#JILL.
Mother!
#CHARLES.
You've insulted my wife. Why? What do you mean by it?
#HILLCRIST.
I apologise. I regret extremely. There is no reason why the ladies of your family or of mine should be involved in our quarrel. For Heaven's sake, let's fight like gentlemen.
#HORNBLOWER.
Catchwords - sneers! No; we'll play what ye call a skin game, Hillcrist, without gloves on; we won't spare each other. Ye look out for yourselves, for, begod, after this morning I mean business. And as for you, Dawker, ye sly dog, ye think yourself very clever; but I'll have the Centry yet. Come, Chearlie!
#HILLCRIST.
Well, Dawker?
#DAWKER.
Safe for the moment. The old lady'll put it up to auction. Couldn't get her to budge from that. Says she don't want to be unneighbourly to either. But, if you ask me, it's money she smells!
#JILL.
Now, mother
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Well?
#JILL.
Why did you insult her?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I think I only asked you to take her out.
#JILL.
Why? Even if she is Old Combustion's daughter - in - law?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
My dear Jill, allow me to judge the sort of acquaintances I wish to make.
#JILL.
She's all right. Lots of women powder and touch up their lips nowadays. I think she's rather a good sort; she was awfully upset.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Too upset.
#JILL.
Oh! don't be so mysterious, mother. If you know something, do spit it out!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Do you wish me to - er - "spit it out," Jack?
#HILLCRIST.
Dawker, if you don't mind - Jill, be respectful, and don't talk like a bargee.
#JILL.
It's no good, Dodo. It made me ashamed. It's just as - as caddish to insult people who haven't said a word, in your own house, as it is to be - old Hornblower.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
You don't know what you're talking about.
#HILLCRIST.
What's the matter with young Mrs. Hornblower?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Excuse me, I shall keep my thoughts to myself at present.
#HILLCRIST.
You've thoroughly upset your mother, Jill.
#JILL.
It's something Dawker's told her; I saw them. I don't like Dawker, father, he's so common.
#HILLCRIST.
My dear, we can't all be uncommon. He's got lots of go, You must apologise to your mother.
#JILL.
They'll make you do things you don't approve of, Dodo, if you don't look out. Mother's fearfully bitter when she gets her knife in. If old Hornblower's disgusting, it's no reason we should be.
#HILLCRIST.
So you think I'm capable - that's nice, Jill!
#JILL.
No, no, darling! I only want to warn you solemnly that mother'll tell you you're fighting fair, no matter what she and Dawker do.
#HILLCRIST.
Jill, I don't think I ever saw you so serious.
#JILL.
No. Because - Well - I was just beginning to enjoy, myself; and now - everything's going to be bitter and beastly, with mother in that mood. That horrible old man! Oh, Dodo! Don't let them make you horrid! You're such a darling. How's your gout, ducky?
#HILLCRIST.
Better; lot better.
#JILL.
There, you see! That shows! It's going to be half - interesting for you, but not for - us.
#HILLCRIST.
Look here, Jill - is there anything between you and young what's - his - name - Rolf?
#JILL.
No. But - now it's all spoiled.
#HILLCRIST.
You can't expect me to regret that.
#JILL.
I don't mean any tosh about love's young dream; but I do like being friends. I want to enjoy things, Dodo, and you can't do that when everybody's on the hate. You're going to wallow in it, and so shall I - oh! I know I shall! - we shall all wallow, and think of nothing but "one for his nob."
#HILLCRIST.
Aren't you fond of your home?
#JILL.
Of course. I love it.
#HILLCRIST.
Well, you won't be able to live in it unless we stop that ruffian. Chimneys and smoke, the trees cut down, piles of pots. Every kind of abomination. There! Imagine! I was born here, and my father, and his, and his, and his. They loved those fields, and those old trees. And this barbarian, with his "improvement" schemes, forsooth! I learned to ride in the Centry meadows - prettiest spring meadows in the world; I've climbed every tree there. Why my father ever sold - ! But who could have imagined this? And come at a bad moment, when money's scarce.
#JILL.
Dodo!
#HILLCRIST.
Yes. But you don't love the place as I do, Jill. You youngsters don't love anything, I sometimes think.
#JILL.
I do, Dodo, I do!
#HILLCRIST.
You've got it all before you. But you may live your life and never find anything so good and so beautiful as this old home. I'm not going to have it spoiled without a fight.
#JILL.
Oh - oh - oh! Who goes there?
#ROLF.
Enemy - after Chloe's bag.
#JILL.
Pass, enemy! And all's ill!
#ROLF.
It's not going to make any difference, is it?
#JILL.
You know it is.
#ROLF.
Sins of the fathers.
#JILL.
Unto the third and fourth generations. What sin has my father committed?
#ROLF.
None, in a way; only, I've often told you I don't see why you should treat us as outsiders. We don't like it.
#JILL.
Well, you shouldn't be, then; I mean, he shouldn't be.
#ROLF.
Father's just as human as your father; he's wrapped up in us, and all his "getting on" is for us. Would you like to be treated as your mother treated Chloe? Your mother's set the stroke for the other big - wigs about here; nobody calls on Chloe. And why not? Why not? I think it's contemptible to bar people just because they're new, as you call it, and have to make their position instead of having it left them.
#JILL.
It's not because they're new, it's because - if your father behaved like a gentleman, he'd be treated like one.
#ROLF.
Would he? I don't believe it. My father's a very able man; he thinks he's entitled to have influence here. Well, everybody tries to keep him down. Oh! yes, they do. That makes him mad and more determined than ever to get his way. You ought to be just, Jill.
#JILL.
I am just.
#ROLF.
No, you're not. Besides, what's it got to do with Charlie and Chloe? Chloe's particularly harmless. It's pretty sickening for her. Father didn't expect people to call until Charlie married, but since -
#JILL.
I think it's all very petty.
#ROLF.
It is - a dog - in - the - manger business; I did think you were above it.
#JILL.
How would you like to have your home spoiled?
#ROLF.
I'm not going to argue. Only things don't stand still. Homes aren't any more proof against change than anything else.
#JILL.
All right! You come and try and take ours.
#ROLF.
We don't want to take your home.
#JILL.
Like the Jackmans'?
#ROLF.
All right. I see you're hopelessly prejudiced.
#JILL.
Enemy?
#ROLF.
Yes, enemy.
#JILL.
Before the battle - let's shake hands.
#DAWKER.
Be out of their way here, ma'am. See old Hornblower with Chearlie?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
It begins at three, doesn't it?
#DAWKER.
They won't be over - punctual; there's only the Centry selling. There's young Mrs. Hornblower with the other boy - over at the entrance. I've got that chap I told you of down from town.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Ah! make sure quite of her, Dawker. Any mistake would be fatal.
#DAWKER.
That's right, ma'am. Lot of peopled - always spare time to watch an auction - ever remark that? The Duke's agent's here; shouldn't be surprised if he chipped in.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Where did you leave my husband?
#DAWKER.
With Miss Jill, in the courtyard. He's coming to you. In case I miss him; tell him when I reach his limit to blow his nose if he wants me to go on; when he blows it a second time, I'll stop for good. Hope we shan't get to that. Old Hornblower doesn't throw his money away.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
What limit did you settle?
#DAWKER.
Six thousand!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
That's a fearful price. Well, good luck to you, Dawker!
#DAWKER.
Good luck, ma'am. I'll go and see to that little matter of Mrs. Chloe. Never fear, we'll do them is somehow.
#CHLOE.
Mrs. Hillcrist!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I beg your pardon?
#CHLOE.
Mrs. Hillcrist -
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Well?
#CHLOE.
I never did you any harm.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Did I ever say you did?
#CHLOE.
No; but you act as if I had.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I'm not aware that I've acted at all - as yet. You are nothing to me, except as one of your family.
#CHLOE.
'Tisn't I that wants to spoil your home.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Stop them then. I see your husband down there with his father. have tried.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Oh! I suppose such men don't pay attention to what women ask them.
#CHLOE.
I'm fond of my husband. I -
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I don't quite know why you spoke to me.
#CHLOE.
I only thought perhaps you'd like to treat me as a human being.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Really, if you don't mind, I should like to be left alone just now.
#CHLOE.
Certainly! I'll go to the other end.
#ROLF.
Are you all right?
#CHLOE.
It's awfully hot.
#ROLF.
There's Dawker. I hate that chap!
#CHLOE.
Where?
#ROLF.
Down there; see?
#CHLOE.
Oh!
#ROLF.
Who's that next him, looking up here?
#CHLOE.
I don't know.
#ROLF.
Don't you feel well? Shall I get you some water?
#JILL.
Come to see us turned out?
#ROLF.
No. I'm looking after Chloe; she's not well.
#JILL.
Sorry. She needn't have come, I suppose?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Can Dawker see you there, Jack? What's the time?
#HILLCRIST.
Three minutes to three.
#JILL.
Don't you feel beastly all down the backs of your legs. Dodo?
#HILLCRIST.
Yes.
#JILL.
Do you, mother?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
No. wagon of old Hornblower's pots passed while we were in the yard. It's an omen.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Don't be foolish, Jill.
#JILL.
Look at the old brute! Dodo, hold my hand.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Make sure you've got a handkerchief, Jack.
#HILLCRIST.
I can't go beyond the six thousand; I shall have to raise every penny on mortgage as it is. The estate simply won't stand more, Amy.
#JILL.
Oh! Look! There's Miss Mullins, at the back; just come in. Isn't she a spidery old chip?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Come to gloat. Really, I think her not accepting your offer is disgusting. Her impartiality is all humbug.
#HILLCRIST.
Can't blame her for getting what she can - it's human nature. Phew! I used to feel like this before a 'viva voce'. Who's that next to Dawker?
#JILL.
What a fish!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Ah! yes.
#HILLCRIST.
Thank God for a human touch!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Oh!
#JILL.
I will. Have a sniff; you look awfully white.
#CHLOE.
Oh! no thanks. I'm all right.
#JILL.
No, do! You must.
#JILL.
D'you mind letting me see that a minute? Beastly hot, isn't it? You'd better keep that.
#CHLOE.
Rolf's getting me some water.
#JILL.
Why do you stay? You didn't want to come, did you? All right! Here's your water.
#JILL.
What's the time, Dodo?
#HILLCRIST.
Three minutes past.
#JILL.
Oh, hell!
#HILLCRIST.
Jill!
#JILL.
Sorry, Dodo. I was only thinking. Look! Here he is! Phew! - isn't he - ?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
'Sh!
#AUCTIONEER.
Sorry to disappoint you, gentlemen, but I've only one property to offer you to - day, No. 1, The Centry, Deepwater. The second on the particulars has been withdrawn. The third that's Bidcot, desirable freehold mansion and farmlands in the Parish of Kenway - we shall have to deal with next week. I shall be happy to sell it you then with out reservation. Now, gen'lemen, as I say, I've only the one property to sell. Freehold No. 1 - all that very desirable corn and stock - rearing and parklike residential land known as the Centry, Deepwater, unique property an A.1. chance to an A.1. audience. Ought to make the price of the three we thought we had. Now you won't mind listening to the conditions of sale; Mr. Blinkard'll read 'em, and they won't wirry you, they're very short.
#CHARLES.
Chloe, aren't you well?
#CHARLES.
Come along, out of the way of these people.
#CHLOE.
No; I'm all right; it's hotter there.
#CHARLES.
Well, look after her - I must go back.
#AUCTIONEER.
Now, gen'lemen, it's not often a piece of land like this comes into the market. What's that? No better land in Deepwater - that's right, Mr. Spicer. I know the village well, and a charming place it is; perfect locality, to be sure. Now I don't want to wirry you by singing the praises of this property; there it is - well - watered, nicely timbered - no reservation of the timber, gen'lemen - no tenancy to hold you up; free to do what you like with it to - morrow. You've got a jewel of a site there, too; perfect position for a house. It lies between the Duke's and Squire Hillcrist's - an emerald isle. No allusion to Ireland, gen'lemen - perfect peace in the Centry. Nothing like it in the county - a gen'leman's site, and you don't get that offered you every day. Carries the mineral rights, and as you know, perhaps, there's the very valuable Deepwater clay there. What am I to start it at? Can I say three thousand? Well, anything you like to give me. I'm sot particular. Come now, you've got more time than me, I expect. Two hundred acres of first - rate grazin' and cornland, with a site for a residence unequalled in the county; and all the possibilities! Well, what shall I say? Two thousand? That won't hurt you, Mr. Spicer. Why, it's worth that to overlook the Duke. For two thousand? And five. Thank you, sir. Two thousand five hundred bid. Come, Mr. Sandy, don't scratch your head over it. And five. Three thousand bid for this desirable property. Why, you'd think it wasn't desirable. Come along, gen'lemen. A little spirit.
#JILL.
Why can't I see the bids, Dodo?
#HILLCRIST.
The last was Dawker's.
#AUCTIONEER.
For three thousand. Three thousand five hundred? May I say - four? No, I'm not particular; I'll take hundreds. Three thousand six hundred bid. And seven. Three thousand seven hundred, and -
#JILL.
Who was that, Dodo?
#HILLCRIST.
Hornblower. It's the Duke in the centre.
#AUCTIONEER.
Come, gen'lemen, don't keep me all day. Four thousand may I say? Thank you. We're beginning. And one? Four thousand one hundred. Four thousand two hundred. May I have yours, sir? And three. Four thousand three hundred bid. No such site in the county, gen'lemen. I'm going to sell this land for what it's worth. You can't bid too much for me. Four thousand five hundred bid. And six. And seven. And eight. Nine, may I say? And nine. Five thousand. Five thousand bid. That's better; there's some spirit in it. For five thousand.
#HILLCRIST.
It's a duel now.
#AUCTIONEER.
Now, gen'lemen, I'm not going to give this property away. Five thousand bid. And one. And two. And three. Five thousand three hundred bid. And five, did you say, sir? Five thousand five hundred bid.
#JILL.
Enemy, Dodo.
#AUCTIONEER.
This chance may never come again. as the poet says. May I say five thousand six hundred, sir? Five thousand six hundred bid. And seven. And eight. For five thousand eight hundred pounds. We're gettin' on, but we haven't got the value yet.
#JILL.
Us, Dodo?
#AUCTIONEER.
Five thousand eight hundred bid. For five thousand eight hundred. Come along, gen'lemen, come along. We're not beaten. Thank you, sir. Five thousand nine hundred. And - ? Six thousand. Six thousand bid. Six thousand bid. For six thousand! The Centry - most desirable spot in the county - going for the low price of six thousand.
#HILLCRIST.
Low! Heavens!
#AUCTIONEER.
Any advance on six thousand? Come, gen'lemen, we haven't dried up? A little spirit. Six thousand? For six thousand? For six thousand pounds? Very well, I'm selling. For six thousand once - For six thousand twice -
#JILL.
Oh! we've got it!
#AUCTIONEER.
And one, sir? Six thousand one hundred bid.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Blow your nose, Jack.
#AUCTIONEER.
For six thousand one hundred. And two. Thank you. And three. For six thousand three hundred. And four. For six thousand four hundred pounds. This coveted property. For six thousand four hundred pounds. Why, it's giving it away, gen'lemen.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Giving!
#AUCTIONEER.
Six thousand four hundred bid. And five. And six. And seven. And eight.
#HILLCRIST.
I've done if that doesn't get it.
#AUCTIONEER.
For six thousand eight hundred. For six thousand eight hundred - once - twice - For the last time. This dominating site. And nine. Thank you. For six thousand nine hundred.
#JILL.
Oh! Dodo!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Don't give in!
#AUCTIONEER.
Seven thousand may I say? Seven thousand.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Keep it down; don't show him.
#AUCTIONEER.
For seven - thousand - going for seven thousand - once - twice And one. Thank you, sir.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Oh! Jack.
#JILL.
Stick it, Dodo; stick it!
#AUCTIONEER.
Now, gen'lemen, I have a bid of seven thousand one hundred for the Centry. And I'm instructed to sell if I can't get more. It's a fair price, but not a big price. Well, you're a judge of thumpin', I admit. Now, who'll give me seven thousand two hundred? What, no one? Well, I can't make you, gen'lemen. For seven thousand one hundred. Once - Twice -
#HILLCRIST.
Two.
#AUCTIONEER.
Thank you, sir. And two. Seven thousand two hundred. May I have yours, sir? And three. And four. Seven thousand four hundred. For seven thousand four hundred. Five. Six. For seven thousand six hundred. Well, gen'lemen, this is. better, but a record property shid fetch a record price. The possibilities are enormous. Eight thousand did you say, sir? Eight thousand. Going for eight thousand pounds. And one. And two. And three. And four. And five. For eight thousand five hundred. A wonderful property for eight thousand five hundred.
#JILL.
Oh, Dodo!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
That's enough, Jack, we must stop some time.
#AUCTIONEER.
For eight thousand five hundred. Once - twice - Six hundred. Seven. May I have yours, sir? Eight.
#HILLCRIST.
Nine thousand.
#AUCTIONEER.
Nine thousand for this astounding property. Why, the Duke would pay that if he realised he'd be overlooked. Now, Sir? Just a little raise on that. For nine thousand. The Centry, Deepwater, for nine thousand. Once - Twice -
#JILL.
Ours!
#A VOICE.
And five hundred.
#AUCTIONEER.
And five hundred. For nine thousand five hundred. May I have yours, sir?
#HILLCRIST.
That's stopped him, anyway.
#AUCTIONEER.
For nine thousand five hundred? Once more. The Centry, Deepwater, for nine thousand five hundred. Once - Twice - For the last time - at nine thousand five hundred. Mr. Smalley. Well! That's that! No more to - day, gen'lemen.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Smalley? Smalley? Is that the Duke's agent? Jack!
#HILLCRIST.
What! What!
#JILL.
Oh, Dodo! How splendidly you stuck it!
#HILLCRIST.
Phew! What a squeak! I was clean out of my depth. A mercy the Duke chipped in again.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Take care; they can hear you. Find DAWKER, Jack.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ye ran me up a pretty price. Ye bid very pluckily, Hillcrist. But ye didn't quite get my measure.
#HILLCRIST.
Oh! It was my nine thousand the Duke capped. Thank God, the Centry's gone to a gentleman!
#HORNBLOWER.
The Duke? No, the Gentry's not gone to a gentleman, nor to a fool. It's gone to me.
#HILLCRIST.
What!
#HORNBLOWER.
I'm sorry for ye; ye're not fit to manage these things. Well, it's a monstrous price, and I've had to pay it because of your obstinacy. I shan't forget that when I come to build.
#HILLCRIST.
D'you mean to say that bid was for you?
#HORNBLOWER.
Of course I do. I told ye I was a bad man to be up against. Perhaps ye'll believe me now. dastardly trick!
#HORNBLOWER.
What did ye call it - a skin game? Remember we're playin' a skin game, Hillcrist.
#HILLCRIST.
If we were younger men -
#HORNBLOWER.
Ay! 'Twouldn't Look pretty for us to be at fisticuffs. We'll leave the fightin' to the young ones. No makin' up to that young woman! I've watched ye. And as for you, missy, you leave my boy alone.
#JILL.
Dodo, may I spit in his eye or something?
#HILLCRIST.
Sit down.
#HORNBLOWER.
Make your mind easy; it can't. I've got ye in a noose, and I'm goin' to hang ye.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Mr. Hornblower, as you fight foul - so shall we.
#HILLCRIST.
Amy!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
And it will not be foul play towards you and yours. You are outside the pale.
#HORNBLOWER.
That's just where I am, outside your pale all round ye. Ye're not long for Deepwater, ma'am. Make your dispositions to go; ye'll be out in six months, I prophesy. And good riddance to the neighbourhood.
#CHLOE.
Here are your salts, thank you. Father, can't you - ?
#HORNBLOWER.
Can't I what?
#CHLOE.
Can't you come to an arrangement?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Just so, Mr. Hornblower. Can't you?
#HORNBLOWER.
As we're speakin' out, ma'am, it's your behaviour to my daughter - in - law - who's as good as you - and better, to my thinking - that's more than half the reason why I've bought this property. Ye've fair got my dander up. Now it's no use to bandy words. It's very forgivin' of ye, Chloe, but come along!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Quite seriously, Mr. Hornblower, you had better come to an arrangement.
#HORNBLOWER.
Mrs. Hillcrist, ladies should keep to their own business.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I will.
#HILLCRIST.
Amy, do leave it to us men. You young man
#HORNBLOWER.
My trick? And what dye call it, to try and put me own son against me?
#JILL.
Well?
#ROLF.
I don't, but -
#HORNBLOWER.
Trick? Ye young cub, be quiet. Mr. Hillcrist had an agent bid for him - I had an agent bid for me. Only his agent bid at the beginnin', an' mine bid at the end. What's the trick in that?
#HILLCRIST.
Hopeless; we're in different worlds.
#HORNBLOWER.
I wish to God we were! Come you, Chloe. And you, Rolf, you follow. In six months I'll have those chimneys up, and me lorries runnin' round ye.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Mr. Hornblower, if you build -
#HORNBLOWER.
Ye know - it's laughable. Ye make me pay nine thousand five hundred for a bit o' land not worth four, and ye think I'm not to get back on ye. I'm goin' on with as little consideration as if ye were a family of blackbeetles. Good afternoon!
#ROLF.
Father!
#JILL.
Oh, Dodo! He's obscene.
#HILLCRIST.
Mr. Hornblower, my compliments.
#HORNBLOWER.
Why! Chloe! What's the matter?
#CHLOE.
I don't know; I'm not well to - day.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Mr. Hornblower, you build at your peril. I warn you.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ye think yourself very cool and very smart. But I doubt this is the first time ye've been up against realities. Now, I've been up against them all my life. Don't talk to me, ma'am, about peril and that sort of nonsense; it makes no impression. Your husband called me pachydermatous. I don't know Greek, and Latin, and all that, but I've looked it out in the dictionary, and I find it means thick - skinned. And I'm none the worse for that when I have to deal with folk like you. Good afternoon.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Thank you; Dawker.
#JILL.
Dodo! It's awful!
#HILLCRIST.
Well, there's nothing for it now but to smile and pay up. Poor old home! It shall be his wash - pot. Over the Centry will he cast his shoe. By Gad, Jill, I could cry!
#JILL.
Look! Chloe's sitting down. She nearly fainted just now. It's something to do with Dawker, Dodo, and that man with him. Look at mother! Ask them!
#HILLCRIST.
Dawker! What's the mystery about young Mrs. Hornblower?
#DAWKER.
No mystery.
#HILLCRIST.
Well, what is it?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
You'd better not ask.
#HILLCRIST.
I wish to know.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Jill, go out and wait for us.
#JILL.
Nonsense, mother!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
It's not for a girl to hear.
#JILL.
Bosh! I read the papers every day.
#DAWKER.
It's nothin' worse than you get there, anyway.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Do you wish your daughter -
#JILL.
It's ridiculous, Dodo; you'd think I was mother at my age.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I was not so proud of my knowledge.
#JILL.
No, but you had it, dear.
#HILLCRIST.
What is it - what is it? Come over here, Dawker. What! Good God!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Exactly!
#JILL.
Poor thing - whatever it is!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Poor thing?
#JILL.
What went before, mother?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
It's what's coming after that matters; luckily.
#HILLCRIST.
How do you know this?
#DAWKER.
My friend here was one of the agents.
#HILLCRIST.
It's shocking. I'm sorry I heard it.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I told you not to.
#HILLCRIST.
Ask your friend to come here. Are you sure of what you've said, sir?
#EVERYCHILD.
Perfectly. I remember her quite well; her name then was -
#HILLCRIST.
I don't want to know, thank you. I'm truly sorry. I wouldn't wish the knowledge of that about his womenfolk to my worst enemy. This mustn't be spoken of.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
It will not be if Mr. Hornblower is wise. If he is not wise, it must be spoken of.
#HILLCRIST.
I say no, Amy. I won't have it. It's a dirty weapon. Who touches pitch shall be defiled.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Well, what weapons does he use against us? Don't be quixotic. For all we can tell, they know it quite well already, and if they don't they ought to. Anyway, to know this is our salvation, and we must use it. Pitch! Dodo! Pitch!
#DAWKER.
The threat's enough! J.P. - Chapel - Future member for the constituency -
#HILLCRIST.
To use a piece of knowledge about a woman - it's repugnant. I - I won't do it.
#HILLCRIST.
I don't know - I don't know.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
At least, you'd like to be in a position to help him, if you thought it necessary?
#HILLCRIST.
Well - that perhaps.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Then you agree that Mr. Hornblower at least should be told. What he does with the knowledge is not our affair.
#HILLCRIST.
Do you realise that an imputation of that kind may be ground for a criminal libel action?
#EVERYCHILD.
Quite. But there's no shadow of doubt; not the faintest. You saw her just now?
#HILLCRIST.
I did. No; I don't like it.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
And the ruin of our home? You're betraying your fathers, Jack.
#HILLCRIST.
I can't bear bringing a woman into it.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
We don't. If anyone brings her in; it will be Hornblower himself.
#HILLCRIST.
We use her secret as a lever.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I tell you quite plainly: I will only consent to holding my tongue about her, if you agree to Hornblower being told. It's a scandal to have a woman like that in the neighbourhood.
#JILL.
Mother means that, father.
#HILLCRIST.
Jill, keep quiet. This is a very bitter position. I can't tell what to do.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
You must use this knowledge. You owe it to me - to us all. You'll see that when you've thought it over.
#JILL.
Pitch, Dodo, pitch!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Jill, be quiet!
#HILLCRIST.
I was brought up never to hurt a woman. I can't do it, Amy - I can't do it. I should never feel like a gentleman again.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Oh! Very well.
#HILLCRIST.
What d'you mean by that?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I shall use the knowledge in my own way.
#HILLCRIST.
You would - against my wishes?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I consider it my duty.
#HILLCRIST.
If I agree to Hornblower being told -
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
That's all I want.
#HILLCRIST.
It's the utmost I'll consent to, Amy; and don't let's have any humbug about its being, morally necessary. We do it to save our skins.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I don't know what you mean by humbug?
#JILL.
He means humbug; mother.
#HILLCRIST.
It must stop at old Hornblower. Do you quite understand?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Quite.
#JILL.
Will it stop?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Jill, if you can't keep your impertinence to yourself -
#HILLCRIST.
Jill, come with me.
#JILL.
I'm sorry, mother. Only it is a skin game, isn't it?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
You pride yourself on plain speech, Jill. I pride myself on plain thought. You will thank me afterwards that I can see realities. I know we are better people than these Hornblowers. Here we are going to stay, and they - are not.
#JILL.
Mother, you're wonderful!
#HILLCRIST.
Jill!
#JILL.
Coming, Dodo.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Dawker!
#DAWKER.
We're going to wire for his partner. I'll bring him too. Can't make too sure.
#DAWKER.
The Squire's squeamish - too much of a gentleman. But he don't count. The grey mare's all right. You wire to Henry. I'm off to our solicitors. We'll make that old rhinoceros sell us back the Centry at a decent price. These Hornblowers - We've got 'em!
#CHLOE.
Come in! Yes, Anna?
#ANNA.
Aren't you going in to dinner, ma'am?
#CHLOE.
No.
#ANNA.
Will you take anything here, ma'am?
#CHLOE.
I'd like a biscuit and a glass of champagne. Why do you smile?
#ANNA.
Was I, ma'am?
#CHLOE.
You know you were. Are you paid to smile at me?
#ANNA.
No, ma'am, Would you like some eau de Cologne on your forehead?
#CHLOE.
Yes. - No. - What's the good? My headache won't go.
#ANNA.
To keep lying down's the best thing for it.
#CHLOE.
I have been - hours.
#ANNA.
Yes, ma'am.
#CHLOE.
Anna! Why do you do it?
#ANNA.
Do what, ma'am?
#CHLOE.
Spy on me.
#ANNA.
I - never! I - !
#CHLOE.
To spy! You're a fool, too. What is there to spy on?
#ANNA.
Nothing, ma'am. Of course, if you're not satisfied with me, I must give notice. Only - if I were spying, I should expect to have notice given me. I've been accustomed to ladies who wouldn't stand such a thing for a minute. Well, you'll take a month's wages and go tomorrow. And that's all, now.
#CHLOE.
If I could see that man - if only - or Dawker -
#ROLF.
How's the head?
#CHLOE.
Beastly, thanks. I'm not going into dinner.
#ROLF.
Is there anything I can do for you?
#CHLOE.
No, dear boy. You don't want this quarrel with the Hillcrists to go on, do you, Rolf?
#ROLF.
No; I hate it.
#CHLOE.
Well, I think I might be able to stop it. Will you slip round to Dawker's - it's not five minutes - and ask him to come and see me.
#ROLF.
Father and Charlie wouldn't -
#CHLOE.
I know. But if he comes to the window here while you're at dinner, I'll let him in, and out, and nobody'd know.
#ROLF.
Yes, but what I mean how -
#CHLOE.
Don't ask me. It's worth the shot that's all. To this window at eight o'clock exactly. First long window on the terrace, tell him.
#ROLF.
It's nothing Charlie would mind?
#CHLOE.
No; only I can't tell him - he and father are so mad about it all.
#ROLF.
If there's a real chance -
#CHLOE.
This way, Rolf. If you don't come back I shall know he's coming. Put your watch by mine. It's a minute fast, see!
#ROLF.
Look here, Chloe
#CHLOE.
Don't wait; go on.
#CHLOE.
I don't want that champagne. Take this to the chemist and get him to make up some of these cachets quick, and bring them back yourself.
#ANNA.
Yes, ma'am; but you have some.
#CHLOE.
They're too old; I've taken two - the strength's out of them. Quick, please; I can't stand this head.
#ANNA.
Yes, ma'am. It'll take some time - you don't want me?
#CHLOE.
No; I want the cachets.
#HORNBLOWER.
How are ye feelin'. Chloe?
#CHLOE.
Awful head! Can ye attend a moment? I've had a note from that woman.
#HORNBLOWER.
"I have something of the utmost importance to tell you in regard to your daughter - in - law. I shall be waiting to see you at eleven o'clock to - morrow morning. The matter is so utterly vital to the happiness of all your family, that I cannot imagine you will fail to come." Now, what's the meaning of it? Is it sheer impudence, or lunacy, or what?
#CHLOE.
I don't know.
#HORNBLOWER.
Chloe, if there's anything - ye'd better tell me. Forewarned's forearmed.
#CHLOE.
There's nothing; unless it's - Unless it's that my father was a - a bankrupt.
#HORNBLOWER.
Hech! Many a man's been that. Ye've never told us much about your family.
#CHLOE.
I wasn't very proud of him.
#HORNBLOWER.
Well, ye're not responsible for your father. If that's all, it's a relief. The bitter snobs! I'll remember it in the account I've got with them.
#CHLOE.
Father, don't say anything to Charlie; it'll only worry him for nothing.
#HORNBLOWER.
No, no, I'll not. If I went bankrupt, it'd upset Chearlie, I've not a doubt. There's nothing else, before I answer her? Ye're sure?
#CHLOE.
She may invent things, of course.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ah! but there's such a thing as the laws o' slander. If they play pranks, I'll have them up for it.
#CHLOE.
Couldn't you stop this quarrel; father? You said it was on my account. But I don't want to know them. And they do love their old home. I like the girl. You don't really need to build just there, do you? Couldn't you stop it? Do!
#HORNBLOWER.
Stop it? Now I've bought? Na, no! The snobs defied me, and I'm going to show them. I hate the lot of them, and I hate that little Dawker worst of all.
#CHLOE.
He's only their agent.
#HORNBLOWER.
He's a part of the whole dog - in - the - manger system that stands in my way. Ye're a woman, and ye don't understand these things. Ye wouldn't believe the struggle I've had to make my money and get my position. These county folk talk soft sawder, but to get anything from them's like gettin' butter out of a dog's mouth. If they could drive me out of here by fair means or foul, would they hesitate a moment? Not they! See what they've made me pay; and look at this letter. Selfish, mean lot o' hypocrites!
#CHLOE.
But they didn't begin the quarrel.
#HORNBLOWER.
Not openly; but underneath they did - that's their way. They began it by thwartin' me here and there and everywhere, just because I've come into me own a bit later than they did. I gave 'em their chance, and they wouldn't take it. Well, I'll show 'em what a man like me can do when he sets his mind to it. I'll not leave much skin on them. It'll give me a power of enjoyment seein' me chimneys go up in front of their windies. That was a bonnie thought - that last bid o' mine. He'd got that roused up, I believe, he, never would a' stopped. I forgot your head. Well, well, ye'll be best tryin' quiet. Shall we send ye something in from dinner?
#CHLOE.
No; I'll try to sleep. Please tell them I don't want to be disturbed.
#HORNBLOWER.
All right. I'll just answer this note.
#HORNBLOWER.
Listen! Hallo! Where are ye?
#CHLOE.
It's so hot.
#HORNBLOWER.
Here's what I've said:
#CHLOE.
Oh! - Well! -
#HORNBLOWER.
Lie ye down, and get a sleep. I'll tell them not to disturb ye; and I hope ye'll be all right to - morrow. Good - night, Chloe.
#CHLOE.
Good - night.
#CHLOE.
Come in.
#DAWKER.
Well, young woman, what do you want of me?
#CHLOE.
You're making a mistake, you know.
#DAWKER.
No. I've got a memory for faces.
#CHLOE.
I say you are.
#DAWKER.
If that's all, you needn't have troubled me to come.
#CHLOE.
No. Don't go! You are playing a game with me. Aren't you ashamed? What harm have I done you? Do you call this cricket?
#DAWKER.
No, my girl - business.
#CHLOE.
What have I to do with this quarrel? I couldn't help their falling out.
#DAWKER.
That's your misfortune.
#CHLOE.
You're a cruel fellow if you can spoil a woman's life who never did you an ounce of harm.
#DAWKER.
So they don't know about you. That's all right. Now, look here, I serve my employer. But I'm flesh and blood, too, and I always give as good as I get. I hate this family of yours. There's no name too bad for 'em to call me this last month, and no looks too black to give me. I tell you frankly, I hate.
#CHLOE.
There's good in them same as in you.
#DAWKER.
There's no good Hornblower but a dead Hornblower.
#CHLOE.
But - but Im not one.
#DAWKER.
You'll be the mother of some, I shouldn't wonder.
#CHLOE.
Oh! leave me alone, do! I'm happy here. Be a sport! Be a sport!
#DAWKER.
You can't get at me, so don't try it on.
#CHLOE.
I had such a bad time in old days.
#CHLOE.
Ah! do! You might! You've been fond of some woman, I suppose. Think of her!
#DAWKER.
It won't do, Mrs. Chloe. You're a pawn in the game, and I'm going to use you.
#CHLOE.
What is it to you? Look here! Don't you make an enemy, of me. I haven't dragged through hell for nothing. Women like me can bite, I tell you.
#DAWKER.
That's better. I'd rather have a woman threaten than whine, any day. Threaten away! You'll let 'em know that you met me in the Promenade one night. Of course you'll let 'em know that, won't you? - or that -
#CHLOE.
Be quiet! Oh! Be quiet! Look! There's my savings - there's all I've got! The pearls'll fetch nearly a thousand. Take it, and drop me out - won't you? Won't you?
#DAWKER.
You mistake your man, missis. I'm a plain dog, if you like, but I'm faithful, and I hold fast. Don't try those games on me.
#CHLOE.
You're a beast! - a beast! a cruel, cowardly beast! And how dare you bribe that woman here to spy on me? Oh! yes, you do; you know you do. If you drove me mad, you wouldn't care. You beast!
#DAWKER.
Now, don't carry on! That won't help you.
#CHLOE.
What d'you call it - to dog a woman down like this, just because you happen to have a quarrel with a man?
#DAWKER.
Who made the quarrel? Not me, missis. You ought to know that in a row it's the weak and helpless - we won't say the innocent - that get it in the neck. That can't be helped.
#CHLOE.
I hope your mother or your sister, if you've got any, may go through what I'm going through ever since you got on my track. I hope they'll know what fear means. I hope they'll love and find out that it's hanging on a thread, and - and - Oh! you coward, you persecuting coward! Call yourself a man!
#DAWKER.
Ah! You look quite pretty like that. By George! you're a handsome woman when you're roused.
#CHLOE.
Is there anything you'll take, not to spoil my life? Me?
#DAWKER.
By God! That's an offer. You - you touched me there. Look here! I've got to use you and I'm going to use you, but I'll do my best to let you down as easy as I can. No, I don't want anything you can give me - that is - I'd like it - but I won't take it. There! Keep your pecker up; don't cry. Good - night!
#CHLOE.
Ugh! Rat in a trap! Rat - !
#CHARLES.
Well, Clo! Had a sleep, old girl?
#CHLOE.
Ye - es.
#CHARLES.
Feel better, dear?
#CHLOE.
Yes, better, Charlie.
#CHARLES.
That's right. Would you like some soup?
#CHLOE.
No.
#CHARLES.
I say - what gives you these heads? You've been very on and off all this last month.
#CHLOE.
I don't know. Except that - except that I am going to have a child, Charlie.
#CHARLES.
After all! By Jove! Sure?
#CHLOE.
Are you glad?
#CHARLES.
Well - I suppose I am. The guv'nor will be mighty pleased, anyway.
#CHLOE.
Don't tell him - yet.
#CHARLES.
All right! My poor girl, I'm so sorry you're seedy. Give us a kiss. I say, you're like fire. You're not feverish?
#CHLOE.
It's a wonder if I'm not. Charlie, are you happy with me?
#CHARLES.
What do you think?
#CHLOE.
You wouldn't easily believe things against me, would you?
#CHARLES.
What! Thinking of those Hillcrists? What the hell that woman means by her attitude towards you - When I saw her there to - day, I had all my work cut out not to go up and give her a bit of my mind.
#CHLOE.
It's not good for me, now I'm like this. It's upsetting me, Charlie.
#CHARLES.
Yes; and we won't forget. We'll make 'em pay for it.
#CHLOE.
It's wretched in a little place like this. I say, must you go on spoiling their home?
#CHARLES.
The woman cuts you and insults you. That's enough for me.
#CHLOE.
Let her. I don't care; I can't bear feeling enemies about, Charlie, I - get nervous - I -
#CHARLES.
My dear girl! What is it?
#CHLOE.
I suppose it's - being like this. But, Charlie, do stop it for my sake. Do, do!
#CHARLES.
Come, come; I say, Chloe! You're making mountains. See things in proportion. Father's paid nine thousand five hundred to get the better of those people, and you want him to chuck it away to save a woman who's insulted you. That's not sense, and it's not business. Have some pride.
#CHLOE.
I've got no pride, Charlie. I want to be quiet - that's all.
#CHARLES.
Well, if the row gets on your nerves, I can take you to the sea. But you ought to enjoy a fight with people like that.
#CHLOE.
No, it's nothing, of course - what I want.
#CHARLES.
Hello! Hello! You are on the jump!
#CHLOE.
If you want me to be a good wife to you, make father stop it.
#CHARLES.
Now, look here, Chloe, what's behind this?
#CHLOE.
Behind?
#CHARLES.
You're carrying on as if - as if you were really scared! We've got these people: We'll have them out of Deepwater in six months. It's absolute ruination to their beastly old house; we'll put the chimneys on the very edge, not three hundred yards off, and our smoke'll be drifting over them half the time. You won't have this confounded stuck - up woman here much longer. And then we can really go ahead and take our proper place. So long as she's here, we shall never do that. We've only to drive on now as fast as we can.
#CHLOE.
I see.
#CHARLES.
If you go on like this, you know, I shall begin to think there's something you -
#CHLOE.
Charlie! Love me!
#CHARLES.
There, old girl! I know women are funny at these times. You want a good night, that's all.
#CHLOE.
You haven't finished dinner, have you? Go back, and I'll go to bed quite soon. Charlie, don't stop loving me.
#CHARLES.
Stop? Not much.
#CHLOE.
Oh - h!
#CHARLES.
What is it? What is it? You are nervy, my dear.
#CHLOE.
I don't know. Go on, Charlie. I'll be all right when this head's gone.
#CHARLES.
You go to bed; I won't be late coming up.
#JILL.
Come in here. There's no one.
#ROLF.
Jill, I just wanted to say - Need we? Seeing you yesterday - it did seem rotten.
#JILL.
We didn't begin it.
#ROLF.
No; but you don't understand. If you'd made yourself, as father has -
#JILL.
I hope I should be sorry.
#ROLF.
That isn't like you. Really he can't help thinking he's a public benefactor.
#JILL.
And we can't help thinking he's a pig. Sorry!
#ROLF.
If the survival of the fittest is right -
#JILL.
He may be fitter, but he's not going to survive.
#ROLF.
It looks like it, though.
#JILL.
Is that all you came to say?
#ROLF.
Suppose we joined, couldn't we stop it?
#JILL.
I don't feel like joining.
#ROLF.
We did shake hands.
#JILL.
One can't fight and not grow bitter.
#ROLF.
I don't feel bitter.
#JILL.
Wait; you'll feel it soon enough.
#ROLF.
Why? About Chloe? I do think your mother's manner to her is -
#JILL.
Well?
#ROLF.
Snobbish. She may not be your class; and that's just why it's snobbish.
#JILL.
I think you'd better shut up.
#ROLF.
What my father said was true; your mother's rudeness to her that day she came here, has made both him and Charlie ever so much more bitter. Is it a whistling matter?
#JILL.
No.
#ROLF.
I suppose you want me to go?
#JILL.
Yes.
#ROLF.
All right. Aren't we ever going to be friends again?
#JILL.
I don't expect so.
#ROLF.
That's very - horrible.
#JILL.
Lots of horrible things in the world.
#ROLF.
It's our business to make them fewer, Jill.
#JILL.
Don't be moral.
#ROLF.
That's the last thing I want to be. - I only want to be friendly.
#JILL.
Better be real first.
#ROLF.
From the big point of view -
#JILL.
There isn't any. We're all out, for our own. And why not?
#ROLF.
By jove, you have got -
#JILL.
Cynical? Your father's motto - "Every man for himself." That's the winner - hands down. Goodbye!
#ROLF.
Jill! Jill!

#ROLF.
Don't!
#FELLOWS.
Mr. Dawker, Miss, and two gentlemen.
#JILL.
Let the three gentlemen in, and me out.
#FELLOWS.
I'll inform Mrs. Hillcrist, sir. The Squire is on his rounds.
#DAWKER.
Now this may come into Court, you know. If there's a screw loose anywhere, better mention it. You knew her personally?
#SECOND STRANGER.
What do you think? I don't, take girls on trust for that sort of job. She came to us highly recommended, too; and did her work very well. It was a double stunt - to make sure - wasn't it, George?
#FIRST STRANGER.
Yes; we paid her for the two visits.
#SECOND STRANGER.
I should know her in a minute; striking looking girl; had something in her face. Daresay she'd seen hard times.
#FIRST STRANGER.
We don't want publicity.
#DAWKER.
Not Likely. The threat'll do it; but the stakes are heavy - and the man's a slugger; we must be able to push it home. If you can both swear to her, it'll do the trick.
#SECOND STRANGER.
And about - I mean, we're losing time, you know, coming down here.
#DAWKER.
George here knows me. That'll be all right. I'll guarantee it well worth your while.
#SECOND STRANGER.
I don't want to do the girl harm, if she's married.
#DAWKER.
No, no; nobody wants to hurt her. We just want a cinch on this fellow till he squeals.
#DAWKER.
Good morning, ma'am. My friend's partner. Hornblower coming?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
At eleven. I had to send up a second note, Dawker.
#DAWKER.
Squire not in?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I haven't told him.
#DAWKER.
Our friends might go in here and we can use 'em as the want 'em.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Will you make yourselves comfortable?
#DAWKER.
I've had this drawn and engrossed. Pretty sharp work. Conveys the Centry, and Longmeadow; to the Squire at four thousand five hundred: Now, ma'am, suppose Hornblower puts his hand to that, hell have been done in the eye, and six thousand all told out o' pocket. - You'll have a very nasty neighbour here.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
But we shall still have the power to disclose that secret at any time.
#DAWKER.
Yeh! But things might happen here you could never bring home to him. You can't trust a man like that. He isn't goin' to forgive me, I know.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
But if he signs, we couldn't honourably -
#DAWKER.
No, ma'am, you couldn't; and I'm sure I don't want to do that girl a hurt. I just mention it because, of course, you can't guarantee that it doesn't get out.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Not absolutely, I suppose.
#DAWKER.
He'll kick and flounder - but you leave him to ask what you want, ma'am; don't mention this The Centry's no mortal good to him if he's not going to put up works; I should say he'd be glad to save what he can.
#FELLOWS.
Mr. Hornblower, ma'am; by appointment, he says.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Quite right, Fellows.
#HORNBLOWER.
I've come to ask ye point bleak what ye mean by writing me these letters. And we'll discus it in the presence of nobody, if ye, please.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Mr. Dawker knows all that I know, and more.
#HORNBLOWER.
Does he? Very well! Your second note says that my daughter - in - law has lied to me. Well, I've brought her, and what ye've got to say - if it's not just a trick to see me again - ye'll say to her face.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Mr. Hornblower, you had better, decide that after hearing what it is - we shall be quite ready to repeat it in her presence; but we want to do as little harm as possible.
#HORNBLOWER.
Oh! ye do! Well, what lies have ye been hearin'? Or what have ye made up? You and Mr. Dawker? Of course ye know there's a law of libel and slander. I'm, not the man to stop at that.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Are you familiar with the law of divorce, Mr. Hornblower?
#HORNBLOWER.
No, I'm not. That is -
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Well, you know that misconduct is required. And I suppose you've heard that cases are arranged.
#HORNBLOWER.
I know it's all very shocking - what about it?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
When cases are arranged, Mr. Hornblower, the man who is to be divorced often visits an hotel with a strange woman. I am extremely sorry to say that your daughter - in - law, before her marriage, was in the habit of being employed as such a woman.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ye dreadful creature!
#DAWKER.
All proved, up to the hilt!
#HORNBLOWER.
I don't believe a word of it. Ye're lyin' to save your skins. How dare ye tell me such monstrosities? Dawker, I'll have ye in a criminal court.
#DAWKER.
Rats! You saw a gent with me yesterday? Well, he's employed her. put - up job! Conspiracy!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Go and get your daughter - in - law.
#HORNBLOWER.
It's a foul shame - a lying slander!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
If so, it's easily disproved. Go and fetch her.
#HORNBLOWER.
I will. I don't believe a word of it.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I hope you are right.
#HORNBLOWER.
Now then, let's have this impudent story torn to rags.
#CHLOE.
What story?
#HORNBLOWER.
That you, my dear, were a woman - it's too shockin - I don't know how to tell ye -
#CHLOE.
Go on!
#HORNBLOWER.
Were a woman that went with men, to get them their divorce.
#CHLOE.
Who says that?
#HORNBLOWER.
That lady there, and her bull - terrier here.
#CHLOE.
That's a charitable thing to say, isn't it?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Is it true?
#CHLOE.
No.
#HORNBLOWER.
There! I'll have ye both on your knees to her!
#DAWKER.
Come in.
#FIRST STRANGER.
How do you do, Mrs. Vane?
#CHLOE.
I don't know you.
#FIRST STRANGER.
Your memory is bad, ma'am: You knew me yesterday well enough. One day is not a long time, nor are three years.
#CHLOE.
Who are you?
#FIRST STRANGER.
Come, ma'am, come! The Caster case.
#CHLOE.
I don't know you, I say. How can you be so vile?
#FIRST STRANGER.
Let me refresh your memory, ma'am. Just on three years ago; "Oct.3. To fee and expenses Mrs. Vane with Mr. C - , Hotel Beaulieu, Twenty pounds. Oct. 10, Do., Twenty pounds." Would you like to glance at this book, sir? You'll see they're genuine entries.
#CHLOE.
It's all lies - lies!
#FIRST STRANGER.
Come, ma'am, we wish you no harm.
#CHLOE.
Take me away. I won't be treated like this.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Confess.
#CHLOE.
Lies!
#HORNBLOWER.
Were ye ever called Vane?
#CHLOE.
No, never.
#DAWKER.
Are you convinced?
#HORNBLOWER.
Take those men away.
#DAWKER.
If you're not satisfied, we can get other evidence; plenty.
#HORNBLOWER.
That's enough. Take them out. Leave me alone with her.
#HORNBLOWER.
My God!
#CHLOE.
Don't tell Charlie! Don't tell Charlie!
#HORNBLOWER.
Chearlie! So, that was your manner of life. So that's what ye got out of by marryin' into my family! Shame on ye, ye Godless thing!
#CHLOE.
Don't tell Charlie!
#HORNBLOWER.
And that's all ye can say for the wreck ye've wrought. My family, my works, my future! How dared ye!
#CHLOE.
If you'd been me! -
#HORNBLOWER.
An' these Hillcrists. The skin game of it!
#CHLOE.
Father!
#HORNBLOWER.
Don't call me that, woman!
#CHLOE.
I'm going to have a child.
#HORNBLOWER.
God! Ye are!
#CHLOE.
Your grandchild. For the sake of it, do what these people want; and don't tell anyone - DON'T TELL CHARLIE!
#HORNBLOWER.
A secret between us. I don't know that I can keep it. It's horrible. Poor Chearlie!
#CHLOE.
You must keep it, you shall! I won't have him told. Don't make me desperate! I can be - I didn't live that life for nothing.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ay; ye look a strange, wild woman, as I see ye. And we thought the world of ye!
#CHLOE.
I love Charlie; I'm faithful to him. I can't live without him. You'll never forgive me, I know; but Charlie - !
#HORNBLOWER.
I'm all at sea here. Go out to the car and wait for me. So I'm down! Me enemies put their heels upon me head! Ah! but we'll see yet! What d'ye want for this secret?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Nothing.
#HORNBLOWER.
Indeed! Wonderful! - the trouble ye've taken for - nothing.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
If you harm us we shall harm you. Any use whatever of the Centry.
#HORNBLOWER.
For which ye made me pay nine thousand five hundred pounds.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
We will buy it from you.
#HORNBLOWER.
At what price?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
The Centry at the price Miss Muffins would have taken at first, and Longmeadow at the price you - gave us - four thousand five hundred altogether. fine price, and me six thousand out of pocket. Na, no! I'll keep it and hold it over ye. Ye daren't tell this secret so long as I've got it.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
No, Mr. Hornblower. On second thoughts, you must sell. You broke your word over the Jackmans. We can't trust you. We would rather have our place here ruined at once, than leave you the power to ruin it as and when you like. You will sell us the Centry and Longmeadow now, or you know what will happen.
#HORNBLOWER.
I'll not. It's blackmail.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Very well then! Go your own way and we'll go ours. There is no witness to this conversation.
#HORNBLOWER.
By heaven, ye're a clever woman. Will ye swear by Almighty God that you and your family, and that agent of yours, won't breathe a word of this shockin' thing to mortal soul.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Yes, if you sell.
#HORNBLOWER.
Where's Dawker?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Mr. Dawker
#HORNBLOWER.
I suppose ye've got your iniquity ready. It's mighty near conspiracy, this. Have ye got a Testament?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
My word will be enough, Mr. Hornblower.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ye'll pardon me - I can't make it solemn enough for you.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Very well; here is a Bible.
#DAWKER.
This is a short conveyance of the Centry and Longmeadow - recites sale to you by Miss Mulling, of the first, John Hillcrist of the second, and whereas you have agreed for the sale to said John Hillcrist, for the sum of four thousand five hundred pounds, in consideration of the said sum, receipt whereof, you hereby acknowledge you do convey all that, etc. Sign here. I'll witness.
#HORNBLOWER.
Take that Book in your hand, and swear first. I swear by Almighty God never to breathe a word of what I know concerning Chloe Hornblower to any living soul.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
No, Mr. Hornblower; you will please sign first. We are not in the habit of breaking our word. To that oath, Mr. Hornblower, we shall add the words, "So long as the Hornblower family do us no harm."
#HORNBLOWER.
Take it in your hands, both of ye, and together swear.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I swear that I will breathe no word of what I know concerning Chloe Hornblower to any living soul, so long as the Hornblower family do us no harm.
#DAWKER.
I swear that too.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I engage for my husband.
#HORNBLOWER.
Where are those two fellows?
#DAWKER.
Gone. It's no business of theirs.
#HORNBLOWER.
It's no business of any of ye what has happened to a woman in the past. Ye know that. Good - day!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Safe! Look! He's just gone! I told you it was only necessary to use the threat. He caved in and signed this; we are sworn to say nothing. We've beaten him.
#JILL.
We saw Chloe in the car. How did she take it, mother?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Denied, then broke down when she saw our witnesses. I'm glad you were not here, Jack.
#JILL.
I shall go and see her.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Jill, you will not; you don't know what she's done.
#JILL.
I shall. She must be in an awful state.
#HILLCRIST.
My dear, you can do her no good.
#JILL.
I think I can, Dodo.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
You don't understand human nature. We're enemies for life with those people. You're a little donkey if you think anything else.
#JILL.
I'm going, all the same.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Jack, forbid her.
#HILLCRIST.
Jill, be reasonable.
#JILL.
Suppose I'd taken a knock like that, Dodo, I'd be glad of friendliness from someone.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
You never could take a knock like that.
#JILL.
You don't know what you can do till you try, mother.
#HILLCRIST.
Let her go, Amy. Im sorry for that young woman.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
You'd be sorry for a man who picked your pocket, I believe.
#HILLCRIST.
I certainly should! Deuced little he'd get out of it, when I've paid for the Centry.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Much gratitude I get for saving you both our home!
#JILL.
Oh! Mother, we are grateful. Dodo, show your gratitude.
#HILLCRIST.
Well, my dear, it's an intense relief. I'm not good at showing my feelings, as you know. What d'you want me to do? Stand on one leg and crow?
#JILL.
Yes, Dodo, yes! Mother, hold him while I. No! I can't - I can't help thinking of her.
#ROLF'S VOICE.
Chloe! Chloe!
#CHLOE.
What are you doing here?
#ROLF.
What are you? I only followed you.
#CHLOE.
Go away.
#ROLF.
What's the matter? Tell me!
#CHLOE.
Go away, and don't say anything. Oh! The roses! Don't they smell lovely?
#ROLF.
What did Jill want this afternoon?
#CHLOE.
I'll tell you nothing. Go away!
#ROLF.
I don't like leaving you here in this state.
#CHLOE.
What state? I'm all right. Wait for me down in the drive, if you want to.
#HILLCRIST.
Now, tell me.
#JILL.
There isn't much, Dodo. I was in an awful funk for fear I should meet any of the others, and of course I did meet Rolf, but I told him some lie, and he took me to her room - boudoir, they call it - isn't boudoir a "dug - out" word?
#HILLCRIST.
The sulking room. Well?
#JILL.
She was sitting like this. And she said in a sort of fierce way: "What do you want?" And I said: "I'm awfully sorry, but I thought you might like it."
#HILLCRIST.
Well?
#JILL.
She looked at me hard, and said: "I suppose you know all about it." And I Said: "Only vaguely," because of course I don't. And she said: "Well, it was decent of you to come." Dodo, she looks like a lost soul. What has she done?
#HILLCRIST.
She committed her real crime when she married young Hornblower without telling him. She came out of a certain world to do it.
#JILL.
Oh! Is it very awful in that world, Dodo?
#HILLCRIST.
I don't know, Jill. Some can stand it, I suppose; some can't. I don't know which sort she is.
#JILL.
One thing I'm sure of: she's awfully fond of Chearlie.
#HILLCRIST.
That's bad; that's very bad.
#JILL.
And she's frightened, horribly. I think she's desperate.
#HILLCRIST.
Women like that are pretty tough, Jill; don't judge her too much by your own feelings.
#JILL.
No; only - Oh! it was beastly; and of course I dried up.
#HILLCRIST.
H'm! One always does. But perhaps it was as well; you'd have been blundering in a dark passage.
#JILL.
I just said: "Father and I feel awfully sorry; if there's anything we can do - "
#HILLCRIST.
That was risky, Jill.
#JILL.
I had to say something. I'm glad I went, anyway. I feel more human.
#HILLCRIST.
We had to fight for our home. I should have felt like a traitor if I hadn't.
#JILL.
I'm not enjoying home tonight, Dodo.
#HILLCRIST.
I never could hate proper; it's a confounded nuisance.
#JILL.
Mother's fearfully' bucked, and Dawker's simply oozing triumph. I don't trust him. Dodo; he's too - not pugilistic - the other one with a pug - naceous.
#HILLCRIST.
He is rather.
#JILL.
I'm sure he wouldn't care tuppence if Chloe committed suicide.
#HILLCRIST.
Nonsense! Nonsense!
#JILL.
I wonder if mother would.
#HILLCRIST.
What's that? I thought I heard - Is these anybody out there?
#JILL.
You! Come in! It's only us! Dodo!
#HILLCRIST.
Good evening! Won't you sit down?
#JILL.
Sit down; you're all shaky.
#HILLCRIST.
Can I do anything for you?
#CHLOE.
I couldn't bear it he's coming to ask you -
#HILLCRIST.
Who?
#CHLOE.
My husband. I've got to be quick. He keeps on asking - he knows there's something.
#HILLCRIST.
Make your mind easy. We shan't tell him.
#CHLOE.
Oh! that's not enough. Can't you tell him something to put him back to thinking it's all right? I've done him such a wrong. I didn't realise till after - I thought meeting him was just a piece of wonderful good luck, after what I'd been through. I'm not such a bad lot - not really. You see, my father went bankrupt, and I was in a shop -
#HILLCRIST.
Yes, yes; Yes, yes!
#CHLOE.
I never gave a man away or did anything I was ashamed of - at least - I mean, I had to make my living in all sorts of ways, and then I met Charlie.
#JILL.
It's all right.
#CHLOE.
He thought I was respectable, and that was such a relief, you can't think, so - so I let him.
#JILL.
Dodo! It's awful
#HILLCRIST.
It is!
#CHLOE.
And after I married him, you see, I fell in love. If I had before, perhaps I wouldn't have dared only, I don't know - you never know, do you? When there's a straw going, you catch at it.
#JILL.
Of course you do.
#CHLOE.
And now, you see, I'm going to have a child.
#JILL.
Oh! Are you?
#HILLCRIST.
Good God!
#CHLOE.
I've been on hot bricks all this month, ever since that day here. I knew it was in the wind. What gets in the wind never gets out. Never! It just blows here and there and then - blows home. But I've paid for being a fool - 'tisn't fun, that sort of life, I can tell you. I'm not ashamed and repentant, and all that. If it wasn't for him! I'm afraid he'll never forgive me; it's such a disgrace for him - and then, to have his child! Being fond of him, I feel it much worse than anything I ever felt, and that's saying a good bit. It is.
#JILL.
Look here! He simply mustn't find out.
#CHLOE.
That's it; but it's started, and he's bound to keep on because he knows there's something. A man isn't going to be satisfied when there's something he suspects about his wife, Charlie wouldn't never. He's clever, and he's jealous; and he's coming here.
#JILL.
Dodo, what can we say to put him clean off the scent?
#HILLCRIST.
Anything - in reason.
#CHLOE.
You will! You see, I don't know what I'll do. I've got soft, being looked after - he does love me. And if he throws me off, I'll go under - that's all.
#HILLCRIST.
Have you any suggestion?
#CHLOE.
The only thing is to tell him something positive, something he'll believe, that's not too bad - like my having been a lady clerk with those people who came here, and having been dismissed on suspicion of taking money. I could get him to believe that wasn't true.
#JILL.
Yes; and it isn't - that's splendid! You'd be able to put such conviction into it. Don't you think so, Dodo?
#HILLCRIST.
Anything I can. I'm deeply sorry.
#CHLOE.
Thank you. And don't say I've been here, will you? He's very suspicious. You see, he knows that his father has re - sold that land to you; that's what he can't make out - that, and my coming here this morning; he knows something's being kept from him; and he noticed that man with Dawker yesterday. And my maid's been spying on me. It's in the air. He puts two and two together. But I've told him there's nothing he need worry about; nothing that's true.
#HILLCRIST.
What a coil!
#CHLOE.
I'm very honest and careful about money. So he won't believe that about me, and the old man wants to keep it from Charlie, I know.
#HILLCRIST.
That does seem the best way out.
#CHLOE.
I'm a true wife to him.
#CHLOE.
Of course we know that.
#HILLCRIST.
It's all unspeakably sad. Deception's horribly against the grain - but -
#CHLOE.
When I deceived him, I'd have deceived God Himself - I was so desperate. You've never been right down in the mud. You can't understand what I've been through.
#HILLCRIST.
Yes, Yes. I daresay I'd have done the same. I should be the last to judge. There, there! Cheer up!
#CHLOE.
Darling Dodo!
#CHLOE.
There's somebody at the door. I must go; I must go.
#JILL.
Oh! It's locked - I forgot. It's all right, Fellows; I was only saying something rather important.
#FELLOWS.
Certainly, Miss. Mr. Charles 'Ornblower is in the hall. Wants to see you, sir, or Mrs. Hillcrist.
#JILL.
What a bore! Can you see him, Dodo?
#HILLCRIST.
Er - yes. I suppose so. Show him in here, Fellows.
#CHARLES.
Is my wife here?
#HILLCRIST.
No, sir.
#CHARLES.
Has she been?
#HILLCRIST.
This morning, I believe, Jill?
#JILL.
Yes, she came this morning.
#CHARLES.
I know that - now, I mean?
#JILL.
No.
#CHARLES.
Tell me what was said this morning.
#HILLCRIST.
I was not here this morning.
#CHARLES.
Don't try to put me off. I know too much. You.
#JILL.
Shall I, Dodo?
#HILLCRIST.
No; I will. Won't you sit down?
#CHARLES.
No. Go on.
#HILLCRIST.
It appears, Mr. Hornblower, that my agent, Mr. Dawker - - that my agent happens to know a firm, who in old days employed your wife. I should greatly prefer not to say any more, especially as we don't believe the story.
#JILL.
No; we don't.
#CHARLES.
Go on!
#HILLCRIST.
Come! If I were you, I should refuse to listen to anything against my wife.
#CHARLES.
Go on, I tell you.
#HILLCRIST.
You insist? Well, they say there was some question about the accounts, and your wife left them under a cloud. As I told you, we don't believe it.
#CHARLES.
Liars!
#HILLCRIST.
What did you say?
#JILL.
Dodo! We are, you know.
#CHARLES.
Why do you tell me that lie? When I've just had the truth out of that little scoundrel! My wife's been here; she put you up to it. She - she put you up to it. Liar that she is - a living lie. For three years a living lie! And hasn't now the pluck to tell me. I've done with her. I won't own a child by such a woman.
#HILLCRIST.
For God's sake, man, think of what you're saying. She's in great distress.
#CHARLES.
And what am I?
#JILL.
She loves you, you know.
#CHARLES.
Pretty love! That scoundrel Dawker told me - told me - Horrible! Horrible!
#HILLCRIST.
I deeply regret that our quarrel should have brought this about.
#CHARLES.
Yes, you've smashed my life.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Would you have wished to live on in ignorance?
#CHARLES.
I don't know. But - you - you did it.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
You shouldn't have attacked us.
#CHARLES.
What did we do to you - compared with this?
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
All you could.
#HILLCRIST.
Enough, enough! What can we do to help you?
#CHARLES.
Tell me where my wife is.
#JILL.
We don't know.
#CHARLES.
Then she was here?
#HILLCRIST.
Yes, sir; and she heard you.
#CHARLES.
All the better if she did. She knows how I feel.
#HILLCRIST.
Brace up; be gentle with her.
#CHARLES.
Gentle? A woman who - who - most unhappy creature. Come!
#CHARLES.
Damn your sympathy!
#JILL.
Dodo, we ought to look for her; I'm awfully afraid.
#HILLCRIST.
I saw her there - listening. With child! Who knows where things end when they and begin? To the gravel pit, Jill; I'll go to the pond. No, we'll go together.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I want someone to go down to Mr. Dawker's.
#FELLOWS.
Mr. Dawker is here, ma'am, waitin' to see you.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Ask him to come in. Oh! and Fellows, you can tell the Jackmans that they can go back to their cottage.
#FELLOWS.
Very good, ma'am.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Charles Hornblower - how did it happen?
#DAWKER.
He came to me. I said I knew nothing. He wouldn't take it; went for me, abused me up hill and down dale; said he knew everything, and then he began to threaten me. Well, I lost my temper, and I told him.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
That's very serious, Dawker, after our promise. My husband is most upset.
#DAWKER.
It's not my fault, ma'am; he shouldn't have threatened and goaded me on. Besides, it's got out that there's a scandal; common talk in the village - not the facts, but quite enough to cook their goose here. They'll have to go. Better have done with it, anyway, than have enemies at your door.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Perhaps; but - Oh! Dawker, take charge of this. These people are desperate - and - I'm sot sure of my husband when his feelings are worked on.
#DAWKER.
Hornblower's, I think. Yes, he's getting out.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
You'd better wait, then.
#DAWKER.
He mustn't give me any of his sauce; I've had enough.
#HORNBLOWER.
Give me that deed! Ye got it out of me by false pretences and treachery. Ye swore that nothing should be heard of this. Why! me own servants know.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
That has nothing to do with us. Your son came and wrenched the knowledge out of Mr. DAWKER by abuse and threats; that is all. You will kindly behave yourself here, or I shall ask that you be shown out.
#HORNBLOWER.
Give me that deed, I say!
#DAWKER.
Now, look 'ere, 'Ornblower, I stood a deal from your son, and I'll stand no more.
#HORNBLOWER.
I'll ruin your place yet!
#JILL.
Rolf! All of you! Stop! Look! In the gravel pit. She's just breathing; that's all.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Bring her in. The brandy, Jill!
#HORNBLOWER.
No. Take her to the car. Stand back, young woman! I want no help from any of ye. Rolf - Chearlie - take her up. Hillcrist, ye've got me beaten and disgraced hereabouts, ye've destroyed my son's married life, and ye've killed my grandchild. I'm not staying in this cursed spot, but if ever I can do you or yours a hurt, I will.
#DAWKER.
That's right. Squeal and threaten. You began it.
#HILLCRIST.
Dawker, have the goodness! Hornblower, in the presence of what may be death, with all my heart I'm sorry.
#HORNBLOWER.
Ye hypocrite!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Dawker, please tell Fellows to telephone to Dr. Robinson to go round to the Hornblowers at once. Jack! Do you blame me?
#HILLCRIST.
No.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Or Dawker? He's done his best.
#HILLCRIST.
No.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
What is it?
#HILLCRIST.
Hypocrite!
#JILL.
Dodo, she's moved; she's spoken. It may not be so bad.
#HILLCRIST.
Thank God for that!
#FELLOWS.
The Jackmans, ma'am.
#HILLCRIST.
Who? What's this?
#MRS. JENKINS.
We're so glad we can go back, sir - ma'am, we just wanted to thank you. Thank you kindly, sir. Good night, ma'am.
#HILLCRIST.
I'd forgotten their existence. What is it that gets loose when you begin a fight, and makes you what you think you're not? What blinding evil! Begin as you may, it ends in this - skin game! Skin game!
#JILL.
It's not you, Dodo; it's not you, beloved Dodo.
#HILLCRIST.
It is me. For I am, or should be, master in this house!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
I don't understand.
#HILLCRIST.
When we began this fight, we had clean hands - are they clean' now? What's gentility worth if it can't stand fire?
