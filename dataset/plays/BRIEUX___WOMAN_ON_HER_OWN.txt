#GUERET.
Then you really don't want me to go and hear the third act?
#MADAME GUERET.
I think as I've been let in for these theatricals solely to please your goddaughter you may very well keep me company. Besides, my brother is coming back and he has something to say to you.
#GUERET.
Very well, my dear.
#MADAME GUERET.
I can't get over it.
#GUERET.
Over what?
#MADAME GUERET.
What we're doing. What are we doing?
#GUERET.
We're giving a performance of Barberine for the amusement of our friends. There's nothing very extraordinary in that.
#MADAME GUERET.
Don't make fun of me, please. What we are doing is simply madness. Madness, do you hear? And it was the day before yesterday - only the day before yesterday - we heard the news.
#GUERET.
We -
#MADAME GUERET.
Hush! , dressed as followers of the queen. Lucienne goes to the piano, takes a piece of music, and comes to Madame Guéret.]
#LUCIENNE.
You'll help me along, won't you, dear Madame Guéret? You'll give me my note when it comes to "Voyez vous pas que la nuit est profonde"?
#MADAME GUERET.
Now don't be nervous.
#MAUD.
We're ready.
#ANTOINETTE.
If the third act only goes as well as the first two -
#MAUD.
We'll listen until we have to go on.
#ANTOINETTE.
Won't you come with us, Madame?
#MADAME GUERET.
No, I can't. I've had to undertake the noises behind the scenes. That job might have been given to someone else, I think.
#LUCIENNE.
Oh, Madame, please don't be angry with us. Madame Chain let us know too late. And you're helping us so much.
#MADAME GUERET.
Well, I've invited the people, and I suppose I must entertain them. As I gave in to Thérèse about getting up this play, I don't want to do anything to spoil the evening.
#LUCIENNE.
How pretty she is as Kalekairi.
#MADAME GUERET.
You don't think people are shocked by her frock?
#LUCIENNE.
Oh, Madame!
#MADAME GUERET.
Well!
#LUCIENNE.
I shall have to go in a moment. Thérèse has come out; I can hear her sequins rattling.
#MADAME GUERET.
Yes; so can I. But René will let us know. Never mind.
#RENE.
Are you ready, Lucienne?
#LUCIENNE.
Yes.
#RENE.
You've only two lines to say.
#LUCIENNE.
Only one. No end of a success, wasn't it, for your Thérèse? Wasn't it? I am so happy, Lucienne. I love her so.
#LUCIENNE.
Listen. That's for me, I think.
#RENE.
Yes, that's for you. Wait. Come. Turn this way so as to make it sound as if you were at a distance. Now then.
#MADAME GUERET.
You have a delightful voice, Mademoiselle Lucienne. And your little window! Have you seen your little window? It was not there at the dress rehearsal. You lift it like this. It's supposed to be an opening in the wall. It ought to have been different; we were obliged to take out a pane. May I show her, Madame Guéret?
#MADAME GUERET.
Yes, yes, of course.
#RENE.
You lift it like this; and to speak you'll lean forward, won't you, so that they may see you?
#LUCIENNE.
I will, yes.
#RENE.
Don't touch it now. You won't forget the bell, will you, Madame? There's plenty of time - ten minutes at least. I'll let you know. Mademoiselle Lucienne, now, time to go on.
#LUCIENNE.
Yes, yes.
#MADAME GUERET.
To have a play being acted in the circumstances we're in - it's beyond everything! I cannot think how I came to allow it.
#GUERET.
You see they'd been rehearsing for a week. And Thérèse -
#MADAME GUERET.
And I not only allowed it, but I'm almost taking part in it.
#GUERET.
We couldn't put off all these people at twenty - four hours' notice. And it's our last party. It's really a farewell party. Besides, we should have had to tell Thérèse everything.
#MADAME GUERET.
Well, you asked me to keep it all from her until to - morrow - though it concerns her as much as it does us. Here's my brother.
#FELIAT.
I've something to tell you. Shall we be interrupted?
#MADAME GUERET.
Yes, constantly.
#FELIAT.
Let's go into another room.
#MADAME GUERET.
I can't. And all the rooms are full of people.
#GUERET.
Marguerite has been good enough to help here by taking the place of Madame Chain, who's ill.
#MADAME GUERET.
Yes, I've got to do the noises heard off! At my age! Tell us, Etienne, what is it?
#GUERET.
We can wait until the play is over.
#MADAME GUERET.
So like you! You don't care a bit about what my brother has to tell us. Who'd ever believe this is all your fault! What is it?
#FELIAT.
I have seen the lawyer. Your goddaughter will have to sign this power of attorney so that it may get to Lyons to - morrow morning.
#GUERET.
But we can't get her to sign that without telling her all about it.
#MADAME GUERET.
Well, goodness me, she'll have to know sometime! I must say I cannot understand the way you've kept this dreadful thing from her. It's pure sentimentality.
#GUERET.
The poor child!
#MADAME GUERET.
You really are ridiculous. One would think that it was only her money the lawyer took. It's gone, of course; but so is ours.
#GUERET.
We still have La Tremblaye.
#MADAME GUERET.
Yes, thank goodness, because La Tremblaye belongs to me.
#RENE.
Where is Mademoiselle Thérèse? She'll keep the stage waiting! No, she's coming, I hear her. Nice fright she's given me! Above all, Madame, don't forget the bell, almost the moment that Mademoiselle Thérèse comes off the stage.
#MADAME GUERET.
Yes, yes.
#RENE.
And my properties!
#FELIAT.
Now we can talk for a minute.
#MADAME GUERET.
Yes.
#FELIAT.
You've quite made up your minds to come to Evreux?
#GUERET.
Quite.
#FELIAT.
Are you sure you won't regret Paris?
#MADAME GUERET.
Oh, no.
#GUERET.
For the last two years I've hated Paris.
#MADAME GUERET.
Since you began to play cards.
#GUERET.
For the last two years we've had the greatest difficulty in keeping up appearances. This lawyer absconding is the last blow.
#FELIAT.
Aren't you afraid you will be horribly bored at La Tremblaye?
#GUERET.
What are we to do?
#FELIAT.
Well, now listen to me. I told you -
#RENE.
Good - morning, uncle.
#FELIAT.
Good - morning, René.
#GUERET.
He knows nothing about it yet?
#FELIAT.
No; and my sister - in - law asked me to tell him.
#MADAME GUERET.
Well, why shouldn't you? If they are engaged, we know nothing about it.
#GUERET.
Oh!
#MADAME GUERET.
We know nothing officially, because in these days young people don't condescend to consult their parents.
#FELIAT.
René told his people and they gave their consent.
#MADAME GUERET.
Unwillingly.
#FELIAT.
Oh certainly, unwillingly. Then I'm to tell him?
#MADAME GUERET.
The sooner the better.
#FELIAT.
I'll tell him to - night.
#GUERET.
I'm afraid it'll be an awful blow to the poor chap.
#MADAME GUERET.
Oh, he's young. He'll get over it.
#FELIAT.
What was I saying when he came in? Ah, yes; you know I've decided to add a bindery to my printing works at Evreux; you saw the building started when you were down there. If things go as I want them to, I shall try to do some cheap artistic binding. I want to get hold of a man who won't rob me to manage this new branch and look after it; a man who won't be too set in his ideas, because I want him to adopt mine; and, at the same time, I'd like him to be not altogether a stranger. I thought I'd found him; but I saw the man yesterday and I don't like him. Now will you take on the job? Would it suit you?
#GUERET.
Would it suit me! Oh, my dear Féliat, how can I possibly thank you? To tell you the truth, I've been wondering what in the world I should do with myself now; and I was dreading the future. What you offer me is better than anything I could have dreamt of. What do you say, Marguerite?
#MADAME GUERET.
I am delighted.
#FELIAT.
Then that's all right.
#GUERET.
I think you won't regret having confidence in me.
#FELIAT.
And your goddaughter?
#MADAME GUERET.
Thérèse?
#FELIAT.
Yes; how is she going to face this double news of her ruin and the breaking off of her engagement?
#MADAME GUERET.
I think she ought to have sense enough to understand that one is the consequence of the other. She can hardly expect René's parents to give their son to a girl without money.
#FELIAT.
I suppose not. But what's to become of her?
#GUERET.
She will live with us, of course.
#MADAME GUERET.
"Of course"! I like that.
#GUERET.
She has no other relations, and her father left her in my care.
#MADAME GUERET.
He left her in your care, and it's I who have been rushed into all the trouble of a child who is nothing to me.
#GUERET.
Child! She was nineteen when her father died.
#FELIAT.
To look after a young girl of nineteen is a very great responsibility.
#MADAME GUERET.
Ho! Ho! Look after! Look after Mademoiselle Thérèse! You think she's a person who allows herself to be looked after! And yet you've seen her more or less every holidays.
#GUERET.
You've not had to look after her; she has been at the Lycée.
#THERESE.
The bell, the bell, godmother! You're forgetting the bell! Good - evening, Monsieur Féliat.
#MADAME GUERET.
I was going to forget it! Oh, what a nuisance! All this is so new to me.
#FELIAT.
Excuse me! I really didn't recognize you for the moment.
#THERESE.
Ah, my dress. Startling, isn't it?
#MADAME GUERET.
Startling is the right word. The bell! And you, on the stage, Mademoiselle Thérèse!
#THERESE.
I'm coming. Here I am!
#MADAME GUERET.
And I had it let down!
#FELIAT.
What?
#MADAME GUERET.
Her dress. What I see most clearly in all this is that she must stay with us.
#RENE.
Where's the queen? Where's Madame Nérisse?
#MADAME GUERET.
I've not seen her.
#RENE.
But goodness gracious - ! Madame Nérisse!
#MADAME NERISSE.
Yes, yes, I'm ready.
#RENE.
I wanted to warn you that Ulric will be on your right, and if he plays the fool -
#MADAME NERISSE.
Very well. Is it time?
#RENE.
Yes, come. You won't forget the trumpets?
#MADAME GUERET.
No, no. All the same, you'd better help me.
#RENE.
I will, I will.
#FELIAT.
You know, if she wants one, she'll find a husband at Evreux.
#MADAME GUERET.
Without a penny!
#FELIAT.
Without a penny! She made a sensation at the ball at the sous - préfecture. She's extremely pretty.
#MADAME GUERET.
She's young.
#FELIAT.
Monsieur Gambard sounded me about her.
#MADAME GUERET.
Monsieur Gambard! The Monsieur Gambard who has the house with the big garden?
#FELIAT.
Yes.
#MADAME GUERET.
But he's very rich.
#FELIAT.
He's forty - nine.
#MADAME GUERET.
She'll have to take what she can get now.
#FELIAT.
And I think that Monsieur Beaudoin -
#GUERET.
But he's almost a cripple!
#MADAME GUERET.
She wouldn't do so well in Paris.
#GUERET.
She wouldn't look at either of them.
#FELIAT.
We must try and make her see reason.
#RENE.
Excuse me, Uncle; don't stand there before the little window.
#FELIAT.
Beg pardon. I didn't know.
#RENE.
I haven't a moment.
#FELIAT.
I've never seen you so busy. At your office they say you're a lazy dog.
#MADAME GUERET.
Probably René has more taste for the stage than for business. Rather! Now, it's time. Come. Lift it. Not yet! There! Now!
#LUCIENNE.
"If you want food and drink, you must do like those old women you despise - you must spin."
#RENE.
Capital!
#LUCIENNE.
Please forgive me, Monsieur, I've not had time to speak to you.
#FELIAT.
Why, it's Mademoiselle Lucienne, Thérèse's friend, who came and stayed in the holidays! Fancy my not recognizing you!
#LUCIENNE.
It's my dress. I do like playing this part. I have to say that lovely bit - you know - the bit that describes the day of the ideal wife. "I rise and go to prayers, to the farmyard, to the kitchen. I prepare your meal; I go with you to church; I read a page or two; I sew a while; and then I fall asleep happy upon your breast."
#FELIAT.
That's good, oh, that's very good! Barberine - now, who wrote that?
#LUCIENNE.
Alfred de Musset.
#FELIAT.
Ah, yes; to be sure, Alfred de Musset. I read him when I was young. You often find his works lying about in pretty bindings.
#RENE.
Uncle, Uncle; I beg your pardon, but don't speak so loud. We can hardly hear what they're saying on the stage.
#FELIAT.
Sorry, I'm sure. You. Now.
#LUCIENNE.
"My lord, these cries are useless. It grows late. If you wish to sup - you must spin." There! Now I must go over the rest with Ulric. The trumpets, Madame. Don't forget.
#MADAME GUERET.
No, no. Don't worry.
#FELIAT.
You blow trumpets?
#MADAME GUERET.
Yes; on the piano.
#FELIAT.
I don't know what to do with myself. I don't want to be in the way. I'm not accustomed to being behind the scenes.
#MADAME GUERET.
Nor am I.
#THERESE.
It's time for me now.
#FELIAT.
She really looks like a professional actress. Now!
#THERESE.
"My lady says, as you will not spin, you cannot sup. She thinks you are not hungry, and I wish you good - night." Good - evening, Monsieur Féliat.
#RENE.
Now then, come along. You go on in one minute.
#THERESE.
I'll come back soon. Now, Madame, you, Quick, Madame!
#MADAME GUERET.
Yes, yes. All right.
#RENE.
Splendid!
#MADAME GUERET.
Ouf! It's over. At last we can have peace! If she's such a fool as to refuse both these men -
#GUERET.
She won't refuse, you may be sure.
#MADAME GUERET.
- we shall have to keep her with us. But I shall insist upon certain conditions.
#GUERET.
What conditions?
#MADAME GUERET.
I won't have any scandals at Evreux.
#GUERET.
There won't be any scandals.
#MADAME GUERET.
No; because she'll have to behave very differently, I can tell you. She'll have to leave all these fine airs of independence behind her in Paris.
#GUERET.
What airs?
#MADAME GUERET.
Well, for instance, getting letters and answering them without any sort of supervision! She manages in such a way that I don't even see the envelopes! I object very much, too, to her student ways.
#GUERET.
She goes to classes and lectures with her girl friends.
#MADAME GUERET.
Well, she won't go to any more. And she will have to give up going out alone.
#GUERET.
She's of age. properly brought up young lady is never of age.
#FELIAT.
Perfectly true.
#MADAME GUERET.
And there must be a change in her way of dressing.
#GUERET.
There will. She'll have to dress simply, for she won't have a rap.
#MADAME GUERET.
That has nothing to do with it. I shall make her understand that she will have to behave like the other girls in good society.
#FELIAT.
Of course.
#MADAME GUERET.
I shall also put a veto on certain books she reads. It's really dreadful, Etienne. You've no idea! One day I found a shocking book upon her table - a horror! What do you suppose she said when I remonstrated? That that disgraceful book was necessary in preparing for her examination. And the worst of it is, it was true. She showed me the syllabus.
#FELIAT.
I'm afraid they're bringing up our girls in a way that'll make unhappy women of them.
#MADAME GUERET.
Don't let's talk about it; you'll start on politics, and then you and Henri will begin to argue. All the same I mean to be very good to her. As soon as she knows what's happened her poor little pretensions will come tumbling about her ears. I won't leave her in uncertainty, and even before she asks I'll tell her she may stay with us; but I shall tell her, too, what I expect from her in return.
#GUERET.
Wouldn't it be better -
#MADAME GUERET.
My dear, I shall go my own way. See what we're suffering now in consequence of going yours. Here's Madame Nérisse. Then the play is over. You must go and look after the people at the supper table. I'll join you in a minute.
#GUERET.
All right.
#MADAME NERISSE.
I've hardly ever been at such a successful party. I wanted to congratulate dear Thérèse, but she's gone to change her dress.
#MADAME GUERET.
So glad. Were you speaking of having a notice of it in your paper?
#MADAME NERISSE.
Of your play! If I was going to notice it! I should think so! The photographs we had taken at the dress rehearsal are being developed. We shall have a wonderful description.
#MADAME GUERET.
Could it be stopped?
#MADAME NERISSE.
It's not possible! Just think how amazed the subscribers to Feminine Art would be if they found nothing in their paper about your lovely performance of Barberine, even if the editress of the paper hadn't taken a part in the play. If it only depended on me, perhaps I could find some way out - explain it in some way, just to please you. But then there's your charming Thérèse - one of our contributors. I can't tell you what a wonderful success she's had with her two stories, illustrated by herself. People adore her.
#MADAME GUERET.
Nobody would know anything about it -
#MADAME NERISSE.
Nobody know! There are at least ten people among your guests who will send descriptions of this party to the biggest morning papers, simply for the sake of getting their own names into print. If Feminine Art had nothing about it, it would be thought extremely odd, I assure you. Wouldn't it, Monsieur?
#FELIAT.
Pardon me, Madame, I know nothing about these things.
#MADAME GUERET.
Well, we'll say no more about it.
#MADAME NERISSE.
But what's the matter? You must have some very good reason for not wanting me to put in anything about your delightful party.
#MADAME GUERET.
No - only - Some of our family are country people, you know. It would take me too long to explain it all to you. It doesn't matter. Then honestly you think Thérèse has some little talent?
#MADAME NERISSE.
Little talent! No, but very great talent. Haven't you read her two articles?
#MADAME GUERET.
Oh, I? I belong to another century. In my days it would have been considered a very curious thing if a young girl wrote novels. My brother feels this too. By the way, I have not introduced my brother to you. Monsieur Féliat, of Evreux - Madame Nérisse, editress of Feminine Art. Madame Nérisse has been kind enough to help us with our little party. Yes - you were speaking about - what was it - this story that Thérèse has written. No doubt your readers were indulgent to the work of a little amateur.
#MADAME NERISSE.
I wish I could find professionals who'd do half as well. I'm perfectly certain the number her photograph is going to be in will have a good sale.
#FELIAT.
You'll publish her photograph?
#MADAME NERISSE.
In her dress as Kalekairi.
#MADAME GUERET.
In her dress as Kalekairi!
#MADAME NERISSE.
On the front page. They tell me it's a first - rate likeness. I'll bring you one of them before long, and your country relations will be delighted. If you'll excuse me, I'll hurry away and change my dress.
#MADAME GUERET.
Oh, please excuse me for keeping you.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Good - bye for the present. I was looking for Maud and Nadia to take them away with me. I see them over there having a little flirtation. All right, all right; I won't interrupt. They'd much rather come home alone. Good - bye. Good - bye, Monsieur. Don't look so upset because you have a goddaughter who can be a great writer or a great painter if she chooses; just as she would have been a great actress if she had taken a fancy for that. Good - bye again and many congratulations.
#MADAME GUERET.
Well! Anyway, she's not my daughter! I must go and say good - bye to everybody. When I've got rid of them, I'll come back and see Thérèse. Will you wait for me? You'll find some papers on that little table. Oh, goodness, what times we live in!
#FELIAT.
Oh, I say, this is really - I must cough or something, and let them know I'm here. They've seen me. They're waving their hands - and - they 're going on just the same!
#THERESE.
What is he doing?
#LUCIENNE.
What's the matter?
#FELIAT.
It is incredible!
#THERESE.
You seem rather upset. What's the matter?
#FELIAT.
What's the matter? Those girls are behaving in such a scandalous way with those young men.
#LUCIENNE.
Let's see.
#FELIAT.
Oh, don't look! Though I must say -
#THERESE.
What must you say?
#FELIAT.
Nothing.
#LUCIENNE.
I know. You mean that we're just as bad.
#FELIAT.
No, no, not as bad.
#LUCIENNE.
Yes, yes; well - almost. I saw you watching us yesterday after the rehearsal! You saw I was flirting, and I know you imagined all sorts of horrid things. Our little flirtations are not what you think. When we flirt we play at love - making with our best boys, just as once upon a time we played at mothering with our dolls.
#FELIAT.
But that doesn't justify -
#THERESE.
You don't understand. People spoil us while we're children, and then look after us so tremendously carefully when we grow up that we guess there must be delightful and dangerous possibilities about us. Flirting is our way of feeling for these possibilities.
#LUCIENNE.
We're sharpening our weapons.
#THERESE.
But the foils have buttons on them, and the pistols are only loaded with powder.
#LUCIENNE.
And it's extremely amusing and does no harm to anybody.
#THERESE.
Monsieur Féliat, you've read bad books. Nowadays girls like us are neither bread - and - butter misses nor demi - vierges. We're perfectly respectable young people. Quite capable and self - possessed and, at the same time, quite straight and very happy.
#FELIAT.
I'm perfectly sure of it, my dear young ladies. But you know I've had a great deal of experience.
#THERESE.
Oh, experience! Well, you know -
#LUCIENNE.
Oh, experience!
#THERESE.
You say you have experience; that only means you know about the past better than we do. But we know much better than you do about the present.
#FELIAT.
I think those girls there are playing a dangerous game.
#THERESE.
You needn't have the smallest anxiety about them.
#FELIAT.
That way of going on might get them into great trouble.
#THERESE.
It won't, I assure you. Monsieur Féliat, believe me, you know nothing about it.
#LUCIENNE.
We're clever enough to be able to take care of ourselves.
#FELIAT.
But there are certain things that take you by storm.
#LUCIENNE.
Not us. Flirting is an amusement, a distraction, a game.
#THERESE.
Shall we say a safety valve?
#LUCIENNE.
There's not a single one of us who doesn't understand the importance of running straight. And, to do them justice, these boys have no idea of tempting us to do anything else. What they want, what we all really want, is a quite conventional, satisfactory marriage.
#FELIAT.
I most heartily approve; but in my days so much wisdom didn't usually come from such fascinating little mouths.
#THERESE.
Now how can you blame us when you see that really we think exactly as you do yourself?
#FELIAT.
In my days girls went neither to the Lycée nor to have gymnastic lessons, and they were none the less straight.
#LUCIENNE.
And yet they grew up into the women of to - day. I get educated and try to keep myself healthy, with exercises and things, because I want to develop morally and physically, and be fit to marry a man a little bit out of the ordinary either in fortune or brains.
#THERESE.
You see our whole lives depend upon the man we marry.
#FELIAT.
I seem to have heard that before.
#LUCIENNE.
Yes; so've I. But it's none the less true for that.
#THERESE.
Isn't it funny that we seem to be saying the most shocking things when we're only repeating what our grandfathers and grandmothers preached to their children?
#LUCIENNE.
They were quite right. Love doesn't make happiness by itself. One has to consider the future. We do consider it; in fact we do nothing else but consider it. We want to get the best position for ourselves in the future that we possibly can. We're not giddy little fools, and we're not selfish egotists. We want our children to grow up happy and capable as we've done ourselves. We're really quite reasonable.
#FELIAT.
You are; indeed you are. It makes one shudder. Excuse me, I'm going to supper.
#LUCIENNE.
Let's all go together.
#FELIAT.
Thanks, I can find my way.
#LUCIENNE.
It's down that passage to the right.
#FELIAT.
Yes, I shall find it, thank you.
#THERESE.
You shocked the poor old boy.
#LUCIENNE.
I only flavored the truth just enough to make it tasty. But I've something frightfully important to tell you. It's settled.
#THERESE.
What's settled?
#LUCIENNE.
I'm engaged.
#THERESE.
You don't say so.
#LUCIENNE.
It's done. Armand has been to his people and they've come to see mine. So I needn't play any more piano, nor sing any more sentimental songs; I needn't be clever any more, nor flirt any more, nor languish at young men any more. And how do you suppose it was settled? Just what one wouldn't have ever expected. You know my people were doing all they could to dress me up, and show me off, and seem to be richer than they are, so as to attract the men. On my side I was giving myself the smartest of airs and pretending to despise money and to think of nothing but making a splash. Everything went quite differently from what I expected. I wanted to attract Armand, and I was only frightening him off. He thought such a woman as I was pretending to be too expensive. It was just through a chance conversation, some sudden confidence on my part, that he found out that I really like quite simple things. He was delighted, and he proposed at once.
#THERESE.
Dear Lucienne, I'm so glad. I hope you'll be very, very happy.
#LUCIENNE.
Ah, that's another story. Armand is not by any means perfect. But what can one do? The important thing is to marry, isn't it?
#THERESE.
Of course. Well, if your engagement is on, mine's off.
#LUCIENNE.
Thérèse! Why I've just been talking to René. I never saw him so happy, nor so much in love.
#THERESE.
He doesn't know yet. Or perhaps they're telling him now.
#LUCIENNE.
Telling him what?
#THERESE.
I've lost all my money, my dear.
#LUCIENNE.
Lost all your money!
#THERESE.
Yes. The lawyer who had my securities has gone off with them.
#LUCIENNE.
When?
#THERESE.
I heard about it the day before yesterday. Godpapa and godmamma were so awfully good they never said anything to me about it, though they're losing a lot of money too. They thought I hadn't heard, and I expect they wanted me to have this last evening's fun. I said nothing, and so nobody knows anything except you, now, and probably René.
#LUCIENNE.
What will you do?
#THERESE.
What can I do? It's impossible for him to marry me without a penny. Of course I shall release him from his promise.
#LUCIENNE.
You think he'll give you up?
#THERESE.
His people will make him. If they cut off his allowance, he'll be at their mercy. He earns about twenty dollars a month in that lawyer's office. So, you see -
#LUCIENNE.
Oh! poor Thérèse! And you could play Barberine with a secret like that!
#THERESE.
I've had a real bad time since I heard. It's awful at night!
#LUCIENNE.
My dearest! And you love him so!
#THERESE.
Yes - oh! don't make me cry.
#LUCIENNE.
It might do you good!
#THERESE.
You know -
#LUCIENNE.
Yes - I know that you're good and brave.
#THERESE.
I shall have to be.
#LUCIENNE.
Then you'll break off the engagement?
#THERESE.
Yes. I shall never see him again.
#LUCIENNE.
Never see him again!
#THERESE.
I shall write to him. If I saw him I should probably break down. If I write I shall be more likely to be able to make him feel that we must resign ourselves to the inevitable.
#LUCIENNE.
He'll be horribly unhappy.
#THERESE.
So shall I. Oh, if he only understood me! If he was able to believe that I can earn my own living and that he could earn his. If he would dare to do without his people's consent!
#LUCIENNE.
Persuade him to!
#THERESE.
It's quite impossible. His people are rich. Only just think what they'd suspect me of. No; I shall tell him all the things his father will tell him. But oh! Lucienne, if he had an answer for them! If he had an answer! But, my poor René, he won't make any stand.
#LUCIENNE.
How you love him!
#THERESE.
Oh, yes; I love him. He's rather weak, but he's so loyal and good and loving.
#LUCIENNE.
Oh, my dear, I do pity you so.
#THERESE.
I am to be pitied, really. There's one thing. I shall take advantage of this business to separate from godpapa and godmamma.
#LUCIENNE.
But you have no money -
#THERESE.
I've not been any too happy here. You know they're - Go now. I'll tell you all about it to - morrow. Well, good - night, my dear. See you to - morrow at the Palais de Glace or at the Sorbonne! Good - night.
#LUCIENNE.
Good - night, Thérèse.
#MADAME GUERET.
Yes, she's here. Come in. Thérèse, we have something to say to you.
#THERESE.
Yes, godmamma.
#MADAME GUERET.
It's about something important; something very serious. Let us sit down.
#GUERET.
You'll have to be brave, Thérèse.
#MADAME GUERET.
We are ruined, and you are ruined too.
#THERESE.
Yes.
#MADAME GUERET.
Is that all you have to say?
#THERESE.
I knew it already.
#MADAME GUERET.
You knew it? Who told you?
#THERESE.
The lawyer told me himself. I had a long letter from him yesterday. He begs me to forgive him.
#MADAME GUERET.
Well, I declare!
#THERESE.
I'll show it to you. He's been gambling. To get a bigger fortune for his girls, he says.
#MADAME GUERET.
You knew it! And you've had the strength, the - duplicity?
#THERESE.
Just as you had yourself, godmamma. And I'm so much obliged to both of you for saying nothing to me, because I'm sure you wanted me to have my play to - night and enjoy myself; and that was why you tried to keep the news from me.
#MADAME GUERET.
And you were able to laugh and to act!
#THERESE.
I've always tried to keep myself in hand.
#MADAME GUERET.
Oh, I know. All the same - And I was so careful about breaking this news to you, and you knew it all the time!
#THERESE.
I'm very sorry. But you -
#MADAME GUERET.
All right, all right. Well, then, we have nothing to tell. But do you understand that you've not a penny left?
#GUERET.
You're to go on living with us, of course.
#MADAME GUERET.
You really might have given her time to ask us. We take it that you have asked us, and we answer that we will keep you with us.
#GUERET.
We are going to Evreux. My brother - in - law is giving me work in his factory.
#MADAME GUERET.
We will keep you with us, but on certain conditions.
#THERESE.
Thank you very much, godmamma, but I mean to stay in Paris.
#GUERET.
You don't understand. We are going to live at Evreux.
#THERESE.
But I am going to live in Paris.
#GUERET.
Then it is I who do not understand.
#THERESE.
All the same -
#MADAME GUERET.
I can hardly believe that you propose to live in Paris by yourself.
#THERESE.
I do, godmamma.
#FELIAT.
Alone!
#GUERET.
Alone! I repeat, I don't understand.
#FELIAT.
Nor do I. But no doubt you have reasons to give to your godfather and godmother.
#THERESE.
There's no secret about my reasons. All the world may know them. When I've explained you'll see that it's all right.
#MADAME GUERET.
I must confess to being extremely curious to hear these reasons.
#THERESE.
I do hope my decision won't make you angry with me.
#MADAME GUERET.
Angry! When have I ever been angry with you?
#THERESE.
You've both been - you've all three been - most good and kind to me, and I shall always remember it and be grateful. You may be sure I shan't love you any the less because I shall live in Paris and you at Evreux. And I do beg of you to feel the same to me. I shall never forget what I owe to you. Father was only your friend; we're not related in any way: but you took me in, and for four years you've treated me as if I was your daughter. From my very heart I'm grateful to you.
#GUERET.
You don't owe us much, you know. For two years you were a boarder at the Lycée Maintenon, and we saw nothing of you but your letters. You've only actually lived with us for two years, and you've been like sunshine in the house.
#MADAME GUERET.
Yes, indeed.
#THERESE.
I've thought this carefully over. I'm twenty - three. I won't be a burden to you any longer.
#GUERET.
Is that because you are too proud and independent?
#THERESE.
If I thought I could really be of use to you, I would stay with you. If I could help you to face your troubles, I would stay with you. But I can't, and I mean to shift for myself.
#MADAME GUERET.
And you think you can "shift for yourself," as you call it, all alone?
#THERESE.
Yes, godmamma. young girl, all alone, in Paris! The thing is inconceivable.
#GUERET.
But, my poor child, how do you propose to live?
#THERESE.
I'll work.
#MADAME GUERET.
You don't mean that seriously?
#THERESE.
Yes, godmamma.
#GUERET.
You think you have only to ask for work and it will fall from the skies!
#THERESE.
I have a few dollars in my purse which will keep me until I have found something.
#FELIAT.
Your purse will be empty before you've made a cent.
#THERESE.
I'm sure it won't.
#GUERET.
Now, my dear, you're tired, and nervous, and upset. You can't look at things calmly. We can talk about this again to - morrow.
#THERESE.
Yes, godpapa. But I shan't have changed my mind.
#MADAME GUERET.
I know you have a strong will of your own.
#FELIAT.
Let us talk sensibly and reasonably. You propose to live all alone in Paris. Good. Where will you live?
#THERESE.
I shall hire a little flat - or a room somewhere.
#MADAME GUERET.
Like a workgirl.
#THERESE.
Like a workgirl. There's nothing to be ashamed of in that.
#FELIAT.
And you are going to earn your own living. How?
#THERESE.
I shall work. There's nothing to be ashamed of in that, either.
#GUERET.
I see. But a properly brought up young lady doesn't work for her living if she can possibly avoid it.
#MADAME GUERET.
And above all, a properly brought up young lady doesn't live all alone.
#THERESE.
All the same -
#MADAME GUERET.
You are perfectly free. There's no doubt about that. We have no power to prevent you from doing exactly as you choose.
#GUERET.
But your father left you in my care.
#THERESE.
Please, godmamma, don't be hard upon me. I feel you think I'm ungrateful, though you don't say so. I know that often and often I shall long for your kindness and for the home where you've given me a place. I've shocked you. Do please forgive me. I'm made like that, and made differently from you. I don't say you're not right; I only say I'm different. Certain ideas have come to me from being educated at the Lycée and from all these books I've read. I think I'm able to earn my own living, and so I look upon it as my bounden duty not to trespass upon your charity. It's a question of personal dignity. Don't you think that I'm right, godfather? Besides, if I did go to Evreux with you, what should I do there?
#GUERET.
It's pretty easy to guess.
#MADAME GUERET.
Yes, indeed.
#GUERET.
You would live with us.
#MADAME GUERET.
You would have a home.
#THERESE.
Yes, yes, I know all that; and it would be a great happiness. But what should I do?
#GUERET.
You would do what all well brought up young girls in your position do.
#THERESE.
You mean I should do nothing.
#GUERET.
Nothing! No, not nothing.
#THERESE.
Pay visits, practise a bit; some crochet and a little photography? That's to say, nothing.
#GUERET.
You were brought up to that.
#THERESE.
I should never have dared to put it into words. But afterwards?
#GUERET.
Afterwards?
#THERESE.
How long would that last?
#GUERET.
Until you marry.
#THERESE.
I shall never marry.
#GUERET.
Why not?
#THERESE.
Oh, godfather, you know why not. I have no money. So I'm going to try and get work.
#FELIAT.
Work! Now, Thérèse, you know what women are like who try to earn their own living. You think you can support yourself. How?
#THERESE.
Perhaps I'm mistaken, but I think I can support myself by my pen.
#FELIAT.
Be a bluestocking?
#THERESE.
Yes.
#MADAME GUERET.
That means a Bohemian life, with everything upside down, and a cigarette always between your lips.
#THERESE.
Neither Bohemia, nor the upside down, nor the cigarette are indispensable, godmother. Your information is neither firsthand nor up - to - date.
#FELIAT.
In a month's time you'll want to give it up.
#THERESE.
Under those circumstances there's no harm in letting me make the experiment.
#GUERET.
Now, my dear child, don't you know that even with your cleverness you may have to wait years before you make a penny. I've been an editor. I know what I'm talking about.
#MADAME GUERET.
She's made up her mind, there's no use saying any more.
#FELIAT.
But I want to talk to her now. Will you be so good as to listen to me, Mademoiselle Thérèse? I wonder if I might be allowed to have a few minutes with her alone.
#MADAME GUERET.
Most willingly.
#GUERET.
Come, Marguerite.
#MADAME GUERET.
It's no use making up your mind to the worst in these days; life always keeps a surprise for you. Let's go.
#FELIAT.
My child, I have undertaken to say something to you that I fear will hurt you, and it's very difficult. You know that I'm only René's uncle by marriage. So it's not on my own account that I speak. I speak for his parents.
#THERESE.
Don't say another word, Monsieur Féliat. I perfectly understand. I'm going to release him from his engagement. I shall write to him this very night.
#FELIAT.
My sister - in - law and her husband are most unhappy about all this.
#THERESE.
I'm grateful to you all.
#FELIAT.
Their affection for you is not in any way diminished.
#THERESE.
I know.
#FELIAT.
And -
#THERESE.
Please, please, Monsieur Féliat, don't say any more; what's the good of it?
#FELIAT.
I beg your pardon, my dear. I am a little upset. I was expecting - er, er -
#THERESE.
Expecting what?
#FELIAT.
I expected some resistance on your part, perhaps indignation. It must be very hard for you; you were very fond of René.
#THERESE.
What's the good of talking about that? Of course he can't marry me now that I've not got a penny.
#FELIAT.
You know - as a matter of fact - I - my old - fashioned ideas - well, you go on surprising me. But this time my surprise is accompanied by - shall I say respect? - and by sympathy. I expected tears, which would have been very natural, because I know that your affection for René was very great.
#THERESE.
I can keep my tears to myself.
#FELIAT.
Yes - Oh, I - at least -
#THERESE.
Let's consider it settled. Please don't talk to me about it any more.
#FELIAT.
Very well. Now will you allow me to say one word to you about your future?
#THERESE.
I shan't change my mind.
#FELIAT.
Perhaps not; all the same I want to advise you like - well, like an old uncle. For several years you have been spending your holidays with me at La Tremblaye. And I have a real affection for you. So you'll listen to me?
#THERESE.
With all my heart.
#FELIAT.
You're making a mistake. Your ideas do you credit, but believe me, you're laying up trouble for yourself in the future. Wait. I don't want to argue. I want you to listen to me, and I want to persuade you to follow my advice. Come to Evreux and you may be perfectly certain that you won't be left an old maid all your life. Even without money you'll find a husband there. You're too pretty, too charming, too well educated not to turn the head of some worthy gentleman. You made a sensation at the reception at the Préfecture. If you don't know that already, I tell you so.
#THERESE.
I'm extremely flattered.
#FELIAT.
Do you know that if - well, if you decide to marry - I might -
#THERESE.
But I've not decided to marry.
#FELIAT.
All right, all right, I am speaking about later on. Well, you've seen Monsieur Baudoin and Monsieur Gambard -
#THERESE.
I haven't the slightest intention of -
#FELIAT.
There's no question of anything immediate. But for a person as wise and sensible as you are, the position of both the one and the other deserves -
#THERESE.
I know them both.
#FELIAT.
Yes; but -
#THERESE.
Now look here. If I had two hundred thousand francs, would you suggest that I should marry either of them?
#FELIAT.
Certainly not.
#THERESE.
There, you see.
#FELIAT.
But you've not got two hundred thousand francs.
#THERESE.
The last thing I want is to be exacting. But really, Monsieur Féliat, think for a minute. If I were to marry a man I could not possibly love, I should marry him for his money. And in that case the only difference between me and the women I am not supposed to know anything about would be that a little ceremony had been performed over me and not over them. Don't you agree with me?
#FELIAT.
But, my dear, you say such extraordinary things.
#THERESE.
Well, do you consider that less dishonoring than working? Honestly now, do you? I think that the best thing about women earning their living is that it'll save them from being put into exactly that position.
#FELIAT.
The right thing for woman is marriage. That's her proper position.
#THERESE.
It's sometimes an unhappy one. Ask the lady kindly to wait a moment.
#MAID.
Yes, Mademoiselle.
#FELIAT.
Well, I'm off. I shall go and see René. Then you'll write to him?
#THERESE.
This very evening.
#FELIAT.
He'll want to see you. My child, will you have the courage to resist him?
#THERESE.
You needn't trouble about that.
#FELIAT.
If he was mad enough to want to do without his parents' consent, they wish me to tell you that they would never speak to him again.
#THERESE.
I see.
#FELIAT.
That he would be a stranger to them. You understand all that that means?
#THERESE.
Yes, yes; oh yes.
#FELIAT.
If you are not strong enough to stand out against his entreaties, you will be his ruin.
#THERESE.
I quite understand.
#FELIAT.
People would think very badly of you.
#THERESE.
Please don't say any more, I quite understand.
#FELIAT.
Then I may trust you?
#THERESE.
You may trust me.
#FELIAT.
Thank you. Thérèse, you're - well - you're splendid. I like courage. I wish you success with all my heart. I really wish you success. But if, in the future, you should want a friend - the very strongest may find themselves in that position - let me be that friend.
#THERESE.
I'm grateful, very grateful, Monsieur. Thank you. But I hope I shall be able to earn my own living. That is all I want.
#FELIAT.
I wish you every success. Good - bye, Mademoiselle.
#THERESE.
Good - bye, Monsieur. How good of you to come, dear Madame. Too bad you should have the trouble.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Nonsense, my dear. I wanted to come. I'm so anxious to show you these two photographs and consult you about which we're to publish. I expected to find you very tired.
#THERESE.
I am not the least tired, and I'm delighted to see you.
#MADAME NERISSE.
This is more brilliant, that's more dreamy. I like this one. What do you think?
#THERESE.
I like this one too.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Then that's settled. What a success you had this evening.
#THERESE.
Yes; people are very kind. I'm so glad you've come just now, dear Madame, so that we can have a few minutes' quiet talk. I have something most important to say to you.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Anything I can do for you?
#THERESE.
Well, I'll explain. And please do talk to me quite openly and frankly.
#MADAME NERISSE.
I will indeed.
#THERESE.
You told me that my article was very much liked. I can quite believe that you may have exaggerated a little out of kindness to me. I want to know really whether you think I write well.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Dear Thérèse, ask Madame Guéret to tell you what I said to her just now about that very thing.
#THERESE.
Then you think my collaboration might be really useful to Feminine Art?
#MADAME NERISSE.
There's nothing more useful to a paper like ours than the collaboration of girls in society.
#THERESE.
Would you like me to send you some more stories like the first?
#MADAME NERISSE.
As many as you can.
#THERESE.
And - and would you pay me the same price for them as for the one you've just published?
#MADAME NERISSE.
Yes, exactly the same; and I shall be very glad to get them. I like your work; you have an exceptionally light touch; people won't get tired of reading your stuff.
#THERESE.
Oh, I hope that's true! I'm going to tell you some bad news. For family reasons my godfather and godmother are going to leave Paris. I shall stay here by myself, and I shall have to live by my pen.
#MADAME NERISSE.
What an idea!
#THERESE.
It's not an idea, it's a necessity.
#MADAME NERISSE.
What do you mean? A necessity? Monsieur Guéret - But I mustn't be inquisitive.
#THERESE.
You're not inquisitive, and I'll tell you all about it very soon; we haven't got time now. Can you promise to take a weekly article from me?
#MADAME NERISSE.
Certainly.
#THERESE.
You can! Oh, thank you, thank you! I can't tell you how you've relieved my mind.
#MADAME NERISSE.
My dear child. I am glad you've spoken to me plainly. I will do everything I possibly can. I'm extremely fond of you. I don't think the Directors will object.
#THERESE.
Why should they have anything to do with it?
#MADAME NERISSE.
Perhaps not, but - the Directors like to give each number a character of its own. It's a thing they're very particular about.
#THERESE.
I could write about very different subjects.
#MADAME NERISSE.
I know you could, but it would be always the same signature.
#THERESE.
Well, every now and then I might sign a fancy name.
#MADAME NERISSE.
That would be quite easy, and I don't think the Directors would mind. They might say it was a fresh name to make itself known and liked.
#THERESE.
We'll try and manage it.
#MADAME NERISSE.
We shall have to fight against some jealousy. The Directors have protégées. The wife of one of them has been waiting to get an innings for more than two months. There are so many girls and women who write nowadays.
#THERESE.
Yes; but generally speaking their work is not worth much, I think.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Oh, I don't know that. There are a great many who have real talent. People don't realize what a lot of girls there are who have talent. But, still, if I'm not able to take an article every week, you may rely upon me to take one as often as I possibly can. Oh, I shall make myself some enemies for your sake.
#THERESE.
Enemies? How do you mean enemies?
#MADAME NERISSE.
My dear, it alters everything if you become a professional. Let me see if I can explain. We have our regular contributors. The editor makes them understand that they must expect to run the gantlet of the occasional competition of society women; because, if these women are allowed to write, it interests them and their families in the paper, and it's an excellent advertisement for us. That'll explain to you, by the way, why we sometimes publish articles not quite up to our standard. But if it's a matter of regular, professional work, we have to be more careful. We have to respect established rights and consider people who've been with us a long time. There is only a limited space in each number, and a lot of people have to live out of that.
#THERESE.
Yes, I see.
#MADAME NERISSE.
How sorry I am for you! If you only knew how I feel for you! Don't look so unhappy. You're not an ordinary girl, Thérèse, and it shall never be said that I didn't do all I could for you. Listen. I told you just now that I had some big projects in my mind. You shall know what they are. My husband and I are going to start an important weekly feminist paper on absolutely new lines. It's going to leave everything that's been done up to now miles behind. My husband shall explain his ideas to you himself. It'll be advanced and superior and all that, and at the same time most practical. Even to think of it has been a touch of genius. When you meet my husband you'll find that he's altogether out of the common. He's so clever, and he'd be in the very first rank in journalism if it wasn't for the envy and jealousy of other men who've intrigued against him and kept him down. I don't believe he has his equal in Paris as a journalist, I'll read you some of his verses, and you'll see that he's a great poet too. But I shall run on forever. Only yesterday he got the last of the capital that's needed for founding the paper; it's been definitely promised. We're ready to set about collecting our staff. We shall have leading articles, of course, and literary articles. Do you want me to talk to him about you?
#THERESE.
Of course I do. But -
#MADAME NERISSE.
We want to start a really smart, respectable woman's paper; of course without sacrificing our principles. Our title by itself proves that. It's to be called Woman Free.
#THERESE.
I'll give you my answer to - morrow - or this evening, if you like.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Before I go - as we're to be thrown a good deal together - I must tell you something about myself - a secret. I hope you won't care for me less when you know it. I call myself Madame Nérisse. But I have no legal right to the name. That's why I've always found some reason for not introducing Monsieur Nérisse to you and your people. He's married - married to a woman who's not worthy of him. She lives in an out - of - the - way place in the country and will not consent to a divorce. My dear Thérèse, it makes me very unhappy. I live only for him. I don't think a woman can be fonder of a man than I am of him. He's so superior to other men. But unfortunately I met him too late. I felt I ought to tell you this.
#THERESE.
Your telling me has added to my friendship for you. I can guess how unhappy you are. Probably I'll go this very evening to your house and see your husband and hear from him if he thinks I can be of use. Anyway, thank you very much.
#MADAME NERISSE.
And thank you for the way you take this. Good - bye for the present.
#THERESE.
René!
#RENE.
Thérèse, it can't be true! It's not possible! It's not all over - our love?
#THERESE.
We must be brave.
#RENE.
But I can't give you up.
#THERESE.
I've lost every penny, René dear.
#RENE.
But I don't love you any the less for that. I can't give you up, Thérèse. I can't give you up. I love you, I love you.
#THERESE.
Oh, René, don't! I need all my courage to face this. Help me. Don't you see, your people will never consent now.
#RENE.
My uncle told me so. But I'll see them. I'll persuade them. I'll explain to them.
#THERESE.
You know very well they never really liked me, and that they'll be glad of this opportunity of breaking it off.
#RENE.
I don't know what to do. But I cannot give you up. What would become of me without you? You're everything to me, everything. And suddenly - because of this dreadful thing - I must give up my whole life's happiness.
#THERESE.
Your people are quite right, René.
#RENE.
And you, you say that!
#THERESE.
Look at me, René. You're crying. Oh, my dear love! I love you, I love you!
#THERESE.
And I love you. Oh, please don't cry any more! René, dear, don't cry any more! You break my heart. I can't bear it, I'm forgetting all I ought to say to you. Oh, how dreadful this is! This is madness.
#RENE.
Ah, stay, Thérèse.
#THERESE.
No. We mustn't do this; we must be brave. Oh, why did you come here? I was going to write to you. We're quite helpless against this dreadful misfortune.
#RENE.
I don't know what to do! But I can't give you up.
#THERESE.
I must do the right thing. René, stop crying. Listen to me.
#RENE.
I love you.
#THERESE.
Yes; there's our love. But besides that there's life, and life is cruel and too strong for our love. There is your future, my dearest.
#RENE.
My future is to love you. My future is nothing if I lose you.
#THERESE.
You can't marry a girl without any money. That's a dreadful fact, like a stone wall. We shall only break ourselves to pieces if we dash ourselves against it. Listen, oh, please listen to me. Don't you hear what I'm saying? René - dear.
#RENE.
I'm listening.
#THERESE.
I give you your freedom without any bitterness or hardness.
#RENE.
I don't want it!
#THERESE.
Now listen. You mustn't sacrifice your whole life for a love affair, no matter how great the love is.
#RENE.
It's by losing you I shall sacrifice my life.
#THERESE.
Try and be brave; control yourself. Let us face this quietly. Suppose we do without your people's consent. What will become of us? Try to look the thing in the face. How should we live? René, it's horrible to bring our love down to the level of these miserable realities, but facts are facts. You know very well that if you marry me without your father and mother's consent, they won't give you any money. Isn't that so?
#RENE.
Oh! father is hard.
#THERESE.
He's quite right, my dear, quite right. If I was your sister, I should advise you not to give up the position you have been brought up in and the profession you've been educated for.
#RENE.
But I love you.
#THERESE.
And I love you. Well, we've got to forget one another.
#RENE.
That's impossible.
#THERESE.
We must be wise enough to -
#RENE.
Oh! how unhappy I am.
#THERESE.
Don't let yourself go. We're not in dreamland. If you keep on saying "I am unhappy," you'll be unhappy.
#RENE.
I love you so. Oh, Thérèse, how I love you!
#THERESE.
You'll forget me.
#RENE.
Never.
#THERESE.
Yes. You'll remember me in a way, of course. But you're young. Very soon you'll be able to live, to laugh, to love, to work.
#RENE.
My dearest! I don't know what to say. I can't talk of it. I only know one thing - I can't let you go.
#THERESE.
But we should be miserable, René.
#RENE.
Miserable together!
#THERESE.
Think, dear, think. It will be years before you can earn your own living, won't it?
#RENE.
But I -
#THERESE.
Now you know you've tried already. Only last year you wanted to leave home and be independent, and you had to go back because you were starving. Isn't that true?
#RENE.
It's dreadful, dreadful!
#THERESE.
So we must look at life as it is, practically, mustn't we? We have to have lodging and furniture and clothes. How are we to manage?
#RENE.
It's dreadful!
#THERESE.
How would you bear to see me going about in rags? You can't face that, can you? Tell me. Can you face that?
#RENE.
No.
#THERESE.
So you see, I'm right. Oh! Oh!
#THERESE.
Oh, can you do nothing but cry?
#RENE.
What a useless creature I am.
#THERESE.
There, now, you see you're better!
#RENE.
I'm ashamed of being so good - for - nothing.
#THERESE.
You're just like all the others. Now, don't be miserable. I'm not angry with you; you are doing what I told you we must do, and you agree. Go, René. Say good - bye. Good - bye, René.
#RENE.
Thérèse!
#THERESE.
Everything we can say is useless, and it'll only torture and humiliate us. We must end this - now - at once.
#RENE.
I shall always love you, Thérèse.
#THERESE.
Yes - exactly - now go.
#RENE.
Oh, my God!
#THERESE.
Go.
#RENE.
I'll go and see my people. They'll never be so cruel -
#THERESE.
Yes, yes, all right.
#RENE.
I'll write you.
#THERESE.
Yes - that's it - you'll write.
#RENE.
I shall see you again, Thérèse?
#THERESE.
René! Thérèse! Oh, what is it?
#THERESE.
Suppose - suppose after all, we did it? Listen. I love you far more than you know, more than I have ever let you know. A foolish feeling of self - respect made me hide a lot from you. Trust me. Trust your future to me. Marry me all the same. Believe in me. Marry me. You don't know how strong I am and all the things I can do. I will work, and you will work. You didn't get on when you were alone, but you will when you have me with you. I'll keep you brave when things go badly, and I'll be happy with you when they go right. René, I'll be content with so little! The simplest, humblest, hardest life, until we've made our way together - together, René, and conquered a place in the world for ourselves, that we'll owe to no one but ourselves. Let us have courage -
#RENE.
Thérèse, I'm sure my people will give in.
#THERESE.
Go, go; poor René. Forget what I said. Good - bye.
#RENE.
Oh, no! not good - bye. I'll make my father help us.
#THERESE.
Too late, my friend, I don't want you now.
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
My card will have informed you that I am Monsieur Mafflu.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Yes. Won't you sit down?
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
I am your new landlord, Madame. I have just bought this house. I've retired from business. I was afraid I shouldn't have enough to do, so I've bought some houses. I am my own agent. It gives me something to do. If a tenant wants repairs done, I go and see him. I love a bit of a gossip; it passes away an hour or so. In that way I make people's acquaintance - nice people. I didn't buy any of the houses where poor people live, though they're better business. I should never have had the heart to turn out the ones that didn't pay, and I should have been obliged to start an agent, and all my plan would have been upset. Now, Madame, for what brought me here. I hope you'll forgive me for the trouble I'm giving you - and I'm sorry - but I've come to give you notice.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Indeed! May I ask what your reason is?
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
I am just on the point of letting the second floor. My future tenant has young daughters.
#MADAME NERISSE.
I'm afraid I don't see what that has got to do with it.
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
Well - he'll live only in a house in which all the tenants are private families.
#MADAME NERISSE.
But we make no noise. We are not in any way objectionable.
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
Oh, no, no; not at all.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Well, then?
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
How shall I explain? I'm certain you're perfectly all right, and all the ladies who are with you here too, but I've had to give in that house property is depreciated by people that work; all the more if the people are ladies, and most of all if they're ladies who write books or bring out a newspaper with such a name as Woman Free. People who know nothing about it think from such a name - oh, bless you, I understand all that's rubbish, but - well - the letting value of the house, you see.
#MADAME NERISSE.
The sight of women who work for their living offends these people, does it?
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
Yes, that's the idea. A woman who works is always a little - hum - well - you know what I mean. Of course I mean nothing to annoy you.
#MADAME NERISSE.
You mean that your future tenants don't want their young ladies to have our example before them.
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
No! That's just what they don't. Having independent sort of people like you about makes 'em uneasy. For me, you know, I wouldn't bother about it - only - of course you don't see it this way, but you're odd - off the common somehow. You make one feel queer.
#MADAME NERISSE.
But there are plenty of women who work.
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
Oh, common women, yes; oh, that's all right.
#MADAME NERISSE.
If you have children, they have nurses and governesses.
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
Oh, those. They work, of course. They work for me, that's quite different. But you - What bothers these ladies, Madame Mafflu and all the others, is that you're in our own class. As for me I stick to the old saying, "Woman's place is the home."
#MADAME NERISSE.
But there are women who have got no home.
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
That's their own fault.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Very often it's not at all their own fault. Where are they to go? Into the streets?
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
I know, I know. There's all that. Still women can work without being feminists.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Have you any idea what you mean by "feminist"?
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
Not very clear. I know the people I live among don't know everything. I grant you all that. But Woman Free! Woman Free! Madame Mafflu wants to know what liberty - or what liberties - singular or plural; do you take me? - ha! ha! There might be questions asked.
#MADAME NERISSE.
You must do me the honor of introducing me to Madame Mafflu. She must be an interesting woman. I'll go and see her.
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
Oh, do! But not on a Wednesday.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Why not?
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
'Cos Wednesday's her day.
#MADAME NERISSE.
I must give it up, then, as I'm free only on Wednesdays.
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
I should like her to see for herself how nice you are. Her friends have been talking to her. They thought that you - well - they say feminist women are like the women were in the time of the Commune. They said perhaps you'd even go on a deputation!
#MADAME NERISSE.
You wouldn't approve of that?
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
Oh, talkin' of that, one of my friends has an argument nobody can answer. "Let these women," he says, "let 'em do their military service."
#MADAME NERISSE.
Well, you tell him that if men make wars, women make soldiers; and get killed at that work too, sometimes.
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
I'll tell him, but he won't understand.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Well, no matter. I won't detain you any longer, Monsieur Mafflu.
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
Oh! Madame. I should like to stay and talk to you for hours.
#MADAME NERISSE.
You're too kind.
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
Then you forgive me?
#MADAME NERISSE.
What would one not forgive you?
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
I say -
#MADAME NERISSE.
No, no. Good - bye, Monsieur.
#MONSIEUR MAFFLU.
Good - bye, Madame.
#MADAME NERISSE.
One really couldn't be angry!
#THERESE.
Good - morning, Madame. I'm so sorry to be late. I met Monsieur Féliat, my godmother's brother.
#MADAME NERISSE.
How is Madame Guéret?
#THERESE.
Very well, he says.
#MADAME NERISSE.
And does Monsieur Guéret like his new home?
#THERESE.
Yes, very much.
#MADAME NERISSE.
And Madame Guéret?
#THERESE.
She seems to be quite happy.
#MADAME NERISSE.
What a good thing. Here's the letter Monsieur Nérisse has written for you to that editor.
#THERESE.
Oh, thank you!
#MADAME NERISSE.
Did you find out when he could see you?
#THERESE.
To - morrow at Two O'clock. Can you spare me then?
#MADAME NERISSE.
Yes, certainly.
#THERESE.
Thank you.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Why don't you read your letter? You see it's open.
#THERESE.
I'll shut it up.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Read it.
#THERESE.
Shall I?
#MADAME NERISSE.
Yes, do.
#THERESE.
Oh, it's too much. This is too kind. With a letter like this my article is certain to be read. Monsieur Nérisse is kind! Will you tell him how very grateful I am?
#MADAME NERISSE.
Yes. I'll tell him, of course. But I dictated the letter myself. Monsieur Nérisse only signed it.
#THERESE.
Then I have one more kindness to thank you for.
#MADAME NERISSE.
I expect Monsieur Cazarès.
#BOY.
Monsieur - ?
#MADAME NERISSE.
Our old editor - Monsieur Cazarès. You know him very well.
#BOY.
Oh, yes, Madame, yes!
#MADAME NERISSE.
He will have another gentleman with him. You must show them straight into Monsieur Nérisse's room and let me know.
#BOY.
Yes, Madame.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Monsieur Cazarès is bringing us a new backer. We're going to make changes in the paper. I'll tell you all about it presently. Tell me, what was there between you and Monsieur Cazarès?
#THERESE.
Nothing at all.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Isn't he just a wee bit in love with you?
#THERESE.
I haven't the least idea. He's said nothing to me about it, if he is.
#MADAME NERISSE.
He's always behaved quite nicely to you?
#THERESE.
Always.
#MADAME NERISSE.
And Monsieur Nérisse?
#THERESE.
Monsieur Nérisse? I don't understand.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Oh, yes, you do. Has he ever made love to you?
#THERESE.
Oh, Madame!
#MADAME NERISSE.
Forgive me, dear child. I know how good and straight you are. You mustn't mind the things I say. Sometimes I'm horrid I know. I have an idea that Monsieur Nérisse is not as fond of me as he used to be.
#THERESE.
Oh, indeed that's only your fancy.
#MADAME NERISSE.
I hope so. I'm a bit nervous I think. I've such a lot of trouble with the paper just now. It's not going well. We're going to try something fresh. This time I think it'll be all right. You'll see it will. What's that? Did he call? I'm sure that idiot of a boy hasn't made up his fire, and he'd never think of it. He's like a great baby. Why, it's Mademoiselle Grégoire! You know, Dr. Grégoire! This is Mademoiselle Thérèse. I spoke to you about her. She'll explain everything to you in no time. I'll come back very soon and introduce you to the others. Excuse me for a minute.
#THERESE.
I really don't know what Madame Nérisse wants me to explain to you. You know our paper?
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
No, I've never seen it.
#THERESE.
Never seen it! Never seen Woman Free?
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
Never. I only know it by name.
#THERESE.
How odd! Well, here's a copy. It's in two parts, you see, and they're quite different from each other. Here the doctrine, there the attractions. Madame Nérisse thought of that.
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
"Votes for Women."
#THERESE.
"Votes for Women," "An End of Slavery." And then, on here, lighter things.
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
Frivolities?
#THERESE.
Frivolities. A story. "Beauty Notes."
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
"The Doctor's Page."
#THERESE.
Oh, too bad! But it wasn't I who first said frivolities!
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
I shall bear up. And what comes after "The Doctor's Page"?
#THERESE.
"Beauty Notes" and "Gleanings."
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
Gleanings?
#THERESE.
Yes. It's a column where real and imaginary subscribers exchange notes about cookery receipts, and housekeeping tips, and hair lotions, and that sort of thing.
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
Quite a good thing.
#THERESE.
I most confess it's the best read part.
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
I'm not at all surprised.
#THERESE.
I'm afraid we can't conceal from ourselves that Monsieur Nérisse has not altogether succeeded. Each of us is inclined to like only her own section. We've a girl here, Caroline Legrand, one of the staff, who's tremendously go - a - head. You should hear her on the subject of "Soap of the Sylphs" and "Oriental Balm."
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
It makes her furious?
#THERESE.
She's a sort of rampageous saint; ferocious and affectionate by turns, a bit ridiculous perhaps, but delightful and generous. She's so simple nasty people could easily make a fool of her, but all nice people like her.
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
Shall I have much to do with her?
#THERESE.
Not much. You'll be under Mademoiselle de Meuriot, and you'll be lucky. She's a dear. She's been sacrificing herself all her life. She's my great friend - the only one I have.
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
But how's this? Your contributors are all men. Gabriel de - , Camille de - , Claud de - , René de - , Marcel de -
#THERESE.
Well! I never noticed that before. They're the pen - names of our writers.
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
All men's names?
#THERESE.
Yes. People still think more of men as writers. You see they are names that might be either a man's or a woman's. Camille, René, Gabriel.
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
There's only one woman's name - Vicomtesse de Renneville.
#THERESE.
That's snobbery! It's Madame Nérisse's pen - name.
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
Well, I suppose it's good business.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
The post's come, Thérèse.
#THERESE.
This is Mademoiselle de Meuriot. Our new contributor.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
You're welcome, Mademoiselle.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Yes, dearest. Yes, dearest. Yes, dearest.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Come, my dear. I'll introduce you to the others. Ah! the post has come. Open the letters, Thérèse, will you?
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Yes, we will.
#MADAME NERISSE.
You first.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
I think our new friend was a bit amused. She's pretty.
#THERESE.
Yes, and she looks capable.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Let's get to work.
#THERESE.
Here!
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
And you? How are you this morning? You're tired, little girl. You sat up working last night.
#THERESE.
I wanted to finish copying out my manuscript. It took me ages, because I wanted to make it as clear as print.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
You know you mustn't be ill, Thérèse.
#THERESE.
How good you are, Mademoiselle, and how lucky I am to have you for a friend. What should I do without you?
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
How about your godmother?
#THERESE.
I didn't get on with her. She never could hide her dislike for me, and it burst out in the end. When she saw that in spite of everything she could say I was going to leave her, she let herself go and made a dreadful scene. And, what was worse, my good, kind godfather joined in! It seemed as if they thought my wanting to be independent was a direct insult to them. What a lot of letters there are to - day.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
It's the renewal of the subscriptions.
#THERESE.
Oh, is that it? So you see we parted, not exactly enemies - but, well - on our dignity. We write little letters to one another now, half cold and half affectionate. I tell you, without you I should be quite alone.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Not more alone than I am.
#THERESE.
I have someone to talk to now and tell my little worries to. It's not that, even. One always finds people ready to listen to you and pity you, but what one doesn't find is people one can tell one's most impossible dreams to and feel sure one won't be laughed at. That's real friendship. To dare to think out loud before another person and let her see the gods of one's secret idolatry, and to be sure one's not exposing one's precious things to blasphemy. How I love you for being like you are and for caring for me a little.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
I don't care for you a little, Thérèse! I care for you very much indeed. I like you because you're brave and hurl yourself against obstacles like a little battering ram, and because you're straight and honest and one can depend on you.
#THERESE.
Please pass me the scissors. Thanks. I might have been all those things, and it would have been no good at all, if you hadn't been able to see them.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Remember that in being friends with you I get as much as I give. My people were very religious and very proud of their title. I made up my mind to leave home, but since then I've been quite alone - alone for thirty years. I'm selfish in my love for you now. I've had so little of that sort of happiness.
#THERESE.
You've done so much for women. You've helped so many.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Here's another who won't renew.
#THERESE.
What will Madame Nérisse say? You know, Mademoiselle, it's not only success that I want. I have a great ambition. I should like to think that because I've lived there might be a little less suffering in the world. That's the sort of thing that I can say to nobody but you.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Thérèse has an ardent soul.
#THERESE.
Yes, Thérèse has an ardent soul. It was you who said that about me first, and I think I deserve it. Here's the subscriber's book. Like Guyan, I have more tears than I need to spend on my own sufferings, so I can give the spare ones to other people. And not only tears, but courage and consolation that I have no opportunity of using up myself. Do you understand what I mean?
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Yes, I understand, my dear. I see my own youth over again. Oh, I hope that you - but I don't want to rouse up those old ghosts; I should only distress you. Perhaps lives like mine are necessary, if it's only to throw into relief lives that are more beautiful than mine. Keep your lovely dreams. When I think that instead of being an old maid I might have been the mother of a girl like you!
#THERESE.
Don't cry.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
No, no, I won't; and when I think that somewhere or other there's a man you love!
#THERESE.
Some day or other I must tell you a whole lot of things about René.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Have you seen him again?
#THERESE.
Yes.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
But you were supposed not to meet any more.
#THERESE.
Yes, we were supposed not to meet any more. One says those things and then one meets all the same. If René had gone on being the feeble and lamentable young man that I parted from the Barberine evening, I should perhaps have never seen him again. You don't know what my René has done, do you now?
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
No.
#THERESE.
I've been looking forward so to telling you. Well, he's quite changed. He's become a different man. Oh, he's not a marvel of energy even yet, but he's not the helpless youth who was still feeding out of his father's hands at twenty - five.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
And how has this great improvement come about?
#THERESE.
You'll make me blush.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Was it for love of you?
#THERESE.
I think it was for love of me. Let me tell you. He wanted to see me again, and he waited at the door when I was coming out from my work, just as if I was a little milliner's assistant. And then he came back another evening, and then another. While we were walking from here to my place we chattered, and chattered, and chattered. We had more to say to each other than we'd ever had before, and I began to realize that his want of will and energy was more the result of always hanging on to his people than anything else. Then there came a crash. A most fortunate crash. His father formally ordered him not to see me again; threatened, if he did, to stop his allowance. What do you think my René did? He sent back the cheque his people had just given him with quite a nice, civil, respectful letter. Then he left his office and got a place in a business house at an absurdly small salary, and he's been working there ever since. He shocked all the other young men in the office by the way he stuck to it. He got gradually interested in what he had to do. He read it all up; the heads of the firm noticed him and were civil to him, and now they've sent him on important business to Tunis. And that's what he's done all for love of me! Now, don't you think I ought to care for him a little? Don't you?
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Yes, my dear. But then if he's in Tunis?
#THERESE.
Oh, he'll come back.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
And when will the wedding be?
#THERESE.
He's sure his people will give in in the end if he can make some money. We shall wait.
#BOY.
Here are this morning's manuscripts.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Put them with the others.
#BOY.
There was one lady was quite determined to see you herself. She said her article was most particular. It's among that lot.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Very well.
#BOY.
Mademoiselle Caroline Legrand is coming.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
Good - morning, Meuriot.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Good - morning, Caroline Legrand.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
It seems there's something new going on here.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
I believe there is, but I know nothing about it.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
I expect the paper's not going well, the jam hasn't hidden the pill. Even Madame Nérisse's thirtieth article upon divorce at the desire of one party hasn't succeeded in stirring up enthusiasm this time. She's been preaching up free love, but she really started the paper only because she thought it would help her to get the law changed and allow her to marry her "dearest."
#THERESE.
Mademoiselle Legrand, I have some news that will please you.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
Are all the men dead?
#THERESE.
No, not yet; but I've heard that in a small country town they're starting a Woman's Trade Union.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
It won't succeed. Women are too stupid.
#THERESE.
They've opened a special workshop there, and they're going to have work that's always been done by men done by women.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
That's splendid! A woman worker the more is a slave the less.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Are you quite sure of that?
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
Oh, don't you misunderstand me! Listen to this. A time will come when people will be as ashamed of having made women work as they are ashamed now of having kept slaves. But, until then -
#THERESE.
The employer is rather disturbed about it.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
He's quite right. Very soon there'll be a fierce reaction among the men about this cheap women's labor. There's going to be a new sex struggle - the struggle for bread. Man will use all his strength and all his cruelty to defend himself. There's a time coming when gallantry and chivalry will go by the board, I can tell you.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Oh, good - morning, Legrand. I'm glad you're here, I've been wanting to ask your advice about a new idea I want to start in Woman Free. A correspondence about getting up a league of society women -
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
What about the others?
#MADAME NERISSE.
- and smart people, who will undertake not to wear ornaments in their hats made of the wings or the plumage of birds.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
You're giving up Woman Free for Birds Free, then?
#MADAME NERISSE.
What do you mean?
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
You'd better make a league to do away with hats altogether as a protest against the sweating of the women who stitch the straw at famine prices and make the ribbon at next to nothing. I shall be more concerned for the fate of the sparrows when I haven't got to concern myself about the fate of sweated women.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Well, of course. That's the article we've got to write.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
Of course.
#MADAME NERISSE.
We'll write it in the form of a letter to a member of parliament - it had better be a man, because we're going to put him in the wrong - a member of parliament who wants to form the league I suggested. What you said about the sparrows will be a splendid tag at the end. Will you write it?
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
Rather! It's lucky you don't stick to your ideas very obstinately, because they can sometimes be improved upon. I think I shall write your paper for you in future.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Go along and send me in Mademoiselle Grégoire and Madame Chanteuil. They'll bother you, and I want them here.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
To write about "Soap of the Sylphs." I know.
#MADAME NERISSE.
She's a little mad, but she really has good ideas sometimes.
#BOY.
The gentlemen are there, Monsieur Cazarès and another gentleman.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Are they with Monsieur Nérisse?
#BOY.
Yes, Madame.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Very well, I'll go. Divide the work between you. There's lots of work to be done.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
We'd better sit down. This is for the advertising department. Is Mademoiselle Baron here?
#THERESE.
No, poor little thing. She's trudging round Paris to try and get hold of a few advertisements.
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
It's a dreadful job, trying to get advertisements for a paper that three - quarters of the people she goes to have never heard of. It gives me the shivers to remember what I had to go through myself over that job.
#THERESE.
And poor little Baron is so shy!
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
She earned only fifty francs all last month.
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
I know her, I met her lately; she told me she was in luck, that she had an appointment with the manager of the Institut de Jouvence.
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
And she thinks she's in luck!
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
It appears that that's a place where you can do quite good business.
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
Yes, young women can do business there if they're pretty; but have you any idea what price they pay? Nothing would induce me to put my foot inside the place again.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Oh, the poor little girl! Oh, dear!
#THERESE.
It seems to me our name Woman Free is horrible irony.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Oh, Chanteuil, what have you done? Here's somebody perfectly furious. She says she asked you to give her some information in the beauty column. It was something she was mistaken about. She wrote under the name of "Always Young," and apparently you've answered "Always Young is a mistake." She thinks you did it to insult her. You must write her a letter of apologies.
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
Yes, Mademoiselle.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
"Little Questions of Sentiment." This is for you, Thérèse. "I feel so sad because I am getting old," etc. Answer, "Why this sadness - "
#THERESE.
"White hairs are a crown of - "
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
"Astral Influences." Who is "Astral Influences"?
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
I am.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Here are two, three - one without a post office order. Put that one straight into the waste paper basket. Remember that you must always promise them luck, with little difficulties to give success more flavor. And be sure to tell them they're full of good qualities, with some little amiable weaknesses and the sort of defects one enjoys boasting about. "About using whites of eggs to take the sharpness out of sorrel," "To take out ink - stains." These are for you, dear.
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
Yes. I didn't think of that when I took my degree.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
"Stoutness"; that's for you too. What does this one want? Four pages; ah, here we are - "A slender figure - smaller hips - am not too stout anywhere else." That's for the doctor.
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
Iodiform soap.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
My dear, not at all, "Soap of the Sylphs."
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
But that's exactly the same thing.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
I know that. But it sounds so different. "A red nose" -
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
Lemon juice.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
"Superfluous hairs." Be sure to recommend the cream that gives us advertisements; don't make any mistake about that. "Black specks on the chin," "Wrinkles round the eyes."
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
There's no cure for that.
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
Tell her to go to bed early and alone.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
That's too easy, she wouldn't believe in it. Find something else. "To make them firm without enlarging them"; that's for you too. And all the rest I think. "To whiten the teeth," "To make the hair lighter," "To give firmness to the bust."
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
They're always asking that.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
"To enlarge the eyes," "get rid of wrinkles" - "and double chins" - "a clear complexion" - "to keep young" - ouf! That's all. No, here's one that wants white arms. They're all alike, poor women!
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
And all that to please men.
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
To please a man more than some other woman, and so to be fed, lodged, and kept by him.
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
Kept is the right word.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Ah, here's Mademoiselle Baron. Well? What luck?
#MADEMOISELLE BARON.
There's no one in the office. I've got the signed contract for the advertisements of the Institut de Jouvence. Now I must go on to the printers. Here it is. Good - bye.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Good - bye, my dear.
#THERESE.
Poor, poor little thing!
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Perhaps she has someone at home who's hungry.
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
I must go and see to the "Doctor's Page."
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
And I to the "Gleaner's Column."
#NERISSE.
Do as you like. I've told you my opinion. I wash my hands of it. When your draft is ready show it to me. Mademoiselle!
#THERESE.
Monsieur!
#NERISSE.
Listen. I have something to say to you. Did Madame Nérisse give you the letter of introduction I wrote for you?
#THERESE.
Yes, Monsieur. Please forgive me for not having thanked you before.
#NERISSE.
It's nothing.
#THERESE.
Indeed it's a great deal.
#NERISSE.
Nothing.
#THERESE.
Yes, I'm sure to be received quite differently with that letter from what I should be without it.
#NERISSE.
I can give you any number of letters like that. May I?
#THERESE.
No, thank you.
#NERISSE.
You won't let me?
#THERESE.
No.
#NERISSE.
Why?
#THERESE.
You know very well why.
#NERISSE.
You're still angry with me. You do yourself harm by the way you treat me, you do indeed. Listen, this is the sort of thing. Moranville, the editor of the review I was talking about, is going to meet me at my restaurant after dinner. I know he wants just such stories as you write. But Moranville reads only the manuscripts of people he knows - he has a craze about it. Well, I hardly dare propose to you a thing which nevertheless is perfectly natural among colleagues, to come and dine with me first and meet him after. I hardly like - You see, I'm right. You don't trust me.
#THERESE.
On the contrary, I'll go gladly. Madame Nérisse will be with you of course?
#NERISSE.
Madame Nérisse! Nonsense! Do you suppose I drag her everywhere I go? Say no more about it. Whatever I say will only make you suspicious. All this misunderstanding and suspicion is horrible to me. How stupid the world is! There are times when I feel disgusted with everything, myself included! I'm getting old. I'm a failure. I'm losing my time and wasting my life over this ridiculous paper, which will never be anything but an obscure rag. I shall have done for myself soon.
#THERESE.
Don't say that.
#NERISSE.
Yes, I shall. I might have a chance of saving myself yet if I took things energetically and got free of the whole thing. But I should have to be quick about it. I'm so low - so unhappy!
#THERESE.
So unhappy?
#NERISSE.
Yes. Are they gone?
#MADAME NERISSE.
Yes, they're gone.
#NERISSE.
Is it all settled?
#MADAME NERISSE.
Yes. I am to meet them at the bank at four. But they wouldn't give way on the question of reducing expenses as regards the contributors.
#NERISSE.
And the dates of publication?
#MADAME NERISSE.
We are to come out fortnightly instead of weekly. You must go and speak to them.
#NERISSE.
Is Thérèse's salary to be reduced too?
#MADAME NERISSE.
It would be impossible to make distinctions.
#NERISSE.
Difficult, yes. Still - I think one might have managed to do something for her.
#MADAME NERISSE.
I cannot see how she differs from the others. Can you?
#NERISSE.
Oh, well - say no more about it.
#MADAME NERISSE.
That will be best. I should think so indeed! While Monsieur Nérisse was talking to the other man I had a chat with Monsieur Cazarès. He was talking about you. He's a nice fellow, and it's quite a good family you know. He's steady and fairly well off - very well off.
#THERESE.
You talk as if you were offering me a husband!
#NERISSE.
And what would you say supposing he had asked me to sound you?
#THERESE.
I should say that I was very much obliged, but that I decline the honor.
#NERISSE.
What's wrong with him?
#THERESE.
Nothing.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Well then?
#THERESE.
You can't marry upon that.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Have you absolutely made up your mind?
#THERESE.
Absolutely.
#MADAME NERISSE.
I think you're making a mistake. I think it all the more because this chance comes just at a time - well, you'll understand what I mean when I've told you something that I have to say to you as manageress of Woman Free. It's this. You know that in spite of all we could do we've had to hunt about for more capital. We've found some, but we've had to submit to very severe conditions. The most important is that they insist upon a stringent cutting down of expenses. Instead of coming out every week, Woman Free will be a fortnightly in future, and we've been obliged to consent to reducing the salaries of the contributors in proportion.
#THERESE.
How much will they be reduced?
#MADAME NERISSE.
In proportion I tell you. They'll be cut down by one half.
#THERESE.
And I shall not have enough to live upon even in the simplest way.
#MADAME NERISSE.
That was exactly what I said to them. And the work will not be the same.
#THERESE.
My work will not be the same?
#MADAME NERISSE.
No; you will be obliged to work at night.
#THERESE.
At night?
#MADAME NERISSE.
Yes.
#THERESE.
But then I shall be free all day.
#MADAME NERISSE.
No, you won't. In the daytime you will have to take charge of the business part of the paper, and in the evening too your work will not be purely literary, but more of an administrative character.
#THERESE.
It appears to me that I'm asked to accept a smaller salary and to do double work for it.
#MADAME NERISSE.
I am conveying to you the offers of the new Directors; if they don't suit you, you have only to refuse them.
#THERESE.
Of course I refuse them, and you may say to the people who have made them that they must be shameful sweaters to dare to offer women salaries that leave them no choice between starvation and degradation.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Those are strong words, my dear, and you seem to forget very quickly -
#THERESE.
Yes. Oh, I beg your pardon. But think for a minute, Madame, and you'll forgive me for being angry. I hardly know what I'm saying. Listen, oh listen! Forget what I said just now; I'll explain to you. I accept the reduction of salary. I'll manage. I'll get my expenses down. Only I can't consent to give up all my time. You know I have some work in hand; you know I have a big undertaking to which I've given all my life. I've told you about it, you know about that. You know I can only stand my loneliness and everything because of the hope I have about this. If people take all my time, it's the same as if they killed me. I beg you, I implore you, get them to leave me my evenings free.
#MADAME NERISSE.
It can't be done.
#THERESE.
Very well, that's settled. I will go at the end of the month; that's to say to - morrow.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Take a little time to consider it.
#THERESE.
I have considered it. They propose that I should commit suicide. I say no!
#MADAME NERISSE.
I'm sorry, truly sorry. Go and call me a taxi, but first say to Monsieur Nérisse -
#BOY.
Monsieur Nérisse has just gone out, Madame.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Are you quite sure?
#BOY.
I called him a taxi.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Very well, you can go. I'll ask you for your final answer this evening. If you make up your mind to stay, make me these two bibliographies.
#MADEMOISELLE GREGOIRE.
Good - bye, all.
#THERESE.
Well, what do you think of this?
#MADAME CHANTEUIL AND CAROLINE LEGRAND.
It's an insult.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
You must try and keep quiet. What shall you do?
#THERESE.
I shall leave.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
You ought to stay.
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
No, Thérèse is right. We must all leave.
#THERESE.
We must leave to - morrow - no, this evening.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Do you think that you'll be able to make better terms anywhere else?
#THERESE.
That won't be difficult.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
You think so?
#THERESE.
Rather.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
Where, for instance?
#THERESE.
There are other papers in Paris besides this one.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Then you know a lot of others that pay better?
#THERESE.
One will be enough for me.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
And you think you'll find a place straight off? You know there are other people -
#THERESE.
I'll give lessons. I took my degree.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
Much good may it do you.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
You think you'll be a governess? At one time a governess could get 1,200 francs, now it's 650 francs - less than the cook. And if you were to be a companion -
#THERESE.
Why not a lady's maid at once?
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
Yes; lady's maid. That's not a bad idea. It's the only occupation a girl brought up as rich people bring up their daughters can be certain to get and to keep, if she's only humble enough.
#THERESE.
I shall manage to get along without taking to that.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
But, Thérèse, have you really been blind to all that's been going on here? Haven't you constantly seen unfortunate women, as well brought up and as well educated as yourself, coming hunting for work? Don't you remember that advertisement of the girl that Caroline Legrand was interested in? That advertisement has been appearing in the paper for the last three months. I'll read it to you. Here it is. "A young lady of distinguished appearance, who has taken a high certificate for teaching. Good musician. Drawing, English, shorthand, etc." I know that girl. She told me all about her life. D'you know what she's offered? She asked two francs an hour for teaching the piano. They laughed in her face, because for that they could get a girl who'd taken first prize at the Conservatoire. They gave her seventy - five centimes. Deduct from that seventy - five centimes the price of the journey in that underground, the wear and tear of clothes, the time lost in going and coming, and then what do you think is left?
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
Let's be just. She got answers from doubtful places abroad, letters from old satyrs, and invitations to pose for the "movies."
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
What's left then? The stage. It's quite natural you should think of the stage.
#THERESE.
If one must.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
If one must! You'd condescend to it, wouldn't you? You poor child!
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
You can't get into the Conservatoire after twenty - one. Are you under that? No. Are you a genius? No. Well then?
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
Have you a rich lover who will back you?
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
No. Then you'll get nothing at all in the theatres except by making friends with half a dozen men or selling yourself to one.
#THERESE.
I'll go into a shop. At any rate, when it shuts I shall be free.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
You think they're longing for you, don't you? You forget you'd have to know things for that one doesn't learn by taking a degree; things like shorthand and typewriting. Do you know there are twenty thousand women in Paris who want to get into shops and offices and can't find places?
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
I know exactly what's going to become of me.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
Now you're going to say something silly.
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
You think so, you've guessed. Well, I tell you, middle class girls thrown on the world as we are can't get along without a man - a husband or a lover. We haven't got the key of the prison door. We've not learned a trade. We've learned to smile, and dance, and sing - parlor tricks. All that's only of use in a love affair or a marriage. Without a man we're stranded. Our parents have brought us all up for one career and one only - the man. I was a fool not to understand before. Now I see.
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
Look here, you're not going to take a lover?
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
Suppose I am?
#CAROLINE LEGRAND.
My dear, you came here full of indignation, clamoring against the state of society. You called yourself a feminist, but you, and women like you, are feminists only when it's convenient. There are no real feminists except ugly women like me or old ones like Meuriot. You others come about us in a swarm and then drop away one after another to go off to some man. As soon as a lover condescends to throw the handkerchief you're up and off to him. You want to be slaves. Go, my dear, and take your lover. That's your fate. Good - night.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Don't listen to her, you poor child. Don't ruin all your life in a fit of despair.
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
I can't stay here. I'm not a saint and I'm not a fool. How can I live on what they offer to pay me?
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Stay for a little, while you're looking for something else.
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
Look for something else! Never! That means all the horrors I went through, before I came here, over again! No! no! no! Never! Looking for work means trailing through the mud, toiling up stairs, ringing bells, being told to call again, calling again to get more snubs. And then when one thinks one's found something one comes up against a door guarded by a man who's watching you, and who's got to be satisfied before you can get into the workroom, or the office, or the shop, or whatever it may be. And then you've got to begin again with somebody else and be snubbed again. No. Since it's an accepted, settled, decided thing that the only career for a woman is to satisfy the passions of a man, I prefer the one I've chosen myself.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
And what if he goes off and leaves you with a baby?
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
Well, I'll bring it up. I shan't be the first. Women do it. It happens to one in every five in Paris. Ask Mademoiselle de Meuriot, the old maid, if she wouldn't be glad to have one now? When one grows old it's better to have had a child in that way than not to have had one at all. Ask her if I'm not telling the truth. Ask her if she's happy in her loneliness.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Oh, it's true - it's true! Sometimes -
#THERESE.
Oh, Mademoiselle, dear Mademoiselle!
#MADAME CHANTEUIL.
Good - bye, Mademoiselle. Good - bye, Thérèse.
#MADEMOISELLE DE MEURIOT.
Wait, wait. I'm going with you. I am not going to leave you just now.
#NERISSE.
My dear child, I have news for you. Pleasant news, I think.
#THERESE.
Have you?
#NERISSE.
One little smile, please, or I shall tell you nothing.
#THERESE.
I assure you smiling is the last thing I feel like.
#NERISSE.
If you only knew what I've been doing for you, you wouldn't receive me so unkindly.
#THERESE.
You can do nothing for me. Will you please leave me alone?
#NERISSE.
I don't deserve to be spoken to like that, Thérèse. Listen; we must come to an understanding. I know you're angry with me still about what happened last month. I promised you then I would say no more. Have I kept my word?
#THERESE.
Yes, you have.
#NERISSE.
Will you always be angry? Is it quite impossible for us to be friends? I am constantly giving you proofs of my friendship. I've done two things for you quite lately. The first was that letter to the editor you're going to see to - morrow, and the second is what I've done now with our new backer. It's this. They wanted to sack you or to offer you humiliating conditions. I said if you didn't stay I wouldn't stay either. I gave in on other points to get my way about this. I shall have their final answer to - morrow, and I know I shall succeed if I stick to my point.
#THERESE.
But what right had you to do such a thing? We agreed to forget altogether that you had dared to make love to me. D'you really not understand how that makes it impossible I should ever accept either assistance or protection from you?
#NERISSE.
I have still the right to love you in secret.
#THERESE.
Indeed you have not, and you've kept your secret precious badly. Madame Nérisse suspects, and I can see quite well that she's jealous of me. I owe her a great deal; she gave me my first start and got me my place here. I wouldn't make her unhappy for anything in the world. As soon as she hears of what you've done what d'you suppose she'll think?
#NERISSE.
I don't care a rap what she thinks.
#THERESE.
But I care very much. You've compromised me seriously.
#NERISSE.
Compromised you! Aha, yes, there's the word! Oh, you middle class girls! Always the same! What are you doing here then? What d'you know about life? Nothing. Compromised! Then all your dreams of elevating humanity, all your ambitions, your career, the realization of yourself - you'll give up all that before you'll be what you describe by that stupid, imbecile, middle class word, compromised. When you shook yourself free of your family you behaved like a capable woman. Now you're behaving and thinking like a fashionable doll. Isn't that true? I appeal to your intelligence, to your mind, to everything in you that lifts you out of the ordinary ruck. Your precious word compromised is only the twaddle of a countrified miss. Don't you see that yourself?
#THERESE.
Ah, if I were only certain that you are hiding nothing behind your friendship and your sympathy!
#NERISSE.
Hiding? You said hiding? Is that what you throw in my face? You insult me? What d'you take me for?
#THERESE.
I beg your pardon.
#NERISSE.
What kind of assurance do you want me to give you? Do you believe in nothing? Is it quite impossible for you to feel frankly and naturally, and to say "I have confidence in you, and I accept your friendship" - a friendship offered to you perfectly honestly and loyally? It really drives one to despair.
#THERESE.
Well, yes. I say it.
#NERISSE.
Thank you. Oh, Thérèse, I love you, how I love you!
#THERESE.
Oh, this is abominable. You set a trap for me, and my vanity made me fall into it.
#NERISSE.
I implore you to let me tell you about myself. I'm so miserable and lonely when you're away.
#THERESE.
I know quite well what you want to say to me, and it all amounts to this: you love me. It's quite clear, and I answer you just as clearly: I do not love you.
#NERISSE.
I'm so unhappy!
#THERESE.
If it's true that you're unhappy because I don't love you, that is a misfortune for you; a misfortune for which I am not in any way responsible, because you certainly cannot accuse me of having encouraged you.
#NERISSE.
I don't ask you to love me - yet. I ask you to allow me to try and win your love.
#THERESE.
Don't dare to say that again. If you were an honorable man, you couldn't possibly have said these things to me to - day when my living depends upon you. You know the position I'm in, and you know that if I don't stay here, there are only two courses open to me - to go and live at the expense of my godmother, which I will not do, or to take the chances of a woman alone looking for work in Paris. Don't you understand that speaking about your love for me to - day is the same as driving me into the street?
#NERISSE.
If you go into the street, it is by your own choice.
#THERESE.
Exactly. There's the old, everlasting, scandalous bargain. Sell yourself or you shall starve. If I give in, I can stay; if I don't -
#NERISSE.
I didn't say so. But clearly my efforts to help you will be greater if I know that I'm working for my friend.
#THERESE.
You actually confess it! You think yourself an honorable man, and you don't see that what you're doing is the vilest of crimes.
#NERISSE.
Now I ask you. Did I wait for your answer before I began to defend you and to help you?
#THERESE.
No, but you believe I shall give in through gratitude or fear. Well, don't count upon it. Even if I have to kill myself in the end, I shall never sell myself, either to you or to anyone else. Then that's what it comes to. Wherever we want to make our way, to have the right to work and to live, we find the door barred by a man who says, Give yourself or starve. Because one's on one's own, because they know that there's not another man to start up and defend his property! It's almost impossible to believe human beings can be so vile to one another. For food! Just for food! Because they know we shall starve if we don't give in. Because we have old people, or children at home who are waiting for us to bring them food, men put this vile condition to us, to do like the girls in the streets. It's shameful, shameful, shameful. It's enough to make one shriek out loud with rage and despair.
#NERISSE.
I've never asked you to sell yourself. I ask you to love me.
#THERESE.
I shall never love you.
#NERISSE.
You'll never love. Neither me nor others. Listen -
#THERESE.
I -
#NERISSE.
Wait; I insist upon speaking. You will never love, you say. You will live alone all your life. You're foolish and self - confident enough to think that you can do without a man's affection.
#THERESE.
But I -
#NERISSE.
I must try to make you understand your folly. These efforts you're making to escape from the ordinary life of affection are useless, and it's lucky for you they are useless. You can't live without love.
#THERESE.
Why?
#NERISSE.
All lonely people are wretched. But the lonely woman is twice, a hundred times more wretched than the man. You've no idea what it is. It's to pass all your life under suspicion, yes, suspicion. The world never believes that people live differently from others unless they have secret reasons, and the world always says that secret reasons are shameful reasons. And that's not all. Think of the lonely room where you may cry without anyone to hear you. Think of illness where to your bodily pain is added the mental torture of the fear of dying all alone. Think of the empty heart, the empty arms always, always. And in old age, more wretchedness in the regret for a wasted life. And for what and for whom are you making this sacrifice? For a convention; for a morality that nobody really believes in. Who'll think the better of you for it? People won't even believe in your honesty. They will find explanations for it that would make you die of shame if you knew them. Is that what you want, Thérèse? I am unhappy. Love me. Oh, if you only -
#THERESE.
Please spare me your confidences.
#NERISSE.
You think this is only a caprice on my part. You are mistaken. I ask you to share my life.
#THERESE.
I will never be your mistress.
#NERISSE.
You're proud and you're strong. You insist upon marriage. Very well. I agree.
#THERESE.
I will not have you! I will not have you!
#NERISSE.
Why? Tell me why.
#THERESE.
I will tell you why; and then, I hope, I shall have done with you. You're right in one way. I believe I should not be able to live all alone. I should be too unhappy. But at least I'll keep my right of choice. If ever I give myself to anyone, it will be to someone I love. And I love him, I love him!
#NERISSE.
You have a lover! If that's true -
#THERESE.
Oh, have I got to the bottom of your vulgar, hateful little soul? If there ever was any danger of my giving in, your expression then would have saved me. You never thought there could be anything better. A lover! No, I have no lover. I have a love.
#NERISSE.
I don't see so very much difference.
#THERESE.
I know you don't, and that shows what you are. This is the one love of my life, my love for my betrothed. I lost my money and that separated us, but we found each other again. It's unhappy to be separated, but we bear our unhappiness out of respect for what you call prejudices, because we know how our defying them would hurt those we love. You think me ridiculous, but you cannot imagine how utterly indifferent I am. I am waiting, we are waiting, with perfect trust and love. Now d'you understand that I'm perfectly safe from you? Go!
#NERISSE.
How dare you say that to me, Thérèse? How dare you bring such a picture before me? I will not allow you to belong to another man.
#THERESE.
No, no, don't dare! Don't touch me! don't dare to touch me!
#NERISSE.
Forgive me. I'm out of my mind. I don't know what I'm doing.
#THERESE.
Will you go? I've work to do.
#NERISSE.
Yes, I'll go. I want to ask you - you won't leave us?
#THERESE.
You dare to say that? You think I'll expose myself a second time to a scene like this. Yes! I shall leave, and leave to - night! Will you go?
#NERISSE.
I implore you. Here she is! Control yourself, I beg of you. Don't tell her.
#THERESE.
You needn't be afraid.
#MADAME NERISSE.
What's going on here?
#NERISSE.
Mademoiselle Thérèse says that she's going to leave us, and I tried to make her understand - perhaps you could do something - I must go out.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Yes. Go.
#MADAME NERISSE.
You wish to leave us?
#THERESE.
Yes, Madame.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Because Monsieur Nérisse - ?
#THERESE.
Yes, Madame.
#MADAME NERISSE.
What can I say to you?
#THERESE.
Nothing, Madame.
#MADAME NERISSE.
My poor child.
#THERESE.
I don't want pity. Don't be unhappy about me. I shall be able to manage for myself. I have plenty of courage.
#MADAME NERISSE.
I'm so ashamed to let you go like this. How honest and loyal you are! I was honest too, once.
#THERESE.
Good - bye, Madame.
#MADAME NERISSE.
Good - bye, Thérèse.
#GUERET.
I tell you Duriot's men are coming out on strike.
#FELIAT.
And I ask you, what's that to me?
#GUERET.
Ours will do the same.
#FELIAT.
Oh no, they won't.
#GUERET.
You'll see.
#FELIAT.
Duriot's men are furious with the women because of what happened last year.
#GUERET.
They say woman's the enemy in business.
#FELIAT.
Let 'em talk.
#GUERET.
They want Duriot to sack all his women.
#FELIAT.
And I've told you why. There's no danger of anything like that happening here.
#GUERET.
You think so, do you? Well, you'll see.
#FELIAT.
We shall see.
#GUERET.
You'll give in only after they've broken two or three of your machines as they did Duriot's, or done something worse, perhaps.
#FELIAT.
My dear Guéret, I get out of the women for a cent what I have to pay the men three cents for. And as long as I can economize ten cents on the piece I shall go on.
#GUERET.
You'll regret it. If I was in your place -
#FELIAT.
Well, what would you do if you were in my place?
#GUERET.
What should I do?
#FELIAT.
Yes, what?
#GUERET.
I shouldn't take long to think. I'd cut off a finger to save my hand, I'd turn out every one of the women to - morrow.
#FELIAT.
You're mad. You've always objected to my employing women, and I know very well why.
#GUERET.
Well, let's hear why.
#FELIAT.
You want to know. Well, because you've been jealous of Thérèse ever since she came here six months ago.
#GUERET.
Oh, I say!
#FELIAT.
That's it; my sister can't endure her.
#GUERET.
Marguerite -
#FELIAT.
You know she wouldn't even see her when she came down from Paris; and if Thérèse got work here, it was in spite of Marguerite. I was wiser than you about this. The girl's courage appealed to me. She's plucky and intelligent. Oh, I don't want to make myself out cleverer than I am. I took her a bit out of pity, and I thought she'd draw me a few designs; that was all I expected. But she has energy and initiative. She organized the two workrooms, and now she's got the whole thing into order by starting this Union.
#GUERET.
The Hen's Union.
#FELIAT.
What?
#GUERET.
That's what the men call her Union. You should hear the things they say about it.
#FELIAT.
Well, long live the Hen's Union! A hen's plucky when it has to be.
#GUERET.
Seriously, it's just this Union which has annoyed the men. They feel it's dangerous.
#FELIAT.
Very well. I'll be ready for them.
#GUERET.
I'll go and find out what's going on.
#FELIAT.
Yes, do.
#THERESE.
I've just been seeing the man who makes our finishing tools. He says it's perfectly easy to make a tool from the drawing I did that won't be more expensive than the old one. Here's the drawing. You see I've thought of cheapness, but I've not sacrificed utility. After all, it's only a copy of a Grolier, just a little altered.
#FELIAT.
Very good, but what will the price come out at?
#THERESE.
How much do you think.
#FELIAT.
I can easily do it.
#THERESE.
The beating won't be done with a hammer, but in the rolling machine; the sawing - in and the covering will be done as usual.
#FELIAT.
Two francs forty.
#THERESE.
One franc seventy. You've calculated on the basis of men's work. But, if you approve, I'll open a new workroom for women in the old shop. Lucienne can manage it. I could let Madame Princeteau take Lucienne's present place, and I'll turn out the stuff at the price I quoted.
#FELIAT.
But that's first - rate. I give you an absolutely free hand.
#THERESE.
Thank you, Monsieur Féliat.
#FELIAT.
How do you think the men will take it? You know that last year, before you came here, a strike of the workmen was broken by the women taking the work the men were asking a rise for - taking it at lower wages, too. Since then the men feel very strongly against the women. Your godfather is anxious about it.
#THERESE.
Oh, leave it to me, I'm not afraid.
#FELIAT.
Well done. I like pluck. Go ahead. How lucky I was to get you here.
#THERESE.
How grateful I am to you for believing in me. And how good you are, too, to have given work to poor Lucienne. When I think what you saved her from! She really owes her life to you. At any rate she owes it to you that she's living respectably.
#FELIAT.
Well, I owe you ten per cent reduction on my general expenses. Then that's agreed? You're going ahead?
#THERESE.
Yes, Monsieur.
#FELIAT.
I'll go and give the necessary orders.
#THERESE.
It's all right. It's done. He's agreed! I'm to have my new workroom, and you're to be the head of it.
#LUCIENNE.
Oh, splendid! Then I'm really of some importance here at last. Oh dear, how happy I am. I'd never have believed I could have enjoyed the smell of a bindery so. Glue, and white of egg, and old leather; it's lovely! Oh, Thérèse, what you did for me in bringing me here! What I owe you! That's what a woman's being free means; it means a woman who earns her own living.
#THERESE.
Oh, you're right! Isn't it splendid, Lucienne, ten wretched women saved, thanks to our new workshop. I've seen Duriot's forewoman. At any moment fifty women from there may be out of work. I can take on only ten at present, and I've had to choose. That was dreadful! Thirty of them are near starvation. I took the worst cases: the old maids, the girls with babies, the ones whose husbands have gone off and left them, the widows. Every one of those, but for me, would have been starved or gone on the streets. I used to want to write books and realize my dreams that way. Now I can realize them by work. I wish Caroline Legrand could know what I'm doing. It was she who helped me to get over my silly pride, and come and ask for work here.
#LUCIENNE.
Dear Caroline Legrand! Without her! Without you! What d'you suppose happened to me this morning? I had a visit from Monsieur Gambard.
#THERESE.
Another visit! I shall be jealous!
#LUCIENNE.
You've reason. For the last week that excellent old man has come every single morning with a book for me to bind. I begged him not to take so much trouble, and I told him that if he had more work for us to do, we could send for the books to his house. What d'you think he did to - day?
#THERESE.
I've no idea.
#LUCIENNE.
He asked me to marry him.
#THERESE.
My dear! What then?
#LUCIENNE.
Why, then I told him that I was married and separated from my husband.
#THERESE.
There's such a thing as divorce.
#LUCIENNE.
Naughty girl! That's exactly what he said. I told him that my first experience of marriage was not calculated to make me run the chances of a second. And then he asked me to be his mistress.
#THERESE.
Indignation of Lucienne!
#LUCIENNE.
No! I really couldn't be angry. He offered so naïvely to settle part of his fortune upon me that I was disarmed. I simply told him I was able to earn my own living, so I was not obliged to sell myself.
#THERESE.
And he went off?
#LUCIENNE.
And he went off.
#THERESE.
Was that three o'clock that struck.
#LUCIENNE.
Yes, but there's nothing very extraordinary in that.
#THERESE.
Not for you, perhaps. But I made up my mind not to think about a certain thing until it was three o'clock. I stuck to it - almost - not very easily. Well, my dear, three o'clock to - day is a most solemn hour in my life.
#LUCIENNE.
You don't say so!
#THERESE.
I do. Lucienne, I am so happy. I don't know how I can have deserved to be as happy as I am.
#LUCIENNE.
Good gracious, what's happened in the last five minutes?
#THERESE.
I'll tell you. One hour ago René arrived at Evreux. He's come back from Tunis. Come back a success and a somebody. And now -
#VINCENT.
Good - morning, Mademoiselle Thérèse. I want a word with you, because it's you who engages -
#THERESE.
Not the workmen.
#VINCENT.
I know. But it's about a woman, about my wife.
#THERESE.
Your wife? But I don't want your wife.
#VINCENT.
I heard as how you were taking on hands.
#THERESE.
Yes, but I choose them carefully. First of all I take the ones who need work or are not wanted at home.
#VINCENT.
You're quite right - but I ain't asking you to pay my old woman very much - not as much as a man.
#THERESE.
Why not, if she does the same work?
#VINCENT.
Well, in the first place, she's only a woman; and, besides, if you didn't make a bit out of it, you wouldn't take her in the place of a man.
#THERESE.
But you get excellent wages here yourself. You can live without forcing your wife to work.
#VINCENT.
Well, anyhow, her few halfpence would be enough to pay for my tobacco.
#LUCIENNE.
Come, you don't smoke as much as all that.
#VINCENT.
Besides, it'll put a bit more butter on the bread.
#THERESE.
But your wife will take the place of another woman who hasn't even dry bread perhaps.
#VINCENT.
Oh, if one was bothering all the time about other people's troubles, you'd have enough to do!
#THERESE.
Now will you forgive me if I meddle a little in what isn't exactly my business?
#VINCENT.
Oh, go on, you won't upset me.
#THERESE.
What d'you do when you leave the works? You go to the saloon?
#VINCENT.
That's yer game, is it! You take me for a regler soaker. That's a bit too thick, that is. You can go and ask for yourself in all the saloons round here. Blimey, sometimes I don't drink nothing but water for a week on end! Can you find anybody as has ever seen me blue - blind - paralytic - eh? I'm one of the steady ones, I am. I has a tiddley in the morning, like every man as is a man, to keep out the fog; then I has a Vermouth before lunch, and a drop of something short after, just to oil the works like - and that's the bloomin' lot. Of course you're bound to have a Pernod before dinner to get your appetite up; and if I go for a smoke and a wet after supper, well, it's for the sake of a bit of company.
#THERESE.
Well, that's a franc a day you might have saved. franc.
#THERESE.
Add it up.
#VINCENT.
Oh, I'll take your word for it. I ain't much good at sums.
#THERESE.
With that franc you might have put a fine lot of butter on every round of bread.
#VINCENT.
Well, look here, I want a bicycle.
#THERESE.
Why? You live five minutes' walk from here.
#VINCENT.
Yes, but I want to get about a bit on Sundays.
#THERESE.
There's one thing you haven't thought of. You have two little children. Who'll look after them if your wife comes to work here?
#VINCENT.
Don't you worry about that. You takes 'em all dirty to the crèche every morning and gets 'em back in the evenin' all tidied up.
#THERESE.
And who's going to get supper ready?
#VINCENT.
Why, the old woman when she comes back from work.
#THERESE.
While you take your little drink?
#VINCENT.
Oh, yes; I shan't hurry her up too much.
#THERESE.
Who'll mend your clothes?
#VINCENT.
Why, the old woman of course.
#THERESE.
When?
#VINCENT.
On Sundays.
#THERESE.
While you go off for a run on the bicycle?
#VINCENT.
Yes; it'll be a change for her. And at night I'll take her to see me play billiards. That's all settled, ain't it?
#THERESE.
Indeed, it's not.
#VINCENT.
Why not? Aren't you going to open a new workroom?
#THERESE.
Your wife has no need to work.
#VINCENT.
What's that got to do with you? You're taking on the others.
#THERESE.
The others are in want.
#VINCENT.
That's nothing to me. You ought to take the wives of the chaps as works here first.
#THERESE.
All I can do is to mention her name at the next meeting of our Union.
#VINCENT.
Oh, damn your Union - it's a fair nuisance! Union is always a nuisance to somebody.
#VINCENT.
And you'll ask your Union not to take my old woman?
#THERESE.
I certainly shall.
#VINCENT.
Very well. Things was more comfortable here before you come from Paris, you know.
#THERESE.
I'm sorry.
#VINCENT.
And they'll be more comfortable when you take your hook back.
#THERESE.
That won't be for a good while yet.
#VINCENT.
I ain't so damned sure about that! Good - afternoon.
#THERESE.
Good - afternoon.
#LUCIENNE.
You've made an enemy, my dear.
#THERESE.
I don't care as long as I'm able to prevent women being driven to work to pay for their husbands' idleness and drunkenness.
#FELIAT.
Tell me, Mademoiselle, if there was a strike here, could you count upon your workwomen?
#THERESE.
I'm sure I could.
#FELIAT.
Are you certain none of them would go back on you?
#THERESE.
Two or three married women might if their husbands threatened them.
#FELIAT.
Will you try, in a quiet way, to find out about that?
#THERESE.
Yes, certainly.
#FELIAT.
Look here, it seems that Duriot has just had a visit from two delegates from the Central Committee in Paris, who were sent down to protest against the engagement of women. I'm afraid we're going to have trouble here.
#THERESE.
The conditions here are very different from those at Duriot's.
#FELIAT.
All the same, find out what you can.
#THERESE.
I will, at once.
#FELIAT.
Whatever happens we must send off that Brazilian order. How is it getting on?
#THERESE.
We shall have everything ready in three days. I'll go and inquire about the other thing.
#FELIAT.
Good.
#GUERET.
Three days isn't the end of the world. I think I can promise you to keep my men as long as that.
#FELIAT.
If it's absolutely necessary, one might make them some little concessions.
#GUERET.
I'll do all I can.
#FELIAT.
Yes. And if they're too exacting, we'll let them go, and the women shall get the stuff finished up for us. Come in.
#GUERET.
Hullo!
#FELIAT.
René!
#GUERET.
You or your ghost?
#FELIAT.
Where do you come from? Nobody's heard of you for a hundred years.
#RENE.
Come now, only six months, and you've had some news.
#FELIAT.
Where are you from last?
#RENE.
From Tunis.
#GUERET.
And what are you doing here?
#RENE.
I'll tell you all about it. I want to have a bit of a talk with you.
#FELIAT.
Well, we're listening.
#GUERET.
You're mighty solemn about it.
#RENE.
It's extremely serious business.
#FELIAT.
Don't be tragic. You're here safe and sound; and you've not lost money, because you'd none to lose.
#RENE.
I've come to marry Thérèse.
#GUERET.
Well, I must say you don't beat about the bush.
#FELIAT.
But it's to your own people you've got to say that. What the devil - ! Thérèse has no more money than she had a year ago. So -
#RENE.
I'll marry her in spite of them.
#GUERET.
Well, we've nothing to do with it.
#RENE.
Yes, but I don't want to marry her in spite of you.
#FELIAT.
Nor in spite of herself.
#RENE.
I'm certain she won't say no.
#FELIAT.
But a year ago you solemnly separated; you both agreed everything was over.
#RENE.
Nothing was over. A year ago I was a fool.
#GUERET.
To the point again.
#FELIAT.
And what are you now?
#RENE.
At any rate I am not quite useless any longer. I'm not a boy now, obliged to do what he's told because he's perfectly incapable of doing for himself.
#FELIAT.
Have you found something to do?
#RENE.
I'm in phosphates.
#FELIAT.
And what the devil are you in phosphates?
#RENE.
Representative.
#FELIAT.
How do you mean? commercial traveller, as father said with great contempt.
#GUERET.
Well, it was not with a view to that sort of future that he had you called to the Bar.
#RENE.
At the Bar I could have earned my own living in about ten years - possibly. When I had to give up marrying Thérèse I saw how useless I was. Thanks to her I found myself out. She gave me a bit of her own courage. She woke up my self - respect. Besides, after that I had something to work for, an aim, and I seemed to understand why I was alive. I worked and read a lot; my firm noticed me; they sent me to Tunis. I asked them to let me give up clerk work and have a try on my own. Over there I got into touch with three small firms. I placed their goods. I earn four hundred francs a month. Next year I mean to start a little branch in this district where we will manufacture superphosphates. From now until then I shall travel about the district and try and get customers; and my wife - and Thérèse - will go on with her work here, if you will be so good as to keep her.
#GUERET.
Ouf! Think of a young man who can talk as long as that, without taking breath, giving up the Bar. What a pity!
#FELIAT.
Have you told all that to your people?
#RENE.
Yes. They're not at all proud of my business. And after refusing to let me marry Thérèse because she had no money they won't let me marry her now because she works for her living. To be directress of a bindery, even of your bindery, uncle, is not distinguished enough for them.
#FELIAT.
Well, my boy, you certainly couldn't have stood up to things like that a year ago. What d'you want us to do for you? Thérèse doesn't want our consent to marry; nor do you.
#FELIAT.
You're looking at Mother Bougne. Good - morning, Mother Bougne.
#MOTHER BOUGNE.
Good - morning, Monsieur Féliat.
#FELIAT.
When does the Committee of your Union sit?
#MOTHER BOUGNE.
On Wednesday, Monsieur Féliat.
#FELIAT.
You won't miss it, will you?
#MOTHER BOUGNE.
I haven't missed one up to now, Monsieur Féliat.
#FELIAT.
That's right. We call Mother Bougne our Minister of the Interior, because she tries to keep the place tidy. She's been a weaver near Rouen since she was eight years old; she's been stranded here.
#RENE.
And she's a member of the Committee of the Union?
#GUERET.
Yes, she's a member. Thérèse insisted on it. When Thérèse founded a Woman's Trade Union here she had the nice idea of including among them this poor old creature, wrecked by misery and hard work. Our Thérèse has ideas like that. But business, business. What do you want us to do for you?
#RENE.
I've come to ask you two things. The first is to try to get round my people.
#FELIAT.
Well, I'll try. But I know your father. He's even more obstinate than I am myself. I shan't make the smallest impression upon him. What else?
#RENE.
I want to have a talk with Thérèse in your presence.
#FELIAT.
In our presence! Now listen, my boy. Our presence will be much more useful in the work rooms. We have our hands full here. You've dropped in just at the point of a split between workmen and employers. Besides, to tell you the truth, I think I know pretty well what you have to say to Thérèse. I'll send her to you. And, look here, don't keep her too long, because she's got her hands full too. Will you go and telephone to Duriot's?
#GUERET.
Yes, there might be some news.
#FELIAT.
And I'll send Thérèse here.
#THERESE.
How do you do, René?
#RENE.
How are you, Thérèse?
#THERESE.
That'll do; don't, René dear. Don't. Let's talk. Have you seen your people?
#RENE.
Yes.
#THERESE.
Well?
#RENE.
Well, Thérèse, they won't come to our wedding.
#THERESE.
They still refuse their consent?
#RENE.
We can do without it.
#THERESE.
But they refuse it?
#RENE.
Yes. Forgive me, my dearest, for asking you to take just my own self. Do you love me enough to marry me quite simply, without any relations, since I leave my relations for your sake?
#THERESE.
My dear, we mustn't do that; we must wait.
#RENE.
No, I won't wait. I won't lose the best time of my life, and years of happiness, for the sake of prejudices I don't believe in. Do you remember what you said to me the night we played Barberine? You were splendid. You said: "Marry me all the same, in spite of my poverty." Oh, let me - please let me go on! I was only a miserable weakling then, I was frightened about the future. But you roused me and set me going. If I'm a man now, it's to you I owe it. Thanks to you I know how splendid it is to trust one's self and struggle, and hope, and succeed. Now I can come to you and say: "I am the man you wanted me to be, let us marry and live together." Oh, together, together! How splendid it sounds! Do you remember how you said that night long ago: "Let us conquer our place in the world together"?
#THERESE.
Oh, René! René! We must wait!
#RENE.
Why? Why must we wait? What possible reason can you have for not doing now what you wanted me to do a year ago? Don't you believe in me?
#THERESE.
Oh yes, yes. It's not that!
#RENE.
What is it then? Thérèse, you frighten me. It seems as if you were hiding something from me.
#THERESE.
No, no. What an idea!
#RENE.
Is it - oh, can it be that you don't love me so much?
#THERESE.
Oh, René, no, no. Don't think that for a moment.
#RENE.
But you're not being straight with me. You're hiding something.
#THERESE.
Don't ask me.
#RENE.
Thérèse!
#THERESE.
Oh, please don't ask me!
#RENE.
Now, you know very well that's impossible. How can there be secrets between us? You and I are the sort of people who are straight with one another. I must have my share in everything that makes you unhappy.
#THERESE.
Well, then, I must tell you. It's about your father and mother. Oh, how I wish I needn't tell you. René, while you've been away your people have been dreadful to me. Your father came here to see me. He wanted me to swear never to see you again - never. Of course I wouldn't. When I refused to give in he said it was through worldly wisdom. He said: "If he wasn't going to inherit my money, you wouldn't hang on to him like this." He dared to say that to me, René - your father whom I have always wanted to respect and love. He thought that of me. And then I swore to him, and I've sworn to myself, that I'll never marry you, never, without his consent. I cannot be suspected of that. You understand, don't you? The poorer I am the prouder I ought to be. My dear - my dear! How unhappy I am! How dreadfully unhappy I am!
#RENE.
My darling!
#THERESE.
Don't, René! I couldn't help telling you. But you understand, my dearest, that we've got to wait until he knows me better. No. We will not wait.
#THERESE.
I'll never break my word.
#RENE.
What d'you want us to wait for? A change of opinion that'll probably never come. And our youth will go, we shall have spoilt our lives. You want to send me back to Paris all alone and unhappy, to spend long silent evenings thinking about you and suffering from not being with you, while you, here, will be suffering in the same way, in the same loneliness. And we love each other, and it absolutely depends only on ourselves whether we shall change our double unhappiness for a double joy. I can't stand it, Thérèse. I've loved you for two years, and all this last year I've toiled and slaved to win you. I want you.
#THERESE.
Oh, hush, hush!
#RENE.
I want you. You're the one woman I've loved in my life. My love for you is my life. I can't give up my life. Listen: I have to be in Paris this evening; are you going to let me leave you broken - hearted?
#THERESE.
Do you think that I'm not broken - hearted?
#RENE.
I shan't suffer any the less because I know that you're suffering too.
#THERESE.
It doesn't depend upon us.
#RENE.
It depends entirely upon us. Look here, if people refuse to let us marry, our love for each other is strong enough to do without marriage. Thérèse, come with me!
#THERESE.
Oh, René, René! What are you asking me to do?
#RENE.
Have you faith in me? Look at me. Do you think I'm sincere? Do you think I'm an honest man? Do you think that, if people refuse to let us go through a ridiculous ceremony together, our union will be any the less durable? Is it the ceremony that makes it real? Thérèse, come with me. Come this evening; let's go together; let's love each other. Oh, if you loved me as much as I love you, you wouldn't hesitate for a second.
#THERESE.
Oh, don't say that, I implore you!
#RENE.
Then you don't trust me?
#THERESE.
I won't do it. I won't do it.
#RENE.
What prevents you? You're absolutely alone, you have no relations. You owe nothing to anybody. No one will suffer for your action. You've already given a year of your life to the foolish prejudices of society. You've shown them respect enough. First they prevented our marriage because you were poor; now they want to prevent it because you work. Thanks to you I have been able to assert myself and get free. My father and mother can keep their money. I don't want it. Come.
#THERESE.
You're torturing me. Oh, my dear, you're making me most unhappy. I could never do that, never. Don't be angry with me. I love you. I swear that I love you.
#RENE.
I love you, Thérèse. I swear that I love you. All my life is yours. Don't make me so unhappy. The more unhappy, the more I love you.
#THERESE.
I couldn't do it.
#FELIAT.
Hullo! Was it to make her cry like that that you wanted to see her? Is that what you've learnt "in phosphates"? Don't, my dear. You! Is it you I find crying like a little schoolgirl? Oh, I understand all about it. But his father will give in in the end. And you, René, be reasonable, don't hurry things.
#RENE.
But I want -
#FELIAT.
No, no, for goodness' sake, not just now. We'll talk about it later on. Just now we have other fish to fry. We're in a fix, my young lover. We've got to face some very serious difficulties. Go along with you.
#GUERET.
One of the delegates of the Central Committee is outside.
#FELIAT.
And what does the brute want?
#GUERET.
He wishes to speak to the Chairman of the Women's Union.
#FELIAT.
Oh, ask the gentleman in. My boy, you must be off. I'll see you presently.
#RENE.
Yes, presently.
#THERESE.
Be at the station half an hour before the train goes. I'll be there to say good - bye.
#FELIAT.
Good - morning. What can I do for you?
#DELEGATE.
I am a delegate from the Central Committee in Paris.
#FELIAT.
I am Monsieur Féliat, the owner of these works. I'm at your service.
#DELEGATE.
It's not to you I wish to speak. This is a question which doesn't concern you.
#FELIAT.
Which doesn't concern me!
#DELEGATE.
Not at present, at any rate. Will you kindly tell me where I can find the person I have come to see?
#FELIAT.
I - She is here.
#DELEGATE.
Mademoiselle, I'm here as the representative of the Central Committee in Paris to request you to break up your Women's Union.
#THERESE.
So that's it.
#DELEGATE.
That's it.
#THERESE.
What harm does it do you?
#DELEGATE.
It strengthens you too much against us.
#THERESE.
If I asked you to break up yours for the same reason, what would you say to me?
#DELEGATE.
Our union is to fight the masters; yours is to fight us.
#THERESE.
It does you no harm whatever.
#DELEGATE.
Your union supports a movement we've decided to fight.
#THERESE.
What movement?
#DELEGATE.
The movement of the competition of women, the invasion of the labor market by female labor.
#THERESE.
Not a very dangerous invasion.
#DELEGATE.
You think not. Listen. I've just come down from Paris. Who gave me my railway ticket? A woman. Who did I find behind the counter at the Post Office? A woman. Who was at the end of the telephone wire? A woman. I had to get some money; it was a woman who gave it to me at the bank. I don't even speak of the women doctors and lawyers. And in industry, like everywhere else, women want to supplant us. There are women now even in the metal - working shops. Everyone has the right to defend himself against competition. The workmen are going to defend themselves.
#THERESE.
Without troubling about the consequences. To take away a woman's right to work is to condemn her to starvation or prostitution. You're not competitors, you're enemies.
#DELEGATE.
You're mistaken. We're so little the enemies of the women that in asking you to do away with your Union we're speaking in your own interest.
#THERESE.
Bah!
#DELEGATE.
We don't want women to take lower wages than ours.
#THERESE.
I know the phrase. "Equal wages for equal work."
#DELEGATE.
That's absolutely just.
#THERESE.
The masters won't give those equal wages.
#DELEGATE.
The women have a means of forcing them to; they can strike.
#THERESE.
We don't wish to employ those means.
#DELEGATE.
I beg your pardon, the women would consent at once. It's you that prevent them, through the Union that you've started. Isn't that so?
#THERESE.
That is so. But you know why.
#DELEGATE.
No, I do not know why.
#THERESE.
Then I will tell you why. It is because the phrase only seems to be just and generous. You know very well that here, at any rate, the owner would not employ any more women if he had to pay them the same wages he pays the men. And if they struck, he'd replace them by men. Your apparent solicitude is only hypocrisy. In reality you want to get rid of the women.
#DELEGATE.
Well, I admit that. The women are not competitors; they're enemies. In every dispute they'll take the side of the masters.
#THERESE.
How d'you know that?
#DELEGATE.
They've always done it, because women take orders by instinct. They're humble, and docile, and easily frightened.
#THERESE.
Why don't you say inferiors, at once?
#DELEGATE.
Well, yes; inferiors, the majority of them.
#THERESE.
If they're inferiors, it's only right that they should take lower wages.
#DELEGATE.
Oh, I didn't mean to say -
#THERESE.
But it's not true - they are not your inferiors. If they believe they are, it's because of the wrongs and humiliations you've imposed on them for centuries. You men stick together. Why are we not to do the same? If you start trade unions, why may not we? As a matter of fact, as regards work, we're your equals. We need our wages; and to get hold of the jobs that we're able to do we offer our work at a cheaper rate than you do. That is competition; you must protect yourselves from it. If you want no more competition, keep your women at home and support them.
#DELEGATE.
But that's precisely what we want: "The man in the workshop, the woman in the home."
#THERESE.
If the mother is not at home nowadays, it's because the man is in the saloon.
#DELEGATE.
The men go to the saloons because they're tired of finding the place badly kept and the supper not ready when they go home, and instead of a wife a tired - out factory hand.
#THERESE.
D'you think it's to amuse themselves the women go to work? Don't you suppose they prefer a quiet life in their own homes?
#DELEGATE.
They've only got to stay there.
#THERESE.
And who's to support them?
#DELEGATE.
Their husbands!
#THERESE.
First they've got to have husbands. What about the ones who have no husbands - the girls, the widows, the abandoned? Isn't it better to give them a trade than to force them to take a lover? Some of them want to leave off being obliged to beg for the help of a man. Can't you see that for a lot of women work means freedom? Can you blame them for demanding the right to work? That's the victory they're fighting for.
#DELEGATE.
I'm not at all sure that that victory is a desirable one. Indeed, I'm sure it is not. When you've succeeded in giving the woman complete independence through hard work; when you have taken her children from her and handed them over to a crèche; when you've severed her from her domestic duties and also from all domestic happiness and joy, how d'you know she won't turn round and demand to have her old slavery back again? The quietness and peace of her own home? The right to care for her own husband and nurse her own child?
#THERESE.
But can't you see that it's just that that the immense majority of women are demanding now? We want the women to stay at home just as much as you do. But how are you going to make that possible? At present the money spent on drink equals the total of the salaries paid to women. So the problem is to get rid of drunkenness. But the middle classes refuse to meet this evil straightforwardly because the votes which keep them in power are in the pockets of the publicans; and you socialist leaders refuse just as much as the middle classes really to tackle the drink question because you're as keen for votes as they are. You've got to look the situation in the face. We're on the threshold of a new era. In every civilized country, in the towns and in the rural districts, from the destitute and from the poor, from every home that a man has deserted for drink or left empty because men have no longer the courage to marry, a woman will appear, who comes out from that home and will sit down by your side in the workshop, in the factory, at the office, in the counting house. You don't want her as housewife; and as she refuses to be a prostitute, she will become a woman - worker, a competitor; and finally, because she has more energy than you have, and because she is not a drunkard, she will take your places.
#DELEGATE.
Well, before another hour's gone over our heads you'll find that she won't start that game here.
#FELIAT.
My dear sir, a thousand pardons for interrupting you, but as I've just turned your friend out of my house because he took advantage of being in it to start a propaganda against me, what's the use of your going on talking to this lady about a course of action she will no more consent to than I shall?
#DELEGATE.
Very well, Monsieur. I shall telephone to Paris for instructions. Probably you will refuse to let me use your instrument.
#FELIAT.
I most certainly shall.
#DELEGATE.
So I shall go to the Post Office, and in ten minutes -
#FELIAT.
Go, my dear sir, go. But let me tell you in a friendly way that it'll take you more than ten minutes to get on to Paris.
#DELEGATE.
It takes you more, perhaps, but not me. Good - morning.
#FELIAT.
The low brute! Things are not going well. What happened at Duriot's has made a very unfortunate impression here. The news that you were going to open a new workshop for the women has been twisted and distorted by gossip and chatter, and my men have been worked up by the other brute to come and threaten me.
#THERESE.
What d'you mean?
#FELIAT.
They threaten me with a strike and with blacklisting me if I don't give up the idea.
#THERESE.
You can't give up absolutely certain profits.
#FELIAT.
If I am too obstinate, it may result in much larger losses which will be equally certain.
#THERESE.
But what then?
#FELIAT.
I've had to promise that for the present at any rate there's no question of taking on any more women.
#THERESE.
Oh!
#FELIAT.
What could I do?
#FELIAT.
Well?
#GUERET.
They wouldn't listen.
#FELIAT.
I was afraid they wouldn't. That's not all. Your godfather has been trying something else, and I understand he's not succeeded. I shall have to take the mending away from your workshop.
#THERESE.
The women won't agree to that.
#GUERET.
Perhaps that would be the best solution of the difficulty.
#THERESE.
Don't say that. You can't mean it. Think!
#GUERET.
What's more, the men refuse to finish the work the women have begun.
#THERESE.
We'll finish it.
#GUERET.
Then they'll strike.
#THERESE.
Let them strike. Monsieur Féliat, you can fight now and get terms for yourself. Just at this moment we have only one very urgent order. If the men strike, I can find you women to replace them. Every day I am refusing people who want to be taken on.
#GUERET.
I have an idea.
#THERESE.
What's that?
#GUERET.
I know my men; they're not bad fellows.
#THERESE.
My workers are splendid women.
#GUERET.
Of course they are. As a matter of fact we're face to face now, not with a fight between men and masters, but with a fight between men - workers and women - workers. The men have their trade union, and the women have theirs. Both unions have a President and two Vice - Presidents. Both have their office. We must have a meeting between the two here at once, in a friendly, sensible way, before they've all had time to excite themselves; and let them find some way out that'll please 'em all.
#FELIAT.
But, my dear fellow, if you bring them together, they'll tear one another's eyes out.
#GUERET.
Oh, we know you don't believe the working classes have any sense.
#FELIAT.
I don't. I've been an employer too long.
#THERESE.
Why not try what my godfather suggests? What do you risk?
#FELIAT.
I don't mind. But I will have nothing to do with it personally.
#GUERET.
Neither will I.
#THERESE.
I'll go and see if Berthe and Constance are here. You go and fetch your men.
#GUERET.
I give you my word that, if there's any possible way out, this is the only chance of getting at it.
#FELIAT.
Very well, go and fetch them.
#BERTHE.
Good - morning, Monsieur Féliat.
#CONSTANCE.
Good - morning, Monsieur Féliat.
#THERESE.
I want Berthe and Constance to tell you themselves whether you can count upon them in case of the men striking.
#CONSTANCE.
Oh yes, Monsieur Féliat. We'll do anything you want us to.
#BERTHE.
Oh, Monsieur Féliat, don't send us away!
#CONSTANCE.
Oh, Monsieur Féliat, you won't send us away, will you?
#BERTHE.
We do want the work so, Monsieur.
#CONSTANCE.
It's God's truth we do.
#FELIAT.
I'll do everything possible on my side, but it all depends on yourselves and the men. Try to come to some understanding.
#CONSTANCE.
Yes, Monsieur.
#BERTHE.
If you can't pay us quite as much for the mending, we don't mind taking a little less. You'd keep it dark, wouldn't you?
#FELIAT.
We'll see about it.
#WORKMEN.
Good - morning, ladies and gents.
#FELIAT.
Has my brother explained to you why he asked you to meet the representatives of the Women's Union and to try to come to an understanding with them?
#GIRARD.
Yes, Monsieur Féliat.
#CHARPIN.
That's all we want. All friends together, like.
#DESCHAUME.
That's the hammer, mate!
#FELIAT.
Then I'll go. Do try and keep your tempers.
#ALL.
Oh yes. To be sure, sir. You needn't trouble, sir.
#CHARPIN.
Well, what d'you say to a sit down?
#DESCHAUME.
That lazy swine's only comfortable when he's sittin' down.
#CHARPIN.
I ain't agoing to tire meself for nix, not 'arf!
#CONSTANCE.
Have my chair, Mademoiselle.
#THERESE.
No, thank you, I prefer to stand.
#CHARPIN.
I see that all our little lot's here. There's four on us, but only three 'er you.
#DESCHAUME.
One of the hens ain't turned up yet.
#CHARPIN.
Perhaps she's a bit shy, like.
#THERESE.
You mean Mother Bougne. You, workmen yourselves, mock at an old woman wrecked by work. But you're right. She ought to be here. I'll go and fetch her. Only to look at her would be an argument on our side.
#DESCHAUME.
Mademoiselle Thérèse needn't kick up such a dust about a little thing like that. There's four on us; so there must be four on you, in case we have to take a vote.
#THERESE.
Give me a chair. Sit down, Mother Bougne. Mother Bougne, sit down.
#MOTHER BOUGNE.
Oh, don't trouble, miss, I'm not used to -
#THERESE.
Sit down.
#CHARPIN.
Well, here's the bloomin' bunch of us.
#DESCHAUME.
We'd best fix up a chairman.
#GIRARD.
What's the good of that?
#DESCHAUME.
We'd best have you, Girard. You've education, and you're up to all the dodges about public meetings.
#GIRARD.
It's not worth while.
#DESCHAUME.
Well, I only put it forrard because it's the usual. But have it your own way! Only don't all jaw at once. You'll see you'll want a chairman, I tell you that, but I don't care. It ain't my show.
#CHARPIN.
Get a move on you, Girard, and speak up.
#GIRARD.
Well, ladies -
#VINCENT.
Now look here. I want to get at an understandin'.
#THERESE.
Monsieur Girard, will you be kind enough to speak for your friends? We have nothing to say on our part. We're asking for nothing.
#GIRARD.
Well, that's true. We want to have the mending back.
#THERESE.
And we don't mean to give it up.
#GIRARD.
Well, we expected that. Now, to show you that we're not such a bad lot as you think, we'll share it with you on two conditions. The first is that you're paid the same wages as we are.
#DESCHAUME.
Look here, that won't suit me at all, that won't. If my old woman gets as much as me, how am I to keep her under? Blimey, she'll think she's my bloomin' equal!
#GIRARD.
Oh, bung her into some other berth. Let me go on. The second condition is that you aren't to have a separate workshop. We'll all work together as we used to.
#THERESE.
Why?
#DESCHAUME.
You women do a damned sight too much for your ha'pence.
#GIRARD.
Yes, it's all in the interests of the masters. It's against solidarity.
#THERESE.
Will you allow me to express my astonishment that you should make conditions with us when you wish to take something from us?
#CHARPIN.
We're ony tellin' you our terms for sharing the work with you.
#THERESE.
I quite understand; but we have no desire to share it with you. We mean to keep it. And I'm greatly surprised to hear you suggest that we should all work together.
#CONSTANCE.
Indeed we won't.
#DESCHAUME.
Why not, Mademoiselle? When we worked together -
#CONSTANCE.
When we worked with you before, you played all sorts of dirty tricks on us to make us leave.
#DESCHAUME.
What tricks? Did you hear anything about that, Charpin?
#CHARPIN.
I dunnow what she's talkin' about. D'you Vincent?
#VINCENT.
Look here, I only want to get to an understandin'.
#CONSTANCE.
You never stopped sayin' beastly things.
#DESCHAUME AND CHARPIN.
Oh! O - ho!
#DESCHAUME.
Well, if we can't have a bit of chippin' in a friendly way like!
#BERTHE.
Beastly things like that ain't jokes. I didn't know where to look meself; and I've sat for a sculptor, so I ain't too particular.
#CHARPIN.
He! He! I thought she was talkin' about that old joke of the rats.
#THERESE.
Yes, you're laughing about it still! About shutting up live rats in our desks before we came to work.
#GIRARD.
He! He! We didn't mean any harm.
#THERESE.
You didn't mean any harm! The little apprentice was ill for a week, and Madame Dumont had a bad fall. You thought of dozens of things of that kind, like the typists who mixed up all the letters on the women's desks. When we went away to get our lunch, you came and spoilt our work and made the women lose a great part of their day's pay or work hours of overtime. We don't want any more of that. You agreed we should have a separate workshop. We'll keep it.
#GIRARD.
If Monsieur Féliat sticks to you, we'll have to come out on strike.
#THERESE.
We don't want Monsieur Féliat to get into trouble because of us.
#GIRARD.
Well, what are you going to do about it?
#THERESE.
We'll take your places.
#CHARPIN.
Well, I'm damned!
#DESCHAUME.
If you do, we'll have to put you through it!
#CONSTANCE.
We'll do it!
#GIRARD.
D'you understand now, Mademoiselle, why we socialists don't want women in the factory or in the workshop? The woman's the devil because of the low salary she has to take. She's a victim, and she likes to be a victim, and so she's the best card the employer has to play against a strike. The women are too weak, and if I might say so, too slavish -
#DESCHAUME.
Yes, that's the word, mate, slavish.
#BERTHE.
Look at that man there, my husband, and hear what he's saying before me, his wife, that he makes obey him like a dog. He beats me, he does. You don't trouble about my being what you call slavish when it's you that profits by it! I'd like to know who taught women to be slavish but husbands like you.
#THERESE.
You've so impressed it upon women that they're inferior to men, that they've ended by believing it.
#GIRARD.
Well, maybe there's exceptions, but it's true in the main.
#DESCHAUME.
Let 'em stay at home, I says, and cook the bloomin' dinner.
#BERTHE.
And what'll they cook the days when you spend all your wages in booze.
#GIRARD.
It's the people that started you working that you ought to curse.
#BERTHE.
I like that! It was my husband himself that brought me to the workshop.
#THERESE.
She's not the only one, eh, Vincent?
#VINCENT.
But I ain't sayin' nothin', I ain't. What are you turnin' on me for? I ain't sayin' nothin'.
#BERTHE.
We'd like nothing better than to stay at home. Why don't you support us there?
#CONSTANCE.
It's because you don't support us there that you've got to let us work.
#DESCHAUME.
We ain't going to.
#BERTHE.
We won't give in to you.
#GIRARD.
If you don't, we'll turn the job in.
#THERESE.
And I tell you that we shall take your places.
#DESCHAUME.
Rats! You can't do it.
#THERESE.
We couldn't at one time, that's true. But now we've got the machines. The machines drove the women from their homes. Up to lately one had to have a man's strength for the work; now, by just pulling a lever, a woman can do as much and more than the strongest man. The machines revenge us.
#DESCHAUME.
We'll smash the things.
#GIRARD.
She's right. By God, she's right! It's them machines has done it. If any one had told my grandfather a time would come when one chap could keep thousands of spindles running and make hundreds of pairs of stockings in a day, and yards and yards of woollen stuff, and socks and shirts and all, why grandfather'd've thought everybody'd have shirts and socks and comforters and shoes, and there'd be no more hard work and empty bellies. Curse the damned things! We works longer hours, and there's just as many bare feet and poor devils shivering for want of clothes. The machines were to give us everything, blast 'em! The workers are rotten fools! The damned machines have made nothing but hate between them that own them and them that work them. They've used up the women and even the children; and it's all to sell the things they make to niggers or Chinamen; and maybe we'll have war about it. They've made the middle classes rich, and they're the starvation of all of us; and after they've done all that, here are the women, our own women, want to help 'em to best us!
#MOTHER BOUGNE.
You're right, Girard. When I was a kid, and there was no machines - leastways, not to speak of - we was all better off. Women stayed at home, and they'd got enough to do. Why, my old grandmother used to fetch water from the well and be out pickin' up sticks before it was light of a mornin'! Yes, and women made their own bread, and did their washin', and made their bits of things themselves! Now it's machines for everythin', and they say to us: "Come into the factory and you'll earn big money." And we come, like silly kids! Why, fancy me, eight years old, taken out of the village and bunged into a spinnin' mill! Then, when I was married, there was me in a workman's dwellin'. You turn a tap for your water, don't fetch it; baker's bread, and your bit of dinner from the cookshop, or preserved meat out of a tin. You don't make a fire, you turn on the gas; your stockin's and togs all fetched out of a shop. There ain't no need for the women to stay at home no longer, so they cuts down the men's wages and puts us in the factories. We ain't got time to suckle our kids; and now they don't want young 'uns any more! But when you're in the factory, they make yer pay through the nose for yer gas and yer water, and baker's bread and ready - made togs; and you've got nothin' left out of yer bit of wages, and you're as poor as ever; and you're only a "hand" at machines in the damp and smoke, instead of bein' in your own house an' decent like. What are you fussin' about, Girard? Don't you see that we can't go back to the old times now? A woman ain't got a house now, only a little room with nothin' but a dirty bed to sleep on! And I tell you, Girard, you've got to let us earn our livin' like that now, because it's you and the likes of you that's brought us to it.
#GIRARD.
Well, after all, we've got to look after our living. The women want to take it from us.
#MOTHER BOUGNE.
It's because they haven't got any themselves, my lad. They've got to live as well as you, you see.
#GIRARD.
And supposing there isn't enough living for everybody?
#MOTHER BOUGNE.
The strongest'll get it and the weak 'uns'll be done in.
#GIRARD.
Well, we've not made the world, and we're not going to have our work taken away from us.
#CONSTANCE.
And we're not, either.
#DESCHAUME.
Damn it all, we've got to live.
#BERTHE.
Well, we've got to live too. The kids has got to live and we've got to live. One would think we was brute beasts.
#CONSTANCE.
We say just the same as you. We've not made the world, it ain't our fault.
#A WOMAN.
It ain't our fault.
#A MAN.
So much the worse for you.
#ANOTHER WOMAN.
We've got to live, we've got to live!
#ANOTHER MAN.
Ain't we got to live too?
#THERESE.
Well, don't drink so much.
#A WOMAN.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
#WOMEN.
Right, Mademoiselle! Well done! Good!
#BERTHE.
You won't get our work away from us.
#DESCHAUME.
It's our work; you took it.
#BERTHE.
You gave it up to us.
#A MAN.
Well, we'll take it back from you.
#ANOTHER MAN.
We were wrong.
#ANOTHER MAN.
Drive out the Hens.
#ANOTHER MAN.
The strike! Long live the strike! We'll come out!
#A WOMAN.
We'll take your places; we've got to live.
#A MAN.
There's no living for you here.
#A WOMAN.
Yes there is; we'll take yours.
#THERESE.
Yes, we'll take yours. And your wife that you brought here yourself will take your place, Vincent. And you the same, Deschaume. She'll take your place, and it'll serve you right. You can stay at home and do the mending to amuse yourself.
#GIRARD.
This woman from Paris is turning the heads of the lot of you.
#CHARPIN.
Yes, that's about the size of it.
#VINCENT.
She don't play the game. She does as she bloomin' well likes. She wouldn't engage my old woman. She took women from Duriot's.
#GIRARD.
That's it. It's you that's doing it. You've got to ask the same wages as us.
#THERESE.
You know very well -
#GIRARD.
It's all along of your damned Union.
#VINCENT.
There wasn't any ructions till you come.
#CHARPIN.
We'll smash the Hens' Union.
#A MAN.
Put 'em through it! Down 'em! Smash the Hens! Smash 'em!
#A WOMAN.
Turn out the lazy swines!
#A WOMAN.
We're fightin' for our kids.
#BERTHE.
Turn out the lazy swines!
#DESCHAUME.
Shut up, blast you, shut up!
#ANOTHER MAN.
Don't strike her!
#DESCHAUME.
It's my wife; can't I do as I like? Get out, you!
#BERTHE.
I won't!
#A MAN.
Damn her, she's hurt me!
#ANOTHER MAN.
It's her scissors! Get hold of her scissors.
#THERESE.
They'll kill one another! Go home, go home; they'll kill you. Go home at once.
#A WOMAN.
Oh, you brutes! Oh, you brutes!
#GIRARD.
Deschaume's bin hurt, sir.
#FELIAT.
He must be taken to the Infirmary.
#DESCHAUME.
With her scissors she did it, blast 'er!
#CHARPIN.
The police, send for the police!
#GIRARD.
Don't be a bally fool. We can take care of ourselves, can't we, without the bloomin' coppers.
#DESCHAUME.
The police, send for the police! To protect the right to work. Send for 'em.
#GIRARD.
If 't was to bully us, you'd have sent for 'em long ago. What are you waiting for?
#FELIAT.
I'm waiting till you kindly allow me to speak. I can't believe my ears. Is it you, Girard, and you, Deschaume, who want to have the police sent for to save you from a pack of women? Ha! Ha!
#CHARPIN.
Oh, it makes you laugh, does it?
#GIRARD.
You defend the cats because they're against us. Well, we won't have it. Duriot's men came out -
#CHARPIN.
Yes, and we'll do the same.
#DESCHAUME.
We will. Look out for the strike!
#GIRARD.
We're agreed; ain't we, mates?
#CHARPIN AND DESCHAUME.
Yes, yes. We'll strike. Let's strike.
#FELIAT.
You don't really mean that you're going on strike?
#GIRARD.
Don't we, though!
#FELIAT.
How can you? I've given everything you've asked for.
#CHARPIN.
That's just the reason.
#GIRARD.
If you've given in, that shows we were right. You'll have to give in some more.
#FELIAT.
Good God, what d'you want now?
#CHARPIN.
We want you to sack all the women.
#DESCHAUME.
No we don't. We want you to sack Mademoiselle Thérèse.
#FELIAT.
You're mad! What harm has she done you?
#GIRARD.
The harm she's done us? Well, she's on your side.
#DESCHAUME.
She's turned the women's heads. They want to take our places.
#CHARPIN.
And we won't have it.
#FELIAT.
Come! Be reasonable. You can't ask me that.
#GIRARD.
We do ask you that.
#FELIAT.
It will upset my whole business.
#CHARPIN.
What's that to us?
#FELIAT.
Well, I must have time to think about it.
#GIRARD.
There's nothing to think about. Sack the Paris woman or we go on strike.
#FELIAT.
You can't put a pistol to my head like this. I've got orders in hand.
#GIRARD.
What's that to us?
#FELIAT.
Well then, I won't give in this time. You demanded that I should not open a new workshop. I gave in. I won't go further than that.
#GIRARD.
Then out we go.
#FELIAT.
Well go, and be damned to you. The women will take your places.
#GIRARD.
You think so, do you? You think it's as easy as that. Well, try. Just you try to fill up our places. Have you forgot there's two delegates here from the Central Committee? A phone to Paris and your bally show is done for.
#FELIAT.
It's damnable.
#GIRARD.
And if that doesn't choke you off, there's other things.
#CHARPIN.
We'll set the whole bloomin' place on fire.
#GIRARD.
Don't you try to bully us.
#FELIAT.
Well, look here. We won't quarrel. I'll send away Mademoiselle Thérèse. But give me a little time to settle things up.
#CHARPIN.
No; out she goes.
#FELIAT.
Give me a month. I ask only a month.
#GIRARD.
An hour, that's all you'll get, an hour.
#CHARPIN.
An hour, not more.
#GIRARD.
We're going off to meet the delegates at the Hotel de la Poste; you can send your answer there. The Parisian goes out sharp now, or else look out for trouble. Come on, boys, let's go and tell the others. There's nothing more to do here.
#FELIAT.
But stop, listen -
#CHARPIN.
That's our last word. Hurry on.
#FELIAT.
How much did you hear?
#THERESE.
Oh, please, please, don't give in. Don't abandon these women. It's dreadful in the workroom. They're in despair. I've just been with them, talking to them. They get desperate when they think of their children.
#FELIAT.
The men are not asking me now to get rid of them. What they're asking for is the break - up of your Union, and that you yourself should go.
#THERESE.
Oh, they say that now. But if you give in, they'll see that they can get anything they like from your weakness, and they'll make you turn out all these wretched women.
#FELIAT.
But I can't help myself! You didn't hear the brutal threats of these men. If I don't give in, I shall be blacklisted, and they'll set the place on fire; they said so. Where will your women's work be then? And I shall be ruined.
#THERESE.
Then you mean to give in without a struggle?
#FELIAT.
Would you like to take the responsibility for what will happen if I resist? There'll be violence. Just think what it'll mean. In the state the men are in anything may happen. There's a wounded man already. How many would there be to - morrow?
#THERESE.
You think only of being beaten. But suppose you win? Suppose you act energetically and get the best of it.
#FELIAT.
My energy would be my ruin.
#THERESE.
Then you wish me to go?
#FELIAT.
I have only made up my mind to it to prevent something worse.
#THERESE.
It's impossible you can sacrifice me in this way at the first threat. Look here, Monsieur Féliat; perhaps it doesn't come very well from me, but I can't help reminding you that you've said repeatedly yourself that I've been extremely useful to you. Don't throw me overboard without making one try to save me.
#FELIAT.
It would be no use.
#THERESE.
How can you tell? It's your own interest to keep me. The delegate said that if I go they'll break up the Women's Union and make the women take the same wages as the men.
#FELIAT.
They won't do that because they know I wouldn't keep them.
#THERESE.
You see! If you give in, it means the break - up of the whole thing and the loss to you of the saving I've made for you. And you have obligations to these women who have been working for you for years.
#FELIAT.
If I have to part with them, I will see they are provided for.
#THERESE.
Yes, for a day - a week, perhaps. But afterwards? What then? Little children will be holding out their hands for food to mothers who have none to give them.
#FELIAT.
But, good God, what have I to do with that? Is it my fault? Don't you see that I'm quite powerless in the matter?
#THERESE.
No, you're not quite powerless. You can choose which you will sacrifice, the women who have been perfectly loyal to you, or the men who want to wring from your weakness freedom from competition which frightens them.
#FELIAT.
They're fighting for their daily bread.
#THERESE.
Yes, fighting the woman because she works for lower wages. She can do that because she is sober and self - controlled. Is it because of her virtues that you condemn her?
#FELIAT.
I know all that as well as you do, and I tell you again the women can go on working just as they were working before you came.
#THERESE.
You'll be made to part with them.
#FELIAT.
We shall see. But at present that's not the question. The present thing is about you. One of us has to be sacrificed, you or me. I can see only one thing. If I stick to you, my machinery will be smashed and my works will be burned. I'm deeply sorry this has happened, and I don't deny for a moment the great value of your services; but, after all, I can't ruin myself for your sake.
#THERESE.
But you wouldn't be ruined. Defend yourself, take measures. Ask for assistance from the Government.
#FELIAT.
The Government can't prevent the strike.
#THERESE.
But the women will do the work.
#FELIAT.
You think of nothing but your women. And the men? They'll be starving, won't they? And their women and their children will starve with them.
#THERESE.
And me, you have no pity for me. What's to become of me? If you abandon me, I'm done for. I'd made a career for myself. I had realized my dreams. I was doing a little good. And I was so deeply grateful to you for giving me my chance. I'm all alone in the world, you know that very well. Before I came here I tried every possible way to earn my living. Oh, please don't send me away. Don't drive me back into that. Try once again, do something. Let me speak to the men. It's all my life that's at stake. If you drive me out, I don't know where to go to.
#GUERET.
Féliat, we mustn't wait a moment; we must give in at once. They're exciting themselves; they're mad; they're getting worse; they may do anything. They've gone to the women's workroom and they're driving them out.
#THERESE.
Go, Monsieur! Go quickly! Don't let anything dreadful happen. You're right. I'll leave at once. Go!
#THERESE.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
#GUERET.
Don't be frightened, it's all over. The shot was fired in the air. The men have gone out; there are only the women now - crying in the workshop.
#THERESE.
Are you sure nobody is killed? Is it true, oh, tell me, is it really true?
#FELIAT.
Poor Thérèse! Don't be frightened.
#THERESE.
Oh, those screams! Those dreadful screams! Is it true, really, nobody was hurt?
#FELIAT.
Nobody, I assure you.
#THERESE.
The shot?
#FELIAT.
Fired in the air, to frighten the women. The men broke in the door, and upset a bench, and made a great row. I got there just in time. As soon as they were promised what they want they were quiet.
#THERESE.
They were promised what they want. So it's done. Then there's nothing left for me but to go.
#GUERET.
Where are you going to?
#FELIAT.
You needn't go at once.
#THERESE.
Yes, I'm going at once. I'm going where I'm forced to go.
#FELIAT.
You can leave to - morrow or the day after.
#THERESE.
No, I leave by train, this evening, for Paris.
