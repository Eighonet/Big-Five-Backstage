#JOHN GALE.
It’s most time for me to go to the store, Mary. I declare it’s astonishing how soon eight o’clock comes these short mornings.
#MARY.
It brings to mind the mornings, in the days gone by, when you were obliged to go to school, I suppose.
#JACK.
Yes; and I can’t say I enjoy one any more than the other. It’s about as disagreeable as leaving a nice, cosey fire on a winter’s night and getting into a cold bed.
#MARY.
But then I think one appreciates his home more, and enjoys the time he is able to pass in it more fully, than if he remained at home.
#JACK.
Perhaps you are right, Mary; but I shouldn’t object to try the other way for awhile.
#MARY.
John, dear, hadn’t you better put your slippers in their place?
#JACK.
Oh, we’ll consider this their place. Then I shan’t have to go searching after them to - night.
#MARY.
There won’t be any need of searching for them. If you put them where they belong, they will be sure to remain there.
#JACK.
But it’s a great bother to go out of one’s way for such trifles. They’re much handier lying there, and will be all ready for me to put on to - night.
#MARY.
But life is made up of trifles, and leaving things round clutters up the room so.
#JACK.
Why, no; a thing looks as well in one place as another. Besides, what’s the use of having a house if you can’t keep things where you want to? But there , they’re out of sight now. They will be handy, and no one will be the wiser for their being there.
#MARY.
But I have to go around every day and pick things up after you.
#JACK.
Oh, well, don’t pick them up; just let them stay where they are, and then I can find them when I want them.
#MARY.
Something must be done to cure John of this careless habit of leaving things around; but how it can be arranged, I cannot tell yet. I must think it over.
#AUNT REBECCA.
And you have married since I saw you last; married happily, I hope.
#MARY.
Yes; I couldn’t wish for a kinder or pleasanter husband. But between you and me, Aunt Rebecca, he has one fault that distresses me exceedingly.
#AUNT REBECCA.
And what is that?
#MARY.
He is so careless about his things. You have only to look about you, and you will see at once what I mean. I haven’t been in this room until now since he went to the store this morning. There are two hats, two coats, dressing - gown, vest and slippers lying around. He is in such a hurry when he goes away, that he doesn’t notice anything about it, and when he comes home, I have put them all in their places, so I don’t think he realizes what an untidy appearance the room presents.
#AUNT REBECCA.
That is rather a disagreeable habit. Have you spoken to him about it?
#MARY.
Spoken? Yes; I’ve delivered whole lectures on the subject.
#AUNT REBECCA.
And what does he say?
#MARY.
Oh, he makes light of it, and manages to change the subject whenever it is brought up. I don’t like to spoil the peace of our cosey home by scolding, but I feel as if something must be done.
#AUNT REBECCA.
I see how it is, Mary. You must declare war.
#MARY.
In what way?
#AUNT REBECCA.
I haven’t fully matured a plan yet, but we will open the campaign to - night, and, my word for it, if you follow my directions, you will come off victorious.
#MARY.
I am filled with curiosity to know how it is all to come about.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
A littir for you, ma’am.
#MARY.
It is a line from John, saying that he will bring his friend, Mr. Hastings, home to dine with us. I suppose he thought it possible I might be out.
#AUNT REBECCA.
What kind of a man is Mr. Hastings?
#MARY.
Very pleasant indeed, and as fond of a good joke as any one I know of. He and John are great friends.
#AUNT REBECCA.
Then it will be just the time for us to open the campaign.
#MARY.
You have it all arranged, then?
#AUNT REBECCA.
Yes; draw your chair this way, and I will explain it to you.
#JOHN GALE.
What! house - cleaning, Mary?
#MARY.
Oh, no. I’m glad to see you, Mr. Hastings. Sit down, do. You haven’t been here for a long time.
#EDWIN.
It is a long time for me to be away.
#JACK.
Say, Mary, what shall I do with these dry - goods?
#MARY.
Oh, lay them on the table.
#JACK.
But there isn’t room.
#MARY.
Isn’t there? Well, put them on the piano.
#JACK.
But I was just going to open it, so that we might have some music.
#MARY.
Well, put them on the sofa, then. There’s certainly room enough there.
#JACK.
But some one may sit on them there.
#MARY.
I guess not.
#JACK.
Hadn’t you better pick up things a little, Mary?
#MARY.
Oh, no, just let them lie as they are.
#JACK.
But they look so bad. And you know we frequently have callers in the evening.
#MARY.
Oh, they don’t look bad. I don’t see but a thing looks as well in one place as another.
#JACK.
I never saw your room look like this before, Mary.
#MARY.
Didn’t you? But I thought we might as well keep things handy. What’s the use of having a house, if you can’t keep things where you want to?
#JACK.
Oh, that’s it. So you’re giving an imitation of me, are you?
#MARY.
I’ve tried to. But don’t you like it?
#JACK.
No, I don’t; that’s a fact.
#MARY.
Well, then, if you’ll agree not to do so again, I’ll straighten up the room; but if you have a relapse, mind, I shall have one, too.
#JACK.
Oh, I shan’t; don’t fear. If I’m in danger of it, the recollection of this scene will bring me back to the paths of rectitude.
#ELISE.
I congratulate you, on the success of your scheme, Mrs. Marden, and have no doubt it will prove efficacious. It is worth a dozen scoldings, and is a far more agreeable remedy.
#JACK.
I rather think it touches you a little, old fellow, too, judging from the appearance of your bachelor apartments when I have called there.
#ELISE.
I am sure of that, and have taken a part of it to myself already. When next you come to my rooms, you will, without doubt, be struck with the transformation, and will perceive at once, that I, as well as yourself have profited by Mrs. Marden’s lesson.
