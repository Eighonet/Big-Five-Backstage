#BELINDA.
Are you sure you're tying it up tightly enough, Betty?
#BETTY.
Yes, ma'am; I think it's firm.
#BELINDA.
Because I'm not the fairy I used to be.
#BETTY.
Yes, ma'am; it's quite firm this end too.
#BELINDA.
It's not the ends I'm frightened of; it's the middle where the weight's coming. It looks very nice.
#BETTY.
Yes, ma'am.
#BELINDA.
I asked them at the Stores if they were quite sure it would bear me, and they said it would take anything up to - I forget how many tons. I know I thought it was rather rude of them. How does one get in? So trying to be a sailor!
#BETTY.
I think you sit in it, ma'am, and then throw your legs over.
#BELINDA.
I see. Yes. I'm afraid that was rather wasted on you, Betty. We must have some spectators next time.
#BETTY.
Yes, ma'am.
#BELINDA.
Cushions. There! Now then, Betty, about callers.
#BETTY.
Yes, ma'am.
#BELINDA.
If Mr. Baxter calls - he is the rather prim gentleman -
#BETTY.
Yes, ma'am; the one who's been here several times before.
#BELINDA.
Yes. Well, if he calls, you'll say, "Not at home."
#BETTY.
Yes, ma'am.
#BELINDA.
He will say, "Oh - er - oh - er - really." Then you'll smile very sweetly and say, "I beg your pardon, was it Mr. Baxter?" And he'll say, "Yes!" and you'll say, "Oh, I beg your pardon, sir; this way, please."
#BETTY.
Yes, ma'am.
#BELINDA.
That's right, Betty. Well now, if Mr. Devenish calls - he is the rather poetical gentleman -
#BETTY.
Yes, ma'am; the one who's always coming here.
#BELINDA.
Yes. Well, if he calls you'll say, "Not at home."
#BETTY.
Yes, ma'am.
#BELINDA.
He'll immediately throw down his bunch of flowers and dive despairingly into the moat. You'll stop him, just as he is going in, and say, "I beg your pardon, sir, was it Mr. Devenish?" And he will say, "Yes!" and you will say, "Oh, I beg your pardon, sir; this way, please."
#BETTY.
Yes, ma'am. And suppose they both call together?
#BELINDA.
We won't suppose anything so exciting, Betty.
#BETTY.
No, ma'am. And suppose any other gentleman calls?
#BELINDA.
There aren't any other gentlemen.
#BETTY.
It might be a clergyman, come to ask for a subscription like.
#BELINDA.
If it's a clergyman, Betty, I shall - I shall want your assistance out of the hammock first.
#BETTY.
Yes, ma'am.
#BELINDA.
That's all. To anybody else I'm not at home. Oh, just give me that little green book. The one at the bottom there - that's the one. Thank you. "The Lute of Love," by Claude Devenish. It doesn't seem much for half - a - crown when you think of the Daily Telegraph. ... Lute... Lute.... I should have quite a pretty mouth if I kept on saying that. Lute!
#BETTY.
Is that all, ma'am?
#BELINDA.
That's all. Oh, what am I thinking of! I want that review; I think it's the blue one. It has an article by Mr. Baxter on the "Rise of Lunacy in the Eastern Counties" - yes, that's the one. I'd better have that too; I'm just at the most exciting place. You shall have it after me, Betty.
#BETTY.
Is that all, ma'am?
#BELINDA.
Yes, that really is all.
#BELINDA.
"It is a matter of grave concern to all serious students of social problems - " But not in April. "Tell me where is love" - well, that's the question, isn't it? Delia!
#DELIA.
Well, mummy, aren't you glad to see me?
#BELINDA.
My darling child!
#DELIA.
Say you're glad.
#BELINDA.
My darling, I'm absolutely - Hold the hammock while I get out, dear; we don't want an accident. They're all right when you're there, and they'll bear two tons, but they're horrid getting in and out of. Darling, it really is you?
#DELIA.
Oh, it is jolly seeing you again. I believe you were asleep.
#BELINDA.
Certainly not, child. I was reading "The Nineteenth Century" - and after. Darling, wasn't it next Thursday you were coming back?
#DELIA.
No, this Thursday, silly.
#BELINDA.
Oh, my darling, and I was going over to Paris to bring you home.
#DELIA.
I half expected you.
#BELINDA.
So confusing their both being called Thursday. And you were leaving school for the very last time. If you don't forgive me, Delia, I shall cry.
#DELIA.
Silly mother!
#BELINDA.
Isn't it a lovely day for April, darling! I've wanted to say that to somebody all day, and you're the first person who's given me the chance. Oh, I said it to Betty, but she only said, "Yes, ma'am."
#DELIA.
Poor mother!
#BELINDA.
I simply must have another one. And to think that you're never going back to school any more. Darling, you are looking pretty.
#DELIA.
Am I?
#BELINDA.
Lovely. And now you're going to stay with me for just as long as you want a mother. Darling, you didn't mind being sent away to school, did you? It is the usual thing, you know.
#DELIA.
Silly mother! of course it is.
#BELINDA.
I'm so glad you think so too.
#DELIA.
Have you been very lonely without me?
#BELINDA.
Very.
#DELIA.
The truth, mummy!
#BELINDA.
I've missed you horribly, Delia. The absence of female companionship of the requisite -
#DELIA.
Are you really all alone?
#BELINDA.
Well, not always, of course.
#DELIA.
Mummy, I believe you're being bad again.
#BELINDA.
Really, darling, you forget that I'm old enough to be - in fact, am - your mother.
#DELIA.
You are being bad.
#BELINDA.
My child, that is not the way to - Oh, I say, what a lot taller I am than you!
#DELIA.
And prettier.
#BELINDA.
Oh, do you think so? Don't be silly, child.
#DELIA.
Now tell me all that's been happening here at once.
#BELINDA.
And I was just going to ask you how you were getting on with your French.
#DELIA.
Bother French! You've been having a much more interesting time than I have, so you've got to tell.
#BELINDA.
O - oh!
#DELIA.
Is it like the Count at Scarborough?
#BELINDA.
My darling, what do you mean?
#DELIA.
Don't you remember the Count who kept proposing to you at Scarborough? I do.
#BELINDA.
Dear one, you were the merest child, paddling about on the beach and digging castles.
#DELIA.
I was old enough to notice the Count.
#BELINDA.
And I'd bought her a perfectly new spade! How one deceives oneself!
#DELIA.
And then there was the M.P. who proposed at Windermere.
#BELINDA.
Yes, dear, but it wasn't seconded - I mean he never got very far with it.
#DELIA.
And the artist in Wales.
#BELINDA.
Darling child, what a memory you have. No wonder your teachers are pleased with you.
#DELIA.
Now tell me all about this one.
#BELINDA.
Which one?
#DELIA.
Oh, are there lots?
#BELINDA.
Only two.
#DELIA.
Two! You abandoned woman!
#BELINDA.
It's something in the air, darling. I've never been in Devonshire in April before.
#DELIA.
Is it really serious this time?
#BELINDA.
I wish you wouldn't say this time, Delia. It sounds so unromantic. If you'd only put it into French - cette fois - it sounds so much better. Cette fois. When one's daughter has just returned from an expensive schooling in Paris, one likes to feel -
#DELIA.
What I meant, dear, was, am I to have a stepfather at last?
#BELINDA.
Now you're being too French, darling.
#DELIA.
Why, do you still think father may be alive?
#BELINDA.
Why not? It's only eighteen years since he left us, and he was quite a young man then.
#DELIA.
Yes, but surely you'd have heard from him in all those years, if he'd been alive?
#BELINDA.
Well, he hasn't heard from me, and I'm still alive.
#DELIA.
I shall never understand it.
#BELINDA.
Understand what?
#DELIA.
Were you as heavenly when you were young as you are now?
#BELINDA.
Oh, I was sweet!
#DELIA.
And yet he left you after only six months.
#BELINDA.
I wish you wouldn't keep on saying he left me. I left him too.
#DELIA.
Why?
#BELINDA.
Well, you see, he was quite certain he knew how to manage women, and I was quite certain I knew how to manage men. If only one of us had been certain, it would have been all right.
#DELIA.
What really happened, mummy? I'm grown up now, so I think you ought to tell me.
#BELINDA.
That was about all, you know... except for his beard.
#DELIA.
Had he a beard? How funny!
#BELINDA.
Yes, dear, it was; but he never would see it. He took it quite seriously.
#DELIA.
And did you say dramatically, "If you really loved me, you'd take it off"?
#BELINDA.
I'm afraid I did, darling.
#DELIA.
And what did he say?
#BELINDA.
He said - very rudely - that, if I loved him, I'd do my hair in a different way.
#DELIA.
How ridiculous!
#BELINDA.
Of course, I didn't do it like this then. I suppose we never ought to have married, really.
#DELIA.
Why did you?
#BELINDA.
Mother rather wanted it. Delia, never get married because your mother - Oh, I forgot; I'm your mother.
#DELIA.
And I don't want a better one.... And so you left each other?
#BELINDA.
Yes.
#DELIA.
But, darling, didn't you tell him there was going to be a Me?
#BELINDA.
Oh no!
#DELIA.
I wonder why not?
#BELINDA.
Well, you see, if I had, he might have wanted to stay.
#DELIA.
But -
#BELINDA.
If he didn't want to stay for me, I didn't want him to stay for you. Forgive me, darling, but I didn't know you very well then. We've been very happy together, haven't we?
#DELIA.
I should think we have.
#BELINDA.
I don't want to deny you anything, and, of course, if you'd like a stepfather or two -
#DELIA.
Oh, you have been enjoying yourself.
#BELINDA.
Only you see how awkward it would be if Jack turned up in the middle of the wedding, like - like Eugene Aram.
#DELIA.
Enoch Arden, darling.
#BELINDA.
It's very confusing their having the same initials. Perhaps I'd better call them both E. A. in future and then I shall be safe. Well, anyhow it would be awkward, darling, wouldn't it? Not that I should know him from Adam after all these years - except for a mole on his left arm.
#DELIA.
Perhaps Adam had a mole.
#BELINDA.
No, darling; you're thinking of Noah. He had two.
#DELIA.
I wonder what would happen if you met somebody whom you really did fall in love with?
#BELINDA.
Now you're being serious, and it's April.
#DELIA.
Aren't these two - the present two - serious?
#BELINDA.
Oh no! They think they are, but they aren't a bit, really. Besides, I'm doing them such a lot of good. I'm sure they'd hate to marry me, but they love to think they're in love with me, and - I love it, and - and they love it, and - and we all love it.
#DELIA.
You really are the biggest, darlingest baby who ever lived. Do say I shan't spoil your lovely times.
#BELINDA.
Spoil them? Why, you'll make them more lovely than ever.
#DELIA.
Well, but do they know you have a grown - up daughter?
#BELINDA.
Oh!
#DELIA.
It doesn't really matter, because you don't look a day more than thirty.
#BELINDA.
No. I mean, how sweet of you - only -
#DELIA.
What!
#BELINDA.
Well, one of them, Mr. Baxter - Harold - he writes statistical articles for the Reviews - percentages and all those things. He's just the sort of man, if he knew that I was your mother, to work it out that I was more than thirty. The other one, Mr. Devenish - Claude - he's rather, rather poetical. He thinks I came straight from heaven - last week.
#DELIA.
I think I'd better go straight back to Paris.
#BELINDA.
You will do nothing of the sort. You will take off that hat - which is a perfect duck, and I don't know why I didn't say so before - and let me take a good look at you , and kiss you , and then we'll go to your room and unpack and have a lovely talk about clothes. And then we'll have tea.
#BELINDA.
And now here's Betty coming in to upset all our delightful plans, just when we've made them.
#DELIA.
How are you, Betty? I've left school.
#BETTY.
Very nicely, thank you, miss. You've grown.
#BELINDA.
I'm much taller than she is.... Well, Betty, what is it?
#BETTY.
The two gentlemen, Mr. Baxter and Mr. Devenish, have both called together, ma'am.
#BELINDA.
Oh! How - how very simultaneous of them!
#DELIA.
Oh, do let me see them!
#BELINDA.
Darling, you'll see plenty of them before you've finished. What have you done with them?
#BETTY.
They're waiting in the hall, ma'am, while I said I would see if you were at home.
#BELINDA.
All right, Betty. Give me two minutes and then show them out here.
#BETTY.
Yes, ma'am.
#BELINDA.
They can't do much harm to each other in two minutes.
#DELIA.
Well, I'll go and unpack. You really won't mind my coming down afterwards?
#BELINDA.
Of course not. Darling one, I wonder if you'd mind - just at first - being introduced as my niece. You see, I expect they're in a bad temper already, having come here together, and we don't want to spoil their day entirely.
#DELIA.
I'll be your mother if you like.
#BELINDA.
Oh no, that wouldn't do, because then Mr. Baxter would feel that he ought to ask your permission before paying his attentions to me. He's just that sort of man. A niece is so safe - however good you are at statistics, you can't really prove anything.
#DELIA.
All right, mummy.
#BELINDA.
You'd like to be called by a different name, wouldn't you? There's something so thrilling about taking a false name. Such a lot of adventures begin like that. How would you like to be Miss Robinson, darling? It's a nice easy one to remember. And you shall put your hair up so as to feel more disguised. What fun we're going to have!
#DELIA.
You baby! All right, then, I'm Miss Robinson, your favourite niece.
#BELINDA.
How sweet of you! Oh, I'm coming with you to do your hair. You don't think you're going to be allowed to do it yourself, when so much depends on it, and husbands leave you because of it, and -
#BETTY.
The mistress was here a moment ago. I expect she'll be back directly, if you'll just wait.
#DEVENISH.
Good heavens, Baxter, she's been reading your article!
#BAXTER.
I dare say she's not the only one.
#DEVENISH.
That's only guesswork ; you don't know of anyone else.
#BAXTER.
How many people, may I ask, have bought your poems?
#DEVENISH.
I don't write for the mob.
#BAXTER.
I think I may say that of my own work.
#DEVENISH.
Baxter, I don't want to disappoint you, but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that you are one of the mob. Dash it! what are you doing in the country at all in a bowler - hat?
#BAXTER.
If I wanted to be personal, I could say, "Why don't you get your hair cut?" Only that form of schoolboy humour doesn't appeal to me.
#DEVENISH.
This is not a personal matter; I am protesting on behalf of nature. What do the birds and the flowers and the beautiful trees think of your hat?
#BAXTER.
If one began to ask oneself what the birds thought of things -
#DEVENISH.
Well, and why shouldn't one ask oneself? It is better than asking oneself what the Stock Exchange thinks of things.
#BAXTER.
Well , it's the nesting season. Your hair! Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!
#DEVENISH.
Really, Baxter, you're vulgar. Ha, my book! Baxter, she reads my book.
#BAXTER.
I suppose you gave her a copy.
#DEVENISH.
Yes, I gave her a copy. My next book will be hers and hers alone.
#BAXTER.
Then let me say that, in my opinion, you took a very great liberty.
#DEVENISH.
Liberty! And this from a man who is continually forcing his unwelcome statistics upon her.
#BAXTER.
At any rate, I flatter myself that there is no suggestion of impropriety in anything that I write.
#DEVENISH.
I'm not so sure about that, Baxter.
#BAXTER.
What do you mean, sir?
#DEVENISH.
Did you read The Times this month on the new reviews!
#BAXTER.
Well!
#DEVENISH.
Oh, nothing. It just said, "Mr. Baxter's statistics are extremely suggestive." I haven't read them, so of course I don't know what you've been up to.
#BAXTER.
Pah!
#DEVENISH.
Poor old Baxter! Baxter -
#BAXTER.
I wish you wouldn't keep calling me "Baxter."
#DEVENISH.
Harold.
#BAXTER.
It is only by accident - an accident which we both deplore - that we have met at all, and in any case I am a considerably older man than yourself.
#DEVENISH.
Mr. Baxter - father - I have a proposal to make. We will leave it to this beautiful flower to decide which of us the lady loves.
#BAXTER.
Eh?
#DEVENISH.
She loves me, she loves Mr. Baxter, she loves me, she loves Mr. Baxter - Heaven help her! - she loves me -
#BELINDA.
What are you doing, Mr. Devenish!
#DEVENISH.
My lady.
#BAXTER.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Tremayne.
#BELINDA.
How nice of you both to come!
#BAXTER.
Mr. Devenish and I are inseparable - apparently.
#BELINDA.
You haven't told me what you were doing, Mr. Devenish. Was it "This year, next year?" or "Silk, satin - "
#DEVENISH.
My lady, it was even more romantic than that. I have the honour to announce to your ladyship that Mr. Baxter is to be a sailor.
#BELINDA.
Doesn't he talk nonsense?
#BAXTER.
He'll grow out of it. I did.
#BELINDA.
Oh, I hope not. I love talking nonsense, and I'm ever so old. Now which one of you will say it first?
#DEVENISH.
You are as old as the stars and as young as the dawn.
#BAXTER.
You are ten years younger than I am.
#BELINDA.
What sweet things to say! I don't know which I like best.
#DEVENISH.
Where will my lady sit?
#BELINDA.
I will recline in the hammock, an it please thee, my lord - only it's rather awkward getting in, Mr. Baxter. Perhaps you'd both better look at the tulips for a moment.
#BAXTER.
Oh - ah - yes.
#DEVENISH.
If only -
#BELINDA.
You'd better not say anything, Mr. Devenish. Keep it for your next volume. One, two, three - that was better than last time. I wonder if either of you can guess what I've been reading this afternoon!
#DEVENISH.
I know.
#BELINDA.
How did you know? Yes, Mr. Baxter, it was your article I was reading. If you'd come five minutes earlier you'd have found me wrestling - I mean revelling in it.
#BAXTER.
I am very greatly honoured, Mrs. Tremayne. Ah - it seemed to me a very interesting curve showing the rise and fall of -
#BELINDA.
I hadn't got up to the curves. They are interesting, aren't they? They are really more in Mr. Devenish's line. Mr. Devenish, it was a great disappointment to me that all the poems in your book seemed to be written to somebody else.
#DEVENISH.
It was before I met you, lady. They were addressed to the goddess of my imagination. It is only in these last few weeks that I have discovered her.
#BELINDA.
And discovered she was dark and not fair.
#DEVENISH.
She will be dark in my next volume.
#BELINDA.
Oh, how nice of her!
#BAXTER.
You should write a real poem to Mrs. Tremayne.
#BELINDA.
Oh do! "To Belinda." I don't know what rhymes, except cinder. You could say your heart was like a cinder - all burnt up.
#DEVENISH.
Oh, my lady, I'm afraid that is a cockney rhyme.
#BELINDA.
How thrilling! I've never been to Hampstead Heath.
#DEVENISH.
"Belinda." It is far too beautiful to rhyme with anything but itself.
#BELINDA.
Fancy! But what about Tremayne? Oh, I am Mrs. Tremayne, and I don't want to marry again.
#DEVENISH.
My lady!
#BAXTER.
Belinda!
#BELINDA.
There, that's the first time he's called me Belinda!
#DEVENISH.
Are you serious?
#BELINDA.
Not as a rule.
#DEVENISH.
You're not going to marry again?
#BELINDA.
Well, who could I marry? and BAXTER. Me!
#BELINDA.
But this is England.
#BAXTER.
Mrs. Tremayne, I claim the right of age - of my greater years - to speak first.
#DEVENISH.
Mrs. Tremayne, I -
#BELINDA.
You can speak afterwards, Mr. Devenish. It's so awkward when you both speak together.
#BAXTER.
Mrs. Tremayne, I am a man of substantial position, and perhaps I may say of some repute in serious circles. All that I have, whether of material or mental endowment, I lay at your feet, together with an admiration which I cannot readily put into words. As my wife I think you would be happy, and I feel that with you by my side I could achieve even greater things.
#BELINDA.
How sweet of you! But I ought to tell you that I'm no good at figures.
#DEVENISH.
My lady -
#BELINDA.
I don't mean what you mean, Mr. Devenish. You wait till it's your turn. Yes?
#BAXTER.
I ask you to marry me, Belinda.
#BELINDA.
O - oh!... Now it's your turn, Mr. Devenish.
#DEVENISH.
Money - thank Heaven, I have no money. Reputation - thank Heaven, I have no reputation. What can I offer you? Dreams - nothing but dreams. Come with me and I will show you the world through my dreams. What can I give you? Youth, freedom, beauty -
#BAXTER.
Debts.
#BELINDA.
You mustn't interrupt, Mr. Baxter.
#DEVENISH.
Belinda, marry me and I will open your eyes to the beauty of the world. Come to me!
#BELINDA.
O - oh! You've got such different ways of putting things. How can I choose between you?
#DEVENISH.
Then you will marry one of us?
#BELINDA.
You know I really oughtn't to.
#BAXTER.
I don't see why not.
#BELINDA.
Well, there's just a little difficulty in the way.
#DEVENISH.
What is it? I will remove it. For you I could remove anything - yes, even Baxter.
#BELINDA.
And anyhow I should have to choose between you.
#DEVENISH.
Choose me.
#BAXTER.
Mrs. Tremayne does not require any prompting. A fair field and let the best man win.
#DEVENISH.
Aye, let the best man win! Well spoken, Baxter. Send us out into the world upon some knightly quest, lady, and let the victor be rewarded.
#BAXTER.
I - er - ought to say that I should be unable to go very far. I have an engagement to speak at Newcastle on the 21st.
#DEVENISH.
Baxter, I will take no unfair advantage of you. Let the beard of the Lord Mayor of Newcastle be the talisman that my lady demands; I am satisfied.
#BAXTER.
This sort of thing is entirely contrary to my usual mode of life, but I will not be outfaced by a mere boy. I am prepared.
#DEVENISH.
Speak, lady.
#BELINDA.
Gentlemen, ye put wild thoughts into my head. In sooth, I am minded to send ye forth upon a quest that is passing strange. Know ye that there is a maid journeyed hither, hight Robinson - whose - what's the old for aunt?
#BAXTER.
Mother's sister.
#BELINDA.
You know, I think I shall have to explain this in ordinary language. You won't mind very much, will you, Mr. Devenish?
#DEVENISH.
It is the spirit of this which matters, not the language which clothes it.
#BELINDA.
Oh, I'm so glad you think so. Well, now about Miss Robinson. She's my niece and she's just come to stay with me, and - poor girl - she's lost her father. Absolutely lost him. He disappeared ever such a long time ago, and poor Miss Robinson - Delia - naturally wants to find him. Poor girl! she can't think where he is.
#DEVENISH.
I will find him.
#BELINDA.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Devenish; Miss Robinson would be so much obliged.
#BAXTER.
Yes - er - but what have we to go upon? Beyond the fact that his name is Robinson -
#BELINDA.
I shouldn't go on that too much. You see, he may easily have changed it by now. He was never very much of a Robinson. Nothing to do with Peter or any of those.
#DEVENISH.
I will find him.
#BAXTER.
Well, can you tell us what he's like?
#BELINDA.
Well, it's such a long time since I saw him. Of course, I was quite a girl then. The only thing I know for certain is that he has a mole on his left arm about here.
#DEVENISH.
I will find him.
#BAXTER.
I am bound to inform you, Mrs. Tremayne, that even a trained detective could not give you very much hope in such a case. However, I will keep a look - out for him, and, of course, if -
#DEVENISH.
Fear not, lady, I will find him.
#BAXTER.
Yes, you keep on saying that, but what have you got to go on?
#DEVENISH.
Faith! The faith which moves mountains.
#BELINDA.
Yes, and this is only just one small mole - hill, Mr. Baxter.
#BAXTER.
Yes, but still -
#BELINDA.
S'sh! here is Miss Robinson. If Mr. Devenish will hold the hammock while I alight - we don't want an accident - I can introduce you. Thank you. Delia darling, this is Mr. Baxter, - and Mr. Devenish. My niece, Miss Robinson -
#DELIA.
How do you do?
#BELINDA.
Miss Robinson has just come over from France. Mon Dieu, quel pays!
#BAXTER.
I hope you had a good crossing, Miss Robinson.
#DELIA.
Oh, I never mind about the crossing. Aunt Belinda -
#BELINDA.
Yes, dear?
#DELIA.
I believe tea is almost ready. I want mine, and I'm sure Mr. Baxter's hungry. Mr. Devenish scorns food, I expect.
#DEVENISH.
Why do you say that?
#DELIA.
Aren't you a poet?
#BELINDA.
Yes, darling, but that doesn't prevent him eating. He'll be absolutely lyrical over Betty's sandwiches.
#DEVENISH.
You won't deny me that inspiration, I hope, Miss Robinson.
#BELINDA.
Well, let's go and see what they're like. Mr. Baxter, just a moment.
#BAXTER.
Yes?
#BELINDA.
Not a word to her about Mr. Robinson. It must be a surprise for her.
#BAXTER.
Quite so, I understand.
#BELINDA.
That's right. Oh, Mr. Devenish.
#DEVENISH.
Yes, Mrs. Tremayne?
#BELINDA.
Not a word to her about Mr. Robinson. It must be a surprise for her.
#DEVENISH.
Of course! I shouldn't dream - Robinson! What an unsuitable name!
#BELINDA.
All right, I'll catch you up.
#BELINDA.
Have you lost yourself, or something? No; the latch is this side.... Yes, that's right.
#TREMAYNE.
I'm afraid I'm trespassing.
#BELINDA.
But it's such a pretty garden , isn't it?
#TREMAYNE.
I - I beg your pardon, I - er -
#BELINDA.
I should have done the same myself, you know.
#TREMAYNE.
Oh, but you mustn't think I just came in because I liked the garden -
#BELINDA.
No; but say you do like it, quick.
#TREMAYNE.
It's lovely and -
#BELINDA.
Yes?
#TREMAYNE.
Yes, it's lovely.
#BELINDA.
O - oh!... Now tell me what really did happen?
#TREMAYNE.
I was on my way to Marytown -
#BELINDA.
To where?
#TREMAYNE.
Marytown.
#BELINDA.
Oh, you mean Mariton.
#TREMAYNE.
Do I?
#BELINDA.
Yes; we always call it Mariton down here. You don't mind, do you?
#TREMAYNE.
Not a bit.
#BELINDA.
Just say it - to see if you've got it right.
#TREMAYNE.
Mariton.
#BELINDA.
Oh no, that's quite wrong. Try it again Mariton.
#TREMAYNE.
Mariton.
#BELINDA.
Yes, that's much better.... Well, do go on.
#TREMAYNE.
I'm afraid it isn't much of an apology really. I saw what looked like a private road, but what I rather hoped wasn't, and - well, I thought I'd risk it. I do hope you'll forgive me.
#BELINDA.
Oh, but I love people seeing my garden. Are you staying in Mariton?
#TREMAYNE.
I think so. Oh yes, decidedly.
#BELINDA.
Well, perhaps the next time the road won't feel so private.
#TREMAYNE.
How charming of you! Are you Mrs. Tremayne by any chance?
#BELINDA.
Yes.
#TREMAYNE.
Yes.
#BELINDA.
How did you know?
#TREMAYNE.
They use you as a sign - post in the village. Past Mrs. Tremayne's house and then bear to the left -
#BELINDA.
And you couldn't go past it?
#TREMAYNE.
I'm afraid I couldn't. Thank you so much for not minding. Well, I must be getting on, I have trespassed quite enough.
#BELINDA.
And you haven't really seen the garden yet.
#TREMAYNE.
If you won't mind my going on this way, I shall see some more on my way out.
#BELINDA.
Please do. It likes being looked at. All pretty things do.
#TREMAYNE.
Thank you very much. Er -
#BELINDA.
Yes?
#TREMAYNE.
I wonder if you'd mind very much if I called one day to thank you formally for the lesson you gave me in pronunciation?
#BELINDA.
Yes. I almost think you ought to. I think it's the correct thing to do.
#TREMAYNE.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Tremayne.
#BELINDA.
You'll come in quite formally by the front - door next time, won't you, because - because that seems the only chance of my getting to know your name.
#TREMAYNE.
Oh, I beg your pardon. My name is - er - er - Robinson.
#BELINDA.
How very odd!
#TREMAYNE.
Odd?
#BELINDA.
Yes; we have someone called Robinson staying in the house. I wonder if she is any relation?
#TREMAYNE.
Oh no, no. No, she couldn't be. I have no relations called Robinson - not to speak of.
#BELINDA.
You must tell me all about your relations when you come and call, Mr. Robinson.
#TREMAYNE.
I think we can find something better worth talking about than that.
#BELINDA.
Do you think so? O - oh!
#BETTY.
If you please, ma'am, Miss Delia says, are you coming in to tea?
#BELINDA.
Betty,... about callers.... If Mr. Robinson calls - he's the handsome gentleman who hasn't been here before - you will say, "Not at home." And he will say, "Oh!" And you will say, "I beg your pardon, sir, was it Mr. Robinson?" And he will say, "Yes!" And you will say, "Oh, I beg your pardon, sir - " "This way - " - "please!"
#BETTY.
Good morning, sir.
#DEVENISH.
Good morning. I am afraid this is an unceremonious hour for a call, but my sense of beauty urged me hither in defiance of convention.
#BETTY.
Yes, sir.
#DEVENISH.
See, the dew is yet lingering upon them; how could I let them wait until this afternoon?
#BETTY.
Yes, sir; but I think the mistress is out.
#DEVENISH.
They are not for your mistress; they are for Miss Delia.
#BETTY.
Oh, I beg your pardon, sir. If you will come in, I'll see if I can find her.
#DELIA.
Oh, good morning, Mr. Devenish. I'm afraid my - er - aunt is out.
#DEVENISH.
I know, Miss Delia, I know.
#DELIA.
She'll be so sorry to have missed you. It is her day for you, isn't it?
#DEVENISH.
Her day for me?
#DELIA.
Yes; Mr. Baxter generally comes to - morrow, doesn't he?
#DEVENISH.
Miss Delia, if our friendship is to progress at all, it can only be on the distinct understanding that I take no interest whatever in Mr. Baxter's movements.
#DELIA.
Oh, I'm so sorry; I thought you knew. What lovely flowers! Are they for my aunt?
#DEVENISH.
To whom does one bring violets? To modest, shrinking, tender youth.
#DELIA.
I don't think we have anybody here like that.
#DEVENISH.
Miss Delia, they are for you.
#DELIA.
Oh, how nice of you! But I'm afraid I oughtn't to take them from you under false pretences; I don't shrink. fanciful way of putting it, perhaps. They are none the less for you.
#DELIA.
Well, it's awfully kind of you. I'm afraid I'm not a very romantic person. Aunt Belinda does all the romancing in our family.
#DEVENISH.
Your aunt is a very remarkable woman.
#DELIA.
She is. Don't you dare to say a word against her.
#DEVENISH.
My dear Miss Delia, nothing could be further from my thoughts. Why, am I not indebted to her for that great happiness which has come to me in these last few days?
#DELIA.
Good gracious! and I didn't know anything about it. But what about poor Mr. Baxter?
#DEVENISH.
I must beg that Mr. Baxter's name be kept out of our conversation.
#DELIA.
But I thought Mr. Baxter and you - do tell me what's happened. I seem to have lost myself.
#DEVENISH.
What has happened, Miss Delia, is that I have learnt at last the secret that my heart has been striving to tell me for weeks past. As soon as I saw that gracious lady, your aunt, I knew that I was in love. Foolishly I took it for granted that it was she for whom my heart was thrilling. How mistaken I was! Directly you came, you opened my eyes, and now -
#DELIA.
Mr. Devenish, you don't say you're proposing to me?
#DEVENISH.
I am. I feel sure I am. Delia, I love you.
#DELIA.
How exciting of you!
#DEVENISH.
It's nothing; I am a poet.
#DELIA.
You really want to marry me?
#DEVENISH.
Such is my earnest wish.
#DELIA.
But what about my aunt?
#DEVENISH.
She will be my aunt - in - law.
#DELIA.
She'll be rather surprised.
#DEVENISH.
Delia, I will be frank with you. I admit that I made Mrs. Tremayne an offer of marriage.
#DELIA.
You really did? Was it that first afternoon I came?
#DEVENISH.
Yes.
#DELIA.
Oh, I wish I'd been there!
#DEVENISH.
It is not my custom to propose in the presence of a third party. It is true that on the occasion you mention a man called Baxter was on the lawn, but I regarded him no more than the old apple - tree or the flower - beds, or any other of the fixtures.
#DELIA.
What did she say?
#DEVENISH.
She accepted me conditionally.
#DELIA.
Oh, do tell me!
#DEVENISH.
It is rather an unhappy story. This man called Baxter in his vulgar way also made a proposal of marriage. Mrs. Tremayne was gracious enough to imply that she would marry whichever one of us fulfilled a certain condition.
#DELIA.
How sweet of her!
#DEVENISH.
It is my earnest hope, Miss Delia, that the man called Baxter will be the victor. As far as is consistent with honour, I shall endeavour to let Mr. Baxter win.
#DELIA.
What was the condition?
#DEVENISH.
That I am not at liberty to tell. It is, I understand, to be a surprise for you.
#DELIA.
How exciting!... Mr. Devenish, you have been very frank. May I be equally so? Why do you wear your hair so long?
#DEVENISH.
You have noticed it?
#DELIA.
Well, yes, I have.
#DEVENISH.
I wear it so to express my contempt for the conventions of so - called society.
#DELIA.
I always thought that people wore it very very short if they despised the conventions of society.
#DEVENISH.
I think that the mere fact that my hair annoys Mr. Baxter is sufficient justification for its length.
#DELIA.
But if it annoys me too?
#DEVENISH.
It shall go.
#DELIA.
I told you I wasn't a very romantic person, didn't I? You can always grow it again if you fall in love with somebody else.
#DEVENISH.
That is cruel of you, Delia. I shall never fall in love again.
#BELINDA.
Why, it's Mr. Devenish! How nice of you to come so early in the morning! How is Mr. Baxter?
#DEVENISH.
I do not know, Mrs. Tremayne.
#BELINDA.
I got most of the things, Delia. "The things," Mr. Devenish, is my rather stuffy way of referring to all the delightful poems that you are going to eat to - night.
#DEVENISH.
I am looking forward to it immensely, Mrs. Tremayne.
#BELINDA.
I do hope I've got all your and Mr. Baxter's favourite dishes.
#DEVENISH.
I'm afraid Mr. Baxter and I are not likely to appreciate the same things.
#BELINDA.
Oh, Mr. Devenish! And you were so unanimous a few days ago.
#DELIA.
I think Mr. Devenish was referring entirely to things to eat.
#BELINDA.
I felt quite sad when I was buying the lamb cutlets. To think that, only a few days before, they had been frisking about with their mammas, and having poems written about them by Mr. Devenish. There! I'm giving away the whole dinner. Delia, take him away before I tell him any more. We must keep some surprises for him.
#DELIA.
Come along, Mr. Devenish.
#BELINDA.
Are those my flowers, Mr. Devenish?
#DEVENISH.
They are for the most beautiful lady in the land.
#BELINDA.
Oh, how nice of you!
#BELINDA.
I suppose he means Delia - bless them!
#BAXTER.
Er - may I come in, Mrs. Tremayne?
#BELINDA.
Oh, Mr. Baxter, how you surprised me!
#BAXTER.
I must apologize for intruding upon you at this hour, Mrs. Tremayne.
#BELINDA.
Stop!
#BAXTER.
What?
#BELINDA.
I cannot let you come in like that.
#BAXTER.
Like what?
#BELINDA.
You called me Belinda once.
#BAXTER.
May I explain my position, Mrs. Tremayne?
#BELINDA.
Before you begin - have you been seeing my niece lately?
#BAXTER.
No.
#BELINDA.
Oh! Please go on.
#BAXTER.
Why, is she lost too?
#BELINDA.
Oh no; I just - Do sit down. Let me put your hat down somewhere for you.
#BAXTER.
It will be all right here, thank you.
#BELINDA.
I'm dying to hear what you are going to say.
#BAXTER.
First as regards the use of your Christian name. I felt that, as a man of honour, I could not permit myself to use it until I had established my right over that of Mr. Devenish.
#BELINDA.
All my friends call me Belinda.
#BAXTER.
As between myself and Mr. Devenish the case is somewhat different. Until one of us is successful over the other in the quest upon which you have sent us, I feel that as far as possible we should hold aloof from you.
#BELINDA.
Just say "Belinda" once more, in case you're a long time.
#BAXTER.
Belinda.
#BELINDA.
How nicely you say it - Harold.
#BAXTER.
Mrs. Tremayne, I must not listen to this.
#BELINDA.
I won't offend again, Mr. Baxter. Please go on. Tell me about the quest; are you winning?
#BAXTER.
I am progressing, Mrs. Tremayne. Indeed, I came here this morning to acquaint you with the results of my investigations. Yesterday I located a man called Robinson working upon a farm close by. I ventured to ask him if he had any marks upon him by which he could be recognized. He adopted a threatening attitude, and replied that if I wanted any he could give me some. With the aid of half - a - crown I managed to placate him. Putting my inquiry in another form, I asked if he had any moles. regrettable misunderstanding, which led to a fruitless journey to another part of the village, was eventually cleared up, and on my return I satisfied myself that this man was in no way related to your niece.
#BELINDA.
How splendid of you! Well, now, we know he's not.
#BAXTER.
Yes. In the afternoon I located another Mr. Robinson following the profession of a carrier. My first inquiries led to a similar result, with the exception that in this case Mr. Robinson carried his threatening attitude so far as to take off his coat and roll up his sleeves. Perceiving at once that he was not the man, I withdrew.
#BELINDA.
How brave you are! That makes two. It still leaves a good many. Just call me Belinda again.
#BAXTER.
You mustn't tempt me, Mrs. Tremayne.
#BELINDA.
I won't!
#BAXTER.
To resume, then, my narrative. This morning I have heard of a third Mr. Robinson. Whether there is actually any particular fortune attached to the number three I cannot say for certain. It is doubtful whether statistics would be found to support the popular belief. But one likes to flatter oneself that in one's own case it may be true; and so -
#BELINDA.
And so the third Mr. Robinson - ?
#BAXTER.
Something for which I cannot altogether account inspires me with hope. He is, I have discovered, staying at Mariton. This afternoon I go to look for him.
#BELINDA.
Mariton! How funny! I wonder if it's the same one.
#BAXTER.
What one?
#BELINDA.
Oh, just one of the ones. Mr. Baxter, you are doing all this for me.
#BAXTER.
Pray do not mention it. I don't know if it's Devonshire, or the time of the year, or the sort of atmosphere you create, Mrs. Tremayne, but I feel an entirely different man. There is something in the air which - yes, I shall certainly go over to Mariton this afternoon.
#BELINDA.
I have had the same feeling sometimes, Mr. Baxter. I am not always the staid respectable matron which I appear to you to be. Sometimes I - Good gracious!
#BAXTER.
What is it!
#BELINDA.
Mr. Baxter, I'm going to throw myself on your mercy.
#BAXTER.
My dear Mrs. Tremayne -
#BELINDA.
A strange man will be here directly. He must not find you with me.
#BAXTER.
A man?
#BELINDA.
Yes, yes, a man! He is pursuing me with his attentions. If he found you here, there would be a terrible scene.
#BAXTER.
I will defend you from him.
#BELINDA.
No, no. He is a big man. He will - he will overpower you.
#BAXTER.
But you - ?
#BELINDA.
I can defend myself. I will send him away. But he must not find you here. You must hide before he overpowers you.
#BAXTER.
I will withdraw if you wish it.
#BELINDA.
No, not withdraw, hide. He might see you withdrawing. Quick, in here.
#BAXTER.
I don't think I quite -
#BELINDA.
It's perfectly respectable; it's where we keep the umbrellas.
#BAXTER.
I'm not at all sure that I -
#BELINDA.
Oh, but don't you see what trust I'm putting in you? Some people are so nervous about their umbrellas.
#BAXTER.
Well, of course, if you - but I don't see why I shouldn't just slip out of the door before he comes.
#BELINDA.
Of course, if you grudge me every little pleasure - Quick! Here he is.
#TREMAYNE.
It's no good your pretending to be surprised, because you said I could come.
#BELINDA.
But I can still be surprised that you wanted to come. Oh no, you aren't.
#BELINDA.
Just a little bit - that much.
#TREMAYNE.
It would be much more surprising if I hadn't come.
#BELINDA.
It is a pretty garden, isn't it?
#TREMAYNE.
You forget that I saw the garden yesterday.
#BELINDA.
Oh, but the things have grown so much since then. Let me see, this is the third day you've been and we only met three days ago. And then you're coming to dinner again to - night.
#TREMAYNE.
Am I?
#BELINDA.
Yes. Haven't you been asked?
#TREMAYNE.
No, not a word.
#BELINDA.
Yes, that's quite right; I remember now, I only thought of it this morning, so I couldn't ask you before, could I?
#TREMAYNE.
What made you think of it then?
#BELINDA.
It was at the butcher's. There was one little lamb cutlet left over and sitting out all by itself, and there was nobody to love it. And I said to myself, suddenly, "I know, that will do for Mr. Robinson." I do hope you like lamb?
#TREMAYNE.
I adore it.
#BELINDA.
Oh, I'm so glad! When I saw it sitting there I thought you'd love it. I'm afraid I can't tell you any more about the rest of the dinner, because I wouldn't tell Mr. Devenish, and I want to be fair.
#TREMAYNE.
Who's Mr. Devenish?
#BELINDA.
Oh, haven't you met him? He's always coming here. Is he in love with you too?
#BELINDA.
Too? Oh, you mean Mr. Baxter.
#TREMAYNE.
Confound it, that's three!
#BELINDA.
Three?
#TREMAYNE.
Who is Mr. Baxter?
#BELINDA.
Oh, haven't you met him? He's always coming here.
#TREMAYNE.
Who is Mr. Baxter?
#BELINDA.
Oh, he's a sort of statistician. Isn't that a horrid word to say? So stishany.
#TREMAYNE.
What does he make statistics about?
#BELINDA.
Oh, umbrellas and things. Don't let's talk about him.
#TREMAYNE.
All right, then; who is Mr. Devenish?
#BELINDA.
Oh, he's a poet. Ah me!
#TREMAYNE.
What does he write poetry about? What does he write poetry about?
#BELINDA.
He wrote "The Lute of Love and other Poems, by Claude Devenish." The Lute of Love - I haven't been saying that lately. The Lute of Love - the Lute.
#TREMAYNE.
And what is Mr. Devenish -
#BELINDA.
You'll let me know when it's my turn, won't you?
#TREMAYNE.
Your turn?
#BELINDA.
Yes, to ask questions. I love this game - it's like clumps.
#TREMAYNE.
I beg your pardon. I - er - of course have no right to cross - examine you like this.
#BELINDA.
Oh, do go on, I love it. I've got my question ready.
#TREMAYNE.
I think perhaps it is your turn.
#BELINDA.
Is it really? Well then - who is Mr. Robinson?
#TREMAYNE.
What?
#BELINDA.
I think it's a fair question. I met you three days ago and you told me you were staying at Mariton. Mariton. You can say it all right now, can't you?
#TREMAYNE.
I think so.
#BELINDA.
Just say it.
#TREMAYNE.
Mariton.
#BELINDA.
Lovely! I don't think any of the villagers do it as well as that.
#TREMAYNE.
Well?
#BELINDA.
Well, that was three days ago. You came the next day to see the garden, and you came the day after to see the garden, and you've come this morning - to see the garden; and you're coming to dinner to - night, and it's so lovely, we shall simply have to go into the garden afterwards. And all I know about you is that you haven't any relations called Robinson.
#TREMAYNE.
What do I know about Mrs. Tremayne but that she has a relation called Robinson?
#BELINDA.
And two dear friends called Devenish and Baxter.
#TREMAYNE.
I was forgetting them.
#BELINDA.
I mustn't forget Mr. Baxter.
#TREMAYNE.
But what does it matter? What would it matter if I knew nothing about you? I know everything about you - everything that matters.
#BELINDA.
Tell me some of them.
#TREMAYNE.
Belinda -
#BELINDA.
He's going to propose to me. I can feel it coming.
#TREMAYNE.
Confound it! how many men have proposed to you?
#BELINDA.
Since when?
#TREMAYNE.
Since your first husband proposed to you.
#BELINDA.
Oh, I thought you meant this year. Well now, let me see. One. Two. Three. No, I don't think that one ought to count really. Three, four, five - do you want the names or just the total?
#TREMAYNE.
This is horrible.
#BELINDA.
But anybody can propose. Now if you'd asked how many I'd accepted - Let me see, where was I up to? I shan't count yours, because I haven't really had it yet. Six, seven - Yes, Betty, what is it?
#BETTY.
If you please, ma'am, cook would like to speak to you for a minute.
#BELINDA.
Yes, I'll come. You'll forgive me, won't you? You'll find some cigarettes there. It's probably about the lamb cutlets; I expect your little one refuses to be cooked.
#DEVENISH.
Hullo! Hullo!... Are you Mr. Devenish?
#DEVENISH.
Yes.
#TREMAYNE.
Devenish the poet?
#DEVENISH.
My dear fellow, you know my work?
#TREMAYNE.
My dear Mr. Devenish, your name is most familiar to me.
#DEVENISH.
I congratulate you. I thought your great - grandchildren would be the first to hear of me.
#TREMAYNE.
My name's Robinson, by the way.
#DEVENISH.
Then let me return the compliment, Robinson. Your name is familiar to me.
#TREMAYNE.
I don't think I'm related to any Robinsons you know.
#DEVENISH.
Well, no, I suppose not. When I was very much younger I began a collection of Robinsons. Actually it was only three days ago, but it seems much longer. Many things have happened since then.
#TREMAYNE.
Really!
#DEVENISH.
There is a man called Baxter who is still collecting, I believe. For myself, I am only interested in one of the great family - Delia.
#TREMAYNE.
You are interested in her?
#DEVENISH.
Devotedly. In fact, I am at this moment waiting for her to put on her hat.
#TREMAYNE.
My dear Devenish, I am delighted to make your acquaintance. How are you?
#DEVENISH.
Fairly well, thanks.
#TREMAYNE.
That's right.
#DEVENISH.
You are a very lucky fellow, Robinson.
#TREMAYNE.
In what way?
#DEVENISH.
People you meet must be so very reluctant to say good - bye to you. Have you ever tried strangling lions or anything like that?
#TREMAYNE.
Well, as a matter of fact, I have.
#DEVENISH.
I suppose you won all right?
#TREMAYNE.
In the end, with the help of my beater.
#DEVENISH.
Personally I should have backed you alone against any two ordinary lions.
#TREMAYNE.
One was quite enough. As it was, he gave me something to remember him by.
#DEVENISH.
By Jove, that's a nasty one! Good heavens!
#TREMAYNE.
What's the matter?
#DEVENISH.
Wait. Let me think. Have you ever met a man called Baxter?
#TREMAYNE.
No.
#DEVENISH.
Would you like to?
#TREMAYNE.
Very much indeed.
#DEVENISH.
He's the man I told you about who's interested in Robinsons. He'll be delighted to meet you. Funny thing, he's rather an authority on lions. You must show him that scar of yours; it will intrigue him immensely. Don't shake hands with him too heartily just at first; it might put him off the whole thing.
#TREMAYNE.
This Mr. Baxter seems to be a curious man.
#DEVENISH.
Yes, he is rather odd. I wonder if I - I suppose you won't be -
#TREMAYNE.
What's that!
#DEVENISH.
Come in.
#BAXTER.
Oh, I just - I just -
#DEVENISH.
Baxter! Come in, Baxter, old man; you're just the very person I wanted. Good man. This is Mr. Baxter that I was telling you about.
#TREMAYNE.
Oh, is this Mr. Baxter? How are you, Mr. Baxter?
#DEVENISH.
Steady! Baxter, this is Mr. Robinson. R - o - b - i - n - s - o - n.
#BAXTER.
Really? I am very glad to meet you, sir.
#TREMAYNE.
Very good of you to say so.
#DEVENISH.
Robinson is a great big - game hunter.
#BAXTER.
Indeed? I have never done anything in that way myself, but I'm sure it must be an absorbing pursuit.
#TREMAYNE.
Oh, well, it's something to do.
#DEVENISH.
You must get him to tell you about a wrestle he had with a lion once. Extraordinary story! Jove! I must be off. See you again, Baxter. Good - bye, Robinson. No, don't shake hands. I'm in a hurry.
#TREMAYNE.
Unusual man, your friend Devenish. I suppose it comes of being a poet.
#BAXTER.
I have no great liking for Mr. Devenish -
#TREMAYNE.
Oh, he's all right.
#BAXTER.
But I am sure that if he is impressed by anything outside himself or his own works, it must be something rather remarkable. Pray tell me of your adventure with the lion.
#TREMAYNE.
Really, you mustn't think that I go about telling everybody my adventures. It just happened to come up. I'm afraid I shook his hand rather more warmly than I meant, and he asked me if I'd ever tried strangling lions. That was all.
#BAXTER.
And had you?
#TREMAYNE.
Well, it just happened that I had.
#BAXTER.
Indeed! You came off scathless, I trust?
#TREMAYNE.
Well, he got me one across there.
#BAXTER.
Really, really. One across there. Not bad, I hope?
#TREMAYNE.
Well, it doesn't show unless I do that.
#BAXTER.
Good heavens! I've found it!
#TREMAYNE.
Found what?
#BAXTER.
I must see Mrs. Tremayne. Where's Mrs. Tremayne?
#TREMAYNE.
She went out just now. What's the matter?
#BAXTER.
Out! I must find her. This is a matter of life and death.
#BELINDA.
Such a to - do in the kitchen! The cook's given notice - at least she will directly - and your lamb cutlet slipped back to the shop when nobody was looking, and I've got to go into the village again, and oh dear, oh dear, I have such a lot of things to do! Oh yes, that's another one. Mr. Robinson, you will have to leave me. Farewell.
#TREMAYNE.
Belinda -
#BELINDA.
No, not even Belinda. Wait till this evening.
#TREMAYNE.
I have a thousand things to say to you; I shall say them this evening.
#BELINDA.
Begin about eight o'clock. Good - bye till then.
#BELINDA.
Mr. Baxter, Mr. Baxter, you may come in now; he has withdrawn. I have unhanded him. Oh!
#BAXTER.
Ah, there you are!
#BELINDA.
Oh, how you frightened me, Mr. Baxter! I couldn't think what had happened to you. I thought perhaps you'd been eaten up by one of the umbrellas.
#BAXTER.
Mrs. Tremayne, I have some wonderful news for you. I have found Miss Robinson's father.
#BELINDA.
Miss Robinson's father?
#BAXTER.
Yes. Mr. Robinson.
#BELINDA.
Oh, you mean - Oh yes, he told me his name was Robinson - Oh, but he's no relation.
#BAXTER.
Wait! I saw his arm. By a subterfuge I managed to see his arm.
#BELINDA.
You saw -
#BAXTER.
I saw the mole.
#BELINDA.
Show me.
#BAXTER.
There!
#BELINDA.
And I didn't know!
#BAXTER.
Mrs. Tremayne, I am delighted to have done this service for your niece -
#BELINDA.
Of course, he knew all the time.
#BAXTER.
Still more am I delighted to have gained the victory over Mr. Devenish in this enterprise.
#BELINDA.
Eighteen years - but I ought to have known.
#BAXTER.
I shall not be accused of exaggerating when I say that the odds against such an enterprise were enormous.
#BELINDA.
Eighteen years - And now I've eight whole hours to wait!
#BAXTER.
It will be announced to - night. "Mr. Devenish," I shall say, "young fellow - "
#BELINDA.
So I was right, after all! He does look better without a beard!
#BAXTER.
"Mr. Devenish, young fellow, when you matched yourself against a man of my repute, when you matched yourself against a man" - "who has read papers at soirées of the Royal Statistical Society; when - er - "
#DELIA.
What rubbish he writes!
#BELINDA.
Who, dear?
#DELIA.
Claude - Mr. Devenish. Of course, he's very young.
#BELINDA.
So was Keats, darling.
#DELIA.
I don't think Claude has had Keats' advantages. Keats started life as an apothecary.
#BELINDA.
So much nicer than a chemist.
#DELIA.
Now, Claude started with nothing to do.
#BELINDA.
Do you always call him Claude, darling? I hope you aren't going to grow into a flirt like that horrid Mrs. Tremayne.
#DELIA.
Silly mother! I don't think he'll ever be any good till he really gets work. Did you notice his hair this evening?
#BELINDA.
Whose, dear?
#DELIA.
Mummy, look me in the eye and tell me you are not being bad.
#BELINDA.
Bad, darling?
#DELIA.
You've made Mr. Robinson fall in love with you.
#BELINDA.
Have I?
#DELIA.
Yes; it's serious this time. He's not like the other two.
#BELINDA.
However did you know that?
#DELIA.
Oh, I know.
#BELINDA.
Darling, I believe you've grown up. It's quite time I settled down.
#DELIA.
With Mr. Robinson?
#BELINDA.
Delia, are you prepared for a great secret to be revealed to you?
#DELIA.
Oh, I love secrets.
#BELINDA.
Darling, you mustn't take it like that. This is a great, deep, dark secret; you'll probably need your sal volatile.
#DELIA.
Go on!
#BELINDA.
Well - Shall we have the lights down a little?
#DELIA.
Go on, mummy.
#BELINDA.
Well, Mr. Robinson is - is not quite the Robinson he appears to be.
#DELIA.
Yes?
#BELINDA.
In fact, child, he is - Hadn't you better come and hold your mother's hand?
#DELIA.
Go on.
#BELINDA.
Well, Mr. Robinson is a - sort of relation of yours; in fact - he is your - father. Dear one, this is not a matter for mirth.
#DELIA.
Darling, it is lovely, isn't it? I am laughing because I am so happy.
#BELINDA.
Aren't you surprised?
#DELIA.
No. You see, Claude told me this morning. He found out just before Mr. Baxter.
#BELINDA.
Well! Every one seems to have known except me.
#DELIA.
Didn't you see how friendly father and I got at dinner? I thought I'd better start breaking the ice - because I suppose he'll be kissing me directly.
#BELINDA.
Say you like him.
#DELIA.
I think he's going to be awfully nice. Does he know you know?
#BELINDA.
Not yet. Just at present I've rather got Mr. Baxter on my mind. I suppose, darling, you wouldn't like him as well as Mr. Devenish! You see, they're so used to going about together.
#DELIA.
Claude is quite enough.
#BELINDA.
I think I must see Mr. Baxter and get it over. Do you mind if I have Mr. Devenish too? I feel more at home with both of them. I'll give you him back. Oh dear, I feel so happy to - night! And is my little girl going to be happy too? That's what mothers always say on the stage. I think it's so sweet.
#DELIA.
Yes, I think so, mummy. Of course, I'm not romantic like you. I expect I'm more like father, really.
#BELINDA.
Jack can be romantic now. He was telling me this morning all about the people he has proposed to. I mean, I was telling him. Anyhow, he wasn't a bit like a father. Of course, he doesn't know he is a father yet. Darling, I think you might take him into the garden; only don't let him know who he is. You see, he ought to propose to me first, oughtn't he? Here you all are! I do hope you haven't been throwing away your cigars, because smoking is allowed all over the house.
#TREMAYNE.
Oh, we've finished, thank you.
#BELINDA.
Isn't it a wonderful night? - and so warm for April. Delia, you must show Mr. Robinson the garden by moonlight - it's the only light he hasn't seen it by.
#DEVENISH.
I don't think I've ever seen it by moonlight, Miss Delia.
#BELINDA.
I thought poets were always seeing things by moonlight.
#BAXTER.
I was hoping, Mrs. Tremayne, that - er - perhaps -
#DELIA.
Come along, Mr. Robinson.
#TREMAYNE.
It's very kind of you, Miss Robinson. I suppose there is no chance of a nightingale?
#BELINDA.
There ought to be. I ordered one specially for Mr. Devenish. Now we're together again. Well, Mr. Devenish?
#DEVENISH.
Er - I -
#BELINDA.
No; I think I'll let Mr. Baxter speak first. I know he's longing to.
#BAXTER.
Yes. H'r'm! Mrs. Tremayne, I beg formally to claim your hand.
#BELINDA.
On what grounds, Mr. Baxter?
#DEVENISH.
Yes, sir, on what grounds?
#BAXTER.
On the grounds that, as I told you this morning, I had succeeded in the quest.
#DEVENISH.
Succeeded?
#BAXTER.
Yes, Mr. Devenish, young fellow, you have lost. I have discovered the missing Mr. Robinson.
#DEVENISH.
Who - where -
#BAXTER.
Miss Robinson has at this moment gone out with her father.
#DEVENISH.
Good heavens! It was he!
#BELINDA.
Poor Mr. Devenish!
#DEVENISH.
And to think that I actually sat on that table - no, that seat - no, not that one, it was the sofa - that I sat on the sofa with him this morning, and never guessed! Why, ten minutes ago I was asking him for the nuts!
#BAXTER.
Aha, Devenish, you're not so clever as you thought you were.
#DEVENISH.
Why, I must have given you the clue myself! He told me he had a scar on his arm, and I never thought any more of it. And then I went away innocently and left you two talking about it.
#BELINDA.
A scar on his arm?
#DEVENISH.
Where a lion mauled him.
#BAXTER.
It's quite healed up now, Mrs. Tremayne.
#BELINDA.
A lion! What you two have adventured for my sake!
#BAXTER.
I suppose you will admit, Devenish, that I may fairly claim to have won?
#BELINDA.
Mr. Devenish, I have never admired you so much as I do at this moment.
#BAXTER.
I say, you know, that's not fair. It's all very well to take your defeat like a man, but you mustn't overdo it. Mrs. Tremayne, I claim the reward which I have earned.
#BELINDA.
Mr. Baxter - Mr. Devenish, I have something to tell you. I have not been quite frank with you. I think you both ought to know that - I - I made a mistake. Delia is not my niece; she is my daughter.
#DEVENISH.
Your daughter! I say, how ripping!
#BAXTER.
Your daughter!
#BELINDA.
Yes.
#BAXTER.
But - but you aren't old enough to have a daughter of that age.
#BELINDA.
Well, there she is.
#BAXTER.
But - but she's grown up.
#BELINDA.
Quite.
#BAXTER.
Then in that case you must be -
#BELINDA.
I'm afraid so, Mr. Baxter.
#BAXTER.
But this makes a great difference. I had no idea. Why, when I'm fifty you would be -
#BELINDA.
Yes, I suppose I should.
#BAXTER.
And when I'm sixty -
#BELINDA.
Can't you stop him?
#DEVENISH.
Look here, Baxter, another word from you and you'll never get to sixty.
#BAXTER.
And then there's Miss - er - Delia. In the event of our marrying, Mrs. Tremayne, she, I take it, would be my step - daughter.
#BELINDA.
I don't think she would trouble us much, Mr. Baxter. I have an idea that she will be getting married before long.
#BAXTER.
None the less, the fact would be disturbing. I have never yet considered myself seriously as a step - father. I don't think I am going too far if I say that to some extent I have been deceived in this matter.
#BELINDA.
And so have I. I thought you loved me.
#DEVENISH.
Yes, yes.
#BELINDA.
And Mr. Devenish too.
#BAXTER.
Er -
#DEVENISH.
Er -
#BELINDA.
Well, I shall have to marry somebody else, that's all.
#BAXTER.
Who?
#BELINDA.
I suppose Mr. Robinson. After all, if I am Delia's mother, and Mr. Baxter says that Mr. Robinson's her father, it's about time we were married.
#DEVENISH.
Mrs. Tremayne, what fools we are! He is your husband all the time!
#BELINDA.
Yes.
#BAXTER.
You've had a husband all the time?
#BELINDA.
I lost him; it wasn't my fault.
#BAXTER.
Really, this is very confusing. I don't know where I am. I gather - I am to gather, it seems, that you are no longer eligible as a possible wife?
#BELINDA.
I am afraid not, Mr. Baxter.
#BAXTER.
But this is very confusing - this is very disturbing to a man of my age. For weeks past I have been regarding myself as a - a possible benedict. I have - ah - taken steps. Only this morning, in writing to my housekeeper, I warned her that she might hear at any moment a most startling announcement.
#DEVENISH.
Oh, that's all right. That might only mean that you were getting a new bowler - hat.
#BAXTER.
Ah, and what about you, sir? How is it that you take this so lightly? I have it. It all becomes clear to me. You have transferred your affections to her daughter!
#DEVENISH.
Oh, I say, Baxter, this is very crude.
#BELINDA.
And why should he not, Mr. Baxter? He has made me very happy.
#BAXTER.
He has made you happy, Mrs. Tremayne!
#BELINDA.
Very happy.
#BAXTER.
Ah! Mrs. Tremayne, I have taken a great resolve. I also will make you happy. I also will woo Miss Delia. Come, we will seek Miss Delia together. It may be that she will send us upon another quest in which I shall again be victorious. Come, I say!
#DEVENISH.
Please!
#BELINDA.
Mr. Baxter... Harold. You are too impetuous. I think that as Delia's mother -
#BAXTER.
Your pardon, Mrs. Tremayne. In the intoxication of the moment I am forgetting. I have the honour to ask your permission to pay my addresses -
#BELINDA.
No, no, I didn't mean that. But, as Delia's mother, I ought to warn you that she is hardly fitted to take the place of your housekeeper. She is not very domesticated.
#BAXTER.
Not domesticated? Why, did I not hear her tell her father at dinner that she had arranged all the flowers?
#BELINDA.
There are other things than flowers.
#DEVENISH.
Bed - socks, for instance, Baxter. It's a very tricky thing airing bed - socks. I am sure your house - keeper -
#BAXTER.
Mrs. Tremayne, she will learn. The daughter of such a mother... I need say no more.
#BELINDA.
Oh, thank you. But there is something else, Mr. Baxter. You are not being quite fair to yourself. In starting out upon this simultaneous wooing, you forget that Mr. Devenish has already had his turn this morning alone. You should have yours... alone... too.
#DEVENISH.
Oh, I say!
#BAXTER.
Yes, yes, you are right. I must introduce myself first as a suitor. I see that. You stay here; I will go alone into the garden, and -
#BELINDA.
It is perhaps a little cold out of doors for people of... of our age, Mr. Baxter. Now, in the library -
#BAXTER.
Library?
#BELINDA.
Yes.
#BAXTER.
You have a library?
#BELINDA.
He doesn't believe I have a library.
#DEVENISH.
You ought to see the library, Baxter.
#BAXTER.
But you are continually springing surprises on me this evening, Mrs. Tremayne. First a daughter, then a husband, and then - a library! I have been here three weeks, and I never knew you had a library. Dear me, I wonder how it is that I never saw it?
#BELINDA.
I thought you came to see me.
#BAXTER.
Yes, yes, to see you, certainly. But if I had known you had a library....
#BELINDA.
Oh, I am so glad I mentioned it. Wasn't it lucky, Mr. Devenish?
#BAXTER.
My work has been greatly handicapped of late by lack of certain books to which I wanted to refer. It would be a great help -
#BELINDA.
My dear Mr. Baxter, my whole library is at your disposal. I'm just going to show him the "Encyclopedia Britannica."
#DELIA.
Hullo, we're just coming in.
#TREMAYNE.
Where's Mrs. Tremayne?
#DEVENISH.
She's gone to the library with Baxter.
#TREMAYNE.
Oh, the library. Where's that?
#DEVENISH.
The end door on the right. Right at the end. You can't mistake it. On the right.
#TREMAYNE.
Ah, yes. Yes. Yes.
#DEVENISH.
I say, your mother is a ripper.
#DELIA.
Isn't she! At least, you mean my aunt?
#DEVENISH.
No, I mean your mother. To think that I once had the cheek to propose to her.
#DELIA.
Oh! Is it cheek to propose to people!
#DEVENISH.
To her.
#DELIA.
But not to me?
#DEVENISH.
Oh I say, Delia!
#DELIA.
Thank you, my name is Miss Robinson - I mean, Tremayne.
#DEVENISH.
Well, if you're not quite sure which it is, it's much safer to call you Delia.
#DELIA.
Well, perhaps it is.
#DEVENISH.
And if I did propose to you, you haven't answered
#DELIA.
If you want an answer now, it's no; but if you like to wait till next April -
#DEVENISH.
Oh, I say, and I cut my hair for you the same afternoon. You haven't really told me how you like it yet.
#DELIA.
Oh, how bad of me! You look lovely.
#DEVENISH.
And I promised to give up poetry for your sake.
#DELIA.
Perhaps I oughtn't to have asked you that.
#DEVENISH.
As far as I'm concerned, Delia, I'll do it gladly, but, of course, one has to think about posterity.
#DELIA.
But you needn't be a poet. You could give posterity plenty to think about if you were a statesman.
#DEVENISH.
I don't quite see your objection to poetry.
#DELIA.
You would be about the house so much. I want you to go away every day and do great things, and then come home in the evening and tell me all about it.
#DEVENISH.
Then you are thinking of marrying me!
#DELIA.
Well, I was just thinking in case I had to.
#DEVENISH.
It would be rather fun if you did. And look here - I will be a statesman, if you like, and go up to Downing Street every day, and come back in the evening and tell you all about it.
#DELIA.
How nice of you!
#DEVENISH.
Farewell, Parnassus!
#DELIA.
What does that mean?
#DEVENISH.
Well, it means that I've chucked poetry. A statesman's life is the life for me; behold Mr. Devenish, the new M.P. - no, look here, that was quite accidental.
#DELIA.
I believe I shall really like you when I get to know you.
#DEVENISH.
I don't know if it's you, or Devonshire, or the fact that I've had my hair cut, but I feel quite a different being from what I was three days ago.
#DELIA.
You are different. Perhaps it's your sense of humour coming back.
#DEVENISH.
Perhaps that's it. It's a curious feeling.
#DELIA.
Let's go outside; there's a heavenly moon.
#DEVENISH.
Moon? Moon? Now where have I heard that word before?
#DELIA.
What do you mean?
#DEVENISH.
I was trying not to be a poet. Well, I'll come with you, but I shall refuse to look at it. The Prime Minister then left the House.
#BELINDA.
Thank you. I don't think it's unkind to leave him, do you? He seemed quite happy.
#TREMAYNE.
I shouldn't have been happy if we'd stayed.
#BELINDA.
Yes, but I was really thinking of Mr. Baxter.
#TREMAYNE.
Not of me?
#BELINDA.
Well, I thought it was Mr. Baxter's turn. Poor man, he's had a disappointment lately.
#TREMAYNE.
A disappointment?
#BELINDA.
Yes, he thought I was - younger than I was.
#TREMAYNE.
How old are you, Belinda?
#BELINDA.
Twenty - two. He thought I was eighteen. Such a disappointment!
#TREMAYNE.
Belinda, how old are you?
#BELINDA.
Just about the right age, Mr. Robinson.
#TREMAYNE.
The right age for what?
#BELINDA.
For this sort of conversation.
#TREMAYNE.
Shall I tell you how old you are?
#BELINDA.
Do you mean in figures or - poetically?
#TREMAYNE.
I meant -
#BELINDA.
Mr. Devenish said I was as old as the - now, I must get this the right way round - as old as the -
#TREMAYNE.
I don't want to talk about Mr. Devenish.
#BELINDA.
Nobody ever does - except Mr. Devenish. As old as the stars, and as young as the dawn. I think that's rather a nice age to be, don't you? very nice age to be.
#BELINDA.
It's a pity he's thrown me over for Delia; I shall miss that sort of thing rather. You don't say those sort of things about your aunt - in - law - not so often.
#TREMAYNE.
He really is in love with Miss Robinson!
#BELINDA.
Oh yes. I expect he is out in the moonlight with her now, comparing her to Diana.
#TREMAYNE.
Well, that accounts for him. Now what about Baxter?
#BELINDA.
I thought I told you. Deeply disappointed to find that I was four years older than he expected, Mr. Baxter hurried from the drawing - room and buried himself in a column of the "Encyclopedia Britannica."
#TREMAYNE.
Well, that settles Baxter. Are there any more men in the neighbourhood?
#BELINDA.
Isn't it awful? I've only had those two for the last three weeks.
#TREMAYNE.
Belinda.
#BELINDA.
Yes, Henry!
#TREMAYNE.
My name is John.
#BELINDA.
Well, you never told me. I had to guess. Everybody thinks they can call me Belinda without giving me the least idea what their own names are. You were saying, John?
#TREMAYNE.
My friends call me Jack.
#BELINDA.
Jack Robinson. That's the man who always goes away so quickly. I hope you're making more of a stay?
#TREMAYNE.
Oh, you maddening, maddening woman!
#BELINDA.
Well, I have to keep the conversation going. You do nothing but say "Belinda."
#TREMAYNE.
Have you ever loved anybody seriously, Belinda?
#BELINDA.
I don't ever do anything very seriously. The late Mr. Tremayne, my first husband - Jack - Isn't it funny, his name was Jack - he used to complain about it too sometimes.
#TREMAYNE.
Silly ass!
#BELINDA.
Ah, I think you are a little hard on the late Mr. Tremayne.
#TREMAYNE.
Has he been dead long?
#BELINDA.
Dead to me.
#TREMAYNE.
You quarrelled?
#BELINDA.
Yes. It was his fault entirely.
#TREMAYNE.
I'm sure it was.
#BELINDA.
How sweet of you to say that!
#TREMAYNE.
Belinda, I want you to marry me and forget about him.
#BELINDA.
This is the proposal that those lamb cutlets interrupted this morning.
#TREMAYNE.
Belinda, I love you - do you understand?
#BELINDA.
Suppose my first husband turns up suddenly like - like E. A.?
#TREMAYNE.
Like who?
#BELINDA.
Well, like anybody.
#TREMAYNE.
He won't - I know he won't. Don't you love me enough to risk it, Belinda?
#BELINDA.
I haven't really said I love you at all yet.
#TREMAYNE.
Well, say it now. You do! Well, I'm going to have a kiss, anyway, There!
#BELINDA.
O - oh! The late Mr. Tremayne never did that.
#TREMAYNE.
I have already told you that he was a silly ass. Belinda -
#BELINDA.
Yes, Henry - I mean, Jack?
#TREMAYNE.
Do you know who I am!
#BELINDA.
Yes, Jack.
#TREMAYNE.
Who?
#BELINDA.
Jack Tremayne.
#TREMAYNE.
Good heavens, you know!
#BELINDA.
Yes, Jack.
#TREMAYNE.
You've known all the time that I was your husband, and you've been playing with me and leading me on?
#BELINDA.
Well, darling, you knew all the time that I was your wife, and you've been making love to me and leading me on.
#TREMAYNE.
That's different.
#BELINDA.
That's just what the late Mr. Tremayne said, and then he slammed the door and went straight off to the Rocky Mountains and shot bears; and I didn't see him again for eighteen years.
#TREMAYNE.
Darling, I was a fool then, and I'm a fool now.
#BELINDA.
I was a fool then, but I'm not such a fool now - I'm not going to let you go. It's quite time I married and settled down.
#TREMAYNE.
You darling! How did you find out who I was?
#BELINDA.
Well, it was rather curious, darling. It was April, and I felt all sort of Aprily, and - and - there was the garden all full of daffodils - and - and there was Mr. Baxter - the one we left in the library - knowing all about moles. He's probably got the M volume down now. Well, we were talking about them one day, and I happened to say that the late Mr. Tremayne - that was you, darling - had rather a peculiar one on his arm. And then he happened to see it this morning and told me about it.
#TREMAYNE.
What an extraordinary story!
#BELINDA.
Yes, darling; it's really much more extraordinary than that. I think perhaps I'd better tell you the rest of it another time. Now show me where the nasty lion scratched you. Oh! You shouldn't have left Chelsea, darling.
#TREMAYNE.
I should never have found you if I hadn't.
#BELINDA.
No, Jack, you wouldn't. I - I've got another little surprise for you if - if you're ready for it. Properly speaking, I ought to be wearing white. I shall certainly stand up while I'm telling you. Darling, we have a daughter - our little Delia.
#TREMAYNE.
Delia? You said her name was Robinson.
#BELINDA.
Yes, darling, but you said yours was. One always takes one's father's name. Unless, of course, you were Lord Robinson.
#TREMAYNE.
But you said her name was Robinson before you - oh, never mind about that. A daughter? Belinda, how could you let me go and not tell me?
#BELINDA.
You forget how you'd slammed the door. It isn't the sort of thing you shout through the window to a man on his way to America.
#TREMAYNE.
Oh, Belinda, don't let me ever go away again.
#BELINDA.
I'm not going to, Jack. I'm going to settle down into a staid old married woman.
#TREMAYNE.
Oh no, you're not. You're going on just as you did before. And I'm going to propose to you every April, and win you, over all the other men in love with you.
#BELINDA.
You darling!
#TREMAYNE.
Our daughter.
#DELIA.
You're my father.
#TREMAYNE.
If you don't mind very much, Delia.
#DELIA.
You've been away a long time.
#TREMAYNE.
I'll do my best to make up for it.
#BELINDA.
Delia, darling, I think you might kiss your poor old father.
#DEVENISH.
Just in case you're going to be my mother - in - law.
#TREMAYNE.
We seem to be rather a family party.
#BELINDA.
There! We've forgotten Mr. Baxter again.
#BAXTER.
Oh, don't mind about me, Mrs. Tremayne. I've enjoyed myself immensely. I have been collecting some most valuable information on lunacy in the - er - county of Devonshire.
