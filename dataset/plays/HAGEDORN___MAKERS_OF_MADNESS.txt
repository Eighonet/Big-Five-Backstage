#MINISTER OF WAR.
I can only repeat, gentlemen, what his Excellency, the Chief of Staff, has already made clear to you. Nothing has been decided. You have your orders in your pockets. There may be war and there may not be war. I understand, gentlemen, your natural impatience once more to draw the naked steel for the glory of our country, and you may rest assured that his gracious majesty, the King, will not forget that his fame and the happiness of his people rests ultimately in your hands. Personally, as a man of family and as a Christian, I hope to God that peace may be preserved. But if God wills that our enemy, by his insolence, forces us to draw the sword, I know that you will wield it with honor and will not sheathe it until our enemy is crushed, root and branch, stock and barrel, and brought so low that he will never raise his head again in dishonorable defiance of our holy rights. That is all, gentlemen. But I recommend that you do not send your service uniforms to the tailor tonight. You may have need of them.
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
We are ready. But the King! The peace propagandists are after him. Mediation is the magic word. Mediation - by which the neutral nations block our legitimate road to victory for their own benefit, in the name of civilization and progress.
#GENERAL.
Old women's talk. Give me a sword in my right hand again, I say! I'll break open a few skulls yet, for all my sixty years. Eh? Mediation! Let those mediate, I say, who are afraid to fight!
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
We are not mediating yet. You may tell that to your friends if they become downhearted.
#GENERAL.
To command, your Excellency! It is good that some one looks out for the honor of the army. Good night, gentlemen!
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
Ha! Once more to have those fellows behind me. Think of it! Each man of them represents fifty thousand. And behind them another million and another! God! What a machine to handle. And the old brain working still!
#MINISTER OF WAR.
I don't know, Clement. I am growing old. I think sometimes that war is the most terrible matter in which we erring humans become engaged. I have always thought that - at times.
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
So you are a sentimentalist, after all?
#MINISTER OF WAR.
No. Because there is something stronger in me, conquering the repulsion. My temperament, character, destiny. I am impelled to war. A dozen generations of soldiers in my blood press me on. My whole education presses me on. My sympathies and my religious sense make me tremble before the impending horror, but - I confess to you - I believe I want this war.
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
So do we all. War is the soldier's work. And he does not want to play all his life. Look. We land here and here and here. No defenses, except at this place - a masonry fort built thirty years ago. Bad cement, moreover. Fraudulent contractor. Then -
#MINISTER OF WAR.
No, you old hawk, we're not going to do it. We'll be content to settle ourselves in peaceful graves, you and I and the old Chief. No war, no war!
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
That is sentiment. Here is fact. We land here and here and here. Then march down here and up there, uniting the armies. Rich country. I've never seen it, but I know it better than any letter - carrier in the district. We live on the land, burning and pillaging if the inhabitants don't give us what we want. A little dose will tame them. We'll sweep all before us in six weeks.
#MINISTER OF WAR.
Stop, man, stop! You make me want to try it.
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
I can't stop. It's a game with me. I play it all day in my thoughts and all night I direct campaigns in my dreams. A great game. Only sometimes I get tired of playing it on paper, and want to hear the real guns and see the real battalions.
#SECRETARY.
message from the King sent over from the Foreign Office. The Prime Minister was not there.
#MINISTER OF WAR.
Let me have it. What? That will do.
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
Well?
#MINISTER OF WAR.
Look at this, look at it! The King is sending our national honor to the dogs. He has secretly resumed communication with the Ambassador of the Republic, instead of doing what was natural and constitutional, sending the man to us. He is going to compromise. Pack up your tin soldiers, old man. Take them home for your grandchildren to play with. Our country evidently has no more use for them.
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
Show me. "The King desires to inform the Foreign Office that, in pursuance of his well - known love of peace, he sent for the Ambassador of the Republic this afternoon and outlined a plan that would satisfy the royal government and at the same time yield certain points to the government of the Republic. The Ambassador was courteous, but, although acknowledging the generosity of the King's offer, regretted that he was unable to consider any compromise before communicating again with his government. The King replied that if his offers were refused he could then have nothing further to say in the matter, but would have to turn it over entirely to his Ministers. "The King suggests to the Foreign Office that these facts be put before our Ambassadors abroad, and, to pacify the public mind, be given at once to the newspapers." My God, and you want peace!
#MINISTER OF WAR.
Well, how do you like it?
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
He's backed down, he's backed down. All the world will be shouting tomorrow how our King has backed down. Christo! To accept defeat before you've begun to fight! If this other plan should be frustrated by the enemy's navy, look, we could land here and here and -
#PRIME MINISTER.
Good evening, gentlemen. Counting your battalions?
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
And here, joining our armies at -
#MINISTER OF WAR.
Thank God, you're here. Where in sin have you been?
#PRIME MINISTER.
Home on my estates, saying good - bye to my family.
#MINISTER OF WAR.
You think you are going to war?
#PRIME MINISTER.
I know.
#MINISTER OF WAR.
Read that. It came from your office.
#PRIME MINISTER.
Eh? The King? Mediation on his own hook? So? So? So? Very good. He can find a new Prime Minister. I resign.
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
No, you don't!
#MINISTER OF WAR.
We stick together in this. You are not going to resign.
#PRIME MINISTER.
My good friends, I am going to resign. Give me your seat at the desk. On the back of this ignoble parley, my resignation goes to him.
#MINISTER OF WAR.
You are the support of the army. We go to the dogs, if you leave us.
#PRIME MINISTER.
So? "The King suggests to the Foreign Office that these facts be put before our Ambassadors abroad and, to pacify the public mind, be given at once to the newspapers." He suggests. So do I suggest - something different.
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
Three hundred thousand men here, turning the flank of a possible army marching north with that ridge of mountains as a cover - If we can only have the chance!
#PRIME MINISTER.
By Heaven! If -
#MINISTER OF WAR.
What is it? You look as if -
#PRIME MINISTER.
If nothing! Bring me some claret out of that inexhaustible cabinet of yours.
#PRIME MINISTER.
Thanks. More. And cigars.
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
I planned this campaign first some twenty years ago. But there was no navy then to speak of, and no airships. It is more intricate now, but very much more interesting as an intellectual problem.
#PRIME MINISTER.
Another, good man.
#MINISTER OF WAR.
You're smelling blood when you drink like that.
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
I have been making my plans for twenty years. The present plans have been complete, except for slight revisions, for three years.
#PRIME MINISTER.
The army and navy are fully equipped?
#MINISTER OF WAR.
Down to the last shoe - string.
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
Strike at once.
#MINISTER OF WAR.
You dreamers, you theorists! How about the King's negotiations?
#PRIME MINISTER.
Gentlemen, I have seen fit to abbreviate the King's message. I have not altered a word nor added a word. I have merely omitted all that did not seem to me pertinent or useful. The message reads as follows: "The King sent for the Ambassador of the Republic this afternoon and outlined a plan that would satisfy the royal government. The Ambassador regretted that he was unable to consider any compromise. The King replied that then he could have nothing more to say in the matter."
#MINISTER OF WAR.
There's ginger, by Heaven! The other was a dove - peep to a parley. This is a trumpet call of defiance.
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
The Republic will never swallow that.
#PRIME MINISTER.
They are not supposed to. They will declare war, and then be the aggressors.
#MINISTER OF WAR.
Our God of old lives yet and will not let us perish in disgrace!
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
My helmet. Damn it! Where is my helmet? I am going to dig at the plans once more. If God lets me lead the armies in such a fight, the devil can come when I'm through and fetch away the old carcass.
#MINISTER OF WAR.
Secretary, here!
#PRIME MINISTER.
To the telegraph - operator with this. It is to be sent to every news bureau in the city and to all our embassies abroad.
#MINISTER OF WAR.
Tomorrow, the mobilization!
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
Tonight! I need those twelve hours for my plans.
#SECRETARY.
Your Majesty!
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
My King!
#KING.
I trust I am not breaking in upon a matter that does not concern me?
#PRIME MINISTER.
There is nothing that the King's servants may do that does not concern the King.
#KING.
True. But sometimes the King is kept in ignorance nevertheless.
#SECRETARY.
Here, your Majesty.
#PRIME MINISTER.
It is the report of your Majesty's interview with the Ambassador.
#KING.
My message has been altered. It was conciliatory. It is a challenge now. Who did this?
#PRIME MINISTER.
Your Majesty sees the culprit before you.
#KING.
Are you trying to make war?
#PRIME MINISTER.
I am trying, your Majesty, to save the country from the results of your Majesty's indiscretion in calling the Ambassador to your palace without consulting your Ministers. If we do not strike now we lose our prestige as a great nation, our national honor is dragged in the dust. We have to fight. We cannot afford to back down.
#KING.
But this is unholy, barbaric - this deliberate concoction of a great, terrible war. I saw clearly this evening as I was talking with the Ambassador how utterly without inner necessity this war - scare is. It is a made thing from beginning to end, and I refuse absolutely to sanction it.
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
Your Majesty is an idealist. We are practical, and, I may say, far - seeing men. And we are the three men, perhaps, who have given your Majesty the chair you sit on and made your kingdom what it is.
#KING.
I think I have not been ungrateful. But my people come first, and I will not have my people plunged into misery for no valid and inevitable necessity.
#PRIME MINISTER.
Your Majesty, I have served you for fifteen years and I served your exalted father for twenty. You are right. This war may be avoided. In two days this war - cloud could be so utterly dissipated that men would laugh here and in the great Republic that for a day they had talked so hotly of war. Dissipated. For a year, for two years. For always? No. The war must come sooner or later. It is a matter, in the first place, of prestige, of national honor. But, more emphatically, it is a question of mathematics, birth - rate, death - rate, revenue, taxes, industries, imports, exports. There is a map of the world, your Majesty. This stretch of land there we need as a safety - valve. If we get that we are safe. If we fail to get it we explode. Not at once. But sooner or later. Our army and navy have never been in better shape. These two gentlemen can give your Majesty their word for that. But you can take mine, too. The enemy's army is politically rotten, and enfeebled by sentimental peace propaganda. Their defenses are inadequate and their navy likewise. Those things will change. Strike today - and they never raise their heads again. Wait - and it is you who may be crushed.
#KING.
That is a theory. Not a fact. Ten years may change the aspect of things entirely, particularly if we use those ten years in preparations not for war but for peace, honest at home and abroad, just, open, civil, to our neighbors.
#PRIME MINISTER.
Your Majesty, I look farther than ten years, farther than ten times ten years. And I have wrought for this moment, prepared for this moment, this moment of our strength and our enemy's weakness. I have a right to insist that I, who have brought your kingdom thus far, shall not have my hands tied when the moment for stern action arrives.
#KING.
After all, my good Prime Minister, it is my kingdom, you know.
#PRIME MINISTER.
Your Majesty knows that what I have done I have done for your glory. The liberals have cursed me for a reactionary through the length and breadth of the kingdom; because I served you, and served you in all love and devotion.
#KING.
I know your devotion. But give me a fresh example of it. Keep my kingdom at peace with the world.
#PRIME MINISTER.
That I cannot do.
#KING.
You cannot? You will not.
#PRIME MINISTER.
I could not face my conscience, or make my peace with God, if I weakened now and allowed the golden opportunity to pass by. For your Majesty's sake as well as for our country's.
#KING.
For mine?
#PRIME MINISTER.
Your Majesty has forgotten that your throne was built by war and rests on force. Force only, military prestige only, can uphold you. The rebels of labor have crept close to your throne now. Ten more years of peace, and you are cast out overnight, to wander over Europe, a homeless absurdity, a king without a chair to sit on.
#KING.
We shall see!
#PRIME MINISTER.
May I ask your Majesty in all humility and devotion to give me back that slip of paper?
#KING.
You have thought of our national honor, our prestige, our commercial growth, our dynastic life. Have you given no thought at all to the men you send to death to purchase these? man has no higher privilege than to die for his country. I beg your Majesty - the paper?
#KING.
And the women?
#PRIME MINISTER.
We'll find them new husbands, your Majesty. The paper, if you please.
#KING.
I forbid this war!
#PRIME MINISTER.
My God, your Majesty! You are letting a sentiment master you. There are worse things than war. There are possibilities in peace infinitely worse than any war, or there would be no war. War may kill a million bodies, but a wicked peace can snuff out unnumbered souls!
#KING.
I will take my chances with peace.
#MINISTER OF WAR.
It is for you we are fighting, your Majesty, but not for you only, not for your glory only and the permanence of your House, but for the permanence of the monarchical principle, which we know is better and higher than the principle of democracy, since it is the earthly symbol of God's singleness of rule, and comes direct from God.
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
Moreover, your Majesty, it works!
#KING.
This is a matter of war and peace, not a matter of monarchy or democracy.
#PRIME MINISTER.
Your Majesty does not see far enough. Give us war, and we keep our monarchy. Give us peace, and we plunge within ten years into the rapids of revolution and democracy.
#KING.
I will take my chances with peace.
#PRIME MINISTER.
Very good, your Majesty. Then you may paddle your bark alone. I resign.
#MINISTER OF WAR.
And I resign!
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
And I!
#KING.
I did not expect that of you.
#PRIME MINISTER.
Oh, your Majesty! You know what my love has been -
#KING.
Half the country will fall from me if you three desert me.
#PRIME MINISTER.
It is not desertion, your Majesty. It is loyalty to something even higher than the King, the principle that makes him King.
#KING.
Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps I am sentimental -
#MINISTER OF WAR.
Your Majesty is humane, but perhaps a deeper humanity demands a hardening of the heart sometimes.
#MINISTER OF WAR.
When the honor of our country is at stake -
#KING.
But nobody is attacking our honor!
#PRIME MINISTER.
The case is as I said. We need this war, and we must have it.
#KING.
I cannot let you resign. There is no one else I can trust as I trust you three. But not war, not war!
#PRIME MINISTER.
I am a lover of peace, but the time has come when we must have war.
#MINISTER OF WAR.
It is our sacred duty, your Majesty, to draw our swords for light and justice when God calls!
#CHIEF OF STAFF.
And God has always been with us. God will be with us now!
#KING.
You are three strong men against me. I want peace, but I am helpless without you three. For I am an anachronism. Not nature but human force, fighting against nature, keeps me on my throne. If you must have war, have it. But I tell you this: God has no part in it. Leave God out of the game!
#PRIME MINISTER.
Here. It is a copy of the message I directed you to send to the news bureaus and embassies. Transmit it at once.
#GENERAL.
Evening, Grosvenor. Not poaching on your rights if we come in here a minute? The other windows were crowded.
#GROSVENOR.
Not at all, General, not at all. We're all making way for the khaki today, sir. And proud to have the chance. Take my place, Captain.
#CAPTAIN.
Thanks. Great tune that, eh? Stirs up a man's vitals, eh?
#GROSVENOR.
Yes, indeed; yes, indeed.
#CAPTAIN.
Wait till we put that into the repertory of the enemy's bandmasters. Come. They're a fine - looking lot, eh?
#GENERAL.
Fine! Fine! The pick of the land. Fighters to a finish, every one of 'em.
#CAPTAIN.
And say, but they're thanking God tonight for the war - scare that's brought 'em back from manoeuvres.
#GROSVENOR.
They are, eh?
#CAPTAIN.
Manoeuvres are too tame. They're crazy to get into a real fight.
#GROSVENOR.
Then you think - there'll be war?
#GENERAL.
The President expects to hear from our Ambassador any minute about the private interview he wired he was about to have with the King.
#GROSVENOR.
Seen the latest?
#GENERAL.
"Iberia planning secret attack," eh? That man Pollen knows more things that aren't so than a college graduate.
#CAPTAIN.
He's entertaining enough, though. I daresay he has some influence.
#GROSVENOR.
I pray to God that we may keep peace, but we must not let ourselves be walked over - we must not -
#CAPTAIN.
Exactly. The nation is at last to see what it spends its army and navy appropriations for. Eh?
#GENERAL.
No sane man wants war, but if -
#CAPTAIN.
I'm sane. And I want war. I want to go out and help lambaste those infernally cocksure armies of that jelly - and - cream King. We've parleyed long enough. Now we'll fight. Force is the only convincing argument after all.
#GROSVENOR.
As our Master said, "I bring a sword" -
#GENERAL.
Fine fellows those. Look at that boy there, third from the end. And that lieutenant. Strapping, wonderful fellows - with brains! That's the great thing. Give me five hundred thousand of those and I'll hold off all comers.
#GROSVENOR.
How long d'ye think it'll last?
#GENERAL.
Six months. Maybe a year.
#GROSVENOR.
You couldn't, I suppose - say - more exactly?
#GENERAL.
How should I - before it's even begun?
#GROSVENOR.
Oh - er - just a matter of curiosity.
#CAPTAIN.
At any rate, we'll be back in time for the next presidential election. We're coming back with the General on our shoulders, and when we drop him it'll be through the skylight of the President's house.
#GENERAL.
Don't talk nonsense.
#CAPTAIN.
There's nothing like a war to make a man President. More and more and more of 'em. Bully lines. Not natty enough to be a joke, just straight and trim. Those fellows'll carry you into the presidency, General, if anyone can. A few of 'em'll have to choke first, but that's fisherman's luck.
#GENERAL.
That'll do, Dave.
#PAGE.
Mr. Grosvenor? Mr. Grosvenor?
#GROSVENOR.
Here.
#PAGE.
Any answer?
#GROSVENOR.
Wait.
#CAPTAIN.
They are happy. I wonder which of 'em'll come back, and which won't.
#PAGE.
No answer.
#CAPTAIN.
Any news, Mr. Grosvenor?
#GROSVENOR.
plot, a damned Stock Exchange plot.
#CAPTAIN.
Hello! Say, General, look at this.
#GENERAL.
What's up?
#CAPTAIN.
The State Department has just had news from our Ambassador to Iberia. Delightful interview with the King. Evident willingness to meet us half way.
#GENERAL.
Is this straight? It sounds fishy.
#CAPTAIN.
They're trying to gain time. I don't believe it.
#GROSVENOR.
It's a damned plot.
#GENERAL.
Looks to me like a blind to stop our preparations. I'm going over to the War Department. Coming, Captain?
#CAPTAIN.
It's that crafty Prime Minister over there playing us tricks, eh?
#GROSVENOR.
It's a plot!
#GENERAL.
Something's queer! Good night, Grosvenor!
#GROSVENOR.
Good night, General, good night. God be with us all in these dark days, I say!
#GENERAL.
Amen to that!
#CAPTAIN.
Good night.
#GROSVENOR.
Good night, good night. It's a plot, it's a damned plot - Can you get me the House? Mr. Maynard. Yes. Making a speech? Never mind.
#PAGE.
Ring, sir?
#GROSVENOR.
Yes. Take this to the House at once. To Mr. Maynard. See that he gets it himself. Here's a dollar.
#PAGE.
Thank you, sir.
#GROSVENOR.
Give me the Senate. Mr. Taney. Saw him go out? Isn't anyone on the job? damned plot! -
#TANEY.
Hello, Grosvenor.
#GROSVENOR.
Thank God, you're here.
#TANEY.
Only got a minute. Hell's loose in the Senate.
#GROSVENOR.
I've been nearly crazy waiting for news.
#TANEY.
God, man. Perhaps you think I ain't been busy rounding up a lot of on - the - fence - men? It seems to me pretty nearly everybody was on the fence. No decided opinions at all. But they're coming, they're coming.
#GROSVENOR.
How 'bout that report about the King over there wanting peace?
#TANEY.
That's what the row's about. The highbrows an' the peace people are shouting hurrahs all over the place, an' the rest of us has to do what we can to drown 'em out.
#GROSVENOR.
If it's true about the King, can you - work it - anyway?
#TANEY.
How do I know?
#GROSVENOR.
Got any figures? For or against?
#TANEY.
Yes. It's about an even go.
#GROSVENOR.
You can't give me anything more definite?
#TANEY.
What's up, anyway? You look nervous.
#GROSVENOR.
I am. This business is cutting into my sleep. My last cent is tied up, and I've got a good many other people's last cents as well. Damn it, Taney, this is worse than Monte Carlo. You're dealing with cold - blooded chance there, but here you're dealing with sentiments, emotions. It's exhausting. War is a terrible thing, Taney. It worries me day and night. Think of the lives! And yet we need this war, we need it for the good of the nation. And now that we're ready, it would be a calamity if -
#TANEY.
Don't you worry about that.
#GROSVENOR.
How's the House going?
#TANEY.
Don't know anything about the House. But I guess your man Maynard is doing his job. I'm off to see Cottrell. Another man that wants news. Be back in ten minutes.
#GROSVENOR.
Keep me posted, for God's sake. You know - I'm not ungrateful. You shan't lose by your efforts, Taney. You know I'm a liberal man.
#TANEY.
Look here. You're not Conroy and you're not Pollen. They're the whales in this pond. You're only a nervous minnow. I'm working with bigger men than you. And perhaps I've got some convictions of my own, had 'em for years. If I hadn't, no money of yours would buy me. I believe the people want this war to settle once and for all whether that wishy - washy King or us is going to direct the universe, and if the people want it, it's my business to see that they get it. If that means any money in your pocket, it's none of my business. But I'm not your slave, Grosvenor. And don't you forget it.
#GROSVENOR.
You'll keep me posted? If anything goes wrong, I've got to have time to get from under. You'll surely keep me posted?
#TANEY.
Get your man Maynard on the string. I'm hanged if I'll be your office boy.
#GROSVENOR.
Taney - Office of the "Morning Bulletin," please. Mr. Pollen, please. Out? This is Mr. Grosvenor. On his way to the Club? Thanks.
#CONROY.
Hello, Grosvenor. I might have known that I'd find you on the job. What is it this time - canned goods, uniforms, hospital supplies - or just general enthusiasm? little business, but mainly enthusiasm. A great time to be alive, Conroy! Any news?
#CONROY.
Maynard's making a rousing speech. Spread eagle. Our honor as a nation. The dearest, sweetest flag that ever waved over a noble, invincible people. Damned rot. But the brethren from the rural districts lap it up like cider in October. He's gaining votes. Protégé of yours, ain't he?
#GROSVENOR.
Yes. Used to be my office boy. Clever chap. Has a sensible view of things. Realizes that our national honor and our property must be defended at all hazards.
#CONROY.
You mean property. You don't give a damn about national honor. You know you don't. What's the use of trying to fool me?
#GROSVENOR.
Conroy, do you mean to impugn my patriotic motives?
#CONROY.
Grosvenor, we've known each other thirty years. I don't try to bluff you because I know that you know too much about me. You made the beginnings of your pile out of one big war and you've been playing up a lot of little republics against each other ever since, harvesting a neat little fortune every time. Now it's a real world - war you're after. If it comes, you're made, if it don't, you're broke. It's a cinch. Mind you, I'm not throwing stones. Only I don't want you to think you can pull the noble patriotic guff on me.
#GROSVENOR.
I have certain investments, of course, which might possibly be promoted by a war. But I am not thinking of that. I am thinking of the honor of my country, that honor which has never yet been stained, and shall not be stained if I can do aught by my own efforts and by my prayers to God, to keep it pure.
#CONROY.
You carry it off well. I couldn't bluff the way you can. I haven't your religious feeling. I know why I want war. It's because I'm a manufacturer of guns. Everybody knows my business, and they know that if there wasn't war or a fear of war constantly, I and my wife and children would starve. War is my work and it's been my work most of my life. And I've worked for this war because it was the biggest thing in sight. I've worked for it with all the brains I've got, just as I'd have worked for two - hundred - egg hens if I'd been a chicken farmer. I'm not a sentimentalist. Besides, war's a good thing occasionally. I believe that absolutely. It quiets down your socialists, cuts down your superfluous population, increases the moral stamina of the nation. A lot of this talk of war being hell is mush. A few people get shot up, but no one forced 'em to go. It's their own funeral.
#GROSVENOR.
No, Conroy, no. I don't agree with you. I may possibly not lose financially by this war, but nevertheless, war is terrible, awful. The Christian sense balks at it. Only, I feel this way, sometimes when the honor of the nation demands -
#CONROY.
You damn bluff!
#GROSVENOR.
Conroy! If you please!
#POLLEN.
Hello, Conroy. Hello, Mr. Grosvenor.
#GROSVENOR.
Mr. Pollen!
#CONROY.
I was just going to send a note round to you, Pollen. Couldn't get you on the phone. What d'ye think? Yes or no?
#POLLEN.
Yes.
#GROSVENOR.
What?
#CONROY.
Are you sure?
#GROSVENOR.
How can you be sure?
#POLLEN.
I have two reasons. One, because the biggest banker in the country told me so. That's unimportant. He may have been lying. The other, because - my papers tell me so. I see you have been honoring me by reading them. Don't my papers tell you that there's going to be war?
#CONROY.
No one pretends, Pollen, that your papers are wonders of undecorated truth.
#POLLEN.
Well, this time, trust them. What if they do lie about facts occasionally? I am not interested in facts. Facts are always misleading. But I know something about psychology -
#CONROY.
And you're sure?
#GROSVENOR.
How can you be sure?
#POLLEN.
Because the people are smelling blood. That's why. And now they won't let up till they're satisfied. I've watched the war - feeling growing for a year. I tried 'em out on headlines and editorials, first little mild fellows to set them thinking. Then, when their thoughts were set toward trouble, well, we increased the percentage of oxygen. It's been extremely interesting. The psychology of crowds is one of the most satisfying subjects I have ever studied. Say, fifteen, twenty millions, that individually hate you, but as a crowd, a body of readers, unconsciously, perhaps, even against their will, do exactly what you say. We're going to have war, because the people have now got to a state in which they believe that nothing short of war will save them from utter ruin. They want war. I know it. The circulation of my papers has mounted by the hundred thousand daily. And it isn't only because the people want the news. They want the excitement. It's the gambling instinct in them. They've seen the ball rolling, and they can't keep out of the game. The very bigness of the thing lures them on; the bigger the issue, the bigger the fascination. The millions of men and the billions of dollars - that lures them. And the awfulness - the dead, the wounded, the horrors, that lures them like nothing else. There was one thing missing until tonight.
#GROSVENOR.
What was that?
#POLLEN.
Fear. They were too cocksure. But I gave them fear in the eight o'clock extra. There was a rumor that the rest of Europe would take part.
#GROSVENOR.
That looks well for your business, Conroy.
#CONROY.
I'm not complaining.
#POLLEN.
We're playing the thing up in the late editions all over the country. It'll give the people a queer catch in the throat. They'll see the possibility of a fierce struggle, even of defeat. There'll be a wonderful wave of patriotism. You watch. The people'll rise right up. In twenty - four hours there won't be a man in the country that'll be able to tell black from white. All they'll see will be red. Look at the people out there, standing round. They can't stay indoors. They're waiting for the extras. They won't believe 'em when they read 'em, but they can't resist the excitement. Well, the bonfire's ready. Nothing lacking now except the match.
#GROSVENOR.
That's all very well, Mr. Pollen. But suppose the King over there backs down?
#POLLEN.
He won't. The people won't let him.
#CONROY.
His people? They don't want war.
#POLLEN.
Not his people. Ours. I tell you, they've smelt blood.
#GROSVENOR.
Extra! I wonder -
#CONROY.
Here, boy!
#POLLEN.
There you go. You're easy. And there are a hundred million like you. When it comes to war, reason goes to sleep. You both of you knew perfectly well that I had absolutely no later news than you, but you let yourself be hypnotized like children. I can do anything I want with you.
#PAGE.
Ring, sir?
#POLLEN.
Take this to the news - stand in the hall.
#PAGE.
Yes, sir.
#POLLEN.
The edition is going like hotcakes. It has Maynard's speech in it. Did either of you hear it?
#CONROY.
Yes. Damned rot, but effective.
#POLLEN.
He keeps the patriotism hot.
#GROSVENOR.
I trained that young man in patriotism.
#MAYNARD.
Good evening, gentlemen.
#GROSVENOR.
Maynard!
#CONROY.
Great boy! wonderful speech, my boy. We're playing you up for Governor of the State in tonight's late editions.
#MAYNARD.
I'll sweep the State. It's patriotism, it's the flag, that gets the rubes. You should have seen the whiskers of the rural sections waving in the wind!
#CONROY.
Eh?
#MAYNARD.
Any news I've missed?
#GROSVENOR.
How's that? They're shouting "War" already.
#POLLEN.
I told 'em to. That was the message I sent down. That shout gave you a thrill, didn't it? Well, that was what I was after. If I don't hold you down in your chair you'll rush out to buy a copy, even though I should stand here all night, shouting in your ears that it's a fake.
#GROSVENOR.
You are inflaming the people!
#POLLEN.
Exactly. There have been people unkind enough to assert that that was my business. What's yours, Grosvenor?
#GROSVENOR.
Eh? What d'ye mean?
#CONROY.
You're livin' in a crystal palace, Grosvenor. Don't you go and forget that.
#MAYNARD.
I've got to get back to the House, Mr. Grosvenor. I just came over to see if you had any - suggestions?
#GROSVENOR.
No. Only keep me posted. That's all. And remember, our honor as a nation is at stake.
#MAYNARD.
They're not forgetting our honor while I'm on the floor.
#CONROY.
Need any - ready money?
#MAYNARD.
There were a half dozen brethren on the steps as I came out, who implied they were broke, and wouldn't object to a loan.
#CONROY.
Here. Help the poor devils along.
#MAYNARD.
Thanks. I will.
#PAGE.
Senator Taney?
#MAYNARD.
No. Who wants him? Harradan! No, son, Senator Taney is not here.
#GROSVENOR.
Harradan's smelling a rat. He's getting after Taney!
#POLLEN.
Don't you worry. I can finish Harradan up in black - faced letters tomorrow morning. He'll think he's reading his own tombstone.
#TANEY.
Hello, Pollen. Hello, Conroy. Well, Grosvenor, Cottrell is as jumpy as you are.
#GROSVENOR.
Have you seen Harradan?
#TANEY.
Have I seen Harradan? I should say I had! He's leading the peace party in the Senate. Fighting like a fiend. That man has nearly cost me my vocal chords. To see him you wouldn't connect him with the word "peace."
#GROSVENOR.
He's in the club. He's asked for you.
#CONROY.
Come on, Grosvenor. This is no place for an honest business - man to be found conversing with a Senator.
#GROSVENOR.
Quite right.
#TANEY.
Well, Maynard, they don't seem to think we're safe company for good little boys. Suppose we get back on the job?
#POLLEN.
You people act as though you had a bad conscience. I don't think I'd let a mere Senator interfere with the freedom of my movements, if I were you.
#HARRADAN.
Good evening, gentlemen. I seem to have tumbled into headquarters.
#TANEY.
Hello, Harradan. Looking for me?
#HARRADAN.
Yes.
#TANEY.
You know these gentlemen?
#HARRADAN.
Sufficiently.
#TANEY.
I'm due back at the Senate. I'll talk with you till the cock crows after we adjourn. Will that do?
#HARRADAN.
I should like to talk to you now.
#MAYNARD.
In that case, I'll go back to the House.
#GROSVENOR.
We won't intrude -
#CONROY.
The Senators have the floor -
#HARRADAN.
I wish you'd stay, gentlemen.
#GROSVENOR.
I'm sorry I -
#HARRADAN.
You'll please stay, Mr. Grosvenor. You, too, Mr. Conroy.
#CONROY.
I'm hanged if I'll be dictated to.
#HARRADAN.
Do as you please. But if you don't stay, I'll have you both under arrest in fifteen minutes.
#CONROY.
Oh, come off!
#GROSVENOR.
What do you mean, Senator?
#HARRADAN.
My God, man, don't make me mad. I'm twenty years older than you, but I could wipe the floor up with you yet!
#GROSVENOR.
I don't know what you're talking about.
#MAYNARD.
Well, you don't need me.
#HARRADAN.
I do.
#POLLEN.
You haven't expressed yourself about me yet, Senator. Am I invited to the party?
#HARRADAN.
You may stay or not as you like.
#POLLEN.
Thanks. Do you know, if I were you, I don't think I'd detain these other gentlemen just now.
#HARRADAN.
Go to the Devil to whom you belong, Mr. Pollen. I'll do as I see fit.
#POLLEN.
I merely advise you. It isn't always considered patriotic when the people want war, for a Senator to want peace too hard. I shall strive to point that out to twenty million people or so tomorrow morning. Make your will, Senator. The avalanche is coming. You'll be the loneliest voice that ever came out of the wilderness. I prophesy your swift demise.
#HARRADAN.
This is wartime. Most of us are ready to die, if necessary. Only some of us would rather die in the service of peace than in the service of war. You're a very powerful man, Mr. Pollen. I don't doubt at all that you can kill me if you put your mind on it. You have poisoned the whole nation. You are at liberty to kill me outright, but I won't let you slow - poison me. Taney, I've got information against you, and you've got to listen. You, too, Maynard.
#POLLEN.
Am I out in the cold again? I'm listening intently. News - stand, please.
#HARRADAN.
Taney -
#POLLEN.
That you, Burke? Liven up your youngsters outside. They've gone to sleep.
#HARRADAN.
We were friends in the past, Taney. I always knew you were a jingo, but I thought there was hope. I came here because I still thought so. I didn't know you had lined up with the buzzards.
#TANEY.
See here, Harradan. What are you talking about anyway?
#HARRADAN.
We all know why Grosvenor and Conroy and their kind are here. And a few of us have been wondering who were pulling the wires for them.
#GROSVENOR.
You've got me mixed up with somebody else. I'm here attending to - to my regular business.
#CONROY.
And why shouldn't we be down here? I'm in a legitimate business. Guns. And I'm looking after my interests. I'm not declaring war. But if there is a war I don't see any reason why I should get left in the scramble.
#HARRADAN.
War! God, do you know what the word means? I've been in two wars. I've seen and heard and - smelt battlefields. And I've seen women and children waiting at home - and waiting.
#POLLEN.
I'll give you a thousand dollars, Senator, for a thousand - word article on the horrors of war. You can't make it strong enough.
#MAYNARD.
That's one on you, Senator.
#HARRADAN.
Taney, you're a man of sense, and you love your country. Now -
#TANEY.
Good night, gentlemen, I'm going.
#MAYNARD.
Same here.
#HARRADAN.
No, you're not. I want a list of names. I want a list of all the people who are paying you to shout for war. Understand? I want that list now.
#TANEY.
Hell may grow buttercups, Harradan. But you don't get any names out o' me. Besides, I ain't got any to give. And I'll have you up for defamation of character for saying that there's anybody can buy me!
#HARRADAN.
Taney, you've always been a business - man. You look at things just one way. You aren't bothered much by imagination. Perhaps you don't know what you're doing. War, man! Dead men by thousands, wounded men shrieking for some one to put them out of their misery, fire, ruin, starvation! For what good, for what good, ever?
#POLLEN.
I raise my offer, Senator. Make it two thousand.
#TANEY.
You ought to go into vaudeville, Senator. Subject, "The Horrors of War."
#HARRADAN.
God, the country stands on the verge of the greatest calamity in its history and you can't do anything but laugh!
#MAYNARD.
You're an inspiration, Senator. Just like that dago or Dutchman or whoever he was who tried to smash up the windmills. But you haven't a sense of humor.
#HARRADAN.
No. My sense of humor died during our last war. Will you give me those names that are going to help me kill this satanic craving for war? Are you?
#MAYNARD.
You're talking through your hat, Senator. I don't know anything about any names.
#HARRADAN.
Very well. I have five names. They'll do until to - morrow. God willing, they'll bring Congress back to its senses. I thank my God that I found you buzzards out in time. I'll fling your names across the Senate tonight - yours, Conroy, and yours, Grosvenor, and yours, Taney, and yours, Pollen, and yours, Maynard! By Heaven, the country shall hear them from end to end. And there'll be less talk of war then! You and your kind are stirring up the millions to dream of war, to shout about defending our national honor - What honor is there in murder? - stirring their blood with the fifes and drums of your rhetoric! Through your newspapers, you are turning the thoughts of our children to war, our children who should be to us the symbol of a nobler, purer future rising out of the sordid wreckage of the present - you make them drunk with your cant about national glory - glory! - until their innocent faces glow feverishly up to you, hungry for battle. You will not rest until you hear the terrible savage cry from their lips - War, war! You shall not hear it if I can prevent it! I am going to the Senate now. In fifteen minutes your names shall be a byword and a hissing among the nations. The best you can do is to take your vile guns and turn them on yourselves!
#PAGE.
Message for Senator Taney.
#TANEY.
Here, quick. Gentlemen, listen to this from the Iberian Foreign Office to the Associated Press: "The King sent for the Ambassador of the Republic this afternoon and outlined a plan that would satisfy the royal government. The Ambassador regretted that he was unable to consider any compromise. The King replied that he could have nothing further to say in the matter."
#HARRADAN.
The thing's not true. There's a mistake somewhere. It doesn't fit in with what went before.
#MAYNARD.
Fit in? Who cares? It's a challenge! They've insulted us!
#GROSVENOR.
They've challenged our national honor!
#CONROY.
Now, by God, they can pay!
#HARRADAN.
Give me the Department of State.
#TANEY.
For God's sake, what's up?
#AN OFFICER.
We're off!
#GROSVENOR.
What d'ye mean?
#A CIVILIAN.
They've declared war!
#HARRADAN.
Who has?
#SERGEANT.
Congress!
#TANEY.
Senator, you're left.
#HARRADAN.
God! You buzzard! You buzzard! sinks into a chair.]
#MAYNARD.
Senator, it's the national anthem. Haven't you got any patriotism?
#VOICES OF THE CROWD.
War! War!
#HANK.
How long, O Lord? How long?
