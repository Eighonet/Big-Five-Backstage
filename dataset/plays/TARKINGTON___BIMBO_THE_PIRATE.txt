#A HOARSE VOICE.
There, missus! P’raps you’ll have sense enough to lay there! I never did know a prudent female make such a commotion!
#ROBERT.
Who is that?
#THE GIRL.
Whose voice is that?
#ROBERT.
Is that you? Lydia?
#THE GIRL.
Robert? Is it Robert?
#ROBERT.
Yes. They’ve lashed me beneath a table - or it might be a bench - and it’s bolted to the deck. What of you, Lydia?
#LYDIA.
My hands are tied behind me. My ankles are lashed together.
#ROBERT.
Villains!
#LYDIA.
Bloodhounds! Bloodhounds of the sea, Robert! When they began leaping aboard us - ah, the horrid sight! - I saw you fighting among them. I tried to reach you -
#ROBERT.
I tried to come to you, Lydia!
#LYDIA.
Dear heart, I saw it!
#ROBERT.
I think my head is broke. I was struck into a swoon, Lydia, and knew naught till I found them lashing me beneath this bench. I can see a little. That lantern doesn’t look like one of ours. I thought they’d brought me to our captain’s cabin, but that lantern -
#LYDIA.
No, no! Robert, don’t you know where we are?
#ROBERT.
It hasn’t the feel of our own ship.
#LYDIA.
No; we’re in the other, Robert!
#ROBERT.
We are?
#LYDIA.
They dragged me across the rail and threw me here. This is the pirate ship, Robert.
#ROBERT.
Then may Providence have mercy on our souls!
#LYDIA.
I saw them lay hold of my father - he tried to struggle -
#ROBERT.
Struggle? What could it boot? What booted anything? From our very sighting the strange sail we were done. No breeze for us in a flat sea - and he, with his great crew at oars, overhauling us; he came upon us like a shark to the body of a dead porpoise!
#LYDIA.
Hark! They’re quiet now on the deck above us.
#ROBERT.
They have the two ships lashed together, and they’re on ours, taking store of the plunder.
#LYDIA.
Will they murder all our crew, Robert - and my father - and - and us?
#ROBERT.
We are in the hands of Providence, Lydia.
#LYDIA.
Ah, no! In the hands of horrid pirates! How sudden it came upon us, Robert!
#ROBERT.
Sudden? Aye, sudden as a tide wave in the Indy oceans; it’ll come out of a level sea and carry away half your ship while you’re taking a puff o’ your pipe! Sudden’s the way of the sea, Lydia.
#LYDIA.
Oh, I believe it! Was it only a little while ago you and I stood and watched the moon lift itself out of the water so quietly?
#ROBERT.
Yes, at nightfall.
#LYDIA.
And we were happy - and didn’t know it! We thought we had trouble! We were afraid to tell my father that you and I had found love together; we were afraid of what he would say. How strange it seems now; we thought that was trouble!
#ROBERT.
Aye, sweetheart; it’s strange.
#LYDIA.
When they come to us how will they murder us, Robert?
#ROBERT.
I don’t know!
#LYDIA.
Will they throw us into the sea, tied as we are?
#ROBERT.
I can’t tell!
#LYDIA.
Do you think they would be kind enough to murder us together - if I asked them? If I begged them, don’t you think they might, Robert?
#ROBERT.
hope so.
#LYDIA.
Hark!
#ROBERT.
What do you hear?
#LYDIA.
I think they are coming now. Hark!
#THE GUNNER.
We’ll just have a better look at ye! We think belike you’re worth lookin’ at too!
#LYDIA.
No! You shall not look at me!
#THE GUNNER.
Eh? I didn’t mean you, missus. I mean this fine lad on his back here. Aye! A fine, lusty young man! I thought so. You give me a bit of a tousle, lad. It was you put this cut over my eye.
#ROBERT.
I’d put another over the other one if I -
#THE GUNNER.
Aye; I’d trust ye for that. I did a little to your own head. I give ye a knob there to handle ye by.
#ROBERT.
Don’t!
#THE GUNNER.
I put a fine knob on ye.
#ROBERT.
Cut my throat and be done with it if that’s what you came for.
#THE GUNNER.
The captain’s comin’ to talk to ye.
#LYDIA.
Our captain?
#THE GUNNER.
I guess he’s your captain now, missus. His honor, Captain Bimbo.
#LYDIA.
The pirate captain?
#THE GUNNER.
Aye, missus - his honor, Captain Deuteronomy Bimbo, Esquire, commodore of all the high seas of the world and president of our company of one hunder’ and seventy - one free gen’lemen rovers and brave seamen!
#ROBERT.
Bimbo? Is it the pirate Bimbo that’s taken us?
#THE GUNNER.
Why, if you’re the seafarin’ body ye look to be I should think ye’d know it. Who but Bimbo and his company could have took a ship as neat as we took yours? Bimbo? I should say it is Bimbo!
#ROBERT.
Bimbo!
#LYDIA.
Is he worse than other pirates, Robert?
#ROBERT.
We’re under the tiger’s claw, Lydia.
#THE GUNNER.
You talk like an ignorant man. Sunrise is on the way; I’ll just give ye some light to see the “tiger” by, lad! And look that ye speak him respectful. It’s not every common mate of a merchant vessel he honors with his converse. Tiger, ye might find him, if ye scratch him.
#LYDIA.
Have they - have they murdered - my father - yet?
#THE GUNNER.
Which would he be now? Is it a fat old Lunnon merchantlike man in a brindle wig and gold buckles to his shoon?
#LYDIA.
Yes. Have they -
#THE GUNNER.
No. He’s not murdered yet.
#LYDIA.
Will they let me speak to him before they -
#THE GUNNER.
Ask Captain Bimbo, missus. That’ll be him now.
#LYDIA.
Ah!
#ROBERT.
Bimbo!
#BIMBO.
Make the gentleman easy.
#THE GUNNER.
Aye, your honor. A fine, strong, active seaman he is too.
#BIMBO.
D’ye think I’ve no eyes?
#THE GUNNER.
I put a knob on his head for a handle to him if we need one.
#BIMBO.
Ha’ done!
#THE GUNNER.
There, lad! His honor gives ye lief to stretch out the kinks in ye.
#ROBERT.
Lydia!
#THE GUNNER.
Here! His honor didn’t say you could -
#BIMBO.
Stand where you are. Let him alone.
#ROBERT.
Lydia, poor child! Lydia!
#LYDIA.
Poor Robert!
#ROBERT.
We’re not done yet, Lydia.
#THE GUNNER.
What’s in your mind to do with that chair?
#ROBERT.
I think I could kill one man with it - two, I hope.
#BIMBO.
Don’t lift that chair.
#ROBERT.
Won’t I?
#THE GUNNER.
It’s only bolted to the deck! Heave her up, cully!
#BIMBO.
We keep the seas longer than you of the merchant ships, mate. We can’t let much lie about loose. Don’t brain us with the chair; sit in it. You in that one, madam. I suppose you’re in a puzzle what we’ll do with you, mate.
#ROBERT.
I’ve faced death before this.
#BIMBO.
You expect to have your throat cut, do you?
#ROBERT.
When you give the word for it. What else?
#BIMBO.
You hear him?
#THE GUNNER.
Aye! It’s the way of our calling!
#BIMBO.
It’s sickening! You think that’s all we want of a man like you - a man that fought a hundred of us when not another of your whole ship’s company lifted a cutlass! You think all we want of you is to slit your guzzlet, do you? Aye! You do! From the look of your fool face I see it. Sickening!
#ROBERT.
Then what do you want? To hang me instead of cutting my throat?
#BIMBO.
Faugh! What, mistress?
#LYDIA.
Nothing.
#BIMBO.
Send us Brimstone with fire.
#LYDIA.
Ah!
#BIMBO.
What?
#LYDIA.
Brimstone and fire! For - what?
#BIMBO.
For you.
#ROBERT.
For her?
#BIMBO.
Who else? D’ye think I want ’em for me? For you, mistress!
#LYDIA.
Robert!
#ROBERT.
Lydia!
#BIMBO.
Stand away from that woman!
#LYDIA.
Robert -
#BIMBO.
Stand away from her!
#BIMBO.
That’s better!
#LYDIA.
Robert!
#BIMBO.
Sit where you are! It’s Brimstone and hot coals that I sent for.
#LYDIA.
Don’t hurt me! Don’t hurt me! Don’t -
#BIMBO.
He’s deaf and dumb, mistress.
#LYDIA.
Oh!
#ROBERT.
I have my hands free. They shan’t touch you, sweetheart!
#BIMBO.
Stop that!
#ROBERT.
I will speak to her!
#BIMBO.
Speak to her? Yes. But don’t you call her sweetheart.
#ROBERT.
She is my sweetheart.
#BIMBO.
That may be; but don’t you call her so to - day, or I’ll have ’em truss you down again.
#LYDIA.
Was it only a little while ago - when the moon rose - and you and I were happy, Robert?
#ROBERT.
I think - I think life is just a moon path on the sea. It looks all shining white and beautiful - but of a sudden a shark’s fin glides across it. We were swimmers in that moon path, sweet -
#BIMBO.
Don’t you call her sweetheart!
#ROBERT.
Now, look ye, I won’t be told -
#BIMBO.
You were going to! You would have if I hadn’t stopped you! Now I’ve warned you twice, and you take care! Fetch me in that old merchantlike critter with the fat paunch.
#LYDIA.
You want my father to see it, too, when you -
#BIMBO.
The fat old merchantlike body is your father, is he?
#LYDIA.
Yes - my father.
#BIMBO.
And you and he the only passengers aboard. The old man says he owns shares in your ship and cargo.
#ROBERT.
Yes, and in other ships and cargoes. ’Tis Mr. Driscoll, the great Liverpool merchant, and I warn you if harm comes to him, or to his daughter here, the whole British Navy will -
#BIMBO.
The “whole British Navy”! The whole British Navy is hot after me now, mate, and has been these two years. This ship you’re sitting in I took from the whole British Navy! Do you know what port I sailed out of when I first took on the honorable calling of a gentleman sea rover?
#ROBERT.
No, I don’t.
#BIMBO.
Marblehead. I’m a Marblehead sailorman, born in Salem. You send the British Navy after me, meat, and old Doytcher King Geordie in it, and I’ll have his crown off his head and sell it for ten shillin’ in Boston market the Monday after!
#ROBERT.
’Tis no surprise to me that a pirate speaks treason to his king.
#BIMBO.
My king? I know but one king.
#ROBERT.
Aye! That’s Satan!
#BIMBO.
Satan? Now, hark ye, mate! I’ll not have Satan mentioned lightly aboard my ship. I’ll have no blasphemy here.
#BIMBO.
Now, mark me. I don’t take this dram for pleasure. Do you suspect me of it?
#ROBERT.
No. You drink to get you in the mood for horrid deeds.
#BIMBO.
I drink because I’m cold inside. Where is that fellow?
#THE GUNNER.
Coming, your honor; I’m here, sir.
#LYDIA.
Father! Oh, poor Father!
#BIMBO.
Enough o’ that, now! Ha’ done!
#DRISCOLL.
Wretch! Horrid and bloody wretch!
#BIMBO.
Let be! Put her in her chair.
#ROBERT.
Let her alone! I’ll -
#BIMBO.
How many barrels of molasses have you got in that ship o’ yours?
#DRISCOLL.
Wretch!
#BIMBO.
Let be, I say! How many barrels of rum? Fourteen dozen o’ rum, isn’t it?
#DRISCOLL.
You bloody - minded villain! I’m as well - known on ’Change in London as the Duke o’ Marlb’ro is at Blenheim! You’ll see Execution Dock for this; I swear it!
#BIMBO.
You have a care when and where you speak of swearing. I make it sixteen score molasses, fourteen dozen rum, seventeen hogshead Jamaica cured tobacco, thirteen hundred sixty bushel of grain or thereabouts, mildewed and part useless; the tobacco of poor quality and the molasses dirty. There’s a fine cargo for you! I hazard there’s not seventy pounds value that’s worth our keeping. And yet landsmen say we have an easy profession and envy us.
#THE GUNNER.
Aye; they think all we have to do is overhaul a ship and carry away big chests o’ gold and jewels.
#BIMBO.
Jewels! We hain’t a jewel this twelvemonth. Do you know what we’ve got from the last seven ships we’ve taken? Fish! Salt fish! And if there’s one thing we don’t need it’s fish.
#THE GUNNER.
I hate fish!
#BIMBO.
It’s enough to make a man give up his calling! Why, if I could ha’ known beforehand how many cargoes would prove just salt fish and spoilt grain, do you think I’d ever gone for this way of business?
#THE GUNNER.
No! And neither would any young man that could find another opening for himself.
#BIMBO.
If a youth came to me now for guidance, asking my advice whether or no to take up this calling, I’d bid him think it over, I would. In the first place: How many have the right gift for it? In the second, not one in a thousand has the patience; and in the third, not one in ten thousand has the gimp to persevere over the discouragements. The youth, all confidence and ignorance, thinks he has only to get him some brisk companions and take rich treasure ships -
#THE GUNNER.
Aye, so I thought when I was new at it.
#BIMBO.
Fish! Seven cargoes o’ salt fish! Seven! And now, when we’ve been struggling on and wearing ourselves out to improve our conditions and lay by a little something except salt fish for our old age, all we get to reward us is spoilt grain, bad rum, tobacco not fit to smoke, and molasses full of dead bugs!
#THE GUNNER.
Yes; and if I had my way, somebody’d suffer for ’t!
#DRISCOLL.
Quiet, Lydia. Let these villains not believe they fright us!
#LYDIA.
Let them not believe they fright us? Don’t you see what they intend, Father?
#DRISCOLL.
Be quiet.
#LYDIA.
Look yonder! Look yonder! That is for me. Don’t you understand? That is for me! He said it was for me!
#BIMBO.
Well, what of it? What if it is for you?
#DRISCOLL.
Wretch! Would you dare?
#LYDIA.
They mean to burn me. I can’t bear it! Oh, Robert, help me! Father! Father!
#ROBERT.
They shan’t touch you, Lydia! Sweetheart!
#BIMBO.
Drag him away from her! Stop that!
#LYDIA.
Robert, beloved -
#ROBERT.
My love! My love forever -
#DRISCOLL.
What! What do you call each other?
#BIMBO.
I should think you would ask that! They have no decency at all.
#LYDIA.
Save me, Robert! I love you!
#DRISCOLL.
What do you?
#LYDIA.
I love him! They mean to burn me!
#ROBERT.
They shall not! I say they shall not!
#DRISCOLL.
You shan’t love him! You shan’t! You shan’t!
#LYDIA.
Save me! Save me!
#BIMBO.
Silence!
#BIMBO.
What’s all the pother? What’s the matter with you, mistress? Who talks of burning you?
#LYDIA.
You did!
#BIMBO.
I said: Who talks of burning you? Let her speak.
#LYDIA.
You did!
#BIMBO.
Did what?
#LYDIA.
You said - that - was for me!
#BIMBO.
Because you shivered. It was because I thought you were cold.
#LYDIA.
You said, “Send brimstone with fire!”
#BIMBO.
His name’s Brimstone. He’s Salem born, too - Brimstone Smith.
#LYDIA.
It wasn’t to burn me?
#BIMBO.
It was to get you better comfort.
#LYDIA.
Oh! Am I just to - to be thrown into the sea?
#BIMBO.
What! There it is! That’s the reputation such people as Low and Lowther and Teach get for our calling! Now you see what comes of drinking on duty! Men like that misbehave, and the reputation of a whole business suffers for it! I told Lowther the last time I saw him; I said: “I hear your crew was in liquor when they took a Portagee vessel and went and did harm to some o’ they poor Portagees,” I said. “Oh, well,” he says, “what of it? They was only Portagees,” he says. “What of it?” I asks him. “Why, there’s this of it,” I says. “You and such as you and your crew,” I says, “you’ll get a bad name to all of us!” I says. He didn’t like it, but I thought best to speak out to his face. And you see I spoke true.
#THE GUNNER.
So ye did! That’s it; let one or two bad uns get into any business, soon you’ll hear everybody saying the whole business is bad!
#BIMBO.
Why, if we did you harm, don’t you know it would only set people against us when they come to hear of it? Why don’t you use your mind a little?
#LYDIA.
My mind?
#BIMBO.
Don’t you know that men in our way of business have got to keep the public confidence? We have to depend on trading off our goods, don’t we? Do you suppose if we lost the confidence of the coast folk we could hope to prosper? I declare, it’s sickening, the little that people of one walk in life know of those in another walk in life!
#THE GUNNER.
Yes, ’tis. Sickening! Stand quiet, you! What’s the matter now?
#BIMBO.
Let him be understood.
#DRISCOLL.
The British Crown itself shall hear of this! He’s been working with tar, and claps his vile hand under my nose! The smell of tar always makes me sick. Wretch!
#THE GUNNER.
Stop your abuse o’ my hand!
#DRISCOLL.
You lay that dirty hand to my face again, and, blast your vitals, I’ll -
#BIMBO.
Shame! Close him up again! Don’t you know what day it is? Shame on you!
#LYDIA.
What it is? What day -
#BIMBO.
I hope that at least you, madam, are aware that this is the Sabbath.
#LYDIA.
Sunday? It’s Sunday?
#BIMBO.
It is. We allow no profanity on this vessel on the Sabbath Day. According to our interpretation, “Blast your vitals” is profanity. Old man, if you can’t speak without profanity - and on the Seventh Day too - we won’t let you speak at all. Shame on you!
#LYDIA.
But you’re pirates! What difference does it make to a pi -
#BIMBO.
Pray use another term. We are a commonwealth of free seamen.
#LYDIA.
But what have you to do with Sunday?
#BIMBO.
There it is!
#LYDIA.
But what could pi -
#BIMBO.
Be silent, mistress! You but show your ignorance and rub salt in a galled wound. ’Tis the way o’ the universe, so why should we complain? In all the world no man has full understanding of any other - nor has any woman - of anything, I think. Hark ye, mistress; you’re young and may learn a little. What is the common error of mankind?
#LYDIA.
Why, sin.
#BIMBO.
I said error. The common error is to misjudge all who walk not in our own way, and to call them sinners. Then, having called them sinners, we think they sin every sin. That is the common error; and now, as it is the Seventh Day and meet for confession, I humbly confess to be an erring creature, not above this error myself. To make the matter plain to you, take the calling of a play actor. Now, that is a calling abhorrent to me from my earliest training. I look upon it as wholly sinful and wanton and of the way to everlasting fires. Therefore, unless I give heed to second thoughts, I would believe any play actor guilty of all sins - a man that would beat his wife and murder little children, perhaps even upon the Sabbath Day. Yet, if the truth were known, it might be found that just because a man is a play actor he would not of his nature’s necessity and habit do these things. Nevertheless, my first thought would be that he would - because he is a play actor. Fall not into the like misjudgments, mistress. Know that our ship’s company live under rigid law and rule. Else we could not hope to prosper. What think you may be our company’s recreations on this day?
#LYDIA.
I suppose they will take to gaming and to carousing on my father’s rum.
#BIMBO.
When I took my dram o’ brandy I told you it was for no pleasure I had of it. No man of our company may have his dram o’ Sundays except one, and that for being cold inside him, nor may any perform any labor except to the ship’s pressing need. For recreation - none is permitted except the reading of some religious book.
#LYDIA.
What!
#BIMBO.
As for gaming, neither dice nor cards shall ever be seen on any ship of mine, I promise you. We permit no gaming any day at all, much less upon the Seventh. So much for that, madam!
#LYDIA.
I see. Your only recreation is to torture your captives!
#BIMBO.
So! That’s all they know of us, is it? Young madam, again you speak out of your ignorance. You and your father and the young man here have given us much provocation. Have you heard one word of profanity from us? Have you even heard a threatening expression?
#LYDIA.
He said we should be made to suffer for the badness of our cargo.
#BIMBO.
He meant a fine or toll should be levied against your father; but that would mean our holding him here and having his daily association with us on our ship until the fine or ransom could be sent from Jamaica. I would vote against it, because from what we have seen of him I would rather go without the money.
#LYDIA.
So you strip us of what goods we have -
#BIMBO.
Only such as we shall not be ashamed to sell to honest folk. We shall not touch your father’s molasses. If he was a poor man and what we levied from him deeply injurious to his business, we should take up a gathering, or collection, for him.
#LYDIA.
You mock us!
#BIMBO.
If no one will give you credit for it, what is the good of a good action?
#THE GUNNER.
Aye! What’s the use?
#BIMBO.
Now, look ye: In all our ventures from first to last, never once have we took our toll of poor seafaring bodies that we did not pass the hat for ’em, and every man of our crew from captain to cook’s helper put in something to make life brighter and give our captives hope when we sent ’em on their way to begin their business over again. If your father had been a poor man - and of better morals - and if what we levy of his cargo sorely crippled his hope to make a living, we’d do as much for him. As it is, it’s not to be looked for.
#LYDIA.
But will you let us go?
#BIMBO.
Why, if what a merchant captain and his crew must expect from us is to be stripped of all and mishandled, we’d have a fine business of it! They’d strain twice as hard to outsail us, and fight to death afore we could board ’em. There’s ruffians in every business that make it harder for the good, practical men to make it pay; but you shouldn’t judge us by the exceptions just because the exceptions get more talked about.
#LYDIA.
Then you’ll put us back aboard our own ship and let us go?
#BIMBO.
I didn’t say that.
#LYDIA.
Oh!
#BIMBO.
Your father, yes. I wouldn’t keep a Sunday - swearing man among my crew at no price! One rotten apple in a barrel will contaminate the whole.
#LYDIA.
And Robert and me -
#BIMBO.
You scratched and fought or you’d not ha’ been touched. Now that you’ve learned what becomes a respectable - manner female, you’re not only free to go, but you must go. By the strictest law of our commonwealth, women are not permitted aboard except when the ship might be in a port, and then only on Saturday afternoons and only such as may be wife to one of the crew and accompanied by her mother.
#LYDIA.
And Robert?
#BIMBO.
This is a different matter. He’s a fine, active - bodied seaman and knows the art of navigating. But more: he has familiar knowledge of all the upper coast of South America - I had it from the master of your ship - and we design to cruise upon those coasts. He’s needful to our company.
#LYDIA.
You mean to take him with you?
#BIMBO.
He must sign our articles and become one of our commonwealth.
#LYDIA.
No! No! No!
#BIMBO.
Why, his case is none so bad. We’ll learn him our business, and if he’s diligent he’ll rise in it. Who can tell? If we get better cargoes, away from this discouraging fish and molasses belt of trade, he may come to you in England, retired and prosperous and ready to marry you - and all belike within seven or eight years from now!
#LYDIA.
Seven or eight years! Seven or eight! Eight years! Eight -
#BIMBO.
Ha’ done with your caterwauling, young female; we must have him. There’s not one of us can pilot those coasts, and ’twould endanger us to let him go.
#LYDIA.
Oh, pray don’t separate us!
#BIMBO.
Don’t beg me! This is a commonwealth, governed by law, and the law would depose me if I jeopardized the common safety by turning loose this pilot. He must sign with us. Let him speak.
#ROBERT.
Don’t kneel to this ruffian for me, sweetheart.
#BIMBO.
I told you not to call her sweetheart. You do it for pleasure, and our law forbids it on the Seventh Day. Stand away from her! Take your arm from her! You do that for pleasure too.
#ROBERT.
I do it to protect her.
#BIMBO.
You don’t. It’s for pleasure, and we won’t have it. Stand away from her, I say. Now we’ll fetch you to the articles of our company, and you’ll sign ’em.
#ROBERT.
Sign ’em? I’ll die first, ten thousand times!
#BIMBO.
You’ll sign ’em. We’ll hold you and guide your hand.
#LYDIA.
You’ll make him a pirate? Oh, death were better for us both!
#BIMBO.
Fetch him here.
#ROBERT.
They shall not make me! Let me go, you black villains! I defy you!
#BIMBO.
There! You’re writing it, my lad. “Robert.” That’s done. It’s a bad hand, but legible. What’s your last name?
#ROBERT.
You’ll never know.
#BIMBO.
Never mind. Robert is enough. Your hand’s been to our parchment, and you’re one of us by law.
#LYDIA.
Oh! Ha’ mercy!
#BIMBO.
Hold him here while I get the old man and his daughter back to their own vessel. Come, mistress.
#LYDIA.
Father, you can save him. You can pay ransom for him. You can promise to send them coin from England. Father!
#BIMBO.
Bring them with me!
#LYDIA.
Father, tell them you’ll pay them. Father -
#ROBERT.
Mr. Driscoll, if you will, I’ll pay you back. I’ll save till -
#DRISCOLL.
You villain! You think she’s for the likes of you, do you? You knew I meant to wed her to her cousin Jock in Liverpool, and you made love to her on the sly. Don’t look for help from me. You’ve got your deserts, and I’m glad of it. You’ll hang when they catch you, because you’re signed and made into a bloody pirate. Why, blast you -
#BIMBO.
He’s profane again. Stop him!
#DRISCOLL.
You’re a bloody - bluggy -
#BIMBO.
That’s another oath. You use that word as profanity. Shame! Lock him in his cabin on his own ship and let him swear there; we can’t have it on ours. Come, madam.
#LYDIA.
No!
#ROBERT.
Lydia! I shall find a way to throw myself into the sea. Think of me - sometimes!
#LYDIA.
Father, you shan’t abandon him. You don’t know - you don’t know - you don’t know -
#BIMBO.
He doesn’t know what?
#LYDIA.
It is his own son he abandons.
#BIMBO.
His son?
#LYDIA.
His son - in - law. We were married the night before we sailed from Jamaica!
#BIMBO.
Oh - oh, pshaw!
#THE GUNNER.
Well, if that isn’t news to make a man sick! Just when we thought we had a fellow could pilot us on the richest coast in - well, it is - it’s a nuisance! Come along, you!
#DRISCOLL.
I won’t. Now, blast your vitals, I’ll -
#THE GUNNER.
Stop it!
#DRISCOLL.
Bla -
#THE GUNNER.
Shame on you! It’s worse, him being your son - in - law and almost your own flesh and blood. Shame!
#DRISCOLL.

No. No, he isn’t - not unless the lady consents. Now, if he joins us, he might make a very good living and maybe a snug fortune before middle age. Wouldn’t you consent to it?
#LYDIA.
Never!
#BIMBO.
That’s the end of it, then. He’ll have to be crossed off. Our laws strictly forbid us to force a married man unless we obtain his wife’s consent. Let him go.

#BIMBO.
Kiss your wife - on Sunday! Where was you brought up?

#THE GUNNER.
His honor will deliver his weekly address. Trumpets there for his honor!
