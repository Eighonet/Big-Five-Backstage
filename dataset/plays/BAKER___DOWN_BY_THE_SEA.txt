#MRS. GROVENOR.
Do, March, stop that confounded racket!
#MARCH.
Racket! well that’s a good one. Mother Gale, you’ve got no ear for music.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
More ear than you have voice. Do you call that singing?
#MARCH.
To be sure I do.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
March Gale, if you don’t stop that catawauling, I’ll fling this flat - iron right straight at your head.
#MARCH.
Now, don’t, Mother Gale. Don’t you do it. The iron would enter my soul.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Dear, dear! what does ail that boy? March Gale, you’ll distract our fine city boarders.
#MARCH.
Not a bit of it. Don’t they come from the great city where there’s lots of grand uproars, organ - grinders, and fiddlers. I tell you, Mother Gale, they are pining for the delights of the city; and I’m a public benefactor, when, by the sound of my musical voice, I wake in their hearts tender recollections of “Home, sweet Home.”
#MRS. GROVENOR.
I do wish you were sailing. Now, do stop, that’s a good boy. You make my head ache awfully.
#MARCH.
Do I? why didn’t you say that before: I’m done. But, Mother Gale, what do you suppose sent these rich people to this desolate spot?
#MRS. GROVENOR.
It’s their whims, I s’pose: rich people are terrible whimsical. Mr. Raymond told your father he wanted a quiet place down by the sea.
#MARCH.
Blest if he hasn’t got it! It’s almost as desolate here as poor old Robinson Crusoe’s Island.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Well, well! p’raps he had a hankering for this spot, for he was born down here. Ah, me! how times do change. I remember the time when Abner Raymond was a poor fisherman’s boy. Law sakes, boy, when I was a gal, he used to come sparking me; and he and John Gale have had many a fight, all along of me. Well, he went off to the city, got edicated, and finally turned out a rich man.
#MARCH.
You don’t say so. Why, Mother Gale, you might have been a rich lady.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
P’raps I might, March; p’raps I might: but I chose John Gale; and I never regretted it, never.
#MARCH.
Bully for you, Mother Gale, and bully for Daddy Gale, too. He’s a trump. But I say, Mother Gale, isn’t Miss Kate a beauty? My eyes! Keep a sharp look - out, Mother Gale, a sharp eye on our Sept.; for, if I’m not much mistaken, he’s over head and ears in love with her.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Goodness, gracious! what an awful idea!
#MARCH.
Awful! perhaps it is; but she likes it. I’ve seen them on the rocks as chipper as a pair of blackbirds; her eyes glistening and her cheeks rosy, while Sept. was pouring all sorts of soft speeches into her ears.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Heavens and airth! this won’t do! I’ll tell your father of this the minit he comes home.
#MARCH.
No you won’t, Mother Gale. Hush, here’s the young lady now.
#KATE.
May I come in?
#MRS. GROVENOR.
To be sure you may, and welcome It’s awful dirty here.
#KATE.
Dirt? I have not yet been able to discover a particle in the house. It’s a miracle of cleanliness. Well, March, what are you doing?
#MARCH.
Oh! fixin’ up the lines a little.
#KATE.
Who was singing? While I was sewing I’m sure I heard a musical voice.
#MARCH.
No: did you though? Do you hear that, Mother Gale. Miss Kate heard a musical voice. I am the owner of that voice, and I’m mighty proud of it; for there’s precious little I do own in this world.
#KATE.
You should cultivate it.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Fiddlesticks! there’s no more music in that boy than there is in a nor’easter.
#MARCH.
Now, Mother Gale, don’t show your ignorance of music. Yes, Miss Kate, I should cultivate it; but then, you see. I’m an orphan.
#KATE.
An orphan?
#MARCH.
Yes, an orphan, - a poor, miserable, red - headed orphan. The only nurse I ever had was the sea, and a precious wet one she was.
#KATE.
Do you mean to say you are not the son of John Gale?
#MARCH.
That’s the melancholy fact: I’m nobody’s son. I was found upon the sands, after a fearful storm and a shipwreck, very wet and very hungry, by Daddy Gale. This little occurrence was in the month of March. Fearing, from my youth and inexperience, I should be likely to forget the circumstances of my birth, Daddy Gale christened me March, and it’s been march ever since. You march here, and you march there.
#KATE.
And September?
#MARCH.
Oh! Sept. came in the same way, by water, a little sooner, the September before. Daddy Gale evidently expected to complete the calendar, and have a whole almanac of shipwrecked babbies.
#KATE.
He is not Mr. Gale’s son?
#MARCH.
No, he’s a nobody, too: we’re a pair of innocent but unfortunate babbies.
#KATE.
Strange I have not heard this before. I have been here nearly a month.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Bless your dear soul, John Gale doesn’t like to talk about it. He’s precious fond of these boys; and I tell him he’s afeard somebody will come and claim ’um. But he’s done his duty by them. No matter how poor the haul, how bad the luck, he always manages to lay by something for their winter’s schooling; and, if ever anybody should claim them, they can’t complain that they have’nt had an edication.
#MARCH.
That’s so, Mother Gale, all but my singing; but I have strong hopes of somebody coming to claim me. I feel I was born to be something great, - a great singer, or something else.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Something else, most likely.
#MARCH.
Yes. I expect to see my rightful owner appearing in a coach and four to bear me to his ancestrial castle.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Fiddlesticks!
#MARCH.
Mother Gale, your ejaculations are perfectly distressing. I don’t open my mouth to indulge in a few fond hopes, but you ram your everlasting “fiddlesticks” down my throat to choke all my soaring fancies.
#MRS. GROVENOR.
Well, I should think your throat would be sore, with all those big words.
#MARCH.
Yes, Miss Kate: I have strong hopes of being rewarded for my blighted youth with one or more parents of some standing in the world.
#KATE.
I trust your hopes will be realized. This is a strange story, and will interest my father, startle him; for years ago he lost a child by shipwreck. child, - a boy?
#KATE.
Yes, a boy, the child of his first wife, who left France with her infant in a ship that never reached her port.
#MARCH.
Good gracious! when was this?
#KATE.
Oh! a long, long time ago, before I was born, for I am the daughter of his second wife: it must have been twenty, - yes, more than twenty years ago. boy, shipwrecked twenty years ago. Good gracious, it almost takes away my breath.
#KITTY.
Much obliged, I’m sure. You’d better come in.
#MARCH.
Hallo! there’s Kitty. Hallo, Kitty! who’s that you are talking to?
#KITTY.
Wouldn’t you like to know, Mister Gale?
#MARCH.
To be sure I should.
#KITTY.
Well, you can’t: a pretty idea, that I can’t have a beau without being obliged to tell you who it is! beau! It’s that Bige Parker: I know it is.
#KITTY.
Well, suppose it is, Mr. March Gale.
#MARCH.
I’ll just give him the biggest licking ever he had: you see if I don’t.
#KITTY.
What for, pray?
#MARCH.
What right has he to be tagging after you, I’d like to know?
#KITTY.
Suppose I choose to let him, Mr. Gale; and suppose I like to have him, Mr. Gale. What do you say to that?
#MARCH.
That I’ll punch him all the harder when I get at him.
#KITTY.
Will you? You’re a pretty brother, ain’t you? Won’t let your sister have a beau without making a fuss!
#MARCH.
I ain’t your brother: you know I ain’t. I’m a shipwrecked innocent.
#KITTY.
Oh, ho, ho! you’re a pretty innocent, you are!
#MRS. GALE.
Kitty Gale, stop your laughing and behave yourself. Don’t you see Miss Kate? Where have you been?
#KITTY.
Oh! I’ve been over to Mrs. Parker’s.
#MARCH.
Bige Parker’s. Darn him.
#KITTY.
Mrs. Parker was not at home : nobody but Bige.
#MARCH.
I’d like to get hold of him: I’d send him home, and keep him there.
#KITTY.
Oh, dear! I am so hungry!
#MARCH.
I am glad of it.
#KITTY.
Bige Parker wanted to give me a great thick slice of bread and butter; but I knew there was somebody at home who could spread bread and butter better than he.
#MARCH.
No: did you, Kitty? you just keep still, and I’ll bring you a slice.
#KATE.
O Kitty, Kitty! I suspect you are a little coquette.
#KITTY.
Me! why I never thought of such a thing.
#MRS. GALE.
It’s about time for John to be back.
#MARCH.
There, Kitty, there you are!
#KITTY.
Oh! ain’t that nice, now if I only had a seat.
#MARCH.
Here’s one: here’s a high old seat
#MRS. GALE.
I told you you’d catch it
#MARCH.
You didn’t tell me any such thing: I found it out myself. Look at that There’s a blister.
#KATE.
Dear me! I forgot I had a message to deliver. Father would like to see you in his room a moment.
#MRS. GALE.
I’ll go right up.
#KATE.
Where’s Sept., March: I haven’t seen him this morning?
#MARCH.
I saw him off the point about an hour ago: it’s about time he was in.
#KATE.
Come up to my room when you have finished your luncheon. I’ve something to show you.
#KITTY.
Yes, I’ll come right up.
#MRS. GALE.
Now, March, be careful of that musical voice of yours while I’m gone: don’t strain it.
#KITTY.
March Gale! you ain’t a bit perlite: why don’t you give me a seat?
#MARCH.
Well, I’ll give you a seat, now the flat - iron’s out of the way
#KITTY.
Isn’t she pretty?
#MARCH.
Mother Gale?
#KITTY.
Mother Gale! No: Miss Kate.
#MARCH.
Yes, indeed.
#KITTY.
And she’s so rich, and dresses so fine. I suppose she lives in a big house with a buffalo on top, and a pizzaro, and a miranda, and all that.
#MARCH.
Yes, indeed, she’s very rich; but then you just wait till my mysterious parent turns up. I know he’s a rich man: you never heard of a shipwrecked baby but what had a rich father, - never. Sometimes I think he’s a rich English lord, or a French marquis, or a Turkish bashaw. I do hope he’s a Turk: I am very fond of Turkey.
#KITTY.
So am I, with cranberry sauce.
#MARCH.
Oh, pshaw! what’s the use poking fun!
#KITTY.
Do you know what I would do if I was rich?
#MARCH.
No: what is it?
#KITTY.
I’d have some molasses on my bread.
#MARCH.
You won’t have to wait for that
#KITTY.
Now, ain’t he obliging. I do like to be waited upon: and there’s plenty to wait upon me; for, between March and Bige Parker, I’m very comfortably settled.
#MARCH.
Here you are Kitty
#KITTY.
Oh, ain’t that sweet!
#MARCH.
Yes, Kitty, I’ve been thinking that it’s about time I should make an effort to find my father.
#KITTY.
But what can you do? there is nothing by which you can be identified.
#MARCH.
No, but instinct will guide me. I know, if I once set eyes on the man who is truly my father, there will be a come - all - overishness that will cause me to rush into his arms, crying, “Father, behold your son!” In the mean time I must wait.
#KITTY.
While you are waiting, suppose you take me down from this table.
#MARCH.
All right , down you come. I say, Kitty, what did Bige Parker say to you?
#KITTY.
Oh! lots of sweet things.
#MARCH.
Darn him!
#KITTY.
Let me see, - what did he say? He said that the sand seemed like shining gold when I walked upon it.
#MARCH.
I’d like to stuff his throat with it: perhaps it would change the color.
#KITTY.
He said the sky seemed filled with beautiful rainbows.
#MARCH.
I’d like to paint a rainbow round his eyes. He might see stars too.
#KITTY.
And the water -
#MARCH.
Oh, confound the water! you set me on fire. I’ll punch that Bige Parker, you see if I don’t.
#KITTY.
Why, March, you’re jealous.
#MARCH.
Jealous! well, perhaps I am. But I won’t have that Bige Parker sneaking after you: mind that, now. And the next time I see him grinning at you, he’ll catch it: mind that, too. He’s a confounded sneak, darn him.
#KITTY.
Well, I declare, March is really jealous. Now, that’s too bad.
#JOHN GALE.
What’s too bad, Kitty? Where’s all the folks? where’s your marm? where’s Sept.? Where’s anybody?
#KITTY.
Where’s anybody? why, don’t you see me?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, I see you, you chatterbox. Where’s your mother?
#KITTY.
Up - stairs.
#JOHN GALE.
Up - stairs: now, what is she doing up - stairs?
#KITTY.
I’m sure I don’t know.
#JOHN GALE.
Then run and find out.
#KITTY.
Well, I suppose -
#JOHN GALE.
You suppose! Now, what right have you to suppose? Run and find out, quick!
#KITTY.
Gracious, the fish don’t bite.
#JOHN GALE.
Pretty time of day, this is. Cold, wet, and hungry; and nobody at home. Wonder where my rich boarder is? Having what he calls a siesta, I s’pose. Well, every one to his taste; but the idea of a live man snoozing in the house when there’s salt water, a bright sun, and a roaring breeze outside. Bah!
#MRS. GALE.
Well, John, back again?
#JOHN GALE.
Back, of course I’m back. You don’t s’pose I’d stay out after four hours’ fishing, without a bite, do you? Hey!
#MRS. GALE.
Well, you needn’t bite me. You’ve had bad luck.
#JOHN GALE.
Now, what’s the use of telling me that? Don’t I know it? I tell you what, old lady, if we ain’t mighty careful, we shall have nothing to eat one of these days.
#MRS. GALE.
When that time comes, we’ll begin to complain. But with two sich boys as our Sept. and our March -
#JOHN GALE.
Now, what’s the use of talking about them boys? What are they good for? Where’s Sept.?
#MRS. GALE.
Off in his boat, I s’pose.
#JOHN GALE.
His boat! a pretty boat he’s got. If he’s not kerful, he’ll see the bottom afore he knows it.
#MRS. GALE.
Our Sept.! Why, he’s the best boatman along shore. You needn’t be scared about him.
#JOHN GALE.
Not when he’s a stout plank under him. But that skiff of his is as frail as a shingle. Where’s March?
#MRS. GALE.
I left him here a minnit ago.
#JOHN GALE.
There’s another beauty. I tell you what, Mother Gale, I’m going to turn over a new leaf with these boys. I won’t have so much of this shirking work. Sept. shall sell that boat; and March -
#MRS. GALE.
Why, you ugly old bear! what’s the matter with you? Turn over a new leaf indeed! Well, that’s a good one. Only this morning you were blessing your stars you had two such boys, - the best and smartest -
#JOHN GALE.
Humbug! you don’t know what you are talking about. I tell you they’re a good - for - nothing, lazy pair of - Hallo! here’s Raymond.
#MR.
R., R.)
#MR. RAYMOND.
Halloo, Gale! back already? what luck?
#JOHN GALE.
Hem! luck. Precious poor.
#MR. RAYMOND.
I’m sorry for that. But, Gale, my daughter has been telling me a strange story about these boys. They’re not yours.
#JOHN GALE.
Who says they ain’t? I’d like to know who’s a better right to ’em.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Well, well, I’m not going to dispute it. But I would like to hear the story from your lips.
#JOHN GALE.
It’ll be a precious short one, I can tell you. Well, they ain’t my boys. They were shipwrecked on the coast twenty - three years ago.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Twenty - three years ago?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, exactly twenty - three years ago, in the month of September, we were awakened one night by the booming of guns off shore. ’Twas a black night, I tell you, - a roaring gale, the sea dashed over the rocks almost to our door, and the rain poured in torrents. We hastened to the beach. Half a mile off, stuck fast in the sands, was a ship, blue - lights burning and cannons firing. It was no use: mortal man could not reach her in such a sea. In the morning, scattered pieces of the wreck, a few dead bodies, and a live baby, was all there was left of her. living child?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, our Sept. A precious tough time he had of it, I can tell you: we thought he’d die; but mother’s care and a healthy constitution brought him through, and there is not a smarter boatmen or a better lad on all the coast than our Sept., if I do say it.
#MRS. GALE.
Why, John, you said just now -
#JOHN GALE.
What’s the use of talking about what I said just now? You never did take kindly to him; but I say he’s the best lad -
#MRS. GALE.
John Gale, you’re stark, staring mad! Don’t I idolize ’em both?
#MR. RAYMOND.
But the other, Gale?
#JOHN GALE.
Well, he came in the same way. ’Twas very queer; but the very next March, in a blinding storm, we were again turned out at night by the booming of guns. Another ship in the sands; more blue lights; in the morning, more wreck, more dead bodies, and another live baby.
#MR. RAYMOND.
March?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, March; and he was a roarer, I tell you. We haven’t had a shipwreck since: the squalls of that brat, night after night, was enough to scare off all the ships in creation. He weathered it; and though I do say he’s a smart clever - You confounded scoundrel! where have you been?
#MARCH.
My! touching biography. Where have I been? been looking for you.
#MR. RAYMOND.
But, Gale, was no inquiries ever made for these lads?
#JOHN GALE.
No; and I didn’t take particular care to hunt up their owners. If they don’t care enough for ’em to hunt ’em up, I’m content. They’ve been well brought up: they’re a credit to anybody. There’s a good home for ’em here; there’s the broad ocean for their labor; and there are honest hearts here that love ’em as their own; and, if they’re not content, ’twill not be the fault of John Gale.
#MARCH.
Hurrah for John Gale!
#JOHN GALE.
Now, what do you mean by yelling in that way, you good - for - nothing -
#MRS. GALE.
Smart, clever, - Hey, John?
#JOHN GALE.
Now what’s the use of talking -
#MR. RAYMOND.
But these lads, Gale: was nothing found about them by which they could be identified?
#JOHN GALE.
No; Sept. was well bundled up in nice soft flannels, while March was tied up in an old pea - jacket: but no name or marks about them.
#MR. RAYMOND.
This is very strange - very strange.
#KITTY.
Oh, dear! - run, quick! - run, quick!
#MARCH.
Run quick! where, what’s the matter?
#KITTY.
Oh, dear! I’m so frightened!
#JOHN GALE.
What is it?
#ALL.
Speak, speak!
#KITTY.
Oh! do wait till I get my breath! No, no! run quick!
#MRS. GALE.
Lord sakes, Kitty! what is the matter?
#KITTY.
I was up in Miss Raymond’s room, looking out of the window -
#ALL.
Well, well!
#KITTY.
Oh! if you don’t run quick something will happen.
#MARCH.
Well, well, where shall we run?
#KITTY.
I saw Miss Kate walking on the rocks -
#ALL.
Well, well!
#KITTY.
When suddenly she slipped -
#ALL.
Well, well -
#KITTY.
And fell into the sea. DOOR, C. ENTER SEPT., C., WITH KATE IN HIS ARMS.
#SEPT.
Very wet, but safe and sound.
#MRS. GALE.
Thank Heaven!
#MR. RAYMOND.
My daughter!
#MARCH.
Hurrah for Sept.!
#MRS. GALE.
Here, Kitty, March, run for my camphire. Land sakes, what are you doing? ye’ll set the house afire.
#MARCH.
Darn your old irons: there’s another blister.
#KATE.
Don’t be alarmed, there’s nothing the matter. I accidentally slipped off the rock; but, thanks to dear Sept., I am quite safe.
#MRS. GALE.
Come right straight up to your room, and change your clothes. You’ll ketch your death a cold. Come right along.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Sept. Gale, Heaven bless you! you’ve done a noble deed.
#SEPT.
Well, well, here’s a jolly spree about just nothing at all! But, I say, March, isn’t she splendid? Do you know, when I pulled her from the water into my little craft - I couldn’t help it - I felt as though she belonged to me. Yes: rich, young, beautiful as she is, but for the arm of the rough sailor she would now be sleeping her long sleep beneath the waves.
#MARCH.
Well, I dunno about her belonging to you. All the fish you pull out of the water are yours; but a woman isn’t exactly a fish.
#SEPT.
No, no, not exactly, March.
#MARCH.
Sept., you’re a lucky dog. That’s just your luck. I might have been on the water a month without making such a haul as that.
#SEPT.
Well, Father Gale, my little spinning Jenny, as you call her, has done good service to - day. Haven’t you a little better opinion of her?
#JOHN GALE.
Sept., my boy, as March says, you’ve had a streak of luck. But don’t brag about that boat.
#SEPT.
But I will, though. She is the fastest sailer on the coast; the neatest trimmed, and the cleanest built; and I’m proud of her. Hallo, Kitty, what’s the matter?
#KITTY.
Oh, dear, this is an awful world! Suppose Miss Kate should have been drowned, - and she would if it hadn’t been for me, - hurrying down stairs to tell -
#MARCH.
After she had been saved. You’re a smart one, you are.
#KITTY.
I couldn’t help being late, could I?
#SEPT.
Well, mother, all right, hey?
#MRS. GALE.
Yes, Sept., all right. Come right here and kiss me. You’re a dear, good, noble -
#SEPT.
Now, don’t, mother. You’ll spoil me. You’ll make me believe I’ve done something great instead of my duty.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Kate has quite recovered. Sept. Gale, how can I express my obligations, how reward -
#SEPT.
Now, please, don’t Mr. Raymond. Don’t say any thing about it. If I have been the humble instrument of Heaven in saving a life precious to you, believe me the consciousness of duty done is a rich reward, and I ask no other. Oh! here’s Kate.
#KATE.
Here I am, just as good as new. Where’s my preserver? Now, don’t raise your hand: I’m not going to say one word in praise of your conduct. Man was born to wait on woman; and so, sir, you will please follow me to the rock to find my handkerchief, and see that I don’t take another bath. Come along.
#SEPT.
Ay! Ay! I’ll watch you: never fear.
#JOHN GALE.
Mother Gale, it strikes me forcibly that if we are to have any dinner to - day -
#MRS. GALE.
Heavens and airth! I forgot all about it. You, March, run and split me some wood; and you, Kitty, peel me some pertaters; and you, John - dear, dear, what a confusion!
#MARCH.
Come along, Kitty.
#KITTY.
Dear me! If there’s any thing I hate, it’s peeling taters.
#MARCH.
Well, you jest wait until I get my wood, and I’ll fix ’em for you. Come along.
#JOHN GALE.
It strikes me, that March has a mighty fancy for our Kitty. Who knows but what there’ll be a wedding here some of these days? I say, Mr. Raymond, you’ll excuse me, but I must look arter my boat.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Oh, never mind me! Twenty - three years ago! What revelation can fate have in store for me? Twenty - three years ago, I was the possessor of a young and beautiful wife. Travelling in France, I was hastily summoned to America, and obliged to leave my wife, with her infant child, to follow me: she took passage in the ship Diana, in the summer of ’31: the vessel was never more heard of. Every inquiry was made, but no intelligence could be obtained. What was also remarkable, the ship Gladiator, which sailed from Havre on the same day, met a like mysterious fate. These boys found on the sands, - can they be connected with this history? Strange, strange, I never heard of this circumstance! But twenty years ago communication was more difficult than now; and that dreadful winter the fearful losses by storm were never known. New ties, - another wife, - she, too, gone, - a daughter loving and beloved, - have stilled the longings to gain tidings of the fate of the lost one: but this strange history awakens a desire to learn more. I have watched them attentively, but can see no resemblance to my lost wife in either of their faces. Yet something tells me that this strange meeting - this desolate place - the wrecks - the children - cannot be accidental. I will be calm, and watch and wait: for I believe that in one of these boys I shall find my lost son.
#MARCH.
It’s coming, it’s coming! Hold me, somebody! Hold me, especially my head, for I hear strange sounds! I hear the roll of carriage - wheels, and oh, there’s a piebald horse gave me a thundering kick in the head! What did he say? “one of these boys must be his lost son.” So, so! he’s got a lost son; and I’ve got a lost father, somewhere. I shouldn’t wonder if we found out we were related. I’ve seen quite a resemblance between Mr. Raymond and myself, - the same aristocratic air. Suppose it should be - oh! it must be, - I never could have been left out in that cold sand, hungry and wet, for nothing. Won’t it be gay? I long for the time when he will disclose himself. I knew he never could have come to this desolate spot for nothing. And now it’s all out.
#MRS. GALE.
Yes, it is all out, you lazy scamp! Didn’t I tell you to put the wood on the fire?
#MARCH.
Now, don’t scold, Mother Gale. There’s a fire here
#MRS. GALE.
I tell you, there’s no fire here. What are you thinking of?
#MARCH.
“I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls.”
#MRS. GALE.
Marble fiddlesticks! O March, March! you’ll never set the river afire!
#MARCH.
Won’t I, Mother Gale? You may be sure of one thing: I shan’t try in a hurry. Shall I tell her? no; I will keep silence, least I interfere with his plans.
#KITTY.
Oh, dear! oh, dear! I’ve cut my finger with those plaguey taters.
#MARCH.
Dear me, Kitty! you are always in trouble.
#KITTY.
Well, I couldn’t help it. My hands were never made to peel taters.
#MARCH.
No, indeed, they wa’nt. Here, let me fix it for you You shan’t do it again. Fortune has at last smiled upon me: I shall soon be rich, and then -
#KITTY.
How long must we wait?
#MRS. GALE.
How long must I wait for the pertaters?
#KITTY.
Oh, dear! I wish they were in the sea O March, look here, quick! There’s a yacht coming round the point. Isn’t she a beauty?
#MARCH.
My eyes! look at her! A gentleman’s yacht, and headed this way.
#MRS. GALE.
Mercy sakes! More visitors. Who can it be?
#MR. RAYMOND.
Confusion! That confounded Capt Dandelion, to escape whom I fled to this out - of - the - way place, is almost at the door in his yacht. His pursuit of Kate is persistent; and, but that I knew the utter selfishness of the man, I could honor him for the apparently unwearied patience with which he follows her. Well, child, you have heard of the new arrival? new arrival? No: who is it?
#MR. RAYMOND.
Your persevering gallant, Capt. Dandelion, is after you. That is his yacht just dropping anchor.
#KATE.
Now, what could have sent him here?
#MR. RAYMOND.
You don’t seem pleased. Perhaps I may have been unkind in thought; but, remembering your partiality for him in the city, I feared you might have clandestinely invited him here.
#KATE.
Why, Father! can you think so meanly of me? Capt. Dandelion is very pleasant society in the city; but here I can do without him. Oh! I forgot: Sept. wants to speak to you.
#SEPT.
Me? No I don’t.
#KATE.
Why, Sept.! what did you tell me when we were walking by the shore?
#SEPT.
What did I tell you? why - that - I - what did I tell you?
#KATE.
Come, come, sir.
#SEPT.
Well, then, I said you were very beautiful.
#KATE.
Oh, pshaw! not that.
#SEPT.
Yes, I did; and I meant it; that you were rich, admired and courted; that your presence here had been like the coming of a new star in a dark night, to light the path of us hardy fisherman; that - that -
#KATE.
O father! speak to him.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Well, Sept., I’m willing to obey; but what shall I say? - that I fear the presence of my daughter has made a young man forget his lowly station?
#SEPT.
Yes, you may say that: it has. It has made him forget that he is poor, rough, and untutored, - that there are social bonds which hold the rich within their circles, where the poor may not enter. He has forgot all, all this. For the manhood within him - the love of the beautiful implanted in his breast - has burst all slavish bonds, and his heart has forced from his lips the words, ‘I love you!’
#MR. RAYMOND.
And you have said this to my daughter?
#SEPT.
I have: I could not help it.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Base, - base, - base! you have taken advantage of having saved my daughter’s life -
#KATE.
Hold, father! you are mistaken. He has taken no advantage: I do not believe he ever thought of it. It was I who remembered that when I said, ‘Sept., I am glad to hear this; for I dearly, truly love you.’
#MR. RAYMOND.
Confound it, girl! what have you done?
#KATE.
Obeyed the instincts of a true woman, who, when she gains the heart of a man noble and good, accepts it fully and freely, caring not for wealth or station.
#MR. RAYMOND.
You’re a pair of romantic fools. I tell you, girl, you know not what you have done. This must not, cannot be.
#KATE.
Oh! but it is; you are too late: the mischief is done. So, father, give your consent and make us happy.
#KITTY.
O Miss Kate! here’s somebody to see you, - a real gentleman, with rings on his fingers and bells on his toes, I should say, a great mustache under his nose, and half a pair of specs in one eye; and he says “he’s deused wearwy, ah!”
#KATE.
That’s Capt. Dandelion, sure.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Wall, now, wearly, what a surpwise! You don’t know, my dear fwiends, what a search I’ve had for you; you don’t wearly!
#MR. RAYMOND.
Well, Captain, you have found us out. I suppose it would not be polite for me to say we came here on purpose to get rid of you?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Say it, my dear fellah, say it: it’s just like you; it is, wearly; you’re always joking. But, you know, you can’t affwont me, ’pon my word.
#MR. RAYMOND.
No: I wish I could.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
And how is the beautiful, bewitching, adowable Miss Kate?
#KATE.
Quite well, thank you, Captain. How are all our friends in the city?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Miserwable, perfectly miserwable: the sun don’t shine in the city when you are not there; it don’t, wearly. I couldn’t live there, and so I took my wacht and sailed after you.
#KITTY.
Took his what?
#KATE.
Excuse me, Captain: let me present my friends. This is Mr. March Gale.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
No, wearly? What a queer name! queer fish, too, ’pon honor.
#MARCH.
The Captain and I have met before. He’s a little near - sighted, and tumbled head over heels over a rock; but I picked him up.
#KATE.
And this is Mr. Sept. Gale.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Oh! wearly, a fisherman.
#SEPT.
Glad to see you, Captain, glad to see you: we’ll make you comfortable here; plenty of fish.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Fish! Yes, and lobsters, too: I’ve felt their claws.
#KATE.
And this is Miss Kitty Gale.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Ah, wearly! Positively bewitching! wuwal simplicity! Wenus in a clamshell! But all fisherman.
#KATE.
Yes, all fisherman; and you’ll find me handy with the line, too, thanks to Sept.’s teaching.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Glad to hear it; quite a womantic place this; so pwimitive, though it does smell hawibly of fish.
#MARCH.
Yes, Captain, she’s a capital fisherman. I do wish they would clear out, and give me a chance for a word with Mr. Raymond. There’s something in my bosom tells me -
#MRS. GALE.
March, March!
#MARCH.
Yes: there’s always something telling me that. It’s nothing but March.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
By the by, Miss Kate, I have a message from a friend in the city, Blanche Allen.
#KATE.
Dear Blanche! give it me quick.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
I declare I’ve left it in my wacht.
#KATE.
Oh! do run and get it quick. Come, I’ll go with you.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Will you? that’s deused kind of you, - it is wearly.
#KATE.
Come, come! I’m impatient to hear from dear Blanche.
#SEPT.
She seems mightily pleased with her city friend. Well, he’s an elegant gentleman, while I’m but a rough fisherman. Can I ever hope to win her! And yet she told me, but a little while ago, she loved me.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Sept., a word with you.
#SEPT.
Ay, ay, sir.
#MR. RAYMOND.
John Gale has been telling me a strange story about you. You are not his son.
#SEPT.
Ah, the story of the shipwreck. No, sir: I am not his son by birth; but he has been a true father to me, and I love him as though he were my own.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Have you no recollection of a mother?
#SEPT.
None: I was an infant when found upon the shore.
#MR. RAYMOND.
This rough fishing life, - do you like it?
#SEPT.
Like it! to be sure I do; for I have known no other. I was lulled to sleep in infancy by the dash of the waves upon the rocks, the whistling of the breeze among the shingles of the old house; and, winter and summer, I have been rocked upon the bosom of the only mother I know, - the ocean.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Oh! but there’s danger in it.
#SEPT.
Yes, there is danger; but who, with a true heart and a stout arm, cares for danger! Ah, that’s the sport of it! To be upon the sea when the winds are roaring, and the waves are seething in anger; to hear along shore the dash of the sea upon the rocks, and to know you have a stout plank beneath you and a light bark obedient to your command, braving the fury of the tempest, - ah, that’s glorious!
#MR. RAYMOND.
But it is mere drudgery. You have read some, I know. Have you never longed for other scenes, - other occupations?
#SEPT.
To be sure I have. As I have read of great generals and their campaigns, of merchant princes, - their thrift and industry, - I have longed to be among them, to bear a hand in the battle, to test my brain, or strain my sinews with the best.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Well, why have you never tried? The city is open to all who possess industry and talent.
#SEPT.
Ay, ay, sir. But here’s father and mother Gale; age is creeping upon them: who is to take care of them? No, no! let the dream pass. They might have left me to die upon the sands: but they took me to their hearts; and, with Heaven’s help, I’ll be a true son to them in their old age.
#MARCH.
Halloo! what’s going on here! Something about me.
#MR. RAYMOND.
March, - is he contented here?
#MARCH.
Not by a long chalk.
#SEPT.
March? Oh! he’s a queer fish; his head is filled with whimsical notions regarding his parentage.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Has he any clue to his parents?
#SEPT.
No more than I have.
#MARCH.
Don’t be too sure of that.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Has he any recollection of a mother?
#MARCH.
Most certainly he has.
#MR. RAYMOND.
How?
#MARCH.
That is, I think I must have had one; and my father, - I know where he is, and just what he looks like.
#MR. RAYMOND.
You do!
#MARCH.
Yes: he’s rather tall, gray hair, dresses well, and looks like me.
#MR. RAYMOND.
A very accurate description.
#MARCH.
You know him, then?
#MR. RAYMOND.
Me! how should I?
#MARCH.
He’s rich too.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Ah! that’s good.
#MARCH.
Yes; and he’s got his eye on me. He’s looking after me. He’s only waiting to see how I take it. He fears it will overcome me: but when he finds I am instinctively drawn towards him; when he finds I only wait to hear a voice say -
#KITTY.
March, I’ve peeled the taters.
#MARCH.
Confound your taters!
#MR. RAYMOND.
Well, well, March, remember the old adage, “Patient waiting, no loss.” Come, Sept., let’s go down and look at the captain’s boat.
#MARCH.
Kitty Gale, you’re enough to try the patience of Job: just when I was on the brink of a discovery, you must pop in, and spoil every thing.
#KITTY.
How could I help it? I did’nt know you was on the brink of any thing.
#MARCH.
In another moment, I should have found my father.
#KITTY.
Oh, pshaw! you’re always finding a father. I don’t believe you ever had one.
#MARCH.
You don’t, hey? I have got one, and he’s rich too; got a fine horse -
#KITTY.
Then why don’t you find him? Bige Parker don’t have to hunt for his father!
#MARCH.
Bige Parker! Do you dare to speak his name to me?
#KITTY.
To be sure I do. I’m going to walk with him to - night: perhaps he’ll see more beautiful rainbows.
#MARCH.
We’ll see about that. I’ll just go and hunt him up, and he’ll ketch the darndest licking ever he got: you see if he don’t.
#KITTY.
Now he’s gone off mad. Well, I don’t care.
#MRS. GALE.
Come, Kitty, hurry and set the table
#KITTY.
Lord! here comes the captain back again.
#KATE.
It’s no use, Captain; my answer is still the same: I can never marry you.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Now, that’s deused unpleasant, after a fellah has come down here in his wacht.
#MRS. GALE.
What’s he say? he’s got warts! I’ll cure ’em for him.
#KITTY.
Hush, mother! he’s making love to Miss Kate.
#MRS. GALE.
Land sakes! he don’t look strong enough to make love to a skeeter.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Do let me entreat you to reverse your decision.
#KATE.
Not another word, Captain. Ah! here’s Mr. Gale. Mr. Gale, let me make you acquainted with a friend of mine, Capt. Dandelion.
#MR. GALE.
Glad to see you, Captain. I’ve been admiring your yacht. She’s a beauty.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Another fisherman. More lobsters’ claws.
#MR. RAYMOND.
John Gale, I forgot one question about the wrecks. Did you find no name about them?
#JOHN GALE.
Name? yes. We found the name of one on pieces of the wreck. ’Twas the Gladiator. The name of the other, on a bucket, - this one , the Diana.
#MR. RAYMOND.
The Diana? Merciful Heaven! which one was this?
#JOHN GALE.
The first. The one which gave us our Sept.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Sept.?
#JOHN GALE.
You seem mighty interested in these wrecks.
#MR. RAYMOND.
I am, I am, John Gale. My wife and her infant son sailed from Havre in that same Diana, twenty - three years ago. She was the only passenger with a child: of that I have had abundant proof. This wreck, this name , the story of the wreck, are convincing proofs of the presence of my lost child beneath your roof. He can be no other than September Gale.
#SEPT.
Me? I your son?
#MR. RAYMOND.
Yes, my boy: you are indeed my son. You see now, Kate, why your marriage with him was impossible. He is your brother.
#KATE.
My brother? oh, misery!
#SEPT.
Her brother? thus ends my dream of happiness.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Her brother? ’Pon honor, my chance is wealy better.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, this does beat all natur.
#MRS. GALE.
Sept.! Sept.! My dear boy, I can’t lose you.
#MARCH.
Darn you, Bige Parker! You just come out here in this public highway.
#KITTY.
Why, March Gale! what have you been doing? Fighting Bige Parker?
#MARCH.
Yes, rather.
#KITTY.
Did you thrash him?
#MARCH.
Does this look like it?
#KITTY.
O March! there’s been such a time here! Mr. Raymond lost a son twenty - three years ago.
#MARCH.
Yes.
#KITTY.
And what do you think? - he’s just discovered him.
#MARCH.
I told you so, - I told you so! It’s coming.
#KITTY.
He’s discovered him here.
#MARCH.
Yes, yes.
#KITTY.
And who do you suppose it is?
#MARCH.
Suppose? I know, Kitty. Can I smother the paternal instinct in my bosom? It is - it is -
#KITTY.
Our Sept.
#MARCH.
O Lord! there’s another black eye for me.
#MRS. GALE.
Heavens and airth! All my best chiny!
#MARCH.
Now, isn’t this a nice little family party? Since Sept. found his father, the house has been about as lively as a funeral. Daddy Gale is as cross as Julius Cæsar, and Mother Gale as dumb as an oyster. Sept. doesn’t seem to take kindly to his new position; and Miss Kate acts as though she had lost a mother, instead of finding a brother. Nobody seems to have any life, except Kitty; and she’s busy flirting with that Capt. Dandelion - confound him. I say, Mother Gale?
#MRS. GALE.
Well?
#MARCH.
Where’s Sept.?
#MRS. GALE.
Don’no, and don’t care.
#MARCH.
Daddy Gale?
#JOHN GALE.
Well?
#MARCH.
Where’s Sept.?
#JOHN GALE.
Don’no, and don’t care?
#MARCH.
Dry weather, ain’t it?
#JOHN GALE.
Now, what’s the use of talking about the weather?
#MARCH.
So I say: what’s the use of talking at all? I like singing better , -
#MARCH.
I thought that would fetch them.
#MRS. GALE.
If John Gale was any kind of a man, he’d soon put an end to sich nonsense.
#JOHN GALE.
Now, what’s the use of telling about John Gale? You spilt the boys! you know you did.
#MRS. GALE.
Gracious goodness! the man is crazy: I spiled ’em?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, you.
#MRS. GALE.
John Gale, you’re a brute.
#JOHN GALE.
You’re another.
#MARCH.
Hallo! it’s getting squally here.
#JOHN GALE.
Here I find these ’ere lads left to die on the shore: and, in the goodness of my heart, I brings ’em home, and tries to make good, honest men on ’em; but what have you done? You’ve made one a fine gentleman, that don’t know us; and the other a sassy chap, that’s eternally squalling when we want peace and quiet.
#MRS. GALE.
Well, I never, John Gale! if I had a skillet, I’d comb your hair for you, you brute.
#SEPT.
Hallo! hallo! what’s the matter now? Silent! no word of welcome for me! Well, well, what’s gone wrong, father? what’s gone wrong?
#JOHN GALE.
Now, what’s the use of calling me father? I ain’t yer father. You’ve got a rich father, rolling in riches; and you’re a great man now. Of course you look down on us poor fishing - folks: it’s what we expected.
#SEPT.
Indeed!
#MRS. GALE.
Yes: poor folks must remember their station now.
#SEPT.
Ay, mother, that they must. If they are honest and true, loving God and their fellow - men, their station is the proudest and the noblest among mankind: for the hands they raise to heaven bear the proof - marks of their kinship to Nature’s first nobleman, Father Adam; and their hearts are rolls of honor, ever brightened by inscriptions of good works and noble heroism.
#MRS. GALE.
Heavens and airth! do hear that boy talk!
#SEPT.
Pray heaven, I may never forget mine, - never forget the kind benefactors who in my helplessness rescued me from the fury of the storm, who took me to their hearts, watched over me in sickness, guided my feet in the path of duty, and made a man of me. It may be as you say, - that I have found a father, one who claims me by right of birth; but my heart beats with no such feeling of love, of reverence, and of duty, towards him, as it does for the honest, true - hearted old fisherman, John Gale
#JOHN GALE.
God bless you, Sept.! God bless you, boy! I knew you were true as steel; but the old lady -
#MRS. GALE.
Now, stop, John Gale! don’t you go to slandering.
#SEPT.
And a mother! where shall I find her? They tell me, that, long ago, she found a grave beneath the wave; but my heart tells me she is here, - here, where my childhood was passed; here among the rocks and sands, where the wild winds roar their loudest and the dark waves beat their fiercest. At the feet of her who first taught me the name of mother, I lay a son’s love and duty, which she, and she alone, has right to claim
#MRS. GALE.
O Sept., Sept.! my dear, dear, boy: we thought we were going to lose you now you are rich and high in the world.
#SEPT.
Never fear, mother, never fear. Come what will, this is my home. We have weathered it together when the clouds of adversity gathered thick about, and we’ll share together the sunshine of prosperity which now breaks upon us.
#MRS. GALE.
Dear me, dear me! what does ail my glasses? I can’t see. There, I’ve dropped another stitch; and good gracious! where’s my handkercher? I declare, I’ve dropped it somewhere - I never did see such careless -
#JOHN GALE.
Hang me if I don’t believe something, run into my pipe, and put it out. Well, Sept., here’s my hand: you’re an honor to us, and all you’ve got is rightly yours; you deserve it. Come, March, let’s go down and look arter the boats.
#SEPT.
with mouth open.)
#SEPT.
Hallo, March, who are you staring at?
#MARCH.
At a chap that’s got a father. It’s a wonderful curiosity to me. I say, Sept., how does it feel?
#SEPT.
Well, March, thus far I can’t say I like it.
#MARCH.
Don’t like it? what a queer chap you are! I wish I was in your shoes.
#SEPT.
I wish with all my heart you were. rich father and a beautiful sister!
#SEPT.
Sister! Ah, there’s the sting!
#MARCH.
Why, you don’t mean to say - oh? good gracious! why, you were dead in love with her - you can’t marry her now, you know.
#SEPT.
No: all my fond dreams of happiness are dispelled by this unfortunate affair.
#MARCH.
Unfortunate! well, you are a queer one. Don’t I wish it was me? wouldn’t I make the money fly?
#JOHN GALE.
March, March, must I wait all day for you, hay?
#MARCH.
Hallo! I forgot I had a job on hand. Good - by Sept., - poor unfortunate son of a millionnaire.
#SEPT.
Sister! can I ever call her by that name; must I forever relinquish the hope of claiming her by a dearer title. No, no: I bear to her something warmer than a brother’s love. This cannot be: this man Raymond treated with scorn my overtures for the hand of his daughter. He can have no proof that I am his son, - nothing but the fact that his infant child was a passenger in the vessel that left me on the sands. He cannot claim me upon such a mere thread as this. Perhaps it is a plot to keep me quiet until his daughter is married to some wealthy suitor; and then how easy to discover his mistake, and cast me adrift in the world. Ah! here is Kate. Good - morning, sister.
#KATE.
Sister?
#SEPT.
It sounds strange from my lips, does it not?
#KATE.
Indeed, it does, Sept.: you know I have never been called so before; and - and -
#SEPT.
You expected once that I should use a dearer title.
#KATE.
Once - O Sept., Sept.! this is so strange. We were so happy yesterday, it seems like awakening from a glorious dream. That you should be fated to call me by the name of sister - it is cruel. I awoke last night, and saw the moonbeams stream in at my window. I arose, and looked out upon the night! the waters were calm and peaceful; the moon glistened upon the rocks, lighting the very spot where you and I sat last night, telling our future hopes. I know it was wicked; but I was so wretched, so miserable, I wished I was sleeping calm and still beneath the waves from which you rescued me, ere I had awakened to such misery as this.
#SEPT.
Be calm, dear Kate: all will yet be well; I am not your brother.
#KATE.
Not my brother! you jest now. My father has claimed you.
#SEPT.
But there is something here that revolts at the kinship. Why should he claim me as his son? There are no proofs, no likeness to him, or her he calls my mother. Nothing but the mere fact that I was found after the wreck of the vessel in which his wife sailed.
#KATE.
No, no! Sept., he must be right. He does see a resemblance to his lost wife in your face. No, no! it must be true.
#SEPT.
I will not believe it without further proof. I do not feel towards him as I know I should were he my father; and as for a brother’s love, the love within my heart for you is of a higher and a holier nature than even that of brother. Kate, you told me last night that you loved me, that you would one day be my wife: will you still keep your promise?
#KATE.
O Sept.! it is impossible!
#SEPT.
If this should be a trick, - a trick to rob me of you, - this claim put forward to keep me from your path until you had wed a richer suitor -
#KATE.
Why, Sept., you cannot believe my father so base as that: you are mad?
#SEPT.
Yes, Kate! I am mad, - madly in love with you. Believe me, I am not your brother. This is, at the best, a mere suspicion.
#KATE.
Suspicion! yes: it is a suspicion, but one that must forever separate us. It may be you are right, and something at my heart tells me you are; but this suspicion will forever darken my life. No, Sept.; much as I love you, it were better we should forever dismiss the hope. For, whether further proof should be found or not, every hope of happiness would be blasted by the fear - the dread - that you might be my brother. Sept., you shall always find in me a sister, a loving sister; ever watchful for your comfort, ever praying for your happiness; but, for Heaven’s sake, no more of a warmer tie.
#SEPT.
Have I lost her? What can I do? where turn to escape from this bewildering maze? Upon this I am determined: I will not accept this man’s bounty, or acknowledge his claim.
#MR. REDFACE.
My dear boy, I’ve just despatched a messenger to town with the glad tidings; and to - morrow we’ll leave this barren spot, and hie to the gay scenes of city - life. Gad! boy, we’ll make a gentleman of you. You must drop that outlandish name of September: you shall be Alden Raymond, jr.
#SEPT.
You go to town?
#MR. RAYMOND.
Yes, to - morrow: I’m impatient to show my city friends the fine lad I found down by the sea.
#SEPT.
I cannot share your gratification, sir, for I shall remain here.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Remain here! what for?
#SEPT.
Because I belong here. Mr. Raymond, I am extremely obliged to you for the kind interest you have manifested in me; but I cannot accept your claim. I do not believe I am your son.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Not my son! why, boy, you are crazy. There cannot be the least doubt of it: you came in the vessel with my wife; there was no other infant on board.
#SEPT.
That you are not certain of.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Certain! of course I am. I tell you, boy, there can be no mistake.
#SEPT.
There may be; there must be. I do not feel towards you the love of a son for his father; and, until some other proof is found, I shall remain here, and bear the only name to which I feel I have a right, - that of September Gale.
#MR. RAYMOND.
But, boy - Sept., come here. Confound him! Here’s a pretty predicament. Here’s an ungrateful scamp who refuses to acknowledge his father. I’ll disinherit him - oh, pshaw! what does he care for that? He’s a noble fellow, and he must be my son.
#KITTY.
Well, I declare, Captain, you are the most delightfulest beau that ever I saw.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
No, wealy: ’pon honor, you overwhelm me; you do, wealy, you dear, delightful little nymph of the sea.
#KITTY.
You’re the sweetest man: your conversation is so sugary.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Yes, jest so: ’pon my honor, I don’t know the weason, but the ladies in the city are very fond of me. I am quite a flower in the city.
#KITTY.
A sunflower! Oh, I do wish that March could see us!
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Yaas, you should go to the city; such a beautiful cweature is wasting her sweetness on the desert air in this howid place, that smells so of fish.
#KITTY.
Now, do you think so, Captain? Well, I’ve always thought I was born for a higher sphere.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
You were, weally. Your beauty would be the admiration of the whole city: it would, weally.
#KITTY.
O Captain! you flatter now.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Flatter? ’pon honor, no. Do let me take you to the city in my the trip would be delightful.
#KITTY.
What! I do believe the man wants me to run away with him.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Yaas, we could slip away from here, go to the city, see all the sights, and return, without any of these people being the wiser.
#MARCH.
Confound his picture! he’s trying to run off with Kitty.
#KITTY.
Why, what an idea! I run off with a man! -
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Who loves you to distraction; he does, weally.
#KITTY.
What would Miss Kate say?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Who cares what she says? ’Tis you I love, you whom I adore.
#KITTY.
Why, what would March say?
#MARCH.
He’ll be cursed if you do any thing of the kind.
#KITTY.
March! you here?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
That howid fisherman!
#MARCH.
Yes, that howid fisherman, you confounded old goggle - eyed sculpin! And as for you, Kitty Sands, I’m ashamed of you. A pretty pair you are! Want to run off, do you?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Come, come, sir! you’re impertinent.
#MARCH.
Oh! I’m impertinent, am I? Wall, I ain’t near - sighted, and I don’t wear eye - glasses, and I can see your nose plainly.
#KITTY.
Why, March! what are you doing?
#MARCH.
I’m just going to open your nose in the most approved style of the manly art!
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Lord, gwacious! I believe the fellah’s going to fight!
#KITTY.
March, if you touch him, I’ll call father just as loud as ever I can.
#MARCH.
Well, you call: you’ll get a pretty talking to, I tell you.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Here, you stop, you fellah! Stop, I say!
#MARCH.
I’ll teach you to skulk round here with your airs!
#KITTY.
Father, father! quick, quick!
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
That’s right: call your father, or I’m a dead man!
#GRAPEAU.

#MARCH.
Yes, I will! Making love to you, darn him!

#MRS. GALE.

#KITTY.
Oh, gracious! there’s mother. What shall we do? She can’t abide peddlers.
#MARCH.
That she can’t. Old gent, you’ll have to tramp.
#GRAPEAU.
Tramp! what for I tramp?
#MARCH.
You’ll get broomed out if you don’t. Here’s a pretty kettle of fish!
#GRAPEAU.
Keetle of fish? I see no keetle of fish.
#MRS. GALE.
What! a peddler in my house! Get out of this, quick! Out of this, I say!
#KITTY.
It’s only a poor old Frenchman.
#MRS. GALE.
But he’s a peddler; and I won’t have a peddler in my house. Start! Where’s my broom?
#GRAPEAU.
What for she get her broom, hey?
#MARCH.
You’ll find out: quick, run for it!
#GRAPEAU.
What for I run for it? Oh, sacre! I see ze old woman wiz ze broom, and I comprend, I comprend!
#MRS. GALE.
Where is he? where is he?
#KITTY.
Hide the old gentleman’s pack, March, quick! Mother will pitch it into the water.
#MRS. GALE.
The idea of a peddler! I’ve had enough on ’em; but they won’t cheat me again in a hurry, I can tell ’em.
#KITTY.
What a blind, silly goose March Gale is! - fighting Bige Parker, and going to fight the Captain, because I encourage their attentions, and can’t see that it’s all to make him speak. So jealous of everybody! If he loves me, why don’t he tell me so?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Ah, ha, my little beauty! you see I have returned.
#KITTY.
Like a dear, charming Captain, as you are.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Where’s that howid fisherman?
#KITTY.
Oh! you needn’t be afraid of him: he’s gone.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Gone, has he? and left the coast clear? What a chawming opportunity!
#KITTY.
Charming opportunity for what?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
To tell you, divine cweecher, how I love you.
#KITTY.
You’ve told me that a hundred times.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Let me tell you a hundred times more. Hold! what’s that?
#KITTY.
Why, your coat, - isn’t it?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Mine? what an howid idea! The idea of my wearing such a coat as that! And such a hat! good gracious! Don’t I look queer!
#KITTY.
Oh, my! what a queer - looking chap you are! You wouldn’t feel much like making love in that suit, - would you, Captain?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Make love to you, my chawmer! Yes, in any dress.
#KITTY.
Oh, capital! It would be so jolly to have a lover on his knees at my feet, dressed as you are!
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
On my knees!
#KITTY.
Yes, on your knees. Don’t I wish March could catch him there! Down on your knees! Quick, or I’ll run off!
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Well, then, here I am. What a howid idea!
#MRS. GALE.
That horrid old peddler here again?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Beautiful nymph of the sparkling sea!
#MRS. GALE.

#CAPT. HAGBERD.

#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Murder! murder!
#MRS. GALE.
Out of my house! You scamp, you villain, you cheat!
#KITTY.
Ha, ha, ha! what a comical figure the Captain does cut! He won’t make love to me again in a hurry.
#GRAPEAU.
Whist, leetle girl! I have come back for my pack and mine hat and mine coat. Sacre! I have run ver much from ze old lady wiz ze broom. Where she be, hey?
#KITTY.
Oh, dear! what shall I say? - the Captain’s run off with them. My brother has put them away somewhere: you must wait till he returns.
#GRAPEAU.
Sacre! I sal get me head break ver much, if I stay here.
#KITTY.
No, mother has just gone out.
#GRAPEAU.
Oh! the old lady have gone out? Parbleu! I feel all ze better, ver much; I feel quite ze comfortable. Ha, you be ver pretty girl!
#KITTY.
Oh, pshaw!
#GRAPEAU.
What for you say ‘pshaw’? You know I speaks ze truth all ze time! You break ze young men’s hearts all to pieces ver much.
#KITTY.
No, I don’t, Mr. Frenchman.
#GRAPEAU.
Ah, ma chere, but you do, you leetle rogue! Did I not see ze young man viz ze red hair? He be ver much in love all over.
#KITTY.
He, - March - in love with me! You are quite mistaken.
#GRAPEAU.
Ah, but he be ver much. I see it in his eyes.
#KITTY.
March love me? No, sir! He’s a selfish -
#GRAPEAU.
Take care, ma chere, - take care! You leetle rogue, you love him, - you know you do!
#KITTY.
I don’t, one bit.
#GRAPEAU.
Ha, you do! Vat for you plague him so if you no love him? Ha! your eyes, - zay tell ze tale.
#KITTY.
I don’t care if I do: he’s a booby! He don’t love me.
#MARCH.
Don’t I, though!
#GRAPEAU.
Vat for you say that, hey?
#KITTY.
Because he never told me.
#MARCH.
Then, by jingo! he tells you so now. Kitty Sands, you’re the idol of my heart. There’s a devouring passion in my bosom that gnaws - Oh, pshaw! I can’t imitate the Captain. But, Kitty Gale, I do truly and sincerely love you.
#KITTY.
Why, March Gale! you’ve been listening. little bit, Kitty, - just enough to find out what a fool I’ve been: but it’s all right now. And you’ll marry me one of these days.
#KITTY.
One of these days? When?
#MARCH.
Well, when I find my father.
#KITTY.
Oh, yes, I’ll marry you then, never fear.
#GRAPEAU.
Ha! zat is good, - zat is very much better.
#KITTY.
Oh, dear, March! here’s mother coming again.
#GRAPEAU.
Ze old lady wiz ze broom? Sacre! I sall get my head broke ver much!
#MARCH.
Old gentleman, you’ll have to make a run of it.
#GRAPEAU.
But I have not ze coat nor ze hat. I will catch ze death of cold in mine head! Sacre! I have him now!
#MARCH.
Where is his hat and coat, Kitty?
#KITTY.
I don’t know, but I suspect mother has them now.
#GRAPEAU.
Ze old lady wiz my coat? Sacre! zat is ver much too bad, - ver much too bad!
#MARCH.
Run and hide him somewhere, - in the wash - room, - anywhere; for here comes Mother Gale.
#KITTY.
Come, old gentleman! I’ll hide you.
#MARCH.
What a confounded ninny I have been! If I had known this before, I might have saved Bige Parker the trouble of giving me the thrashing I intended for him. But ain’t it jolly! I’m so happy I could sing for joy!
#MRS. GALE.
I’ll Kyd you!
#MARCH.
Mother Gale, what are you about?
#MRS. GALE.
About mad. Where’s Kitty? Such a caper! Oh dear, oh dear! I’ve been and chased and chased that confounded peddler way down to the water; and when he gets there, he strips off his coat and hat, and - would you believe it? - it was the Captain!
#MARCH.
Why, Mother Gale! what have you done? what will he say?
#MRS. GALE.
He didn’t stop to say any thing: he jest gave one leap into the water, and swam for his yacht!
#MARCH.
This is bad. What will Daddy Gale say?
#JOHN GALE.
Now, what’s the use of talking about Sept.?
#MR. RAYMOND.
But I tell you I will be obeyed!
#MARCH.
Hallo! here’s a breeze.
#MR. RAYMOND.
It’s all your doing, you rusty old sea - horse! You’ve made the boy disobey his father.
#JOHN GALE.
I tell you, Sept. is his own master; and, if he doesn’t choose to go, why here he stays.
#MR. RAYMOND.
It’s a conspiracy to defraud me of my son, and I won’t stand it!
#MRS. GALE.
What’s the matter?
#JOHN GALE.
Matter? Matter enough! Sept. won’t own his father: that’s what’s the matter!
#MR. RAYMOND.
By your advice! Now, don’t tell me! I know it’s your doing. You envy me the possession of such a son, and you try all you can to keep him here.
#JOHN GALE.
Do I? Well, here’s the boy now to speak for himself. Look here, Sept. Gale, you’re an ungrateful young scamp! Here’s a father boiling over with love, and rich as an alderman, waiting to take you to his arms. He says I’m trying to keep you here.
#SEPT.
Mr. Raymond knows well you have nothing to do with it. I do not acknowledge his claim, because I see no proof.
#KATE.
What’s the matter, father?
#MR. RAYMOND.
Matter? Your brother refuses to acknowledge me as his father, or you as his sister.
#KATE.
Indeed!
#MR. RAYMOND.
Yes, indeed! But I’ll find a way to make him. Hark you, Kate! Capt. Dandelion has again proposed for your hand, to me this time, and I have accepted him: so you can look upon him as your future husband.
#KATE.
Capt. Dandelion! - my husband?
#SEPT.
Her husband! I thought it would come to that.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Yes, your husband! You cannot object to the match: he is rich and highly accomplished.
#KATE.
But I do object. He is rich; but, when I marry, it shall be a man, and not a money - bag.
#MR. RAYMOND.
You refuse to obey me?
#KATE.
In this, yes. You have ever found me an obedient child, ready and eager to obey you: but this is a matter in which the heart commands; and mine bids me obey a higher law, which not even a father has power to set aside.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Well, here’s another! The son refuses to acknowledge his father, the daughter her husband! I tell you, girl, you shall marry this man!
#KATE.
I will not! I love another.
#MR. RAYMOND.
And that other? -
#KATE.
September Gale.
#SEPT.
True, true as steel.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Your brother. Confound it, you’re all crazy! Do you want to drive me mad?
#KATE.
He is not my brother.
#MR. RAYMOND.
But I say he is: every circumstance goes to prove it, - “The Diana,” the wreck, the child found upon the sands. I tell you he must be my son.
#JOHN GALE.
Now, what’s the use of talking about the wreck? Wa’n’t there two on ’em? Couldn’t there have been a baby born on board? Couldn’t your wife have made a mistake in the vessel? I don’t see your proof. She might have sailed in “The Gladiator.”
#GRAPEAU.
“Ze Gladiator?” What for you say “Ze Gladiator”?
#JOHN GALE.
Hallo! who’s this?
#MARCH.
The old Frenchman’s caught.
#MRS. GALE.
That plaguy peddler here! Where’s my broom?
#MARCH.
Hold on, Mother Gale! The old gentleman has done me a service, and I’ll stand by him.
#MR. RAYMOND.
What does he know of “The Gladiator”?
#GRAPEAU.
“Ze Gladiator”? Sacre! I have know “Ze Gladiator” too much, - ver too much. I have sailed from my own France ever so long ago in ze ship call “Ze Gladiator.”
#JOHN GALE.
When was that?
#GRAPEAU.
Oh, sacre! ten, twenty - one, two, three years ago.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Twenty - three years ago?
#GRAPEAU.
Oui, oui! But, sacre? she was vat you call wreck; she all go to ze pieces on ze sands, and I have to make ze passage on ze leetle frail hen - coop.
#MARCH.
Oh, it’s coming, - it’s coming! Say, old man, - Frenchy, - look here! where was this?
#GRAPEAU.
Parbleu! I do not know ze place. I have sail on ze hen - coop far, far away from ze wreck before I picks myself up.
#MARCH.
But - O Lord! somebody hold me! - the passengers? - any babies aboard?
#GRAPEAU.
Babies? passengers? Oui, oui! zere vas ze passengers, - ze lady and ze little baby; but ze poor lady die before ze ship all go to ze pieces.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Died! This lady, - do you know her name?
#GRAPEAU.
Oh, sacre, no! ze membrance fail me ver much. Ze beautiful lady, - she was so pale and so young, mine heart feel ver much for her. Her name - sacre! - oh, it have gone from me. She was ze kind lady, for I vas ver sick. Her name - She was ze light - ze light - Oh, sacre! I have ze name. What ze sun do when he shine, - when he shine? He shoot - he shoot de - de - oh, sacre! my poor old head! - He shoots de -
#KITTY.
Rays?
#GRAPEAU.
Ha, ze little rogue, - ze pooty leetle girl! Zat vas her name, - Ray - Ray - Ray -
#MR. RAYMOND.
Heavens, man, speak! Was it Raymond?
#GRAPEAU.
Oui, oui! Ze Raymond, - ze beautiful Madam Raymond!
#MR. RAYMOND.
Gracious heavens! My wife! But the child, old man? - the child?
#GRAPEAU.
Ze child? ah, ze poor lady, - she have made ze grand mistake: she have engage a passage in ze oder ship vich sail ze same day; but ze stupid driver take her to ze wrong ship, too late for her too make ze change. Ze fatal mistake; for ze unlucky ship met wiz disaster upon disaster, - ze very long passage, and ze wreck at last.
#JOHN GALE.
Long passage! I should think so; six months behind time!
#MR. RAYMOND.
But the child?
#GRAPEAU.
Oui, ze child! Ven ze poor lady die, ze capitan, he take ze leetle boy, and he say, “I do not know zis child or his mozar, but ze child sall be remembered.” So, wiz ze needle and ze ink, he prick upon ze leetle arm of ze leetle boy ze leetle red anchor.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Sept. Gale, speak the truth! Have you such a mark upon your arm?
#SEPT.
No, no, - thank Heaven, no!
#MARCH.
One minute! Just somebody watch me, for I know it’s coming! It’s no use trying to deceive me any longer! I am the child! See the little red anchor!
#ALL.
The anchor!
#MR. RAYMOND.
My boy, my boy!
#SEPT.
Heaven be praised!
#KATE.
My dear, dear brother!
#GRAPEAU.
Ha! ze leetle baby have grown ver much, - ver much. Zis is vat you call jolly.
#MARCH.
Jolly, old Frenchy? That’s so, and I owe it all to you. But where’s Kitty?
#KITTY.
Here, March.
#MARCH.
What are you skulking back there for? You know what you told me to - day.
#KITTY.
But I didn’t think you’d ever find your father; and now you’re rich, and I’m only a poor girl.
#MARCH.
Father, you’ve found a son to - day, and that son has found a wife. You must take both, or neither: which shall it be?
#MRS. GALE.
What! our Kitty!
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, our Kitty.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Well, I don’t know. I must have time to consider.
#MARCH.
No, you mustn’t. Speak quick, or you lose us. I wanted a father bad enough; but thus far I have done without one, and I rather think -
#MR. RAYMOND.
Now, stop! don’t you disobey me. I’ll take you both.
#KATE.
That’s a dear father! I know I shall love Kitty dearly; and March and I have been like brother and sister, - haven’t we, March?
#MARCH.
Ay, that we have, - you and I and Sept. By the by, what’s to become of Sept.? Where’s his father?
#SEPT.
Don’t trouble yourself about me. I’ve got a father here in John Gale.
#MR. RAYMOND.
And here’s another, if you’ll own him. Sept., here’s my daughter, who refused to obey me. I’d give her to you, only, as she has refused to obey me, and -
#KATE.
Dear father, I wouldn’t refuse again for the world.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Then take her, Sept. You deserve her. Well, John Gale, what have you got to say to this?
#JOHN GALE.
Now, what’s the use talking about what I’ve got to say? What will the Captain have to say?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Quite a family party, I declare!
#MR. RAYMOND.
Why, Captain! where have you been?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
I’ve just been aboard my wacht, to change my clothing; that’s all. ’Twas a little chilly.
#MRS. GALE.
Why, Captain! you looked warm enough when I saw you last.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
That howid old woman! - she’s poking fun at me: I know she is.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Well, Captain, I mentioned your proposal to my daughter; but she positively refuses to marry you.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
I’m doosed glad of it; for I’ve found a beautiful cweecher, who suits me better.
#MR. RAYMOND.
Who is that, pray?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Miss Kitty Gale.
#MARCH.
You’re too late, Captain: she’s engaged to me.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
You? - a howid fisherman!
#MR. RAYMOND.
You are mistaken. This young man is my son. It’s all out at last.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Well, it’s doosed plain that I’m out too: so I’ll get up anchor, and off for the city again in my wacht.
#GRAPEAU.
Ze Capitan seems what zay call ver much over ze come.
#JOHN GALE.
Old lady, it strikes me, if we are to have any dinner to - day -
#MRS. GALE.
Land sakes! I forgot all about it. You, March, run - Oh, dear! what shall I do without March?
#JOHN GALE.
Never mind March: we’ve got Sept. left.
#KATE.
But suppose I take him away?
#JOHN GALE.
O Lord! what shall we do without Sept.?
#SEPT.
You shan’t do without him. We began life here in the old shanty; and, whatever fortune may have in store for him, this is his home.
#MR. RAYMOND.
I begin to like this place. We’ll set the men at work, and put up a house on the bluffs, large and roomy.
#JOHN GALE.
That’s right; for this union of the Gales will be likely to end in a squall.
#MR. RAYMOND.
It shall be a family house, with room enough for Sept. and his wife, March and his wife, John Gale and his wife, I and the Captain; and, once a year at least, we’ll all meet there, to talk over old times, and return thanksgiving for the treasures found down by the sea.
