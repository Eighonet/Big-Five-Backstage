#BLANCHE.
Will you buy a flower, monsieur?
#PAUL.
Flower, mademoiselle? You can sell flowers at this hour when it is nearly midnight?
#BLANCHE.
There is moonlight, and I have a smile, monsieur. It is my smile which sells the flowers. Does not monsieur agree that it is irresistible?
#PAUL.
Mademoiselle has charm.
#BLANCHE.
And I have charms for you. My flowers. Will you not buy a flower, monsieur, and I will pin it to your uniform where it will draw all the ladies' eyes to you when you promenade on the boulevard?
#PAUL.
I do not promenade. I stay here.
#BLANCHE.
Here in the Square where it is dull and lonely? But on the boulevards are lights, monsieur, and gaiety, and people promenade because to - night is Christmas Eve.
#PAUL.
Mademoiselle, you're kind. Will you be kind to me and tell me something?
#BLANCHE.
What can I tell?
#PAUL.
I am only a peasant and I do not know many things. But you live in the town and you must know. They say, mademoiselle, they have told me, that there are miracles on Christmas Eve.
#BLANCHE.
Did you believe them?
#PAUL.
I did not know. I only hoped.
#BLANCHE.
What did you hope?
#PAUL.
I have been told that stone can speak on Christmas Eve. And I want, oh, mademoiselle, I want to hear the blessed voice of our glorious Maid.
#BLANCHE.
Monsieur has sentiment.
#PAUL.
You think that she will speak to me?
#BLANCHE.
Monsieur, she speaks in stone to all of us. She stands erect, serene, like the unconquerable spirit of France and cries defiance at the Boche. They sent their shells like hail and ground our homes to powder and made a desolation of our streets, but they could not touch the statue of the Maid nor the church she guards.
#PAUL.
And she speaks! She speaks!
#BLANCHE.
She is the soul of France, monsieur, defying tyranny, invincible and unafraid. She is a message to each one of us. As the shells fell all around and could not harm her, so must we stand unshaken for the France we love. She speaks of freedom and deliverance.
#PAUL.
And she will speak to me?
#BLANCHE.
Perhaps.
#PAUL.
What must I do, mademoiselle, to hear her voice?
#BLANCHE.
Will you not buy a flower for the Maid? They come from far away, from the South where there is always sun, and so they are not cheap. But, for a franc, you may have one lily of Lorraine to put upon the statue of the Maid. lily of Lorraine!
#BLANCHE.
See, monsieur! How could she refuse to speak to you if you gave her that?
#PAUL.
It is the way to make her speak! But a franc! And I have nothing but one sou.
#BLANCHE.
One sou! When flowers are so dear, and have to come so far! Mon dieu, monsieur, but you have had a thirsty day if a sou is all that you have left from the wineshops.
#PAUL.
I did not spend it there, mademoiselle. I gave it to the church, this church where is the statue of our Maid.
#BLANCHE.
Monsieur is devout.
#PAUL.
Not always, mademoiselle. But I was born at Domremy where she was born and I have always adored our sainted Maid who died for France. Perhaps because of that, perhaps without the flower, Jeanne will speak to me at midnight when they say the statues come to life.
#BLANCHE.
Monsieur, I do not know. Perhaps she will. But see, here is a lily of Lorraine which I give you for the Maid. Put it upon her statue and perhaps it will awaken her to speech.
#PAUL.
Mademoiselle! How can I thank you?
#BLANCHE.
I also am a maid of France, monsieur. You are a soldier and you fight for France. But I must sell my flowers now. Perhaps, when I have sold them, I will come again to see if Jeanne has spoken.
#PAUL.
You think she will?
#BLANCHE.
Monsieur, have faith. All things are possible on Christmas Eve.
#BLANCHE.
Holy Virgin, the lies I've told! What simplicity! But Jeanne might. She might.
#GERALD.
O Lord, there's a fellow there. Er - Oh - er - c'est ici la statue de Jeanne d'Arc, n'est - ce pas?
#PAUL.
Mais oui, monsieur.
#GERALD.
And that's about as far as my French will go. I say, you're not on duty, are you? Vous n'êtes pas de garde?
#PAUL.
Non, monsieur.
#GERALD.
No, of course you're not. Damned silly question to ask. All the same, I wish he'd take a hint. I say. Lord, I've forgotten the French for "have a drink." Besides, he couldn't. It's too late. I'll just do what I came for and go. After all, the fellow's as good a right to be here as I have. I'll have one more shot. N'avez - vous pas des affaires?
#PAUL.
Mais non, monsieur. Pas ce soir. Je suis en congé.
#GERALD.
Heaven knows what that means, except that he's a fixture. Oh well, I don't care if he does see me. He'll not know what to make of it, anyhow. Jeanne d'Arc, I'm putting this wreath on your statue. It's an English wreath and it came from England. It's English holly and English ivy and it's supposed to mean that England's sorry for the awful things she did to you and I hope you've forgiven us all. I think that's all. Hang that French fellow. I suppose he'll think I'm mad.
#PAUL.
Monsieur!
#FREDERICK.
Hullo, cockey. How are you getting on?
#PAUL.
Monsieur! This place. These steps. One does not rest upon these steps.
#FREDERICK.
Ho yes, one does. I'm doing it, so I ought to know.
#PAUL.
But here, monsieur. Outside the church.
#FREDERICK.
That's all right. The better the place the better the seat. It ain't a feather - bed in the old house at home, but I've sort of lost the feather - bed 'abit lately.
#PAUL.
One should not sit on these steps, monsieur.
#FREDERICK.
You must like that tune, old son, the way you stick to it. And, if you ask me, one should not do a pile of things that one's been doing over here. Take me, now. By rights, I ought to be eating roast beef and plum - pudding to - morrow in Every Street. Third turn on the left below the Mile End Pavilion, but I suppose I'm the same way as you. Going back on the train at 2 A.M. to eat my Christmas dinner in the blooming trenches. That's you, ain't it? And it's me, too. So let's sit down together and do an entente for an hour. Don't talk and I'll race you to where the dreams come from.
#PAUL.
I ought not to sit here.
#FREDERICK.
Ain't these steps soft enough for you?
#PAUL.
Monsieur, you do not understand. I come from Domremy.
#FREDERICK.
Do you? I'm Mile End myself. What about it?
#PAUL.
But Domremy.
#FREDERICK.
Can't say I'm much the wiser.
#PAUL.
But here, monsieur. This statue. It is our glorious maid. C'est Jeanne d'Arc.
#FREDERICK.
Ark, eh? Is that old Noah?
#PAUL.
Jeanne d'Arc, monsieur. She -
#FREDERICK.
Oh, it's a lady, is it? Dressed like that for riding, I reckon. So that's old Noah's wife, is it? Well, the old cock had a bit of taste.
#PAUL.
It is Jeanne d'Arc. You call her - what do you call her? - Joan of -
#FREDERICK.
Not guilty. I ain't so forward with the ladies. I don't call them in their Christian names till I've been introduced.
#PAUL.
You English call her Joan of Arc. The great Jeanne d'Arc. She -
#FREDERICK.
Wait a bit. Now don't excite me for a moment. I'm thinking. I've heard that name before.
#PAUL.
But yes, monsieur. In history.
#FREDERICK.
That's done it. I take you, cockey. I knew it was a way back. Well, she's nothing in my life.
#PAUL.
She is of my life. I come from Domremy.
#FREDERICK.
So you said.
#PAUL.
It was her birthplace.
#FREDERICK.
Cockey, I'm with you now. I know the feeling. Why, we'd a man born in our street that played center - forward for the Arsenal. Makes you proud of the place where you were born. Na pooed now, poor devil. Got his head blown off last month. He was a sergeant in our lot. 'Ave a woodbine?
#PAUL.
Not here, monsieur.
#FREDERICK.
Please yourself. Smoke your own. Them black things are no use to me. It's a rum country yours, old son. Light beer and black tobacco. But you fight on it all right. Oh yes, you fight all right. 'Ere, 'ave a piece of chocolate to keep the cold out. My missus sent me that.
#PAUL.
Merci. I hope madame is well.
#FREDERICK.
Eh? Who's madame? Oh, you mean old Sally. She's all right. In bed. That's where she is. And I'm here. But I could do with a bit of a snooze myself. Come on, let's do a doss together. doss?
#FREDERICK.
Yus. Wait a bit. I speak French when I'm 'appy. Je vais dormir. Vous likewise dormir.
#PAUL.
I did not come to sleep, monsieur. I came to watch.
#FREDERICK.
Watch? What do you want to watch for here? No Germans here.
#PAUL.
C'est la nuit de Noël, monsieur. They say the statues come to life on Christmas Eve, and I am watching here to see if Jeanne will breathe and move and speak to a piou - piou from Domremy.
#FREDERICK.
You know, old son, you could have scared me once with a tale like that. But not to - day. I've been seeing life lately. If old Nelson got down off his perch, and I met him walking in Trafalgar Square, I'd just salute and think no more about it. You can't raise my hair now.
#PAUL.
Then you believe that she will speak?
#FREDERICK.
You go to sleep, cockey, and there's no knowing what you'll hear. Come on, old sport. Je dormir and vous dormir, and we'll be a blooming dormitory. That's right. Lie close. Two can keep warmer than one. Oh well, good - night all. Merry Christmas, and to hell with the Kaiser.
#JEANNE.
The wreath is here. I did not dream it, then. I saw him come and lay the wreath at my feet. I saw his uniform, and the uniform was not of France. I saw his face, and it was not a Frenchman's face. I heard his voice, and the voice was an English voice. I do not understand. Why should the English bring a wreath to me? I do not want their wreath. I want no favors from an Englishman. I am Jeanne d'Arc. I am your enemy, you English, whom I made to bite the dust at Orléans and vanquished at Patay. It was I who bore the standard into the cathedral at Rheims when we crowned my Dauphin the anointed King of France, and English Bedford trembled at my name. Burgundians took me at Compiègne. Your English money bought me from them, and your English hatred gave me up to mocking priests to try for sorcery. You called me "Heretic," "Relapsed," "Apostate," and "Idolater," and burnt me for a witch in Rouen market - place. And now do you lay a wreath at Jeanne's feet? And do you think she thanks you? I scorn your wreath. This wreath an English soldier set at Jeanne's feet. I tear it, and I trample on it.
#FREDERICK.
I dunno if I'm awake or asleep, but that there wreath, lady - I say, don't tear it. I don't know nothing about it bar what you've just said, but if any of our blokes put it there, you can take it from me it was kindly meant.
#JEANNE.
You? Who are you? You're - You're English.
#FREDERICK.
Yus. I'm English. I don't see that I can help it, though. I just happen to be English same as a dawg. I'm sorry if it upsets you, but I'm English all right. And - No. Blimey, I won't apologize for it. I'm English. I'm English, and proud of it. So there!
#JEANNE.
Why are the English here in France? Why do I see so many of them?
#PAUL.
Maid - Jeanne -
#JEANNE.
You! You are not English. You are a soldier of France.
#PAUL.
I am of France.
#JEANNE.
Then shame to you, soldier of France! Shame on a Frenchman who can forget his pride of race and make a comrade of an Englishman!
#PAUL.
Maid, you do not understand.
#JEANNE.
No. I do not understand. I do not understand treachery. I do not understand baseness, dishonor, and the perfidy of one who has forgotten he is French. The English are the foes of France, and you consort with them. You -
#FREDERICK.
'Ere, 'ere, 'alf a mo'. Steady on, lady. You've got to learn something. All that stuff you've just been talking about the Battle of Waterloo. It's a wash - out now. We've cut it out. This 'ere bloke you're grousing at 'e's a friend of mine, and I'll pipe up for a friend when 'e's being reprimanded undeserving.
#JEANNE.
It is for that I blame a son of France, that he makes friends with you.
#FREDERICK.
Well, it's your mistake. That's the worst of coming out of history. You're out of date. If I took my great - grandmother on a motor - bus to a picture - show, she'd have the same sort of fit that you've got, only it's worse with you. You're further back. And I'll tell you something. That old French froggy business is dead and gorn. We've given it up. Time's passed when an Englishman thought he could lick two Frenchmen with one hand tied behind his back. It's a back number, lady. Carpentier put the lid on that. You ask Billy Wells. Us blokes and the French, we're feeding out of one another's hands to - day.
#JEANNE.
I have seen the English and the French together in the streets. They do not fight.
#FREDERICK.
Lord bless you, no. Provost - marshal wouldn't let 'em, if they wanted a friendly scrap.
#JEANNE.
They fraternize. I have seen them walking arm - in - arm.
#FREDERICK.
That's natural enough.
#JEANNE.
Natural, for French and English!
#FREDERICK.
Yes, lady, natural. If you'd seen the Frenchies fighting, same as I have, you'd want to walk arm - in - arm with them yourself, and be proud to do it, too.
#PAUL.
The English, are our brothers, Maid.
#FREDERICK.
Gorlummy, we're more than that. I've known brothers do the dirty on each other. Us and the French, we're - why, we're pals. So that's all right, lady. Just let me put that wreath back where you got it from. I'm sure you'll 'urt someone's feelings if you trample on it.
#JEANNE.
When you have shown me why I should accept an English wreath, perhaps I will. So far I've yet to learn why a soldier of France is friendly with an Englishman.
#FREDERICK.
I can't show you more than this, can I?
#JEANNE.
That is not reason.
#PAUL.
Perhaps I can show you reason. I who was born at Domremy.
#JEANNE.
You come from there! My home?
#PAUL.
Yes.
#JEANNE.
You know St. Remy's church and the Meuse and the beech - tree where they said the fairies used to dance. The tree. Is it still there?
#PAUL.
I do not know.
#JEANNE.
And the fields! The fields where I kept my father's sheep, and the wolves would not come near when I had charge of them, and the birds came to me and ate bread from my lap. You know those fields of Domremy?
#PAUL.
I knew them once.
#JEANNE.
You knew my church. It still is there?
#PAUL.
Who can say?
#JEANNE.
Cannot you, who were baptized in it?
#PAUL.
Jeanne, the Germans came to Domremy. I do not know if anything is left.
#JEANNE.
The Germans? But the Germans did not count when I lived there.
#FREDERICK.
No, and they'll count a sight less before so long.
#PAUL.
They came like a thunderstorm, Jeanne. They swept our men away. They tore up treaties, and they came through Belgium and ravished it, and took us unawares. They blotted out our frontiers and came on like the tide till even Paris heard the sound of German guns. And then the English came, slowly at first, and just a little late, but not too late, then more and more and all the time more English came. They swept the Germans from the seas and drove their ships to hide. Shoulder to shoulder they have fought for France. They hurled the Germans back from Paris, and when their soldiers fell more came and more. Their plowmen and their clerks, their great lords and their scullions, all came to France to fight with us for la patrie. Their women make munitions and -
#FREDERICK.
Yus. I daresay. Very fine. Only that'll do. We ain't done nothing to make a song about.
#PAUL.
Our children and our children's children will make songs of what the English did.
#FREDERICK.
You let 'em. Leave it to 'em. Way I look at it is this, lady. There's a big swelled - headed bully, and he gets a little fellow down and starts kicking 'im. Well, it ain't manners, and we blokes comes along to teach 'im wot's wot. That's all there is to it.
#PAUL.
There's more than I could tell in a hundred years, Jeanne.
#FREDERICK.
Then what's the good of trying?
#JEANNE.
He tried because he had to make me understand your friendship and all the noble thought and noble deed that lie behind this little wreath.
#FREDERICK.
Oh, I say now, lady, go easy with that wreath, won't you? I - I wouldn't trample it if I were you. Battle of Waterloo's a long time ago.
#JEANNE.
Don't be afraid.
#FREDERICK.
Gave me a turn to see you pick it up like that.
#JEANNE.
The English wreath is in its right place now. Here, on the head of Jeanne d'Arc. I'll wear that wreath forever. Give me your hand, you English soldier.
#FREDERICK.
I've not washed since morning, lady.
#JEANNE.
Your hand, that fights for France. And yours, soldier of France.
#PAUL.
Jeanne! But you -
#JEANNE.
I am where I would always be - amongst my fighting men. They have set me on a pedestal and made a saint of me, but I am better here, between you two, both soldiers of France. They will not let me fight for France to - day. Save for this mystic hour on Christmas Eve I am a thing of stone. But Jeanne lives on. Her spirit fights for France to - day as Jeanne fought five hundred years ago. And, in this hour when I am granted speech, I say, "Fight on, fight on for France till France and Belgium are free and the invader pays the price of treachery. And you, you English who have come to France, and you in England who are making arms for France, I, who have hated you, I, whom you burnt, I, Jeanne d'Arc of Rheims and Orléans, I give you thanks. My people are your people, and my cause your cause. Vivent! Vivent les Anglais!"
#PAUL.
Jeanne!
#BLANCHE.
My name is Blanche, monsieur.
#PAUL.
But I - you - Mademoiselle, you are very like -
#BLANCHE.
I am the flower - girl whom you saw before you went to sleep, and I am very like myself, monsieur.
#PAUL.
Was I asleep? Yes. There is Jeanne.
#BLANCHE.
Where else should Jeanne be but on her pedestal?
#FREDERICK.
Revelley again before you've hardly closed your blooming eyes. Hullo! You're - you're - Why, cockey, it wasn't a yarn. The statues do walk about in France. There's one of them doing it.
#PAUL.
You saw her too?
#FREDERICK.
Saw her? Of course I seen her. She's there. Ain't you and me been talking familiar with her for the last ten minutes?
#PAUL.
Yes, with Jeanne.
#FREDERICK.
Took my 'and she did, and chanced the dirt.
#BLANCHE.
You have been dreaming, monsieur. C'était une rêverie.
#FREDERICK.
Who's raving? Well, it may be raving, but we all raved together. You and me and 'im, and I'll eat my bayonet raw if you didn't stand there and take us by the hands and tell us you were that there Joan of Arc what used to tell old Bonaparte what to do when he was in an 'ole.
#BLANCHE.
It was not I. There is the statue, monsieur.
#FREDERICK.
Where? Well, that's queer. You're the dead spit and image of 'er, too. And 'ere, 'ere, cockey!
#PAUL.
Monsieur?
#FREDERICK.
Look at the statue. Look at its head. Who put that wreath on it? Did you climb up there?
#PAUL.
No.
#FREDERICK.
No. You know you didn't. We saw her put it on herself.
#PAUL.
But, monsieur, then you have dreamed the same dream as I.
#FREDERICK.
I saw you all right, and you saw me?
#PAUL.
I saw you.
#FREDERICK.
And we both saw 'er. It's a rum go, cockey, but I told you I'd given up being surprised. Our lot and yours we're going whacks in licking the Germans, ain't we? Yus, and now we're going whacks in the same dream, so that's that and chance it. Ententing again, only extra cordial. I don't quite see where she comes in, though, if she ain't the statue.
#BLANCHE.
I am a flower - girl, monsieur.
#FREDERICK.
Not so many flowers about you, then.
#BLANCHE.
I have sold out, all but one flower, monsieur, and I came back to see if you had got your wish.
#PAUL.
Yes, mademoiselle, I had my wish. The saints sent Jeanne to me in a dream.
#BLANCHE.
You happy man, to get your wish!
#PAUL.
I am happy, mademoiselle. I have spoken with Jeanne d'Arc.
#FREDERICK.
And you and me will be speaking with our sergeants if we don't buck up and catch that blinking train. Come on, old son, back to the Big Stink for us.
#BLANCHE.
Messieurs return to fight?
#FREDERICK.
Lord love you, no. It's only a rumor about the war. We're a Cook's excursion on a joy - ride seeing the sights of France.
#BLANCHE.
Monsieur!
#FREDERICK.
Well?
#BLANCHE.
I kept one flower back. It is for you - for the brave English soldier who goes out to fight for France.
#FREDERICK.
Don't make me homesick. Reminds me of the flower - pots on my kitchen window - sill. 'Ere, miss, 'ave a bit of chocolate. Made in England, that was.
#BLANCHE.
Monsieur will need it for himself.
#FREDERICK.
Go on. Take it. I'm all right. It's Christmas Day and extra rations.
#BLANCHE.
Merci, monsieur. Et bonne chance, mes braves, bonne chance.
#FREDERICK.
Oh, we'll chance it all right. Merry Christmas, old dear. Noël! Noël! thy babe that lies Within the manger, Mother - Maid, Is King of earth and Paradise, O guard him well, Noël, Noël Ye shepherds sing, be not afraid. O little hills of France, awake, For angel hosts are chanting high, His heart is piercèd for our sake, Noël, Noël, we guard him well, He liveth though all else shall die.
