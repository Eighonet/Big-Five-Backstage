#EDMUND.
I like it, Leo.
#LEO.
Really, uncle? I asked you to be candid.
#EDMUND.
Yes. I do like It. It's immature, but it's the real thing. There's stuff in you, my boy.
#LEO.
You're the first Whitworth who's ever praised my work. The usual thing's to laugh at me for trying to be a poet. prophet in his own country, eh? Perhaps they don't know very much about poetry, Leo.
#LEO.
Is that any reason for laughing at me? I don't know anything about hockey, but I don't laugh at Flo and Elsie for playing. As I tell them, mutual tolerance is the only basis for family life. If I were a large - limbed athlete they'd bow down and worship, but as I've got a sense of beauty and no brawn they simply bully the life out of me.
#EDMUND.
You're sure you do tolerate them?
#LEO.
Of course I do. I'd rather have a sister who's a football maniac any day than a sister who's a politician. There's some beauty in catching balls, but there's no beauty in catching votes. What I complain of is that there's no seriousness in this house about the things that matter.
#EDMUND.
Such as - poetry?
#LEO.
Oh, now you're getting at me. All right. I'm used to it. Being serious about poetry's better than being serious about football, anyhow.
#EDMUND.
Sonnets have their place in the scheme of things. high place, too.
#EDMUND.
I agree with you in putting them above football.
#LEO.
Then you'll find yourself unpopular here,
#EDMUND.
At the same time, it's possible to overdo the sonnets, Leo.
#LEO.
Never. Art demands all.
#EDMUND.
My dear boy, if you're going to talk about art and temperament, and all the other catchwords -
#LEO.
I'm not. I'm only asking you to tell them you believe in my genius and then they'll drop thinking I'm making an ass of myself.
#EDMUND.
I see. By the way, what are you making of yourself, Leo? poet, I hope.
#EDMUND.
I meant for a living.
#LEO.
I have a weak lung.
#EDMUND.
Is that your occupation?
#LEO.
It is my tragedy.
#EDMUND.
Um.
#LEO.
You will speak to them for me, uncle? They'll listen to you. At least you come from London, where people are civilized.
#EDMUND.
Are they? In London I hold a brief for the culture of the provinces.
#LEO.
You took jolly good care to get away from the provinces, yourself. And you mustn't tell me you think Blackton is cultured.
#EDMUND.
I heard my first Max Reger sonata in Blackton long before London had found him.
#LEO.
Music's another matter.
#EDMUND.
Yes. Your father played it to me.
#LEO.
Well, there you are again. Music and football are the only things he cares about. That's just what I complain of. I've tried to raise his tastes, but I find generally a lack of seriousness in men of his age. Of course' there are exceptions.
#EDMUND.
Thank you.
#FLORENCE.
May I hide in here?
#LEO.
What's there to hide from?
#FLORENCE.
Eleanor Smith is tackling Elsie in the hall to play hockey for the High School Old Girls this afternoon. When she finds Elsie won't, she'll want to try me, so I'll keep out of the way, please.
#EDMUND.
And why won't Elsie?
#FLORENCE.
We never do when the Rovers are playing at home. I wouldn't miss seeing the match this afternoon for the best game of hockey I ever had. Topping round on the links, uncle. You ought to have come.
#EDMUND.
I'm a sedentary animal, Flo.
#FLORENCE.
Yes. And you're putting on weight. It's six years since you were here, and I'll bet you've gone up a stone a year.
#EDMUND.
In my profession a portly figure is an asset. If you have a lean and hungry look, clients think it's because you sit up late running up bills of costs. If you look comfortable, they imagine you're too busy dining to think of the six and eightpences.
#FLORENCE.
Yes. I never met a slacker yet who wasn't full of excellent excuses. Leo calls his poetry. You call yours business. Wait till you'll retire. You'll find it out then if you haven't a decent hobby.
#EDMUND.
But I have.
#FLORENCE.
It's invisible to the naked eye. You don't golf, and you don't play tennis or cricket or -
#EDMUND.
I collect postage stamps.
#FLORENCE.
No wonder you're in bad condition with a secret vice like that.
#LEO.
Don't do that.
#FLORENCE.
It's blazing hot. I can't imagine what you want a fire for.
#LEO.
Uncle felt chilly.
#FLORENCE.
Sorry I spoke. No, I'm not. It serves him right for taking no exercise.
#ELSIE.
Flo, Eleanor Smith wants you.
#FLORENCE.
I know she does. That's why I'm hiding in here.
#ELSIE.
They're a man short on the team, and -
#FLORENCE.
Didn't you tell her I can't play to - day? Elsie. She thinks she can persuade you.
#FLORENCE.
She can't.
#ELSIE.
You'd better go and tell her so.
#FLORENCE.
Blow Eleanor Smith! She thinks hockey's everything. I hate fanatics. Elsie. She's waiting for you.
#FLORENCE.
All right. I'll go.
#ELSIE.
Heard the news, Leo?
#LEO.
Not particularly.
#ELSIE.
Jack Metherell's coming in to see father before the match. Father told me.
#LEO.
Oh? My pulse remains normal.
#ELSIE.
You've no more blood in you than a cauliflower. I'm tingling all over at the thought of being under the same roof with Metherell.
#EDMUND.
May I enquire who Mr. Metherell is?
#ELSIE.
Do you mean to say you've never heard of Metherell?
#EDMUND.
I apologise for being a Londoner.
#ELSIE.
That's no excuse. They can raise a decent crowd at Chelsea nowadays.
#EDMUND.
Indeed? I live at Sevenoaks.
#ELSIE.
You must have heard of Metherell.
#EDMUND.
No. Who is he?
#LEO.
Metherell is a professional footballer, uncle.
#EDMUND.
Oh!
#ELSIE.
A professional footballer! He's the finest centre forward in England.
#EDMUND.
Really? Quite a great man.
#LEO.
Quite. He's the idol of my sisters and the Black - ton roughs. For two hours every Saturday and Bank Holiday through eight months of the year forty thousand pairs of eyes are glued on Metherell and the newspapers of Saturday night, Sunday and Monday chronicle his exploits in about two columns; but if you don't know what "agitating the spheroid towards the sticks" means, you'd better not try to read them. He is also good looking and a decent fellow.
#ELSIE.
You'd better add that.
#LEO.
I will add more. He spends the rest of his time training for those two hours, and when he's thirty he'll retire and keep a pub; and in three years eighteen stone of solid flesh will bury the glory that was Metherell.
#ELSIE.
You viperous little skunk.
#LEO.
I appeal to you, uncle. Can a skunk possess the attributes of a viper?
#ELSIE.
If you say another word against Jack Metherell, I'll knock you into the middle of next week. You're frightened of the sight of a football yourself and you dare to libel a man who -
#LEO.
The greater the truth the greater the libel. You're a solicitor, uncle. Isn't that so?
#EDMUND.
Do you want my professional opinion?
#LEO.
I want your personal protection.
#ELSIE.
Uncle, Jack Metherell's the truest sportsman who ever stepped on to a football field. He's the straightest shooter and the trickiest dribbler in the game. I'd walk barefooted over thorns to watch him play, and for Leo to say he'll retire at thirty and grow fat is nothing but a spiteful idiotic lie.
#EDMUND.
Well, suppose we say he'll retire at thirty - five and just put on a little flesh and live to a ripe old age, fighting his battles over again.
#LEO.
Over a gallon of beer in the saloon bar.
#ELSIE.
If your head wasn't too full of poetry for anything important, you'd know Jack's a teetotaller. He's never entered a public house and he never will.
#EDMUND.
If I were you, Leo, I wouldn't quarrel. I should make a poem about it.
#ELSIE.
It's all he's fit for. Lampooning a great man. I tell you, uncle, Jack Metherell can do what he likes in Blackton. If he cared to put up for Parliament, no other man would make a show.
#LEO.
Oh, the fellow's popular. They all love Jack.
#ELSIE.
Popular. There isn't a woman in the town but would sell her soul to marry him.
#EDMUND.
This seems to be the old Pagan worship of the body.
#LEO.
The mob must have a hero. Prize - fighting's illegal and cricket's slow, so it's the footballer's turn to - day to be an idol.
#ELSIE.
Look here, you can judge for yourself this afternoon.
#LEO.
Are you coming to the match, uncle?
#EDMUND.
Yes. I'm curious to see it. I suppose you're not going?
#LEO.
Oh, I shall go.
#EDMUND.
Really? I had gathered that you don't like football.
#LEO.
I don't like funerals or weddings either, but they're all the sort of family function one goes to as a duty. duty. Will you believe me, he never misses a match, uncle?
#LEO.
If you want to know, I go for professional reasons.
#EDMUND.
Professional?
#LEO.
I am training myself to be a close observer of my fellow men, and in a football crowd I can study human passions in the raw. To the earnest student of psychology the interest is enormous.
#ELSIE.
Yes. You wait for his psychological shout when Blackton score a goal. You'll know then if his lungs are weak. We go because we like it and so does he, only we're not ashamed of our tastes and he is. Wait till Jack Metherel comes on the field this afternoon in the old red and gold of the Blackton Rovers and -
#AUSTIN.
But Metherell won't.
#ELSIE.
What. Has Jack hurt himself at practice? Austin. No.
#LEO.
What's up with him?
#AUSTIN.
Nothing.
#ELSIE.
Then why isn't he playing?
#AUSTIN.
He is playing.
#ELSIE.
You just said -
#AUSTIN.
He won't wear the Blackton colours. He's playing for Birchester. He's transferred.
#ELSIE.
You've transferred Jack Metherell! Father, you're joking.
#AUSTIN.
No.
#ELSIE.
I'll never forgive you. He's the only man on the team who's Blackton born and bred. The rest are all foreigners.
#FLORENCE.
Who've you got to put in his place? There isn't another centre forward amongst them.
#AUSTIN.
There's Angus.
#FLORENCE.
Angus! He can't sprint for toffee, and his shooting's the limit.
#AUSTIN.
Well, you've to make the best you can of Angus. Metherell belongs to Birchester now.
#ELSIE.
I don't know what you're thinking about, father. Are you mad? What did you do it for?
#AUSTIN.
Money, my dear, which the Club needs badly.
#ELSIE.
It'll need it worse if we lose to - day and drop to the second division.
#AUSTIN.
We must not lose to - day.
#FLORENCE.
You're asking for it. Transferring Metherell. The rest are a pack of rotters.
#AUSTIN.
They've got to fight for their lives to - day. Birchester offered a record fee on condition I fixed at once. I was there last night with Metherell and he signed on for them.
#FLORENCE.
It's a howling shame.
#LEO.
And over Blackton Rovers was written Ichabod, their glory is departed.
#ELSIE.
Father, do you mind if I go? I might say some of the things I'm thinking if I stayed.
#FLORENCE.
I'll come too. I wish to goodness I was playing hockey. It won't be fun to see Jack Metherell play against us.
#AUSTIN.
It wasn't for fun that I transferred him.
#ELSIE.
No. Worse. For money. You've told us that and - oh, I'd better go.
#AUSTIN.
Go with them, Leo.
#LEO.
Shall I?
#AUSTIN.
Please. Well, Edmund?
#EDMUND.
Well, Austin?
#AUSTIN.
Now you can judge exactly how pressing my necessities are. You've heard it all.
#EDMUND.
Really? You've only talked football.
#AUSTIN.
Football is all. I'm sorry I got in last night too late to have a chat with you, but what I was doing yesterday is public property this morning.
#EDMUND.
You mean about the man Metherell?
#AUSTIN.
Yes.
#EDMUND.
I understand some other club has bought him from you. Are footballers for sale?
#AUSTIN.
Er - in a sense.
#EDMUND.
And why have you sold him if he's a valuable man?
#AUSTIN.
He's invaluable. If ever there was a one - man team, that team is ours. I've seen the others stand around and watch Metherell win matches by himself. But to - day money is more essential than the man.
#EDMUND.
I'm still puzzled. Is football a business then?
#AUSTIN.
Of course. That's the worst of burying yourself in London. You never know anything. Football clubs to - day are limited companies.
#EDMUND.
I fancy I had heard that.
#AUSTIN.
Well, broadly speaking, and not so broadly either, I am the limited company that runs Blackton Rovers. You never cared for sport. I was always keen. In the old amateur days, I played for Blackton while you went country walks and studied law. Football's always meant a lot to me. It means life or death to - day.
#EDMUND.
That's a strong way of talking about a game, Austin.
#AUSTIN.
Life or death, Edmund. Blackton's been my passion. It's not a town that's full of rich men, and the others buttoned up their pockets. Employers of labour too, who know as well as I do that football is an antidote to strikes, besides keeping the men in better condition by giving them somewhere to go instead of pubs. I've poured money out like water, but the spring's run dry and other Clubs are richer. They can buy better players. They bought them from me.
#EDMUND.
Have the men no choice?
#AUSTIN.
Up to a point. But footballers aren't sentimentalists and rats desert a sinking ship. The one man who stuck to me was Metherell. He's a Blackton lad, and he liked to play for his native town. To - day, he's gone. I made him go for the money I needed. The Club's been losing matches. We were knocked out of the Cup Tie in the first round. Lose to - day and Blackton Rovers go down to the second division. My Club in the second division!
#EDMUND.
Does that matter so much - apart from sentimental reasons?
#AUSTIN.
It matters this much. That there'll never be another dividend. The gate money for the second division game's no use to me.
#EDMUND.
But surely, if your public's got the football habit they'll go on coming.
#AUSTIN.
Not to a second division team. They'll drink a pint or two less during the week and travel on Saturdays to the nearest first division match.
#EDMUND.
So much for their loyalty.
#AUSTIN.
They don't want loyalty. They want first class football, and if I can't give it them, they'll go where they can get it. As it is, the Club's on the brink of bankruptcy, and I'm the Club.
#EDMUND.
Then your men had better win to - day.
#AUSTIN.
They must.
#EDMUND.
And if - supposing they don't?
#AUSTIN.
That's why I brought you here. To look into things. I can't face ruin myself.
#EDMUND.
Ruin? It's as bad as that?
#AUSTIN.
Oh, I daresay you're thinking me a fool.
#EDMUND.
I think your sense of proportion went astray.
#AUSTIN.
All my money's in it. I don't care for myself. I had value for it all the day four years ago when Blackton won the Cup at the Crystal Palace, but it's been a steady decline ever since. What troubles me is, it's so rough on the children.
#EDMUND.
Have you told them?
#AUSTIN.
What's the use? Leo's got no head for business and the girls are - girls.
#EDMUND.
Yes. Tell me, what are you doing with Leo?
#AUSTIN.
Doing? Well, Leo's is a decorative personality, and he has a lung, poor lad. Leo's not made for wear.
#EDMUND.
Rubbish! If he's made you feel that, he's a clever scamp, with a taste for laziness and a gift for deception.
#AUSTIN.
Well, I do feel about Leo like a barndoor fowl that has hatched out a peacock.
#EDMUND.
Peacock! Yes, for vanity. A little work would do the feathers no harm.
#AUSTIN.
I can't be hard on a boy with his trouble.
#EDMUND.
I foresee a full week - end, Austin. And I thought I was coming down for a quiet time in the bosom of my family.
#AUSTIN.
Yes, we've been great family men, Edmund, you and I.
#EDMUND.
Well, we won't go into that again.
#AUSTIN.
Yes, we will. We quarrelled over Debussy. Come into the music - room and I'll play the thing over to you now. If you don't admit it's great, I'll -
#EDMUND.
We've other matters to discuss, Austin. This isn't the time for music.
#AUSTIN.
Yes, it is. Music makes me forget. Some men take to drink. I go to the piano.
#ELSIE.
Father, do you want any lunch?
#AUSTIN.
By Jove, yes. Time's getting on. I'll play that Debussy thing afterwards, Edmund. Coming, girls?
#ELSIE.
No, thank you, father. Neither Flo nor I feel we can sit down to table with you just yet. We've had ours.
#AUSTIN.
You've been quick about it. Where's Leo?
#FLORENCE.
Stuffing himself with cold beef. Men have no feelings.
#EDMUND.
Surely Leo must have a feeling of hunger.
#ELSIE.
It's indecent to be hungry after hearing of father's treachery to Blackton.
#AUSTIN.
Treachery!
#FLORENCE.
Some of my tears fell in the salad bowl, and I hope they'll poison you.
#EDMUND.
Be careful what you're saying, Florence. Is that the way to talk to your father?
#FLORENCE.
No. That's nothing to the way I ought to talk to him.
#EDMUND.
Well, I know if I'd addressed my father like that -
#FLORENCE.
It's a long time since you had a father to address, Uncle
#EDMUND.
We bring our fathers up differently to - day.
#EDMUND.
If you only knew what your father -
#AUSTIN.
It doesn't matter, Edmund. Come to lunch.
#FLORENCE.
Yes, it doesn't matter if the Rovers are defeated, but there's beef and beer in the next room and the heavens would fall if food were neglected.
#ELSIE.
Oh, I don't care if they are beaten. The Rovers don't interest me without Metherell.
#FLORENCE.
I don't believe they ever did. You're no true sportswoman,
#ELSIE.
You always thought more about the man than the game. You might be in love with Metherell.
#ELSIE.
Yes, I might.
#FLORENCE.
Perhaps you are.
#ELSIE.
Is there a woman in Blackton who doesn't admire him?
#FLORENCE.
Oh, I admire him. But that's not loving.
#ELSIE.
No. That isn't loving.
#FLORENCE.
You sound jolly serious about it.
#ELSIE.
Do you realize that now he's transferred he'll have to live in Birchester - two hundred miles away?
#FLORENCE.
Yes, I suppose so.
#ELSIE.
What are our chances of seeing him?
#FLORENCE.
Once a year or so when Birchester play here, instead of about every alternate Saturday.
#ELSIE.
I've been seeing him oftener than that.
#FLORENCE.
Do you mean you've been meeting him?
#ELSIE.
Flo, I do love him and I don't care who knows it, and now he'll have to leave Blackton, and I -
#FLORENCE.
Steady, old girl. I'm a bit out of my depth myself, but I'll do my best for you with father.
#ELSIE.
Father wouldn't stop me.
#FLORENCE.
He might try. Jack isn't quite our class, in a general way of speaking, is he?
#ELSIE.
Class! What is our class? We're nobodies.
#FLORENCE.
Still, as things go in Blackton we're rather upper crust, wouldn't you say?
#ELSIE.
Grandfather began life as a mechanic's labourer.
#FLORENCE.
Did he? I've never worried about our pedigree, but you wouldn't think it to look at him.
#ELSIE.
Oh, he made money. One of the good old grinding, saving sort. But he began a good deal lower down than Jack. Jack's father was an undertaker.
#FLORENCE.
An undertaker!
#ELSIE.
Well, I suppose undertakers can have children like other people.
#FLORENCE.
Oh, I've no objections
#ELSIE.
I've no objections either.
#FLORENCE.
I daresay not - to the father. He's dead. But the mother isn't.
#ELSIE.
What's the matter with his mother?
#FLORENCE.
Haven't you seen her?
#ELSIE.
Jack's shirked introducing me, if you want to know.
#FLORENCE.
Well, I have seen her, and -
#ELSIE.
Well?
#FLORENCE.
She's a hard nut to crack.
#ELSIE.
I'll crack her if she needs it. If I want to marry a man, I marry him. I don't mind telling parents about it, but I don't ask their permission. That sort of thing went out about the time motor cars came in.
#FLORENCE.
Then why haven't you told father before this?
#ELSIE.
Because Jack's old - fashioned and thinks he ought to speak to father first. He's got a perfectly ridiculous respect for father.
#FLORENCE.
Father's his employer. We don't think much of father, but I expect there are people who regard him as quite a big man.
#ELSIE.
That needn't have made Jack a coward. As father's ceased to employ him perhaps he'll get his out - of - date interview over now.
#FLORENCE.
What's the matter?
#ELSIE.
I'm sure I heard a ring.
#FLORENCE.
You've got sharp ears. Do you mean to tell me that in this room you can hear a bell in the kitchen?
#ELSIE.
It might be Jack.
#FLORENCE.
Don't you know whether it is?
#ELSIE.
I can't see any one.
#FLORENCE.
But I thought people in your case didn't need to see. Don't you feel his unseen presence in your bones like you feel a thunderstorm?
#METHERELL.
Jack is dark and handsome with traces of coarseness, tall and of strong appearance, clean - shaven, dressed rather cheaply hut not vulgarly. A modest fellow, unspoiled by popular acclaim and simple - minded though successful. He remains near the door, not seeing the girls. Florence restrains Elsie.)
#BARNES.
I will let Mr. Whitworth know you are here. Jack. Thank you.
#BARNES.
Mr. Metherell, I was thinking of having a little money on the team this afternoon. Can I take it from you that it's safe?
#JACK.
It depends which team you put it on.
#BARNES.
Why, the Rovers, of course.
#JACK.
Do you want to win your bet?
#BARNES.
I do that.
#JACK.
Then put it on Birchester.
#BARNES.
Really, Mr. Metherell?
#JACK.
Really.
#BARNES.
I will inform Mr. Whitworth that you are here.
#FLORENCE.
Good - morning, Mr. Metherell.
#JACK.
Good morning, Miss Florence. Florence. Are you much of a reader?
#JACK.
I'm striving to improve my mind.
#FLORENCE.
Good gracious, you've got hold of Plato.
#JACK.
Yes. I have read him in the Everyman Edition, but I see this is a different translation by a Mr. Jowett.
#FLORENCE.
How learned you must be.
#JACK.
Not I, more's the pity. We've two members in the Mutual Improvement League at our Sunday School who can read Plato in the original. I wish I could.
#FLORENCE.
Do you? I'll put it back You'll have no use for Plato in a minute.
#JACK.
Why not, Miss Florence?
#JACK.
It's Elsie.
#ELSIE.
Yes. It's Elsie. Aren't you going to kiss me, Jack?
#JACK.
In your father's house?
#ELSIE.
It's as good as any other place.
#JACK.
No, it isn't. Not till I have asked his leave.
#ELSIE.
You've kissed me in the fields.
#JACK.
I know. I've compromised with my conscience.
#ELSIE.
Jack, if the rest of you was as antiquated as your conscience, you'd be a doddering octogenarian instead of the liveliest player in the LEAGUE. Have you come now to ask father's leave?
#JACK.
I've come because he told me to last night. I might ask his leave though, now. But I think I ought to ask my mother first.
#ELSIE.
They'd better both be told at once. If you're going to Birchester, I'm coming with you.
#JACK.
You've heard that then?
#ELSIE.
Yes. Did you hear what I said?
#JACK.
About coming with me?
#ELSIE.
Yes.
#JACK.
I'm willing if they are.
#ELSIE.
Who are "they"?
#JACK.
Your father, and my mother. Suppose the banns go up next Sunday, we could get married in a month and make one bite of the wedding and the testimonial do they'll want to give me.
#ELSIE.
I couldn't be ready in a month, Jack.
#JACK.
Well, I'm ready any time. Oh, now Elsie, that's a foul. You know -
#ELSIE.
You didn't kiss me. I kissed you. I do what I like in this house.
#JACK.
It's a big house, lass. You'll find less breathing space in my seven - and - six a week house in a row, with my mother in it, and all.
#ELSIE.
I've thought it all out, Jack. It won't be a house in a row. There are moors round Birchester, and we're going to live outside the town in a dinky little cottage where the air will always keep you at the top of your form, and I shall have a garden to look after and be handy for the links. I'm going to teach you golf. I shall drop hockey when I'm married. Married life demands sacrifices.
#JACK.
Yes. You're going to sacrifice a lot.
#ELSIE.
You're not going to begin all that over again, are you? Do you want to marry me?
#JACK.
Like nothing on earth.
#ELSIE.
Then I get you and nothing that I lose counts against that gain.
#JACK.
You've a fine sweet way of putting things. I just go funny - like all over and the words won't come. But I love you, lass, I love you. I'll be a good husband to you.
#ELSIE.
It's heaven to hear you say you love me. I want no sweeter words to come than those, I don't deserve it, Jack. Who am I? Elsie Whitworth. NOTHING. And you're the grandest, strongest player of your time.
#JACK.
You think too much of football, Elsie.
#ELSIE.
That's impossible.
#JACK.
You do. Football's as good a way as another of earning a week's wages, but that's all it is.
#ELSIE.
It's the thing you do supremely well.
#JACK.
Yes. Now and for a few more years maybe, but I'll be an old man for football soon.
#ELSIE.
That's why I mean to teach you golf. Don't I tell you I have thought about it, Jack? You're going to be as brilliant at golf as now you are at football. I'll never lose my pride in you, your huge, hard muscles and your clean fit body.
#JACK.
It's a great thing to be strong and master of your strength.
#ELSIE.
Your splendid strength! Your swiftness and your grace.
#JACK.
But it's a greater to be clever, and I'd give up all my strength if I could write a poem like the one your brother wrote in the Blackton Evening Times.
#ELSIE.
Leo! That weakling.
#JACK.
He may be, but he's got a brain.
#ELSIE.
You're twenty times the cleverer.
#JACK.
Then I'm good for something better than football. I'm up in football now as high as I can get. I used to dream of being called the finest player in the League. They've called me that these last two seasons and my dream's grown bigger. I'm honoured for my play. I'd like to gain some honour now for work.
#ELSIE.
You've just told me football is work.
#JACK.
I mean brain work. A footballer's a labouring man. And I want you,
#ELSIE.
I look to you to lead me to the higher path.
#ELSIE.
You think I can!
#JACK.
I know you can. You've got a fancy now for football, but it's not your real self. You're a cultured woman.
#ELSIE.
Culture doesn't count.
#JACK.
You've gone beyond the things that puzzle me. You're at the other side. Why, Elsie, there are things in Browning that I can't make out, and Walter Pater has me beat to atoms.
#ELSIE.
Those aren't the real things, Jack.
#JACK.
They're real enough to be the things that made me want you. I could pick and choose from lots of women fit to talk of football to me, but I'm tired of football. You're the only woman who can talk to me of other things - and you won't.
#ELSIE.
You're tired of football!
#JACK.
Not of the game. Sick of the eternal jaw about it.
#ELSIE.
Well, I'm sick of books.
#JACK.
You can't be that. Books last.
#ELSIE.
Your fame will last. Books aren't the real thing.
#JACK.
Then what is real?
#ELSIE.
Blood. Flesh and blood. I'd burn every book in this room for the glory of another rush like yours when you scored your second goal last Saturday. It may have lasted thirty seconds, but it was worth a wilderness of books.
#JACK.
It was worth just half a column in the Athletic News.
#ELSIE.
It's worth my love for you. It's not your brain I'm wanting,
#JACK.
It's you. You're splendid as you are. Don't try to hide behind a dreary cloud of culture. It's better fun to be alive all over than to crawl through life with a half - dead body and a half - baked mind.
#JACK.
Life's not all fun.
#ELSIE.
It isn't, but it ought to be, and for you and me it's going to be, and if you don't stop looking serious, I'll upset you by kissing you again.
#JACK.
Don't do that, Elsie. It isn't right yet.
#ELSIE.
Jack, you've a bilious conscience. It's the only part of you that isn't gloriously fit.
#JACK.
Give me till I've seen your father and then perhaps you'll tire of being kissed a long while sooner than I tire of kissing you. Elsie It's so stupid to ask father about a thing like that. It's not his lips you're going to kiss. It's mine.
#JACK.
I've to satisfy my conscience, Elsie.
#ELSIE.
The poor thing needs a lot of nourishment. Don't stint it.
#AUSTIN.
Good morning, Metherell. Elsie, we've to talk business.
#ELSIE.
Mayn't I stay? Men are so funny when they're serious.
#AUSTIN.
You would find no entertainment this time.
#ELSIE.
That's all you know about it.
#AUSTIN.
Sit down, Metherell. Oh, this is my brother, Mr. Edmund Whitworth.
#EDMUND.
I'm pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Metherell.
#AUSTIN.
Very busy that train we came home by last night, Metherell.
#JACK.
Yes, very full.
#AUSTIN.
I couldn't get a chance of talking to you. Now, it's about this match to - day.
#JACK.
Yes?
#AUSTIN.
You know how tremendously important it is for Blackton.
#JACK.
Blackton 'ull be a second division team next season.
#AUSTIN.
I hope not, Metherell.
#JACK.
With me playing against them?
#AUSTIN.
I still hope not. Blackton must not lose today.
#JACK.
I don't see how they can help it.
#EDMUND.
You've a good opinion of yourself, I notice, Mr. Metherell.
#JACK.
Blackton Rovers without me aren't a team at all. They're certain to be beaten.
#AUSTIN.
You say that as if you don't mind if they are.
#JACK.
I belong to Birchester now, Mr. Whitworth.
#AUSTIN.
Come, Metherell, you've belonged to Birchester for half a day. You belonged to Blackton for five years. This match can make no difference to Birchester. They're half way up the list. It's critical for Blackton. You've played all these years for Blackton and you've thought Blackton all your life. You can't change your allegiance all in a moment. You can't pretend you'd like to see Blackton go down.
#JACK.
Oh, I've a fondness for Blackton. I don't deny it.
#AUSTIN.
Metherell, Blackton must win to - day.
#JACK.
They might have done if you hadn't transferred me.
#AUSTIN.
My hand was forced.
#JACK.
So you told me.
#AUSTIN.
At heart you're still a Blackton man, Metherell.
#JACK.
Maybe. But at Football I've signed on to play with Birchester. I may be just as sorry as yourself to see Blackton go down to - day, but as centre forward of Birchester United it's my bounden duty to do my best to send the Rovers down.
#AUSTIN.
Look here, Metherell, you see the hole I'm in. What am I to do?
#JACK.
I've no suggestions.
#AUSTIN.
What about the referee?
#JACK.
Eh?
#AUSTIN.
Anything to be done there?
#JACK.
I don't understand.
#AUSTIN.
Could I square him?
#JACK.
Not unless you want to see him lynched.
#AUSTIN.
Then you're the only hope.
#JACK.
It's a poor hope if you're looking for anything of that from me.
#AUSTIN.
I'm asking you to be loyal to Blackton for another day.
#JACK.
Were you loyal when you transferred me?
#AUSTIN.
Yes: loyal to Blackton's very existence. Don't play your best this afternoon. That's all I ask.
#JACK.
I always play my best.
#EDMUND.
Are you never out of form, Mr. Metherell?
#JACK.
I play at the top of whatever form I'm in.
#EDMUND.
Couldn't you make it convenient to be in particularly bad form to - day? After your long journey to and from Birchester yesterday, a tired feeling's only natural.
#JACK.
I'm feeling very fit. Do you know you're asking me to sell a match?
#AUSTIN.
Yes.
#JACK.
I couldn't square it with my conscience. I really couldn't, Mr. WHITWORTH. I know it means a lot to you, but I'm not that sort, and you ought to know it.
#AUSTIN.
Your conscience might be - salved.
#JACK.
Salved?
#EDMUND.
Yes. Just let us know how much you consider will cover all moral and intellectual damages, will you?
#JACK.
I'm glad it wasn't you who spoke that word.
#AUSTIN.
I endorse it, Metherell. I told you last night how I stood. The loss of to - day's match may involve my ruin.
#JACK.
As bad as that? I'm sorry.
#AUSTIN.
Man, can't you see I'm not romancing? Do you think I'd come to you with this if I wasn't desperate?
#JACK.
It's a pretty desperate thing to do. Suppose I blabbed?
#AUSTIN.
Yes. There's that. It ought to show you just how desperate I am. You know, and no one better, how this Club's been run. You know there's blackguardism in the game, but Blackton hasn't stooped. Whatever other clubs have done, Blackton has stood for sport, the straight, the honest game. The Blackton Club's my life's work, Metherell. I might have done a nobler thing, but there it is. I chose the Club. I gave it life and kept it living, and the time's come now when I can't keep it living any more. Twice top of the League and once winners of the Cup. It's had a great past, Metherell, an honourable past. It's earned the right to live, and now it's in your hands to kill the Blackton Club and end the thing I've fostered till it's seemed I only lived for that one thing. It isn't much to ask. A little compromise to save the Club you've played for all these years, to save the club and me.
#JACK.
I cannot do it, Mr. Whitworth.
#EDMUND.
Now you referred to your conscience, Mr. Metherell. My experience is that when a man does that he's open to negotiation.
#JACK.
Money won't buy my conscience, sir.
#EDMUND.
Well, are you open to barter?
#JACK.
No. The thing I want from you is no more to be bought than my conscience is.
#AUSTIN.
You do want something from me, then?
#JACK.
I want to marry Elsie.
#EDMUND.
My God!
#AUSTIN.
Does she know?
#JACK.
Does she know? She says we're to be married and that's all about it, but I'm old - fashioned and I want your leave.
#EDMUND.
My niece and a professional footballer!
#AUSTIN.
Steady, Edmund. Now, Metherell, just let us see where we stand. You propose to help Birchester to beat Blackton.
#JACK.
I'll do my best.
#AUSTIN.
And you think I'll let you ruin me first and marry my daughter afterwards?
#JACK.
I won't buy Elsie from you at the price of my professional honour.
#AUSTIN.
Professional fiddlesticks! The thing's done every day.
#JACK.
Not by a Blackton lad. I've learnt the game you taught me, Mr. Whitworth, the straight, clean Blackton game. I'll not forget my school even at the bidding of the head. I'm not anxious to be suspended for dishonest play.
#AUSTIN.
Only incompetents get suspended. You needn't fear. You're skilful.
#JACK.
Not at roguery.
#EDMUND.
You're talking straight, Mr. Metherell.
#JACK.
Yes. It's you that's talking crooked.
#ELSIE.
May I come in now?
#AUSTIN.
No. We're busy.
#ELSIE.
Thank you. You don't get rid of me twice with that dear old business bogey. I expect Jack's made an awful mess of it. Has he told you about us, father?
#AUSTIN.
No. Yes. Go away. We're talking seriously.
#ELSIE.
Yes. You all look very foolish. Is it settled, Jack?
#JACK.
No.
#ELSIE.
What's the trouble? Is father being ridiculous?
#EDMUND.
Upon my word, Elsie -
#ELSIE.
Oh, that's all right, uncle Ed. It does father no end of good to be talked to like that. Jack, I find I can be ready in a month after all, so that's all right.
#EDMUND.
Ready for what, girl?
#ELSIE.
My wedding, uncle. You'd better start thinking about your present.
#AUSTIN.
But -
#ELSIE.
Hasn't Jack told you we're to be married?
#AUSTIN.
He's told me he wants to marry you, but -
#ELSIE.
Then what is there to argue about? Men do love making a fuss about nothing and fancying themselves important. Come along, Jack. You're going to take me down to the ground.
#EDMUND.
Well, I'm -
#ELSIE.
Oh, dear no, Uncle. You're not.
#AUSTIN.
Well, Martin.
#MARTIN.
Good afternoon, Mr. Whitworth.
#AUSTIN.
What do you estimate the gate at? Five hundred pounds?
#MARTIN.
The returns are not in yet, but hardly that much.
#AUSTIN.
I should call it a twenty thousand crowd by the looks of it.
#MARTIN.
Not far short. But there's been a little accident, sir.
#AUSTIN.
Accident?
#MARTIN.
Oh, it's happened before. They rushed the turnstiles on the shilling side.
#AUSTIN.
I say, Martin, that's too bad. Just when we need every penny we can screw.
#MARTIN.
About three thousand got in free before the police could master the rush.
#AUSTIN.
That Chief Constable's an incompetent ass. He never sends us enough men.
#MARTIN.
Fewer than usual to - day. There's a socialist demonstration on the recreation ground, and that's taken away a lot of police.
#AUSTIN.
Idiot! Does he think Blackton people will go to a political meeting when there's a football match?
#MARTIN.
As you say, sir, he's a fool.
#AUSTIN.
No use claiming for the loss either. Pass me the cheque - book, Martin. Those people with the mortgage on the stands threaten to foreclose unless we pay on Monday. I'd a letter this morning.
#MARTIN.
Can we meet it, sir?
#AUSTIN.
Yes. Metherell's transfer fee is in the Bank.
#MARTIN.
That brightens our sky.
#AUSTIN.
Think so, Martin?
#MARTIN.
I never thought we should live through the season. And here we are at the end of it still alive and kicking.
#AUSTIN.
They'd better kick to some purpose to - day, Martin, or -
#MARTIN.
It'll be all right, sir.
#AUSTIN.
You're a sanguine fellow. Suppose we lose. Second Division. No dividends. No dividends, no Club. No Club, no Secretary, Martin.
#MARTIN.
Don't talk about it, sir. It's not losing my job. That doesn't matter. But the thought of Blackton going down is more than I can bear.
#AUSTIN.
Yes. It's ugly. You're a good fellow, Martin.
#MARTIN.
Don't mention it, sir. I love the game.
#AUSTIN.
The game! Yes. Always the game.
#MARTIN.
I often wish this side didn't exist, though it is my bread and butter.... That's the whistle. They're playing.
#AUSTIN.
Yes. Didn't you know? They'd begun before I came in here.
#MARTIN.
Oh, sir!
#AUSTIN.
Don't let me keep you from your place.
#MARTIN.
Aren't you coming?
#AUSTIN.
No. I shan't see much of this match, Martin.
#MARTIN.
When so much depends upon it!
#AUSTIN.
Yes. That's why.
#MARTIN.
But you forget things when you watch the game.
#AUSTIN.
Go and forget them, Martin.
#FLORENCE.
Father, aren't you coming? You've missed it all. We've scored a goal in the first five minutes.
#AUSTIN.
Scored already! Thank God.
#FLORENCE.
The most glorious goal you ever saw. Black - ton are playing up like little heroes. It's the match of the season. Angus is in terrific form. I take back what I said about him. Metherell himself couldn't do better. He had the Birchester goalee beat to smithereens. I tell you it's tremendous.
#AUSTIN.
How's Metherell playing?
#FLORENCE.
Against us.
#AUSTIN.
Yes. But how?
#FLORENCE.
How does he generally play?
#AUSTIN.
Like that? He's in form?
#FLORENCE.
It's worth a guinea a minute to watch him. And you're missing it.
#AUSTIN.
I'll go on missing it, Flo.
#FLORENCE.
Well, I won't.
#AUSTIN.
Metherell! Oh, it's you, Doctor. You startled me.
#WELLS.
I beg your pardon, Mr. Whitworth.
#AUSTIN.
My fault for day - dreaming. Ready for contingencies in your torture chamber?
#WELLS.
All clear. You look rather like a contingency yourself.
#AUSTIN.
I'm - I'm nervous.
#WELLS.
It's a trying occasion. Don't you keep a bottle of whisky in that desk?
#AUSTIN.
Don't you know I do?
#WELLS.
I have some recollection of it. Take my strictly unprofessional advice and have a good strong nip.
#AUSTIN.
Have one yourself?
#WELLS.
No, thanks. I'm going to look out for accidents.
#AUSTIN.
Ghoul!
#WELLS.
Every man to his trade.
#EDMUND.
Hullo! That's bad, Austin.
#AUSTIN.
Doctor's orders, Edmund. Will you?
#EDMUND.
No, thanks.
#AUSTIN.
How's the game?
#EDMUND.
Rowdy. You're not watching it?
#AUSTIN.
No. I'm praying for it.
#EDMUND.
So far the gods have heard your prayer.
#AUSTIN.
Metherell hasn't. I hear he's playing his best game against us.
#EDMUND.
I'm no judge.
#AUSTIN.
Are you tired of it already?
#EDMUND.
I find it just a trifle wearing. Perhaps I'm tod old to appreciate a new sensation. The excitement's too concentrated. And the noise! I'm deafened.
#AUSTIN.
It's quiet enough in here. Those windows are double.
#EDMUND.
They need to be. Austin, about Elsie.
#AUSTIN.
Yes?
#EDMUND.
And this footballer. You'll have to put your foot down.
#AUSTIN.
I don't flatter myself I shall have much to say in the matter.
#EDMUND.
Hang it, you're her father.
#AUSTIN.
You heard what she said.
#EDMUND.
To my blank astonishment, I did.
#AUSTIN.
Oh, I'm used to it.
#EDMUND.
Pull yourself together, Austin. You've drifted till your authority's flouted by your own children.
#AUSTIN.
You know, Edmund, that sort of talk was all right in our day, but my children belong to the new generation, and the new generation regards parental authority as a played - out superstition.
#EDMUND.
Nonsense. Be supine and they'll tread on you. You've only your own slackness to blame for it if you're flouted.
#AUSTIN.
That, again, is the view of our time. We're old codgers to - day, Edmund, you and I.
#EDMUND.
Confound it, Austin, you're not going to take this lying down!
#AUSTIN.
No. I shall fight the fight of my generation against the next. I shall lose, of course.
#EDMUND.
You mustn't lose.
#AUSTIN.
Why should I be an exception to a natural law?
#EDMUND.
Natural law! Natural laziness, you mean. You've simply let your children get out of hand through sheer weakness, and if you don't care to exert yourself to save Elsie from a gross mésalliance, I will.
#AUSTIN.
Why's it a mésalliance?
#EDMUND.
Good heavens, man - a footballer!
#AUSTIN.
There spoke the acclimatized Londoner. Black - ton won't be scandalized like Sevenoaks.
#EDMUND.
Oh, hang your smug imitation democracy! You don't believe that, Austin.
#AUSTIN.
I always believe in the inevitable.
#EDMUND.
It's not inevitable, It's incredible. Now, I'll tell you what I'll do, Austin. I'll take Elsie back with me to London and cure her of this infatuation with a jolly good round of the theatres and the shops.
#AUSTIN.
My dear fellow! The theatres where she'll see nothing but romantic love stories and the shops where she'll go under your nose to buy her trousseau. Try it, Edmund. You'll be astonished at the result.
#EDMUND.
It seems my métier to be astonished to - day. First I assist at an attempted bribery, and now it seems I'm to see my niece marry the incorruptible footballer.
#AUSTIN.
You're a bachelor. The modern child surprises you. As a father, I have ceased to be surprised.
#EDMUND.
As a father your idea of your duty is to stand idle while your daughter makes a sentimental mess of her life. I begin to thank my stars I'm a bachelor. At least I'm not henpecked by a rebellious family.
#AUSTIN.
There's no rebellion about it, Edmund. I date from the sixties, they from the nineties, and we rub along quite peacefully in mutual toleration of the different attitudes.
#EDMUND.
Tolerating the difference means that you give in to them every time.
#AUSTIN.
Not quite.
#EDMUND.
Then you won't give in to Elsie?
#AUSTIN.
I shall be loyal to my generation, Edmund. She will be loyal to hers, - and youth will fight for her.
#EDMUND.
That means you'll put up a protest for form's sake and give in gracefully when you think you've said enough to save your face.
#AUSTIN.
No. Not if I can help it.
#EDMUND.
Austin, you must help it. The thing's unthinkable. I'll help you to help it.
#AUSTIN.
I shall be glad of any assistance you can give me.
#EDMUND.
You think I can't give much.
#AUSTIN.
Hullo! The game's stopped. I hadn't heard the whistle go.
#EDMUND.
I fancy I did a minute ago, without knowing its significance. What does it mean?
#AUSTIN.
Probably an accident. Heaven help us if it's one of our men!
#ELSIE.
Father, Jack's broken his arm. Wells. Nothing very serious, Mr. Whitworth. I think it's only a simple fracture.
#ELSIE.
Only!
#WELLS.
Come along in here, Metherell. I'll have it set before you know where you are.
#AUSTIN.
Metherell.
#JACK.
Accidents will happen, Mr. Whitworth.
#ELSIE.
Doctors are callous beasts.
#AUSTIN.
Accident!
#EDMUND.
Why not? Don't they happen?
#AUSTIN.
After my proposition?
#EDMUND.
He scorned it.
#AUSTIN.
Second thoughts. I asked for bad play, but he's thinking of his reputation and he's broken his arm.
#EDMUND.
Deliberately?
#AUSTIN.
Yes.
#EDMUND.
Heroic measures, Austin.
#AUSTIN.
It's the last match of the season. He's all the summer months to get right in.
#ELSIE.
That doctor's turned me out.
#AUSTIN.
Of course. You've no right in there.
#ELSIE.
I've every right to be where Jack is suffering.
#AUSTIN.
He can suffer very well without your assistance.
#ELSIE.
You needn't be brutal about it, father.
#AUSTIN.
I'm not being brutal. The man's a professional footballer. He accepts the risk of a broken limb as a part of his occupation. Metherell's not a wounded hero.
#EDMUND.
No. He's simply a workman who'll doubtless receive proper compensation from his employers.
#ELSIE.
And from me.
#AUSTIN.
You!
#ELSIE.
This will hurry on our marriage, father. Jack needs attention now.
#AUSTIN.
Hasn't he got a mother?
#ELSIE.
No mother could love him as I do. No one can nurse him as tenderly as I shall.
#AUSTIN.
Nurse! A broken arm doesn't make an invalid of any one, especially a man in first - class physical condition.
#ELSIE.
I think it's very cruel of you to belittle Jack's injuries.
#EDMUND.
I wish you would stop calling him Jack.
#ELSIE.
It's his name. He wasn't christened John.
#EDMUND.
I refer to the impropriety of a young lady calling a workman by his Christian name.
#ELSIE.
As the young lady is going to be married to the workman in the shortest possible time, I fail to see where the impropriety comes in.
#EDMUND.
That is where we differ, my dear.
#ELSIE.
About impropriety?
#EDMUND.
No. About marriage.
#ELSIE.
Would you rather I lived with him without being married?
#AUSTIN.
Elsie!
#ELSIE.
Oh, it's all right, father. Uncle deserves a good shock. He's hopelessly suburban.
#EDMUND.
Elsie, I am older than you and -
#ELSIE.
Yes. That's your misfortune.
#EDMUND.
Will you allow me to speak without interrupting?
#ELSIE.
Yes, if you'll speak sensibly and won't put on side because your mind's grown old and pompous as well as your body.
#AUSTIN.
Elsie, I won't have this rudeness to your uncle.
#ELSIE.
My dear father, uncle is being stupid. The only way to combat stupidity is rudeness. Therefore, I am rude.
#EDMUND.
I propose to speak sensibly according to my lights.
#ELSIE.
Ancient lights.
#EDMUND.
Now, suppose we do permit you to marry this -
#ELSIE.
Be careful, uncle. Talking of permission is on the border line.
#EDMUND.
Suppose you marry him, what interests can you have in common? I grant you he's a handsome specimen of manhood to - day, but retired athletes always run to seed.
#AUSTIN.
Hem!
#EDMUND.
And apart from the attraction of the flesh, what's left?
#ELSIE.
Oh, you are talking sense this time. It's difficult, but I shall manage him.
#EDMUND.
Shall you?
#ELSIE.
Oh yes. I couldn't do it if he were as old as you, because at your age a man's in a groove and sticks in it till he dies. Jack's not a modern, but he's young enough to learn. It's hardly credible, but at present he believes in Ruskin and Carlyle and reads BROWNING. Well, you know, I can't have a husband with a taste for Victorianism.
#AUSTIN.
Then why have him at all?
#ELSIE.
It's a curable disease.
#EDMUND.
He reads Browning!
#ELSIE.
Yes, but you needn't worry about that. I shall make a modern of him all right.
#EDMUND.
Do you mean to tell me a footballer reads Browning?
#ELSIE.
He can't always be at football. Oh yes. And Plato, only not in the original.
#EDMUND.
Why, the man's a scholar.
#ELSIE.
Did you think he was illiterate?
#EDMUND.
I'm afraid I have underrated him. Still, that only proves him an estimable member of his class. It doesn't alter the fact that his class isn't yours.
#ELSIE.
Class! What do I care for class? Elemental passions sweep away class distinctions.
#EDMUND.
That's a high falutin' name for a flirtation with a footballer.
#ELSIE.
It's a name I thought you'd understand. Personally I'd say I've got the sex clutch on and other things don't matter. Any more shots, uncle?
#EDMUND.
You needn't flatter yourself you've talked me into consenting to this marriage.
#ELSIE.
Nobody asked you, sir, she said.
#EDMUND.
Nobody -
#ELSIE.
Wouldn't it interest you to see how the game's going, uncle?
#EDMUND.
I think it would. But don't you think you've heard the last of me.
#ELSIE.
No, but you want time to think out a few more objections.
#EDMUND.
I am going purely out of desire to witness the match.
#ELSIE.
Poor dear. He tried his best.
#AUSTIN.
And I am going to try now.
#ELSIE.
Oh, I don't mind you. He tried like an outraged relation. You'll try like a pal.
#AUSTIN.
No. I'm going to be firm.
#ELSIE.
What a bore.
#AUSTIN.
You didn't expect me to be pleased about this, did you?
#ELSIE.
Why not, if I'm pleased? Jack isn't marrying you.
#AUSTIN.
Nor you, if I can help it.
#ELSIE.
But you can't help it, you know.
#AUSTIN.
Oh, I'm quite aware the stern parent isn't my game. But as pals, Elsie -
#ELSIE.
Yes, father, as pals.
#AUSTIN.
As goose to goose, it's not the thing. Now, frankly, is Jack Metherell up to our weight?
#ELSIE.
He's above it.
#AUSTIN.
Above it?
#ELSIE.
Certainly. The condescension's his. He's a better footballer than ever you were, and you were no fool at football.
#AUSTIN.
Football isn't everything, Elsie!
#ELSIE.
Well, you play a decent hand at Bridge, but that's not much. Your golf's rotten. What else do you do well?
#AUSTIN.
Really, Elsie!
#ELSIE.
Don't say "really." Tell me.
#AUSTIN.
I hope I'm fairly good at being a gentleman.
#ELSIE.
Doing, I said, not being.
#AUSTIN.
I - er - play the piano, you know.
#ELSIE.
Yes, but you're not a musician within the meaning of the Act. You play the piano like a third - rate professional, too good for a public - house and not good enough for the concert platform, whereas Jack's football makes him a certainty for the England team in any international match. You may have more money than he has -
#AUSTIN.
I'm not even sure of that.
#ELSIE.
Then you've absolutely nothing on your side except a stupid and obsolete class prejudice.
#AUSTIN.
Upon my word, Elsie -
#ELSIE.
Yes, I know I'm crushing, dear.
#AUSTIN.
You're pitiless. Youth always is.
#ELSIE.
Not always, father, but you shouldn't try to argue about love.
#AUSTIN.
I was arguing about marriage.
#ELSIE.
I suppose at your age it's natural to be cynical about marriage and pretend it's nothing to do with love. And then of course when you were young it used to be the fashion to mock at marriage. We take our duties to society seriously to - day.
#AUSTIN.
Are you proposing to marry Jack from a sense of duty?
#ELSIE.
You'll be awfully proud of your grandchildren, father. They'll be most beautiful babies.
#AUSTIN.
You look ahead, young woman.
#ELSIE.
It's just as well I do. You're still worrying about a thing I settled weeks ago.
#AUSTIN.
Then why didn't you tell me weeks ago?
#ELSIE.
I hadn't told Jack then.
#WELLS.
You'd better go straight home now. Never mind about the match. I want you to avoid excitement for a awhile.
#JACK.
The match doesn't excite me.
#WELLS.
Then you can leave it without regret.
#JACK.
In these?
#WELLS.
I'll go round to the dressing - room and bring your clothes here if you'll trust me not to pick your pockets.
#JACK.
There's nothing to pick. I've more sense than to take money into a dressing - tent.
#AUSTIN.
Can't you trust the others, Metherell?
#JACK.
Yes, so long as they're not tempted.
#WELLS.
I won't be long.
#ELSIE.
Did he hurt you much, Jack?
#JACK.
Not to speak of.
#ELSIE.
Oh, you're brave. But you shall come to no more harm. I'll see you home safely.
#AUSTIN.
You'll find cotton wool in there.
#ELSIE.
What for?
#AUSTIN.
To wrap him up in.
#ELSIE.
Don't be spiteful, father.
#AUSTIN.
Good heavens, girl, a broken arm is nothing.
#ELSIE.
Except that the arm happens to be Jack's.
#AUSTIN.
The civilized world will gasp at the great event.
#ELSIE.
The athletic world certainly will. It's all very well for you to joke. Your arm's not hurt. It's all a gain to you. If Blackton don't win with only ten men against them, they deserve shooting. This accident means a lot.
#AUSTIN.
I know what it means - better than you do.
#JACK.
What's that?
#AUSTIN.
As you tactfully remarked, Metherell, accidents will happen.
#JACK.
Don't you believe it was an accident?
#ELSIE.
What else could it be? Do you think he broke his arm for fun?
#JACK.
It was an accident.
#AUSTIN.
No, my lad. It was a bargain.
#JACK.
I made no bargain.
#AUSTIN.
But you broke your arm.
#JACK.
By accident. singularly opportune coincidence.
#ELSIE.
Father, what do you mean?
#AUSTIN.
You'd better ask Metherell that.
#ELSIE.
Jack!
#JACK.
I'll say nothing.
#ELSIE.
Then what am I to think?
#JACK.
Think what you like.
#ELSIE.
I think you're a sportsman, Jack, and -
#AUSTIN.
I've known a sportsman do a bigger thing than break his arm for a woman.
#ELSIE.
A woman! What woman?
#AUSTIN.
You, my dear. And, as you said, Blackton are safe to win now.
#WELLS.
I'm not so sure of that, Mr. Whitworth. It's anybody's game. The score's one all.
#AUSTIN.
Birchester have scored!
#WELLS.
Yes. Didn't you know? I'll look after Metherell. You're missing a good game.
#ELSIE.
Then you'd better go and watch it, Dr. Wells.
#WELLS.
I will when I've helped Metherell to change.
#JACK.
I'm in no hurry. Don't put yourself about for me. Half time 'ull do.
#WELLS.
Well, it can't be far off that now. I should like to see something of this match. Is the arm painful?
#JACK.
It's sharpish.
#WELLS.
Pull yourself together with a dose of this.
#JACK.
No, thanks. I'm a teetotaller.
#WELLS.
And I'm a doctor, man.
#JACK.
That doesn't help my principles.
#WELLS.
Oh, all right. If you like to be stubborn. Are you coming, Mr. Whitworth?
#ELSIE.
Yes. Do go, father. They'll be expecting to see you outside.
#AUSTIN.
Yes - I'm going - to show them I can smile. Come along, Doctor.
#ELSIE.
Now, Jack. What's this all about?
#JACK.
Your father's making a mistake.
#ELSIE.
About what?
#JACK.
It's a confidential matter, Elsie.
#ELSIE.
That means there's something you're afraid to tell me.
#JACK.
I'm not afraid. He spoke to me in private, and it's giving him away.
#ELSIE.
You can't give him away to me. I've lived at home too long for that.
#JACK.
I can't abuse his confidence.
#ELSIE.
Are you going to talk about your conscience again? Father said you broke your arm for my sake and I want to know what it means.
#JACK.
But I didn't, Elsie. It was an accident.
#ELSIE.
He thought not.
#JACK.
Yes. He's wrong.
#ELSIE.
Why should he think you did it intentionally? Jack Ask him.
#ELSIE.
He's just told me to ask you. Now stop being absurd, Jack, and tell me all about it.
#JACK.
I told him we wanted to be married - - and he offered to strike a bargain. He wants Blackton to win, so I was to play a rotten game for Birchester.
#ELSIE.
And you couldn't do it.
#JACK.
No.
#ELSIE.
No. You couldn't play badly if you tried, and so you broke your arm instead, for me. Jack, if I was proud of you before, I could worship you now. Your arm, your poor, hurt arm, mangled for me. My hero, my lover and my king.
#JACK.
You think that too!
#ELSIE.
Think it! I know it. Don't pretend. It's too late now for modesty.
#JACK.
Modesty! Don't you see if I'd done that, forgotten my sportsmanship and sold a match for my private gain, I'd deserve to be kicked round the county?
#ELSIE.
No. I don't see it. You've hurt yourself for my sake, and that's enough to make of me the proudest woman in the land.
#JACK.
It's enough to prove me dishonest if it were true. Elsie Isn't that true?
#JACK.
Don't I tell you that's an accident?
#ELSIE.
You've never had an accident before.
#JACK.
Not a serious one.
#ELSIE.
No. You're too great a master of the game. Accidents happen to the careless and incompetent.
#JACK.
Then I must be both. I fell and my arm twisted under me.
#ELSIE.
And you really didn't do it on purpose?
#JACK.
Elsie, don't you believe me?
#ELSIE.
It's so beastly to have to. I thought you were a perfect player, and you have an accident; and I thought you were a perfect lover, and you've been afraid to prove your love.
#JACK.
Elsie, there are twenty thousand folk about this ground to - day and some of them have come to see the match, but more to see me play an honest game. They're just a football crowd, but there isn't a man upon this ground to - day but knows Jack Metherell is straight. It's left for you to say I ought to be a crook. You're great at golf and hockey. Is that the way you play the game?
#ELSIE.
Forgive me, Jack. I did want things to be right for us.
#JACK.
At any price?
#ELSIE.
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking of the game. I only thought of you.
#JACK.
I know. But I want things to be right and rightly right.
#ELSIE.
And now they are.
#JACK.
Your father -
#ELSIE.
We've only to let him go on thinking you did it on purpose.
#JACK.
But I didn't.
#ELSIE.
I know. I know it was pure accident. But he doesn't.
#JACK.
He must be told.
#ELSIE.
I thought you wanted his consent to our marriage
#JACK.
I do.
#ELSIE.
Then let him think you've kept the bargain he proposed.
#JACK.
Let him think I'm dishonest?
#ELSIE.
What was he? What does it matter what he thinks if I know the truth?
#JACK.
He's got to know the truth. If he'd have me as a scoundrel for your husband, he should be glad to have me as an honest man. My arm's broke either way.
#ELSIE.
I don't care tuppence for his consent.
#JACK.
It's not the square thing to get married without.
#ELSIE.
Oh, leave him to me.
#JACK.
You bustle him so. It's not respectful, Elsie.
#ELSIE.
Well, you needn't take him under your wing as well. It's not the custom in this family to split hairs about filial piety. I'll make it all right, Jack.
#JACK.
It's my job, Elsie.
#ELSIE.
It's our job, and you've had your innings. Now it's mine. But I'm going to take you home first to your mother.
#JACK.
But my mother doesn't know about you, yet.
#ELSIE.
It's time I made her acquaintance.
#JACK.
I don't know what she'll say.
#ELSIE.
We'll find out when she says it. You think a great deal of your mother, Jack.
#JACK.
My father's dead. She's both to me. That's why I'm anxious.
#ELSIE.
Anxious! But your mother wouldn't stop us, Jack.
#JACK.
You will be careful with her, Elsie.
#ELSIE.
Careful?
#JACK.
Yes. Not like you go on with your father. She's used to my way.
#AUSTIN.
Still here, Metherell!
#ELSIE.
I'm just going to take him home.
#AUSTIN.
Wasn't the doctor going to help you into your clothes? Where is Wells? Have either of you seen him?
#LEO.
Last seen disappearing in the direction of the bar with an eminent London solicitor.
#ELSIE.
Oh, never mind him. Jack's clothes can follow. We'll take a taxi.
#AUSTIN.
But -
#ELSIE.
Come along, Jack.
#LEO.
I say, father, it's a jolly rough game. This must be one of the referee's slack days or he'd pull Angus up sharp.
#AUSTIN.
The score's two - one for Blackton, my boy.
#FLORENCE.
Blackton play against the wind next half.
#AUSTIN.
The match is all right. I've something else to talk about to you two. You saw Metherell and Elsie?
#LEO.
Yes. It's a case.
#AUSTIN.
What?
#LEO.
Well, isn't it?
#AUSTIN.
So you know.
#LEO.
I've got eyes.
#AUSTIN.
You take it philosophically.
#LEO.
I don't see that it matters how I take it.
#AUSTIN.
To my mind it matters considerably. He'll be your brother - in - law if he marries her.
#LEO.
That had occurred to me.
#AUSTIN.
Don't you mind?
#LEO.
I don't mind. Metherell's a stupendous nut at football.
#AUSTIN.
I understood football didn't interest you.
#LEO.
Merely academically.
#AUSTIN.
It's really far more your concern than mine, you know, Leo. In the natural course of things Elsie's husband will be your brother - in - law for a longer period than he'll be my son - in - law. Yours too, Flo.
#FLORENCE.
Yes.
#AUSTIN.
Well? Have neither of you anything to say?
#FLORENCE.
Not much in my line, dad.
#LEO.
Nor in mine. As I'm her brother I can't cut the other fellow out and marry her myself. I'm rather thankful, too. Elsie takes a lot of stopping when she's got the bit between her teeth.
#AUSTIN.
I don't get much help from you.
#FLORENCE.
Why should you?
#LEO.
It's no use jibbing, father. Much easier to give them your blessing and a cheque.
#AUSTIN.
It is always easiest to give way, Leo.
#LEO.
Yes. Isn't it?
#AUSTIN.
Good heavens, do you young people care about nothing?
#LEO.
We're tremendously in earnest about a lot of things, only they're not the things you're in earnest about. There are fashions in shibboleths just as much as in socks, and you're a little out of date in both.
#AUSTIN.
Possibly. But blood is still thicker than water, Leo. Metherell is a man of the people and -
#LEO.
Oh, my dear father, don't talk about the people as if they inhabited an inferior universe. The class bogey is one of the ghosts we've laid to - day.
#AUSTIN.
Indeed. I'd an idea it was rather rampant.
#LEO.
I believe it used to be. As a matter of fact, I do object to Metherell.
#AUSTIN.
Oh! You have some sense left.
#FLORENCE.
I don't. I only wish I was in Elsie's shoes.
#LEO.
Was I speaking, Flo, or were you?
#FLORENCE.
You were, too much.
#LEO.
I object theoretically on aesthetic grounds because of the destined fatness of the retired footballer. But I have Elsie's assurance that Metherell's a teetotaller and I trust her to give him a lively enough time to keep him decently thin, so that practically my objection falls to pieces.
#AUSTIN.
Leo, I didn't expect much help from you, but upon my word your cynicism is disgusting.
#LEO.
I expect, you know, that's pretty much what grandfather thought of you. Hullo! are there no taxis?
#ELSIE.
I think every taxi in the town is outside the ground, but the men are too keen on getting a free sight of the game from the roofs of their cabs to take a fare.
#FLORENCE.
It's a sporting town, Blackton.
#LEO.
I should have thought they'd take it as an honour to drive Metherell home.
#JACK.
Not in the Birchester colours.
#LEO.
Sporting town, Blackton,
#ELSIE.
They're beasts. Beasts. They jeered. They're glad he's hurt.
#JACK.
That's what you've done for me, Mr. Whitworth. I'm laughed at in BLACKTON. Last Saturday I was their idol, and now -
#AUSTIN.
You've done it for yourself, my boy.
#JACK.
You transferred me.
#AUSTIN.
I meant the broken arm, not the broken idol. Jack Do you still think I did it purposely? Austin. I don't think, Metherell. I know. And I'm very much obliged to you. The chances are it's won the match.
#JACK.
It was an accident.
#AUSTIN.
Oh, you needn't keep that up before the family. That reminds me. Leo, Florence, this is your future brother - in - law, Jack Metherell, the sporting footballer, who's sold a match to buy my consent to his marrying Elsie.
#ELSIE.
Hush, Jack.
#FLORENCE.
I don't believe it, father. That consenting business went out with the flood.
#LEO.
Did you ask my father's consent?
#JACK.
Yes.
#LEO.
It's just credible, Flo.
#FLORENCE.
In England? In the twentieth century? Leo. These quaint old customs linger. Half the world doesn't know how the other half thinks.
#AUSTIN.
But aren't you horrified?
#LEO.
At his asking? No. Merely interested in the survival of an archaism.
#AUSTIN.
At his selling a match, man! man who would ask papa is capable of anything.
#ELSIE.
He's not capable of dishonesty.
#AUSTIN.
Oh, you're blind with love.
#ELSIE.
I have his word.
#AUSTIN.
His word!
#ELSIE.
Yes. Jack Metherell's word. The word of the man I'm going to marry.
#AUSTIN.
Deeds speak louder than words.
#JACK.
Yes, Mr. Whitworth, they do. You think you've won this match. We'll see.
#ELSIE.
Jack, what are you going to do?
#JACK.
Play. Play for Birchester as I've never played for Blackton. I'll show him if I sold the match.
#LEO.
No. I say. You mustn't do that with a broken arm.
#JACK.
Yes. Broken arm and all.
#LEO.
It's madness. Look here, I believe you. So does Elsie.
#FLORENCE.
And I.
#LEO.
We all do, except father, and I assure you he's subject to hallucinations. Thinks he can play the piano. Thinks my poetry's bad. Thinks you're a rotter. All sorts of delusions.
#JACK.
Birchester must win. I'm going on that field to show them all what football is.
#WELLS.
I think not, Metherell.
#JACK.
Out of my way, Doctor.
#WELLS.
I forbid it.
#JACK.
Much I care for your forbidding.
#WELLS.
One moment, Metherell. The play is extraordinarily rough. It's Blackton's game to lame their opponents.
#EDMUND.
More like a shambles than a game.
#WELLS.
The referee is strangely kind to Blackton, Mr. Whitworth.
#AUSTIN.
Oh?
#JACK.
What? What's that you said?
#WELLS.
I say if I were referee I'd have ordered off half the Blackton team for rough play. This is no match for a damaged man, Metherell.
#JACK.
So you did try the referee, Mr. Whitworth.
#AUSTIN.
I don't understand you.
#JACK.
Don't you? Well, rough or smooth, I'm going through it now. Thanks for your warning. And I warn you that referee had best be careful now, or I'll report him.
#ELSIE.
For my sake, Jack.
#JACK.
It is for your sake, Elsie, not for his. His consent's nothing to me after this. My record's going to be clean.
#AUSTIN.
Ah! Splendid. Edmund, I've brought you down from town for nothing. The match is ours.
#EDMUND.
Then I can devote my undivided attention to the problem of my niece. But why's the match yours?
#AUSTIN.
Metherell is kind enough to give it us. An injured player is a nuisance to his side - no use and only in the way.
#ELSIE.
You don't know Jack.
#AUSTIN.
Oh yes, I do. You think he's a hero. I know he's a fool.
#ELSIE.
Then he's an honest fool, and -
#AUSTIN.
I haven't time to argue the point now. I want a word with the referee before the game recommences.
#ELSIE.
So Jack was right. You did bribe the referee!
#AUSTIN.
Elsie, if you don't want us all to starve, you'll keep a tight hold of your tongue.
#LEO.
Starve!
#ELSIE.
Starve! What -
#AUSTIN.
Oh, ask your uncle.
#ELSIE.
I haven't time. I'm going to Jack's home to see that all's prepared for him.
#AUSTIN.
Oh, go to - Go where you like.
#ELSIE.
I usually do.
#EDMUND.
Now, Elsie, about this footballer.
#ELSIE.
I shall be rather busy turning his bedroom into a hospital for the next hour, uncle.
#EDMUND.
You're to do nothing so compromising.
#ELSIE.
Compromising!
#EDMUND.
If you insist on going, I shall come with you.
#ELSIE.
You will look funny in Elizabeth Street.
#EDMUND.
I prefer to look ridiculous than that you should look indiscreet.
#LEO.
There's the whistle. Come along, Flo.
#FLORENCE.
Yes. They're playing.
#ELSIE.
You mean to come?
#EDMUND.
I don't mean you to go alone.
#ELSIE.
I wish you were in London, uncle. Your intentions are so good.
#MRS. WILMOT.
Eh, yes. Elizabeth Street isn't what it was.
#MRS. METHERELL.
It's not the street, Amy, it's the people in it.
#MRS. NORBURY.
It used to be known for a saving street when I first came to live here. Every house had a bank - book.
#MRS. WILMOT.
And there's more money coming into the street to - day than there was then.
#MRS. NORBURY.
And going out. They spend more in an ordinary week than ever me and my old man spent in a holiday week one time, and if they don't spend, they gamble, and nothing to show for it all at the finish.
#MRS. WILMOT.
Yes, and come begging off their mother as soon as they fall sick or out of work. And that uppish with it all!
#MRS. NORBURY.
Do you think I can get my girls to stay at home and give me a lift with the house of an evening? Not they. They've always something on that's more important than me. I'm nobody. And the money those girls spend on their clothes!
#MRS. WILMOT.
Time was when a man 'ud come straight home when he'd finished work and be satisfied with doing a bit in his garden. Most he'd ever think of, barring Saturday night of course, was one night a week at his club. Nowadays it's every night the same.
#MRS. NORBURY.
I know. You did know where to lay your hand on them once, but there's no telling where they get to now.
#MRS. WILMOT.
It's all these picture shows and music halls.
#MRS. METHERELL.
It's all your own fault, Amy.
#MRS. WILMOT.
Why?
#MRS. METHERELL.
You let them put upon you.
#MRS. NORBURY.
I suppose you don't?
#MRS. METHERELL.
Our Jack doesn't carry on that road.
#MRS. WILMOT.
He'll have it out of you yet. He's quiet and deep.
#MRS. METHERELL.
He's safe enough.
#MRS. WILMOT.
Till he breaks out.
#MRS. METHERELL.
He's never broken yet.
#MRS. NORBURY.
You're lucky, then.
#MRS. METHERELL.
It isn't luck. It's the way you go about it with them.
#MRS. NORBURY.
Yours gets good money, too.
#MRS. METHERELL.
And I see it all. We've a use for a bank - book in this house.
#MRS. WILMOT.
I wish I saw the half of what mine get. Always crying out for more, but not to give it me. Some of them wouldn't be happy if they'd their own motor - car.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Yes. That's the way. When I was young a man could start poor and end rich. He'd save and stick to what he got. These lads to - day 'ull never rise. They're too busy spending what they have. My Jack knows a game worth two of that. He's improving his mind. His bedroom's full of books. Fitting himself to rise, Jack is.
#MRS. NORBURY.
There are a few like that. They're rare and scarce. I'm nearest.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Sit you still.
#EDMUND.
Mrs. Metherell?
#MRS. METHERELL.
Yes?
#EDMUND.
May we come in?
#MRS. METHERELL.
Looks as if you were in.
#ELSIE.
Have you heard about Jack's accident?
#MRS. METHERELL.
Yes. There was a special out. They get papers out for anything nowadays.
#ELSIE.
You take it very easily.
#MRS. METHERELL.
He'll be looked after. There's a doctor on the ground.
#EDMUND.
Perhaps I ought to introduce myself, Mrs.
#METHERELL.
My name is Whitworth - Mr. Austin Whitworth's brother. This is Miss Whitworth.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Is Jack hurt worse?
#ELSIE.
Not that we know of.
#MRS. WILMOT.
I think we'd best be going. Mrs. Metherell. No. It's all right.
#MRS. NORBURY.
, I can see we're not wanted. We'll be seeing you again before you flit to Birchester.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Many a time. We don't go yet.
#MRS. WILMOT.
Good - bye.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Good - bye. Now, what is it? If it's bad news I can stand it.
#ELSIE.
Is Jack's bed prepared?
#MRS. METHERELL.
Jack's bed was made at eight o'clock this morning. Do you take me for a slut?
#ELSIE.
Oh yes, but he'll need special nursing, and the room - which is his room?
#MRS. METHERELL.
His room's upstairs.
#ELSIE.
I'm going to see that it's right.
#MRS. METHERELL.
His room's my job.
#ELSIE.
Yes, yes. I know. But I must make sure. Don't you realize he's gone on playing with a broken arm?
#MRS. METHERELL.
He was always a fool. But he's not so soft as to take to his bed for a damaged arm.
#ELSIE.
Anything may have happened. Complications. Fever. I'm going to his room. Which is it, please?
#MRS. METHERELL.
You're not going. Elsie. I am. Please don't be stupid, Mrs. Metherell. Edmund. Elsie!
#MRS. METHERELL.
Do you think I'll have a girl I've never set eyes on before ferreting round my house?
#ELSIE.
But - oh, you tell her, uncle.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Here, you come back. Cheek!
#EDMUND.
I think perhaps in the circumstances, Mrs. Metherell -
#MRS. METHERELL.
What circumstances?
#EDMUND.
Don't you know about my niece?
#MRS. METHERELL.
I know she's a forward hussy, like most young girls to - day. That's all I know.
#EDMUND.
Then I must explain.
#MRS. METHERELL.
You'd better.
#EDMUND.
You see, she and your son are engaged to be married.
#MRS. METHERELL.
It's the first I've heard of it.
#EDMUND.
Perhaps I ought rather to say they think they're engaged.
#MRS. METHERELL.
No. You oughtn't. Jack doesn't think he's tied to any woman till he's told me first and got my leave.
#EDMUND.
Ah, now that's quite splendid, Mrs. Metherell. I'm glad to find that you agree with me.
#MRS. METHERELL.
In what?
#EDMUND.
In opposing the engagement.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Why do you?
#EDMUND.
Well, on grounds, shall we say, of general unsuitability.
#MRS. METHERELL.
I don't oppose.
#EDMUND.
I understood -
#MRS. METHERELL.
I don't know owt about the girl. She's made a bad start with me, but she's excited and I'll give fair play. She may be good enough for Jack. I cannot tell you yet. What makes you think she isn't?
#EDMUND.
I didn't exactly think that.
#MRS. METHERELL.
What did you think? Out with it. You're her uncle, you know more about the girl than I can.
#EDMUND.
Well, the fact is I don't consider she would be a suitable wife for your son.
#MRS. METHERELL.
That's what you said before. I want to know why not. Has she a temper?
#EDMUND.
Certainly not.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Flirts then? Not steady? Extravagant?
#EDMUND.
No, no.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Well, is she deformed or does she drink?
#EDMUND.
Good heavens, woman, no.
#MRS. METHERELL.
If you won't tell me what's wrong with her, I must find out for myself.
#EDMUND.
There is nothing wrong with her.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Then, where's your objection?
#EDMUND.
My objection, stated explicitly, is -
#MRS. METHERELL.
Yes? Go on.
#EDMUND.
I find it rather difficult to explain to you.
#MRS. METHERELL.
I've a thick skin.
#EDMUND.
My niece's training and upbringing do not make her a fit wife for your son, Mrs. Metherell.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Did you make a mess of her upbringing?
#EDMUND.
No, but -
#MRS. METHERELL.
How did you bring her up?
#EDMUND.
As a lady.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Then she's handicapped for life. But I have seen some grow out of it.
#ELSIE.
Mrs. Metherell, will you come upstairs a minute?
#MRS. METHERELL.
What for?
#ELSIE.
We ought to have hot water ready and I can't find the bath - room.
#MRS. METHERELL.
You'd have a job to find one in Elizabeth Street.
#ELSIE.
How do you get hot water?
#MRS. METHERELL.
You heat it.
#ELSIE.
Then I'll take this.
#MRS. METHERELL.
That's for his tea. I'll make it too. He always comes in hungry from a match.
#ELSIE.
Oh, what have you got for him? He'll need nourishing.
#MRS. METHERELL.
There's a bit of steak - pie in the cupboard left over from dinner. He'll have it cold.
#ELSIE.
But meat is so indigestible with tea, and he's an invalid.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Eh, stop moithering, lass. You don't know owt about it. What's that over your arm?
#ELSIE.
Oh, I'm sorry. It was upstairs.
#MRS. METHERELL.
That's my towel when you've done with it. Where did you get this from?
#ELSIE.
The bedroom.
#MRS. METHERELL.
That's one of my best towels. It isn't out of Jack's room.
#ELSIE.
I've arranged the front bedroom for him.
#MRS. METHERELL.
I'd have you to know that's my room.
#ELSIE.
The other is such a cheerless, poky little place. It's dark, there's no fireplace, no proper carpet, nothing but a camp - bed and a second - hand bookstall.
#MRS. METHERELL.
It's good enough for him.
#ELSIE.
Nothing but the best is good enough for a man who plays football like Jack.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Football's one thing. Home's another. He's at home here. Do you think he sleeps in the best bedroom?
#ELSIE.
He must have the best - lighted room just now.
#MRS. METHERELL.
So I'm to turn out for him, am I?
#ELSIE.
That isn't asking very much. I don't believe you care for him at all. How can you sit at home when he's playing football?
#MRS. METHERELL.
Custom's everything. I'm used to my men being before the public. Jack's father was a public man - an undertaker, and I've known him have as many as six funerals on a Saturday afternoon, but I didn't go to the cemetery to see he buried them properly, and I reckon it's the same with Jack. He can kick a ball without my watching him. And now perhaps you'll tell me what you mean by interfering in my house?
#ELSIE.
Haven't you told her, uncle?
#EDMUND.
Oh yes. I told her.
#ELSIE.
Well, Mrs. Metherell, will I do?
#MRS. METHERELL.
You said yourself just now that nothing but the best is good enough for Jack, so you'll excuse my being particular. I've been asking your uncle about you and he tells me you're a lady, born and bred.
#ELSIE.
You mustn't blame me for my relations, Mrs. Metherell.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Nay, I don't. Mine's a respectable family, but there's a Metherell doing time at this moment, and another to my certain knowledge who ought to be. But this is where it comes in. If you're going to be Jack's wife, you've to know your way about a house.
#ELSIE.
Yes.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Your father 'ull keep a servant, I suppose.
#ELSIE.
Oh, but I do my share. Servants require a lot of management.
#MRS. METHERELL.
I'll take your word for it. I never had any. And Jack 'ull have none, either.
#ELSIE.
I didn't expect it.
#MRS. METHERELL.
You may be handier than you look. I'll try. Those pots want washing. Let me see you shape. There's a tray. The sink's in yonder.
#EDMUND.
Really, Mrs. Metherell -
#ELSIE.
It's all right, uncle. In there, Mrs. Metherell? Mrs. Metherell. Yes. That'll not do. You won't have a man about the place to wait on you. Close that door, Mr. Whitworth, and let me see her get out by herself. Those are my cups, you know. Here, give it to me. Elsie. I'm sorry, Mrs.
#METHERELL.
But I can learn. Mrs. Metherell Maybe. You've shown willing.
#EDMUND.
Come away, Elsie. You've seen enough of the Metherell standard to show you it will never do.
#ELSIE.
I shall alter the standard.
#EDMUND.
It's fixed. You can't alter it. It's impossible. Elsie. The modern eye is blind to impossibilities. Have you ever been to an Ideal Home Exhibition? what?
#ELSIE.
They show you little houses fitted up with the cutest dodges for saving labour. I know Mrs. Metherell will have to make her home with us, but it'll be a very different home from this. You can credit me with some imagination.
#EDMUND.
I do, if you think Mrs. Metherell will ever believe her house is clean unless she or some one else has drudged in it all day. Seeing's believing, and you can't see the dust fly in a vacuum cleaner.
#ELSIE.
She'll have to use her common sense.
#EDMUND.
The scrubbing brush survives in spite of common sense.
#ELSIE.
You're safe.
#JACK.
And sound, too, but for this.
#ELSIE.
Thank God.
#EDMUND.
Is the match over?
#JACK.
Three - two for Birchester.
#EDMUND.
Birchester have won!
#JACK.
I won the match for Birchester, if it gives you any satisfaction to know it. I haven't been a man. I've been a miracle.
#ELSIE.
You always were.
#JACK.
I've only done my human best before to - day. To - day I've been a superman, a thing inspired, protected guarded by a greater mastery than I have ever known. It wasn't football as it is in life. It's been the football of my dreams.
#EDMUND.
It makes you talk.
#JACK.
I'm still intoxicated with the glamour of that game.
#EDMUND.
Yes, Metherell, success is sweet. But somebody is suffering for this.
#ELSIE.
Who?
#EDMUND.
If Birchester have won, Blackton have lost.
#ELSIE.
For an outsider, you take it seriously.
#EDMUND.
I take it seriously for your father. I ought to be with him now.
#ELSIE.
Haven't you done enough here for the proprieties?
#EDMUND.
I must go to your father, Elsie. Come.
#ELSIE.
I stay here with Jack.
#EDMUND.
Very well.
#JACK.
Elsie, what are you doing here?
#ELSIE.
I came to - to see your mother.
#JACK.
You've told her about us?
#ELSIE.
Yes.
#JACK.
It should have come from me. She'd expect that. But no matter, now she knows. What did she say?
#ELSIE.
It's - it's all right, Jack.
#JACK.
Hurrah! Then we've a clear road now. I was a bit afraid. Mother has a will of her own, and she's not easy to please. But I might have known she couldn't resist you. Tell me what she said when you pleaded to her with the loveliest eyes in the world and told her you loved me.
#ELSIE.
Well -
#JACK.
Yes, I know - you needn't tell me. I can see it all. You there, she here, and then you fell into each other's arms, and she kissed you, and what you said to each other I'm not to know, for it was women's talk not meant for men to hear.
#ELSIE.
Jack, you've never been like this before.
#JACK.
No, I've never played a great game with a broken arm and come through it unscathed. I've never - oh, but it's you that's done the greatest thing for me. You've won my mother for us. That was the cloud that used to get between.
#ELSIE.
And made you talk of self - improvement instead of my eyes? It's only now I learn you know my eyes are good.
#JACK.
I have always known the beauty of your eyes.
#ELSIE.
You couldn't tell me about them.
#JACK.
Not till it was all made right with mother. I thought last night to - day would be the saddest day I've known. I had to play for Birchester and go away from Blackton and from you. And there was mother, but you were brave and took that burden from me, and I'm glad, Elsie, I'm glad of everything.
#ELSIE.
Even of that?
#JACK.
It's brought me luck. It's brought me you, safely secure at last. I wish I had a dozen arms to break.
#ELSIE.
To get a dozen me's?
#JACK.
To suffer with for you.
#ELSIE.
You are suffering?
#JACK.
This bit of pain is nothing to a bad conscience, and it's that I had meeting you and knowing I'd not the pluck to have it out with mother. But now I've got you for my own. No, not a dozen of you, Elsie. One's good enough for me.
#ELSIE.
Jack, you're very strong.
#JACK.
I've only one arm, but it's strong.
#ELSIE.
I love your strength, Jack, but you do take my breath away. You've never kissed me like that before.
#JACK.
I've not been free before. I've kissed you guiltily, not as a free man kisses when he can give his whole mind to it.
#ELSIE.
Jack, let me go.
#JACK.
Don't you like it? I said you'd be the first to tire of kissing.
#ELSIE.
It's - it's almost terrifying, Jack.
#JACK.
Rubbish, lass, you're not made of glass. You can stand it. I needn't kiss you like I kiss my mother.
#ELSIE.
How do you kiss your mother?
#JACK.
Why, respectfully.
#ELSIE.
You don't respect me, then?
#JACK.
It's not the same. I love you.
#ELSIE.
And you don't love her?
#JACK.
It's different. Where is she now?
#ELSIE.
She went in there to wash some pots.
#JACK.
She does too much of that. The work comes heavy at her age.
#ELSIE.
We'll change all that.
#JACK.
Yes. Four hands 'ull make it easy.
#ELSIE.
My methods will be very different.
#JACK.
Different? She'll not like changing her ways. Old people don't like change.
#ELSIE.
No, but it's good for them.
#JACK.
My getting married 'ull be change enough. We must be careful not to upset her.
#ELSIE.
You're very fond of your mother, Jack.
#JACK.
I try to do my duty.
#ELSIE.
It's only duty, then?
#JACK.
Only! Honour thy father and thy mother that -
#ELSIE.
Yes, but I don't want to make old bones. And that honouring business is a bit fly - blown. We spell it humour your parents nowadays and not too much of that. A badly brought up parent's worse than a spoilt child.
#JACK.
Of course, you're joking, Elsie, and I know I'm not a judge of taste, but I don't somehow think we ought to make fun of our parents.
#ELSIE.
I wasn't joking, Jack. If your mother's going to stay with us, she'll have to realize the century she's living in.
#JACK.
My mother's mistress of this house, Elsie.
#ELSIE.
This house. Yes. But we're going to be happy in a cottage on the moors by Birchester, and if people who've forgotten what it is to be young try any interference, so much the worse for them.
#JACK.
Did you tell her that before you asked about the marrying?
#ELSIE.
Tell her what?
#JACK.
That you expected her to take a back seat and watch you interfering with her arrangements?
#ELSIE.
Interfering's not the word. They'll be revolutionized. Our cottage will be run on rational and hygienic principles.
#JACK.
I'd rather have it comfortable.
#ELSIE.
It will be comfortable.
#JACK.
With you and her squabbling all the time?
#ELSIE.
We shan't squabble if she'll be sensible.
#JACK.
Her idea of sense mayn't be the same as yours.
#ELSIE.
It probably won't. It's all right, Jack. I've had practice in handling parents.
#JACK.
I've seen a bit of it, too. You shan't treat mother that way. If we're to marry, Elsie -
#ELSIE.
If we're to marry!
#JACK.
My mother's first with me. I take my orders from her and you'll just have to do the same.
#MRS. METHERELL.
So you've broken your arm, I hear.
#JACK.
Yes, mother.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Wasn't there work enough with a flitting without fetching and carrying for you? Who's going to break the coals now?
#ELSIE.
Mrs. Metherell!
#JACK.
It's all right, Elsie. It's just her way.
#MRS. METHERELL.
And you've been turning my house upside down upstairs. A lot of need you have to talk, my girl. You've been in here ten minutes with a famished man and not so much as lifted a hand to put out his food. I told you where it was.
#ELSIE.
I'm sorry.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Sit you down, Jack.
#ELSIE.
Oh, that tea's been made so long.
#JACK.
I like it black.
#ELSIE.
I'm sure Jack ought to have -
#MRS. METHERELL.
Jack 'ull have what I provide for him, and be thankful he's got it.
#ELSIE.
You'll be having late dinners in a month.
#JACK.
She'll never let us.
#MRS. METHERELL.
I'll do that. If he's to be spoon - fed, I'll feed him.
#ELSIE.
I was doing it to help you, Mrs. Metherell.
#MRS. METHERELL.
You were doing it to show how fond you are. What's this I hear about you, Jack?
#JACK.
Well, she's told you.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Hadn't you a tongue in your own mouth?
#JACK.
I'd have told you to - night.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Going courting behind my back.
#JACK.
You will have your grumble, mother.
#MRS. METHERELL.
I'd do more than grumble if you hadn't gone and hurt yourself. You might have done it on purpose just to get on the soft side of me.
#ELSIE.
Is this your soft side, Mrs. Metiierell?
#MRS. METHERELL.
Yes. Company manners. I'm keeping what I have to say to Jack till you've gone.
#ELSIE.
Jack's ill. You're not to bully him.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Is he your son or mine? Because if he's mine I'll not ask your leave to say what I like to him. I'm mistress here.
#ELSIE.
Yes, but, Mrs. Metherell -
#MRS. METHERELL.
That'll do from you. I've had enough of your back answers. You talk too much.
#AUSTIN.
Mrs. Metherell?
#MRS. METHERELL.
Yes.
#ELSIE.
Father! Austin. You here, Elsie! Thank you. Well, Metherell, I've come to see how you are.
#JACK.
I wasn't carried off the field, but it isn't you I have to thank for it.
#AUSTIN.
No. It's your own magnificent skill. I never saw such play.
#MRS. METHERELL.
You'll excuse me, but I don't allow that kind of talk in here.
#AUSTIN.
But I was praising your son, Mrs. Metherell.
#MRS. METHERELL.
He's buttered up too much outside. In here he get's his makeweight of the other thing.
#JACK.
There's no more praise for me in this town, mother. I'm not popular. They've lost a lot of money on this match.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Was that your fault?
#JACK.
I played for Birchester. The bets were made on Blackton before they knew I was transferred.
#MRS. METHERELL.
They're blaming you for that?
#AUSTIN.
Fair weather sportsmen!
#JACK.
There's no denying I won the match for Birchester.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Whose fault was it you played for Birchester? Yours? No. There stands the man you have to thank for that.
#AUSTIN.
Really, Mrs. Metherell, I was hardly prepared -
#MRS. METHERELL.
You've made my Jack unpopular. That's what you've done. There never was a favourite like Jack. Not a man in the whole of Blackton but looked up to Jack, nor a woman but envied me my son.
#JACK.
But, mother, I didn't know you cared. You've always -
#MRS. METHERELL.
You didn't know I cared! Because I haven't gone and shouted with the others round the field, because I haven't dinned it in your ears and did my level best to stop them spoiling you, do you think I took no pride in knowing you're the idol of the town? I'll show you if I care. Out of that door, Mr. Whitworth. Out of that door, I say. You've brought trouble on this house.
#AUSTIN.
Really, this is very embarrassing.
#MRS. METHERELL.
I'll embarrass you. You've made my Jack unpopular. What do you want here? Your daughter? Take her and go.
#AUSTIN.
What I wanted was a little private conversation with your son, Mrs Metherell.
#MRS. METHERELL.
You've finished with my son. You're not his master now.
#AUSTIN.
No. But as a friend, I hoped -
#MRS. METHERELL.
And you're not his friend.
#AUSTIN.
I can't make things clear if you won't let me, Mrs. Metherell.
#MRS. METHERELL.
They're clear enough.
#AUSTIN.
Metherell, will you do me the favour of stepping outside with me for three minutes' business conversation?
#MRS. METHERELL.
Business!
#ELSIE.
You have no business now with Jack that doesn't include me. If Jack goes, I go.
#AUSTIN.
This includes you.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Jack doesn't go. Jack stays where he is.
#AUSTIN.
Do you know who I am?
#MRS. METHERELL.
You're the man who's flitting me to Birchester. Turning me out of my house, me that's lived in Blackton all my life, to go to a strange town and buy in strange shops where'll they rob me, and live beside strangers instead of here where everybody knew me for the mother of Jack Metherell.
#ELSIE.
But from what Jack says, Mrs. Metherell, Black - ton won't be very pleasant for you now.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Who's made it so?
#AUSTIN.
Mrs. Metherell, can't we be friends? I've always been on friendly terms in Club affairs with Jack, until to - day. lot can happen in a day.
#AUSTIN.
Yes. To - day the club has died.
#ELSIE.
Died!
#AUSTIN.
Yes. You know something of what the club has meant to me. I made it, built it, fostered it, and now it's dead. There's been a meeting since the match. The other directors had pence in where I had pounds. They won't put another farthing down to save the club, and I can't. I'm ruined. But that isn't what I'm here for now. I've lost to - day a greater thing than money.
#ELSIE.
Ruined! Father, what do you mean?
#MRS. METHERELL.
You needn't fret. Ruined is a way of talking. He'll have a nest - egg left to pay your servants and your milliner's bills.
#AUSTIN.
No. It means literally ruined. Metherell has cause to know my case was pretty desperate.
#JACK.
I didn't know how bad.
#AUSTIN.
Could you have acted any differently if you had?
#JACK.
You know I couldn't.
#AUSTIN.
No. You've showed up well to - day, and I've showed badly.
#JACK.
You were in a hole. man can never tell beforehand what he'll do in a tight corner, but he can be ashamed afterwards if he's done the wrong thing. And I'm - I'm trying now to snatch some rags of self - respect. Won't you help me, Mrs. Metherell?
#MRS. METHERELL.
Well, maybe a drowning man can't be particular what straw he clutches at. What can I do?
#AUSTIN.
Jack was the straw I clutched. I tempted him, and, to his honour and my own dishonour, he withstood me. But I owe him reparation, and I want to pay. If I can see these two young people happy, I shan't feel utterly debased. I shall have rescued from the wreck enough to give me back my soul.
#MRS. METHERELL.
That's a grand high way to talk about a bit of conscience - money.
#AUSTIN.
Yes, call it conscience - money if you like, although I have no money now, and money won't buy me back my peace of mind. I'm going to do the one thing in my power to right the wrong I did to Jack this afternoon. I'm going to put this marriage through.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Oh? What marriage may that be?
#AUSTIN.
Don't you know?
#ELSIE.
Of course she knows.
#AUSTIN.
Then that's all right, and a load's gone off my mind.
#ELSIE.
One moment, father.
#AUSTIN.
Yes. What is it?
#ELSIE.
I'm not so confident about it as I was.
#AUSTIN.
As you were when? It's not an hour since you defied the world to stand between you and Jack.
#ELSIE.
It's not the world that stands between. It's Mrs. Metherell.
#JACK.
Elsie!
#AUSTIN.
Mrs. Metherell! Oh, come, we parents have to make this sacrifice to see our children happy.
#MRS. METHERELL.
I care as much about Jack's happiness as you.
#AUSTIN.
Then we're unanimous. That's settled then. Elsie, Not quite.
#AUSTIN.
Why not. You told me my consent was all you wanted.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Did you?
#JACK.
No. I said I'd want yours too.
#AUSTIN.
Of course. Well, you've got my consent now, freely, gladly given.
#JACK.
Yes, I wanted that.
#AUSTIN.
Isn't that everything?
#ELSIE.
No. I've been thinking.
#AUSTIN.
I thought you knew your own mind, Elsie.
#ELSIE.
I didn't know Mrs. Metherell. Perhaps I didn't know Jack.
#AUSTIN.
There's been some lovers' tiff between you. Come, Elsie, I divided you this afternoon. Let me unite you now. What is the difficulty? I'm sure it's just a temporary trifle.
#ELSIE.
Whether it's temporary depends on how long Mrs. Metherell proposes to live.
#MRS. METHERELL.
I'm hearty, thank you. Mine's a long - lived family.
#AUSTIN.
Mrs. Metherell won't stand in your way, Elsie.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Speak for yourself.
#AUSTIN.
Oh, now I see. You're feeling as I did. It took me by surprise. But I'm converted now, and you'll find you'll soon grow used to the idea. Once you and I were young ourselves, and -
#ELSIE.
Father, it's no use talking to Mrs. Metherell as if she was a reasonable being. It rests with Jack to choose.
#JACK.
To choose?
#ELSIE.
Yes. Me or your mother. Which is it to be? don't know.
#MRS. METHERELL.
You'd better know, and sharp.
#JACK.
She's my mother, Elsie.
#ELSIE.
Yes. Who comes first? Your mother or the woman you - the woman I used to think you loved.
#JACK.
Elsie, you know I love you.
#ELSIE.
Do I? Is it love? Love hasn't widened your horizon. Love should break through, but you can't see beyond your mother for all your love.
#AUSTIN.
Elsie, you mustn't ask a man to make a choice like that. These relationships don't clash. They sort themselves out.
#ELSIE.
That's all you know about it. If you'd been here earlier, you'd have seen the clash all right.
#AUSTIN.
I didn't see it, but I know you're very capable of looking after yourself.
#ELSIE.
Oh, I can manage you. And I can manage Jack. You're men, but -
#MRS. METHERELL.
You can't manage me.
#ELSIE.
I've met my match.
#AUSTIN.
Elsie, I've set my heart on seeing you happy. My future's black. I see no future for myself at all, but I hoped that this one satisfaction would be granted me. You wanted Jack.
#ELSIE.
Yes, but -
#AUSTIN.
Do you still want him?
#ELSIE.
He's got a mother.
#AUSTIN.
Never mind her. Do you want him?
#ELSIE.
Yes. By himself.
#AUSTIN.
Very well. Metherell, do you want her?
#JACK.
My mother doesn't want me to want her.
#AUSTIN.
No. But do you?
#JACK.
It's like this -
#ELSIE.
It's no good, father. If wishing could kill Mrs. Metherell, she'd be dead at my feet.
#JACK.
Elsie!
#MRS. METHERELL.
Plain speaking breaks no bones. I can give as good as I get.
#AUSTIN.
May I speak plainly, then? Frankly, don't you think your attitude is selfish. We've all to see our children go from us, or the world would never get on. Let me appeal to you - and I think you will acknowledge that a man of my position is not accustomed to appeal to a woman of - well, you'll admit the difference between us, and the fact that I make very earnestly this petition should -
#MRS. METHERELL.
Yes. I'll admit the difference between us. You're ruined. I'm not.
#AUSTIN.
Ruined!
#MRS. METHERELL.
Didn't you say so?
#AUSTIN.
Yes. I'm ruined.
#MRS. METHERELL.
You've a family. It's a good lift to a ruined man with a family to get a daughter off his hands. That's why you've come to push her on to us. We mayn't be swells, but we can keep her, and that's more than you can do, so -
#AUSTIN.
Metherell, you don't believe that, do you?
#JACK.
No. I think you're sorry you forgot yourself this morning.
#AUSTIN.
I've done my best to make amends.
#JACK.
Yes.
#AUSTIN.
Is it - ?
#ELSIE.
Yes, father. It's impossible.
#JACK.
Elsie!
#ELSIE.
Isn't it impossible?
#JACK.
Yes.
#EDMUND.
May I come in?
#AUSTIN.
You here, Edmund!
#EDMUND.
I came back for Elsie. I've been looking for you everywhere.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Well, now you've found him, you'd better take him away. I'll be charging some of you rent for the use of my room.
#EDMUND.
But what's happened?
#ELSIE.
Oh, you've won.
#EDMUND.
I've won?
#ELSIE.
Yes. The old guard. You and Mrs. Metherell.
#MRS. METHERELL.
Yes. You saw it wouldn't do. You're the only Whitworth in your senses.
#EDMUND.
Thank you, Mrs. Metherell.
#AUSTIN.
You know we lost the match.
#EDMUND.
Yes. What are you going to do?
#AUSTIN.
I've not had time to think about myself. This affair came first.
#EDMUND.
Well, this is where I come in.
#AUSTIN.
What can you do? The club's wound up.
#EDMUND.
If I like, I can do a good deal. I'm a bachelor with a good city practice, and no expensive hobbies, Austin.
#AUSTIN.
I never thought it would come to this. My young brother.
#EDMUND.
Not so young. Oh, if it stings a bit, perhaps it ought to. You'd the old man's house and the lion's share of his money, and I've got to pull you out of the hole you dug yourself. There's only one person who'll like it less than you, and that's my energetic nephew.
#AUSTIN.
Leo!
#EDMUND.
I'll present Master Leo with his articles. The law's a splendid cure for lungs and laziness.
#JACK.
Mr. Whitworth, there's no ill feeling, is there?
#EDMUND.
Not a bit.
#JACK.
And Mr. Austin fancies he owes me something.
#EDMUND.
Oh?
#AUSTIN.
I have that bribery business badly on my mind.
#EDMUND.
What do you want, Metherell?
#JACK.
I'm a man with ambitions, sir, and I heard what you said about Mr.
#LEO.
Would you give me my articles?
#EDMUND.
My friend, you're an excellent footballer, but you'd make a shocking lawyer with that delicate conscience of yours.
#MRS. METHERELL.
You'll go on living honestly, Jack.
#JACK.
Yes, mother.
#MRS. METHERELL.
And when you marry I'll choose you a decent hard - working girl who'll look after you properly, and not a butter - fingered lass who'll break your crockery and want waiting on hand and foot and -
#EDMUND.
Mrs. Metherell!
#MRS. METHERELL.
Oh, I forgot you were there. I was just talking privately to my son, same as you've been doing amongst yourselves.
#EDMUND.
We've earned that. I beg your pardon, Mrs. Metherell.
#ELSIE.
Good - bye, Jack.
#JACK.
Good - bye, Miss Whitworth.
#AUSTIN.
Metherell, I'm sorry.
#JACK.
You did your best to make it right.
#EDMUND.
Elsie.
#ELSIE.
Yes, uncle?
#EDMUND.
London!
