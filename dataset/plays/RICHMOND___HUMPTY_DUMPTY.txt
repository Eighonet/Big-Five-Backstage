#MRS. PRINGLE.
Well, good morning, Mrs. Dumpty, I must be running off now.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Very kind of you to have come in, Mrs. Pringle. I am sorry Humpty was out, I'd like you to have seen him.
#MRS. PRINGLE.
Oh, I can do without seeing him every day, thank you. Is he as fat as ever?
#MRS. DUMPTY.
How you do go on about his being fat, Mrs. Pringle. You don't want me to starve the child, do you?
#MRS. PRINGLE.
No, but there's a lot of difference between starving and over - feeding. I'm sure my Billy don't get the half of what you give Humpty, and just look at him!
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Look at him, indeed! Humpty only gets the same as we get, and has done ever since he's been born. I suppose your Billy gets nothing but bread and milk.
#MRS. PRINGLE.
He didn't have pork chops when he was six months old, if that's what you mean, Mrs. Dumpty.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Well, I was never one to grudge a baby a bit of anything it cried for, and no one can say Humpty's not a fine boy now.
#MRS. PRINGLE.
He may be a fine boy, but he is a very naughty one. He makes more noise than all the rest of the boys put together. That sounds like him now.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
It's just his high spirits, Mrs. Pringle. I like a boy to have a bit of spirit.
#HUMPTY.
Hallo, mother!
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Don't you see Mrs. Pringle, dear?
#HUMPTY.
Yes, I wish I didn't. I don't like Mrs. Pringle.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Oh, Humpty, I'm surprised at you.
#MRS. PRINGLE.
I think I'd best be going, Mrs. Dumpty.
#HUMPTY.
Look out that you don't miss the procession, Mrs. Pringle.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
What procession?
#HUMPTY.
Haven't you heard? All the King's horses and all the King's men are coming along here on their way to the Coronation.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Well, that's very nice. I'll take you to the end of the road, and we'll look at them.
#HUMPTY.
But we needn't go to the end of the road - they pass right along here. I shall only have to get on the wall and I shall see beautifully.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
You're not to get on without me holding on to you. I'm not going to have you falling off and breaking all your bones.
#MRS. PRINGLE.
I don't believe he's got bones to break. He is made of nothing but fat and naughtiness.
#HUMPTY.
That's right, Mrs. Pringle. Stick up for me.
#MRS. PRINGLE.
I'm not sticking up for you, you naughty boy - I'm only sorry for your poor mother having such a son. So unlike my Billy!
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Oh, it's only his playful way, Mrs. Pringle. Run along and wash your face, Humpty, there's a good boy.
#HUMPTY.
I don't want to wash my face.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Well, I'm sure I don't know what the King will say if he sees you with a face like that.
#MRS. PRINGLE.
It's enough to make him abdicate.
#HUMPTY.
The King's not coming, you silly old things, it's his horses and men.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
You're a rude boy, and you're to go and wash your face at once.
#HUMPTY.
Well, I don't mind, just for once - it's nearly a week since I last did, and it's Monday - that's the day my face goes to the wash.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Hadn't you best stop and see the procession with us, Mrs. Pringle? It would be a nice change for you instead of looking at your Billy all day -
#MRS. PRINGLE.
You're not very civil - spoken, Mrs. Dumpty, but I do like to see a procession when I can. But I'm hardly fit to be seen like this. I'd best slip home and put on my new shawl.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Well, if you do that, I'll just pop on my Sunday bonnet - it won't take a minute.
#HUMPTY.
Hurrah - they've both gone - I'll get on the wall. I can see beautifully now. I expect the procession will soon be coming - Yes, I can hear them. Oh, what fun!
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Oh, you naughty boy, didn't I tell you not to get on the wall without me holding you?
#HUMPTY.
I'm all right - I shall see them beautifully from here.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Don't jump about like that - you'll fall off for a certainty.
#HUMPTY.
Oh, let me alone. Can't you hear them coming?
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Take care, Humpty, take care. What did I say...!
#MRS. PRINGLE.
Here I am, Mrs. Dumpty. Why, what's that down there?
#MRS. DUMPTY.
It's Humpty. He's been and fallen off the wall, and I can't get him up again.
#MRS. PRINGLE.
Here, let me try. Give me your hand, Humpty.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
No, it's no use, he is so heavy, you see.
#MRS. PRINGLE.
Didn't I tell you he was too fat? My Billy would be up in a minute.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Bother your Billy - if only someone would come and pick him up.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Oh, sirs - oh, sirs - do, pray, stop a minute.
#KING'S MAN.
Halt! About turn! Yes, ma'am?
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Oh, sir, you look so beautiful - but I'm sorry to tell you that my son, while waiting to see you, has fallen off the wall - he's down there.
#KING'S MAN.
Yes, ma'am! I see him. Is that all, ma'am? Good morning. About turn! -
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Oh, sirs! Oh, sirs! don't go away - I want you to pick him up again.
#KING'S MAN.
Well, ma'am, we may be late for the Coronation, but anything to oblige. About turn! First file, take hold of the boy's arms! Second file, catch hold of his legs! Now - all together, on to the wall - lift! I'm sorry, ma'am. We can't move him - he's rather stout, you see.
#MRS. PRINGLE.
What did I say! If only it was my Billy now.
#KING'S MAN.
Here's another regiment coming - perhaps they can do it.
#KING'S MAN.
If you please, Colonel -
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Halt! What is it, my man?
#KING'S MAN.
There's a young feller there fallen off the wall - we can't get him up again, sir.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
What! All you King's horses and all you King's men can't do a simple thing like that! Preposterous! Ridiculous! Sergeant - Major!
#SERGEANT-MAJOR.
Yes, Colonel!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Fall out the regiment, and replace that boy on the wall.
#SERGEANT-MAJOR.
Right turn! Dismiss! Now then, all together.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
H'm - it's not so easy as I thought. A charge of cavalry might do it. Or, upon my word, an explosion of dynamite would be better. Sergeant - Major!
#SERGEANT-MAJOR.
Yes, Colonel.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Blow this boy off the ground with dynamite.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Oh, thank you so much - I won't trouble you to do that.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
No trouble at all, madam, I assure you. It won't take a moment. Sergeant - Major!
#MRS. PRINGLE.
Oh, how exciting!
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Be quiet, Mrs. Pringle. Pray don't trouble, Colonel - I think he is very comfortable where he is, thank you.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Just as you wish, madam - but if we can't do anything for you I think we had better be moving on. Sergeant - Major!
#SERGEANT-MAJOR.
Yes, Colonel.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Fall in the regiment.
#SERGEANT-MAJOR.
Regiment! Fall in!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Attention! Right turn. Quick march!
#MRS. DUMPTY.
What a dreadful man!
#MRS. PRINGLE.
Oh, did you think so? I thought him so pleasant.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Why, what's Humpty doing?
#HUMPTY.
Phew! I felt rather anxious then - I thought I should have to get up -
#MRS. DUMPTY.
Get up! But can you get up, my poppet?
#HUMPTY.
Of course I can, if I like - only it was such fun having them all crowding round and pulling at me.
#MRS. PRINGLE.
Well, I never! It would have served you quite right if they had blown you up as they said.
#MRS. DUMPTY.
How hard you are on the poor child, Mrs. Pringle.
#MRS. PRINGLE.
My Billy would never have done such a thing.
#HUMPTY.
Of course he wouldn't - he's much too stupid.
#MRS. PRINGLE.
Stupid! Not he - he's got too much sense to go falling off a wall just when a procession was coming. I shall go home and tell him what you did.
#HUMPTY.
And mind you tell him that all the King's horses and all the King's men couldn't pick Humpty Dumpty up again - till he chose!
