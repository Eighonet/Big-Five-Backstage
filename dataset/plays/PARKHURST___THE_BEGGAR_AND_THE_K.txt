#THE BEGGAR.
Bread. Bread. Bread. Give me some bread.
#THE KING.
Who is that crying in the street for bread?
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king, it is a beggar.
#THE KING.
Why does he cry for bread?
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king, he cries for bread in order that he may fill his belly.
#THE KING.
I do not like the sound of his voice. It annoys me very much. Send him away.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king, he has been sent away.
#THE KING.
If that is so, then why do I hear his voice?
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king, he has been sent away many times, yet each time that he is sent away he returns again, crying louder than he did before.
#THE KING.
He is very unwise to annoy me on such a warm day. He must be punished for his impudence. Use the lash on him.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king, it has been done.
#THE KING.
Then bring out the spears.
#THE SERVANT.
O king, the guards have already bloodied their swords many times driving him away from the palace gates. But it is of no avail.
#THE KING.
Then bind him and gag him if necessary. If need be cut out his tongue. I do not like the sound of the fellow's voice. It annoys me very much.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king, thy orders were obeyed even yesterday.
#THE KING.
No. That cannot be. A beggar cannot cry for bread who has no tongue.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Behold he can - if he has grown another.
#THE KING.
What! Why, men are not given more than one tongue in a lifetime. To have more than one tongue is treason.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
If it is treason to have more than one tongue, O king, then is this beggar surely guilty of treason.
#THE KING.
The punishment for treason is death. See to it that the fellow is slain. And do not fan me so languidly. I am very warm.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Behold, O great and illustrious king, all thy commands were obeyed even yesterday.
#THE KING.
How! Do not jest with thy king.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
If I jest, then there is truth in a jest. Even yesterday, O king, as I have told thee, the beggar which thou now hearest crying aloud in the street was slain by thy soldiers with a sword.
#THE KING.
Do ghosts eat bread? Forsooth, men who have been slain with a sword do not go about in the streets crying for a piece of bread.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Forsooth, they do if they are fashioned as this beggar.
#THE KING.
Why, he is but a man. Surely he cannot have more than one life in a lifetime.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Listen to a tale, O king, which happened yesterday.
#THE KING.
I am listening.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Thy soldiers smote this beggar for crying aloud in the streets for bread, but his wounds are already healed. They cut out his tongue, but he immediately grew another. They slew him, yet he is now alive.
#THE KING.
Ah! that is a tale which I cannot understand at all.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king, it may be well.
#THE KING.
I cannot understand what thou sayest, either.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king, that may be well also.
#THE KING.
Thou art speaking now in riddles. I do not like riddles. They confuse my brain.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Behold, O king, if I speak in riddles it is because a riddle has come to pass.
#THE BEGGAR.
Bread. Bread. Give me some bread.
#THE KING.
Ah! He is crying out again. His voice seems to me louder than it was before.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Hunger is as food to the lungs, O king.
#THE KING.
His lungs I will wager are well fed. Ha, ha!
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
But alas! his stomach is quite empty.
#THE KING.
That is not my business.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Should I not perhaps fling him a crust from the window?
#THE KING.
No! To feed a beggar is always foolish. Every crumb that is given to a beggar is an evil seed from which springs another fellow like him.
#THE BEGGAR.
Bread. Bread. Give me some bread.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
He seems very hungry, O king.
#THE KING.
Yes. So I should judge.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
If thou wilt not let me fling, him a piece of bread thine ears must pay the debts of thy hand. king can have no debts.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
That is true, O king. Even so, the noise of this fellow's begging must annoy thee greatly.
#THE KING.
It does.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Doubtless he craves only a small crust from thy table and he would be content.
#THE KING.
Yea, doubtless he craves only to be a king and he would be very happy indeed.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Do not be hard, O king. Thou art ever wise and just. This fellow is exceedingly hungry. Dost thou not command me to fling him just one small crust from the window?
#THE KING.
My commands I have already given thee. See that the beggar is driven away.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
But alas! O king, if he is driven away he will return again even as he did before.
#THE KING.
Then see to it that he is slain. I cannot be annoyed with the sound of his voice.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
But alas! O great and illustrious king, if he is slain he will come to life again even as he did before.
#THE KING.
Ah! that is true. But his voice troubles me. I do not like to hear it.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
His lungs are fattened with hunger. Of a truth they are quite strong.
#THE KING.
Well, propose a remedy to weaken them. remedy, O king?
#THE KING.
That is what I said. A remedy - and do not stop fanning me. I am exceedingly warm.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
A crust of bread, O king, dropped from yonder window - forsooth that might prove a remedy.
#THE KING.
I have said I will not give him a crust of bread. If I gave him a crust to - day he would be just as hungry again to - morrow, and my troubles would be as great as before.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
That is true, O king. Thy mind is surely filled with great learning.
#THE KING.
Therefore, some other remedy must be found.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king, the words of thy illustrious mouth are as very meat - balls of wisdom.
#THE KING.
Now let me consider. Thou sayest he does not suffer pain -
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Therefore he cannot be tortured.
#THE KING.
And he will not die -
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Therefore it is useless to kill him.
#THE KING.
Now let me consider. I must think of some other way.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Perhaps a small crust of bread, O king -
#THE KING.
Ha! I have it. I have it. I myself will order him to stop.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king!
#THE KING.
Send the beggar here.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king!
#THE KING.
Ha! I rather fancy the fellow will stop his noise when the king commands him to. Ha, ha, ha!
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king, thou wilt not have a beggar brought into thy royal chamber!
#THE KING.
Yea. Go outside and tell this fellow that the king desires his presence.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O great and illustrious king, thou wilt surely not do this thing. Thou wilt surely not soil thy royal eyes by looking on such a filthy creature. Thou wilt surely not contaminate thy lips by speaking to a common beggar who cries aloud in the streets for bread.
#THE KING.
My ears have been soiled too much already. Therefore go now and do as I have commanded thee.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O great and illustrious king, thou wilt surely not -
#THE KING.
I said, Go! Forsooth, I fancy the fellow will stop his bawling when I order him to. Forsooth, I fancy he will be pretty well frightened when he hears that the king desires his presence. Ha, ha, ha, ha!
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king, here is the beggar.
#THE KING.
Ha! A magnificent sight, to be sure. Art thou the beggar who has been crying aloud in the streets for bread?
#THE BEGGAR.
Art thou the king?
#THE KING.
I am the king.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
It is not proper for a beggar to ask a question of a king. Speak only as thou art spoken to.
#THE KING.
Do thou likewise. I have ordered thee here to speak to thee concerning a very grave matter. Thou art the beggar, I understand, who often cries aloud in the streets for bread. Now, the complaint of thy voice annoys me greatly. Therefore, do not beg any more.
#THE BEGGAR.
I - I do not understand.
#THE KING.
I said, do not beg any more. do not understand.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
The king has commanded thee not to beg for bread any more. The noise of thy voice is as garbage in his ears.
#THE KING.
Ha! An excellent flower of speech. Pin it in thy buttonhole. Thine ears, I see, are in need of a bath even more than thy body. I said, Do not beg any more. do not understand.
#THE KING.
DO NOT MORE. do not understand.
#THE KING.
Heavens! He is deafer than a stone wall.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king, he cannot be deaf, for he understood me quite easily when I spoke to him in the street.
#THE KING.
Art thou deaf? Canst thou hear what I am saying to thee now?
#THE BEGGAR.
Alas! I can hear every word perfectly.
#THE KING.
Fft! The impudence. Thy tongue shall be cut out for this.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king, to cut out his tongue is useless, for he will grow another.
#THE KING.
No matter. It shall be cut out anyway. I have ordered thee not to beg any more in the streets. What meanest thou by saying thou dost not understand?
#THE BEGGAR.
The words of thy mouth I can hear perfectly. But their noise is only a foolish tinkling in my ears.
#THE KING.
Fft! Only a - ! A lash will tinkle thy hide for thee if thou dost not cure thy tongue of impudence. I, thy king, have ordered thee not to beg any more in the streets for bread. Signify, therefore, that thou wilt obey the orders of thy king by quickly touching thy forehead thrice to the floor.
#THE BEGGAR.
That is impossible.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Come. It is not safe to tempt the patience of the king too long. His patience is truly great, but he loses it most wondrous quickly.
#THE KING.
Come, now: I have ordered thee to touch thy forehead to the floor.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
And quickly.
#THE BEGGAR.
Wherefore should I touch my forehead to the floor?
#THE KING.
In order to seal thy promise to thy king.
#THE BEGGAR.
But I have made no promise. Neither have I any king.
#THE KING.
Ho! He has made no promise. Neither has he any king. Ha, ha, ha. I have commanded thee not to beg any more, for the sound of thy voice is grievous unto my ears. Touch thy forehead now to the floor, as I have commanded thee, and thou shall go from this palace a free man. Refuse, and thou wilt be sorry before an hour that thy father ever came within twenty paces of thy mother.
#THE BEGGAR.
I have ever lamented that he did. For to be born into this world a beggar is a more unhappy thing than any that I know - unless it is to be born a king.
#THE KING.
Fft! Thy tongue of a truth is too lively for thy health. Come, now, touch thy forehead thrice to the floor and promise solemnly that thou wilt never beg in the streets again. And hurry!
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
It is wise to do as thy king commands thee. His patience is near an end.
#THE KING.
Do not be afraid to soil the floor with thy forehead. I will graciously forgive thee for that.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
I said, it is not wise to keep the king waiting.
#THE KING.
Well? Well? WELL?
#THE BEGGAR.
O king, thou hast commanded me not to beg in the streets for bread, for the noise of my voice offends thee. Now therefore do I likewise command thee to remove thy crown from thy forehead and throw it from yonder window into the street. For when thou hast thrown thy crown into the street, then will I no longer be obliged to beg.
#THE KING.
Fft! Thou commandest me! Thou, a beggar from the streets, commandest me, a king, to remove my crown from my forehead and throw it from yonder window into the street!
#THE BEGGAR.
That is what I said.
#THE KING.
Why, dost thou not know I can have thee slain for such words?
#THE BEGGAR.
No. Thou canst not have me slain. The spears of thy soldiers are as straws against my body.
#THE KING.
Ha! We shall see if they are. We shall see!
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king, it is indeed true. It is even as he has told thee.
#THE BEGGAR.
I have required thee to remove thy crown from thy forehead. If so be thou wilt throw it from yonder window into the street, my voice will cease to annoy thee any more. But if thou refuse, then thou wilt wish thou hadst never had any crown at all. For thy days will be filled with a terrible boding and thy nights will be full of horrors, even as a ship is full of rats.
#THE KING.
Why, this is insolence. This is treason!
#THE BEGGAR.
Wilt thou throw thy crown from yonder window?
#THE KING.
Why, this is high treason!
#THE BEGGAR.
I ask thee, wilt thou throw thy crown from yonder window?
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Perhaps it were wise to humor him, O king. After thou hast thrown thy crown away I can go outside and bring it to thee again.
#THE BEGGAR.
Well? Well? Well?
#THE KING.
No! I will not throw my crown from that window - no, nor from any other window. What! Shall I obey the orders of a beggar? Never!
#THE BEGGAR.
Truly, that is spoken like a king. Thou art a king, so thou wouldst prefer to lose thy head than that silly circle of gold that so foolishly sits upon it. But it is well. Thou art a king. Thou couldst not prefer otherwise.
#THE KING.
Stop him! Seize him! Does he think to get off so easily with his impudence!
#THE BEGGAR.
One of thy servants cannot stop me. Neither can ten thousand of them do me any harm. I am stronger than a mountain. I am stronger than the sea!
#THE KING.
Ha! We will see about that, we will see about that. Hold him, I say. Call the guards. He shall be put in chains.
#THE BEGGAR.
My strength is greater than a mountain and my words are more fearful than a hurricane. This servant of thine cannot even touch me. With one breath of my mouth I can blow over this whole palace.
#THE KING.
Dost thou hear the impudence he is offering me? Why dost thou not seize him? What is the matter with thee? Why dost thou not call the guards?
#THE BEGGAR.
I will not harm thee now. I will only cry aloud in the streets for bread wherewith to fill my belly. But one day I will not be so kind to thee. On that day my mouth will be filled with a rushing wind and my arms will become as strong as steel rods, and I will blow over this palace, and all the bones in thy foolish body I will snap between my fingers. I will beat upon a large drum and thy head will be my drumstick. I will not do these things now. But one day I will do them. Therefore, when my voice sounds again in thine ears, begging for bread, remember what I have told thee. Remember, O king, and be afraid!
#THE KING.
After him! After him! He must not be allowed to escape! After him!
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king - I cannot seem to move.
#THE KING.
Quick, then. Call the guards. He must be caught and put in chains. Quick, I say. Call the guards!
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
O king - I cannot seem to call them.
#THE KING.
How! Art thou dumb? Ah!
#THE BEGGAR.
Bread. Bread. Give me some bread.
#THE KING.
Ah. How! Am I afraid of a beggar!
#THE BEGGAR.
Bread. Bread. Give me some bread.
#THE KING.
Close that window!
