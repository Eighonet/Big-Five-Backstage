#CAPTAIN.
Won't you play something for me?
#ALICE CHASE.
What am I to play?
#CAPTAIN.
Whatever suits you.
#ALICE CHASE.
You don't like my repertory.
#CAPTAIN.
Nor you mine.
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you want the doors to stay open?
#CAPTAIN.
If you wish it.
#ALICE CHASE.
Let them be, then. Why don't you smoke?
#CAPTAIN.
Strong tobacco is beginning not to agree with me.
#ALICE CHASE.
Get weaker tobacco then. It is your only pleasure, as you call it.
#CAPTAIN.
Pleasure - what is that?
#ALICE CHASE.
Don't ask me. I know it as little as you - Don't you want your whiskey yet?
#CAPTAIN.
I'll wait a little. What have you for supper?
#ALICE CHASE.
How do I know? Ask Christine.
#CAPTAIN.
The mackerel ought to be in season soon - now the Fall is here.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, it is Fall!
#CAPTAIN.
Within and without. But leaving aside the cold that comes with the Fall, both within and without, a little broiled mackerel, with a slice of lemon and a glass of white Burgundy, wouldn't be so very bad.
#ALICE CHASE.
Now you grow eloquent.
#CAPTAIN.
Have we any Burgundy left in the wine - cellar?
#ALICE CHASE.
So far as I know, we have had no wine - cellar these last five years -
#CAPTAIN.
You never know anything. However, we must stock up for our silver wedding.
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you actually mean to celebrate it?
#CAPTAIN.
Of course!
#ALICE CHASE.
It would be more seemly to hide our misery - our twenty - five years of misery -
#CAPTAIN.
My dear Alice, it has been a misery, but we have also had some fun - now and then. One has to avail one - self of what little time there is, for afterward it is all over.
#ALICE CHASE.
Is it over? Would that it were!
#CAPTAIN.
It is over! Nothing left but what can be put on a wheel - barrow and spread on the garden beds.
#ALICE CHASE.
And so much trouble for the sake of the garden beds!
#CAPTAIN.
Well, that's the way of it. And it is not of my making.
#ALICE CHASE.
So much trouble! Did the mail come?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes.
#ALICE CHASE.
Did the butcher send his bill?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes.
#ALICE CHASE.
How large is it?
#CAPTAIN.
Look at it yourself. I cannot see any longer.
#ALICE CHASE.
What is wrong with your eyes?
#CAPTAIN.
Don't know.
#ALICE CHASE.
Growing old?
#CAPTAIN.
Nonsense! I?
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, not I!
#CAPTAIN.
Hm!
#ALICE CHASE.
Can you pay it?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, but not this moment.
#ALICE CHASE.
Some other time, of course! In a year, when you have been retired with a small pension, and it is too late! And then, when your trouble returns -
#CAPTAIN.
Trouble? I never had any trouble - only a slight indisposition once. And I can live another twenty years.
#ALICE CHASE.
The doctor thought otherwise.
#CAPTAIN.
The doctor!
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, who else could express any valid opinion about sickness?
#CAPTAIN.
I have no sickness, and never had. I am not going to have it either, for I shall die all of a sudden - like an old soldier.
#ALICE CHASE.
Speaking of the doctor - you know they are having a party to - night?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, what of it? We are not invited because we don't associate with those people, and we don't associate with them because we don't want to - because we despise both of them. Rabble - that's what they are!
#ALICE CHASE.
You say that of everybody.
#CAPTAIN.
Because everybody is rabble.
#ALICE CHASE.
Except yourself.
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, because I have behaved decently under all conditions of life. That's why I don't belong to the rabble.
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you want to play cards?
#CAPTAIN.
All right.
#ALICE CHASE.
Just think, the doctor is permitted to use the band for a private entertainment!
#CAPTAIN.
That's because he goes to the city and truckles to the Colonel. Truckle, you know - if one could only do that!
#ALICE CHASE.
I used to be friendly with Gerda, but she played me false -
#CAPTAIN.
They are all false! What did you turn up for trumps?
#ALICE CHASE.
Put on your spectacles.
#CAPTAIN.
They are no help - Well, well!
#ALICE CHASE.
Spades are trumps.
#CAPTAIN.
Spades - ?
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, be that as it may, our case is settled in advance with the wives of the new officers.
#CAPTAIN.
What does it matter? We never give any parties anyhow, so nobody is the wiser. I can live by myself - as I have always done.
#ALICE CHASE.
I, too. But the children? The children have to grow up without any companionship.
#CAPTAIN.
Let them find it for themselves in the city - I take that! Got any trumps left?
#ALICE CHASE.
One - That's mine!
#CAPTAIN.
Six and eight make fifteen -
#ALICE CHASE.
Fourteen - fourteen!
#CAPTAIN.
Six and eight make fourteen. I think I am also forgetting how to count. And two makes sixteen - It is your deal.
#ALICE CHASE.
You are tired?
#CAPTAIN.
Not at all.
#ALICE CHASE.
One can hear the music all this way. Do you think Curt is invited also?
#CAPTAIN.
He arrived this morning, so I guess he has had time to get out his evening clothes, though he has not had time to call on us.
#ALICE CHASE.
Master of Quarantine - is there to be a quarantine station here?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes.
#ALICE CHASE.
He is my own cousin after all, and once I bore the same name as he -
#CAPTAIN.
In which there was no particular honour -
#ALICE CHASE.
See here! You leave my family alone, and I'll leave yours!
#CAPTAIN.
All right, all right - don't let us begin again!
#ALICE CHASE.
Must the Master of Quarantine be a physician?
#CAPTAIN.
Oh, no, he's merely a sort of superintendent or book - keeper - and Curt never became anything in particular.
#ALICE CHASE.
He was not much good -
#CAPTAIN.
And he has cost us a lot of money. And when he left wife and children, he became disgraced.
#ALICE CHASE.
Not quite so severe, Edgar!
#CAPTAIN.
That's what happened! What has he been doing in America since then? Well, I cannot say that I am longing for him - but he was a nice chap, and I liked to argue with him.
#ALICE CHASE.
Because he was so tractable -
#CAPTAIN.
Tractable or not, he was at least a man one could talk to. Here, on this island, there is not one person who understands what I say - it's a community of idiots!
#ALICE CHASE.
It is rather strange that Curt should arrive just in time for our silver wedding - whether we celebrate it or not -
#CAPTAIN.
Why is that strange? Oh, I see! It was he who brought us together, or got you married, as they put it.
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, didn't he?
#CAPTAIN.
Certainly! It was a kind of fixed idea with him - I leave it for you to say what kind. wanton fancy -
#CAPTAIN.
For which we have had to pay, and not he!
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, think only if I had remained on the stage! All my friends are stars now.
#CAPTAIN.
Well, well, well! Now I am going to have a drink. There should be a rail here to put the foot on, so that one might dream of being at Copenhagen, in the American Bar.
#ALICE CHASE.
Let us put a rail there, if it will only remind us of Copenhagen. For there we spent our best moments.
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, do you remember that "navarin aux pommes"?
#ALICE CHASE.
No, but I remember the concerts at the Tivoli.
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, your tastes are so - exalted!
#ALICE CHASE.
It ought to please you to have a wife whose taste is good.
#CAPTAIN.
So it does.
#ALICE CHASE.
Sometimes, when you need something to brag of -
#CAPTAIN.
I guess they must be dancing at the doctor's - I catch the three - four time of the tuba: boom - boom - boom!
#ALICE CHASE.
I can hear the entire melody of the Alcazar Waltz. Well, it was not yesterday I danced a waltz -
#CAPTAIN.
You think you could still manage?
#ALICE CHASE.
Still?
#CAPTAIN.
Ye - es. I guess you are done with dancing, you like me!
#ALICE CHASE.
I am ten years younger than you.
#CAPTAIN.
Then we are of the same age, as the lady should be ten years younger.
#ALICE CHASE.
Be ashamed of yourself! You are an old man - and I am still in my best years.
#CAPTAIN.
Oh, I know, you can be quite charming - to others, when you make up your mind to it.
#ALICE CHASE.
Can we light the lamp now?
#CAPTAIN.
Certainly.
#ALICE CHASE.
Will you ring, please.
#CAPTAIN.
Will you be kind enough to light the lamp, Jenny?
#ALICE CHASE.
I want you to light the hanging lamp.
#JENNY.
Yes, ma'am.
#ALICE CHASE.
Did you wipe the chimney?
#JENNY.
Sure.
#ALICE CHASE.
What kind of an answer is that?
#CAPTAIN.
Now - now -
#ALICE CHASE.
Leave us. I will light the lamp myself. That will be better. I think so too.
#ALICE CHASE.
Go!
#JENNY.
I wonder, ma'am, what you'd say if I did go?
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you think she will go?
#CAPTAIN.
Shouldn't wonder. And then we are in for it -
#ALICE CHASE.
It's your fault! You spoil them.
#CAPTAIN.
Not at all. Can't you see that they are always polite to me?
#ALICE CHASE.
Because you cringe to them. And you always cringe to inferiors, for that matter, because, like all despots, you have the nature of a slave.
#CAPTAIN.
There - there!
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, you cringe before your men, and before your sergeants, but you cannot get on with your equals or your superiors.
#CAPTAIN.
Ugh!
#ALICE CHASE.
That's the way of all tyrants - Do you think she will go?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, if you don't go out and say something nice to her.
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, for if I should do it, you would say that I was flirting with the maids.
#ALICE CHASE.
Mercy, if she should leave! Then I shall have to do the work, as I did the last time, and my hands will be spoiled.
#CAPTAIN.
That is not the worst of it. But if Jenny leaves, Christine will also leave, and then we shall never get a servant to the island again. The mate on the steamer scares away every one that comes to look for a place - and if he should miss his chance, then my corporals attend to it.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, your corporals, whom I have to feed in my kitchen, and whom you dare not show the door -
#CAPTAIN.
No, for then they would also go when their terms were up - and we might have to close up the whole gun shop!
#ALICE CHASE.
It will be our ruin.
#CAPTAIN.
That's why the officers have proposed to petition His Royal Majesty for special expense money.
#ALICE CHASE.
For whom?
#CAPTAIN.
For the corporals.
#ALICE CHASE.
You are crazy!
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, laugh a little for me. I need it.
#ALICE CHASE.
I shall soon have forgotten how to laugh -
#CAPTAIN.
That is something one should never forget - it is tedious enough anyhow!
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, it is not very amusing - Do you want to play any more?
#CAPTAIN.
No, it tires me.
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you know, it irritates me nevertheless that my cousin, the new Master of Quarantine, makes his first visit to our enemies.
#CAPTAIN.
Well, what's the use of talking about it?
#ALICE CHASE.
But did you see in the paper that he was put down as rentier? He must have come into some money then.
#CAPTAIN.
Rentier! Well, well - a rich relative. That's really the first one in this family.
#ALICE CHASE.
In your family, yes. But among my people many have been rich.
#CAPTAIN.
If he has money, he's conceited, I suppose, but I'll hold him in check - and he won't get a chance to look at my cards.
#ALICE CHASE.
Who is it?
#CAPTAIN.
Keep quiet, please.
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, are you not going to look -
#CAPTAIN.
I can hear - I can hear what they are saying - It's the children.
#ALICE CHASE.
Well?
#CAPTAIN.
Wait a little - The children are at the guard - house in the city. Judith is not well again and is staying away from school.
#ALICE CHASE.
Again! What more did they say?
#CAPTAIN.
Money, of course!
#ALICE CHASE.
Why is Judith in such a hurry? If she didn't pass her examinations until next year, it would be just as well.
#CAPTAIN.
Tell her, and see what it helps.
#ALICE CHASE.
You should tell her.
#CAPTAIN.
How many times have I not done so? But children have their own wills, you know.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, in this house at least. So, you yawn in your wife's presence!
#CAPTAIN.
Well, what can I do? Don't you notice how day by day we are saying the same things to each other? When, just now, you sprang that good old phrase of yours, "in this house at least," I should have come back with my own stand - by, "it is not my house only." But as I have already made that reply some five hundred times, I yawned instead. And my yawn could be taken to mean either that I was too lazy to answer, or "right you are, my angel," or "supposing we quit."
#ALICE CHASE.
You are very amiable to - night.
#CAPTAIN.
Is it not time for supper soon?
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you know that the doctor ordered supper from the city - from the Grand Hotel?
#CAPTAIN.
No! Then they are having ptarmigans - tschk! Ptarmigan, you know, is the finest bird there is, but it's clear barbarism to fry it in bacon grease -
#ALICE CHASE.
Ugh! Don't talk of food.
#CAPTAIN.
Well, how about wines? I wonder what those barbarians are drinking with the ptarmigans?
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you want me to play for you?
#CAPTAIN.
The last resource! Well, if you could only leave your dirges and lamentations alone - it sounds too much like music with a moral. And I am always adding within myself: "Can't you hear how unhappy I am! Meow, meow! Can't you hear what a horrible husband I have! Brum, brum, brum! If he would only die soon! Beating of the joyful drum, flourishes, the finale of the Alcazar Waltz, Champagne Galop!" Speaking of champagne, I guess there are a couple of bottles left. What would you say about bringing them up and pretending to have company?
#ALICE CHASE.
No, we won't, for they are mine - they were given to me personally.
#CAPTAIN.
You are so economical.
#ALICE CHASE.
And you are always stingy - to your wife at least!
#CAPTAIN.
Then I don't know what to suggest. Perhaps I might dance for you?
#ALICE CHASE.
No, thank you - I guess you are done with dancing.
#CAPTAIN.
You should bring some friend to stay with you.
#ALICE CHASE.
Thanks! You might bring a friend to stay with you.
#CAPTAIN.
Thanks! It has been tried, and with mutual dissatisfaction. But it was interesting in the way of an experiment, for as soon as a stranger entered the house, we became quite happy - to begin with -
#ALICE CHASE.
And then!
#CAPTAIN.
Oh, don't talk of it!
#ALICE CHASE.
Who can be coming so late as this?
#CAPTAIN.
Jenny does not knock.
#ALICE CHASE.
Go and open the door, and don't yell "come" - it has a sound of the workshop.
#CAPTAIN.
You don't like workshops.
#ALICE CHASE.
Please, open!
#CAPTAIN.
It is Christine - Has Jenny left? Jenny has left.
#ALICE CHASE.
Then I become servant girl again!
#CAPTAIN.
And I man - of - all - work.
#ALICE CHASE.
Would it not be possible to get one of your gunners to help along in the kitchen?
#CAPTAIN.
Not these days.
#ALICE CHASE.
But it couldn't be Jenny who sent in her card?
#CAPTAIN.
You see what it is - I cannot.
#ALICE CHASE.
Curt - it is Curt! Hurry up and bring him in.
#CAPTAIN.
Curt! Well, that's a pleasure!
#CAPTAIN.
Here he is, the traitor! Welcome, old man! Let me hug you!
#ALICE CHASE.
Welcome to my home, Curt!
#CURT.
Thank you - it is some time since we saw each other.
#CAPTAIN.
How long? Fifteen years! And we have grown old -
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, Curt has not changed, it seems to me.
#CAPTAIN.
Sit down, sit down! And first of all - the programme. Have you any engagement for to - night?
#CURT.
I am invited to the doctor's, but I have not promised to go.
#ALICE CHASE.
Then you will stay with your relatives.
#CURT.
That would seem the natural thing, but the doctor is my superior, and I might have trouble afterward.
#CAPTAIN.
What kind of talk is that? I have never been afraid of my superiors -
#CURT.
Fear or no fear, the trouble cannot be escaped.
#CAPTAIN.
On this island I am master. Keep behind my back, and nobody will dare to touch you.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, be quiet, Edgar! Leaving both masters and superiors aside, you must stay with us. That will be found both natural and proper.
#CURT.
Well, then - especially as I feel welcome here.
#CAPTAIN.
Why should you not be welcome? There is nothing between us - What could there be? You were a little careless as a young man, but I have forgotten all about it. I don't let things rankle.
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, you have strayed far and wide in the world?
#CURT.
Yes, and now I have found a harbour with you -
#CAPTAIN.
Whom you married off twenty - five years ago.
#CURT.
It was not quite that way, but it doesn't matter. It is pleasing to see that you have stuck together for twenty - five years.
#CAPTAIN.
Well, we have borne with it. Now and then it has been so - so, but, as you say, we have stuck together. And Alice has had nothing to complain of. There has been plenty of everything - heaps of money. Perhaps you don't know that I am a celebrated author - an author of text - books -
#CURT.
Yes, I recall that, when we parted, you had just published a volume on rifle practice that was selling well. Is it still used in the military schools?
#CAPTAIN.
It is still in evidence, and it holds its place as number one, though they have tried to substitute a worse one - which is being used now, but which is totally worthless.
#CURT.
You have been travelling abroad, I have heard.
#ALICE CHASE.
We have been down to Copenhagen five times - think of it?
#CAPTAIN.
Well, you see, when I took Alice away from the stage -
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, you took me?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, I took you as a wife should be taken -
#ALICE CHASE.
How brave you have grown!
#CAPTAIN.
But as it was held up against me afterward that I had spoiled her brilliant career - hm! - I had to make up for it by promising to take my wife to Copenhagen - and this I have kept - fully! Five times we have been there. Five Have you been in Copenhagen?
#CURT.
No, I have mostly been in America.
#CAPTAIN.
America? Isn't that a rotten sort of a country?
#CURT.
It is not Copenhagen.
#ALICE CHASE.
Have you - heard anything - from your children?
#CURT.
No.
#ALICE CHASE.
I hope you pardon me - but was it not rather inconsiderate to leave them like that -
#CURT.
I didn't leave them, but the court gave them to the mother.
#CAPTAIN.
Don't let us talk of that now. I for my part think it was lucky for you to get out of that mess.
#CURT.
How are your children?
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, thank you. They are at school in the city and will soon be grown up.
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, they're splendid kids, and the boy has a brilliant head - brilliant! He is going to join the General Staff -
#ALICE CHASE.
If they accept him!
#CAPTAIN.
Him? Who has the making of a War Minister in him!
#CURT.
From one thing to another. There is to be a quarantine station here - against plague, cholera, and that sort of thing. And the doctor will be my superior, as you know - what sort of man is he?
#CAPTAIN.
Man? He is no man! He's an ignorant rascal!
#CURT.
That is very unpleasant for me.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, it is not quite as bad as Edgar makes it out, but I must admit that I have small sympathy for the man - rascal, that's what he is. And that's what the others are, too - the Collector of Customs, the Postmaster, the telephone girl, the druggist, the pilot - what is it they call him now? - the Pilot Master - rascals one and all - and that's why I don't associate with them.
#CURT.
Are you on bad terms with all of them?
#CAPTAIN.
Every one!
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, it is true that intercourse with those people is out of the question.
#CAPTAIN.
It is as if all the tyrants of the country had been sent to this island for safe - keeping.
#ALICE CHASE.
Exactly!
#CAPTAIN.
Hm! Is that meant for me? I am no tyrant - not in my own house at least.
#ALICE CHASE.
You know better!
#CAPTAIN.
Don't believe her! I am a very reasonable husband, and the old lady is the best wife in the world.
#ALICE CHASE.
Would you like something to drink, Curt?
#CURT.
No, thank you, not now.
#CAPTAIN.
Have you turned - little moderate only -
#CAPTAIN.
Is that American?
#CURT.
Yes.
#CAPTAIN.
No moderation for me, or I don't care at all. A man should stand his liquor.
#CURT.
Returning to our neighbours on the island - my position will put me in touch with all of them - and it is not easy to steer clear of everything, for no matter how little you care to get mixed up in other people's intrigues, you are drawn into them just the same.
#ALICE CHASE.
You had better take up with them - in the end you will return to us, for here you find your true friends.
#CURT.
Is it not dreadful to be alone among a lot of enemies as you are?
#ALICE CHASE.
It is not pleasant.
#CAPTAIN.
It isn't dreadful at all. I have never had anything but enemies all my life, and they have helped me on instead of doing me harm. And when my time to die comes, I may say that I owe nothing to anybody, and that I have never got a thing for nothing. Every particle of what I own I have had to fight for.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, Edgar's path has not been strewn with roses -
#CAPTAIN.
No, with thorns and stones - pieces of flint - but a man's own strength: do you know what that means?
#CURT.
Yes, I learned to recognise its insufficiency about ten years ago.
#CAPTAIN.
Then you are no good!
#ALICE CHASE.
Edgar!
#CAPTAIN.
He is no good, I say, if he does not have the strength within himself. Of course it is true that when the mechanism goes to pieces there is nothing left but a barrowful to chuck out on the garden beds; but as long as the mechanism holds together the thing to do is to kick and fight, with hands and feet, until there is nothing left. That is my philosophy.
#CURT.
It is fun to listen to you.
#CAPTAIN.
But you don't think it's true?
#CURT.
No, I don't.
#CAPTAIN.
But true it is, for all that.
#CAPTAIN.
It's blowing. I could just feel it coming.
#ALICE CHASE.
You will stay for supper?
#CURT.
Thank you.
#ALICE CHASE.
But it will be very simple, as our housemaid has just left us.
#CURT.
Oh, it will do for me, I am sure.
#ALICE CHASE.
You ask for so little, dear Curt.
#CAPTAIN.
If you could only see how the mercury is dropping! Oh, I felt it coming!
#ALICE CHASE.
He is nervous.
#CAPTAIN.
We ought to have supper soon.
#ALICE CHASE.
I am going to see about it now. You can sit here and philosophise - , but don't contradict him, for then he gets into bad humour. And don't ask him why he was not made a major.
#CAPTAIN.
See that we get something nice now, old lady!
#ALICE CHASE.
You give me money, and you'll get what you want.
#CAPTAIN.
Always money!
#CAPTAIN.
Money, money, money! All day long I have to stand ready with the purse, until at last I have come to feel as if I myself were nothing but a purse. Are you familiar with that kind of thing?
#CURT.
Oh, yes - with the difference that I took myself for a pocket - book.
#CAPTAIN.
Ha - ha! So you know the flavour of the brand! Oh, the ladies! Ha - ha! And you had one of the proper kind!
#CURT.
Let that be buried now.
#CAPTAIN.
She was a jewel! Then I have after all - in spite of everything - one that's pretty decent. For she is straight, in spite of everything.
#CURT.
In spite of everything.
#CAPTAIN.
Don't you laugh!
#CURT.
In spite of everything!
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, she has been a faithful mate, a splendid mother - excellent - but she has a devilish temper. Do you know, there have been moments when I cursed you for saddling me with her.
#CURT.
But I didn't. Listen, man -
#CAPTAIN.
Yah, yah, yah! You talk nonsense and forget things that are not pleasant to remember. Don't take it badly, please - I am accustomed to command and raise Cain, you see, but you know me, and don't get angry!
#CURT.
Not at all. But I have not provided you with a wife - on the contrary.
#CAPTAIN.
Don't you think life is queer anyhow?
#CURT.
I suppose so.
#CAPTAIN.
And to grow old - it is no fun, but it is interesting. Well, my age is nothing to speak of, but it does begin to make itself felt. All your friends die off, and then you become so lonely.
#CURT.
Lucky the man who can grow old in company with a wife.
#CAPTAIN.
Lucky? Well, it is luck, for the children go their way, too. You ought not to have left yours.
#CURT.
Well, I didn't. They were taken away from me -
#CAPTAIN.
Don't get mad now, because I tell you -
#CURT.
But it was not so.
#CAPTAIN.
Well, whichever way it was, it has now become forgotten - but you are alone!
#CURT.
You get accustomed to everything.
#CAPTAIN.
Do you - is it possible to get accustomed - to being quite alone also?
#CURT.
Here am I!
#CAPTAIN.
What have you been doing these fifteen years?
#CURT.
What a question! These fifteen years!
#CAPTAIN.
They say you have got hold of money and grown rich.
#CURT.
I can hardly be called rich -
#CAPTAIN.
I am not going to ask for a loan.
#CURT.
If you were, you would find me ready.
#CAPTAIN.
Many thanks, but I have my bank account. You see , nothing must be lacking in this house; and the day I had no more money - she would leave me!
#CURT.
Oh, no!
#CAPTAIN.
No? Well, I know better. Think of it, she makes a point of asking me when I happen to be short, just for the pleasure of showing me that I am not supporting my family.
#CURT.
But I heard you say that you have a large income.
#CAPTAIN.
Of course, I have a large income - but it is not enough.
#CURT.
Then it is not large, as such things are reckoned -
#CAPTAIN.
Life is queer, and we as well!
#CURT.
What is that?
#CAPTAIN.
Nothing but a time correction.
#CURT.
Have you no telephone?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, in the kitchen. But we use the telegraph because the girls at the central report everything we say.
#CURT.
Social conditions out here by the sea must be frightful!
#CAPTAIN.
They are simply horrible! But all life is horrible. And you, who believe in a sequel, do you think there will be any peace further on?
#CURT.
I presume there will be storms and battles there also.
#CAPTAIN.
There also - if there be any "there"! I prefer annihilation!
#CURT.
Are you sure that annihilation will come without pain?
#CAPTAIN.
I am going to die all of a sudden, without pain
#CURT.
So you know that?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, I know it.
#CURT.
You don't appear satisfied with your life?
#CAPTAIN.
Satisfied? The day I could die, I should be satisfied.
#CURT.
That you don't know! But tell me: what is going on in this house? What is happening here? There is a smell as of poisonous wall - paper, and one feels sick the moment one enters. I should prefer to get away from here, had I not promised Alice to stay. There are dead bodies beneath the flooring, and the place is so filled with hatred that one can hardly breathe. What is the matter with you? Edgar! Edgar!
#CAPTAIN.
Did you say anything? I thought it was - Alice! - Oh, is that you? - Say -
#CURT.
This is horrible! Alice!
#ALICE CHASE.
What is it?
#CURT.
I don't know. Look at him.
#ALICE CHASE.
He goes off like that at times - I'll play and then he will wake up.
#CURT.
No, don't! Not that way! Leave it to me - Does he hear? Or see?
#ALICE CHASE.
Just now he neither hears nor sees.
#CURT.
And you can speak of that with such calm? Alice, what is going on in this house?
#ALICE CHASE.
Ask him there.
#CURT.
Him there? But he is your husband! stranger to me - as strange as he was twenty - five years ago. I know nothing at all about that man - nothing but -
#CURT.
Stop! He may overhear you.
#ALICE CHASE.
Now he cannot hear anything.
#CAPTAIN.
Pardon me. I have to inspect the sentries.
#CURT.
Is he ill?
#ALICE CHASE.
I don't know.
#CURT.
Has he lost his reason?
#ALICE CHASE.
I don't know.
#CURT.
Does he drink?
#ALICE CHASE.
He boasts more of it than he really drinks.
#CURT.
Sit down and talk - but calmly and truthfully.
#ALICE CHASE.
What am I to talk about? That I have spent a lifetime in this tower, locked up, guarded by a man whom I have always hated, and whom I now hate so beyond all bounds that the day he died I should be laughing until the air shook.
#CURT.
Why have you not parted?
#ALICE CHASE.
You may well ask! While still engaged we parted twice; since then we have been trying to part every single day - but we are chained together and cannot break away. Once we were separated - within the same house - for five whole years. Now nothing but death can part us. This we know, and for that reason we are waiting for him as for a liberator.
#CURT.
Why are you so lonely?
#ALICE CHASE.
Because he isolates me. First he "exterminated" all my brothers and sisters from our home - he speaks of it himself as "extermination" - and then my girl friends and everybody else.
#CURT.
But his relatives? He has not "exterminated" them?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, for they came near taking my life, after having taken my honour and good name. Finally I became forced to keep up my connection with the world and with other human beings by means of that telegraph - for the telephone was watched by the operators. I have taught myself telegraphy, and he doesn't know it. You must not tell him, for then he would kill me.
#CURT.
Frightful! Frightful! - But why does he hold me responsible for your marriage? Let me tell you now how it was. Edgar was my childhood friend. When he saw you he fell in love at once. He came to me and asked me to plead his cause. I said no at once - and, my dear Alice, I knew your tyrannical and cruel temperament. For that reason I warned him - and when he persisted, I sent him to get your brother for his spokesman.
#ALICE CHASE.
I believe what you say. But he has been deceiving himself all these years, so that now you can never get him to believe anything else.
#CURT.
Well, let him put the blame on me if that can relieve his sufferings.
#ALICE CHASE.
But that is too much -
#CURT.
I am used to it. But what does hurt me is his unjust charge that I have deserted my children -
#ALICE CHASE.
That's the manner of man he is. He says what suits him, and then he believes it. But he seems to be fond of you, principally because you don't contradict him. Try not to grow tired of us now. I believe you have come in what was to us a fortunate moment; I think it was even providential - Curt, you must not grow tired of us, for we are undoubtedly the most unhappy creatures in the whole world!
#CURT.
I have seen one marriage at close quarters, and it was dreadful - but this is almost worse!
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you think so?
#CURT.
Yes.
#ALICE CHASE.
Whose fault is it?
#CURT.
The moment you quit asking whose fault it is, Alice, you will feel a relief. Try to regard it as a fact, a trial that has to be borne -
#ALICE CHASE.
I cannot do it! It is too much! It is beyond help!
#CURT.
I pity both of you! - Do you know why you are hating each other?
#ALICE CHASE.
No, it is the most unreasoning hatred, without cause, without purpose, but also without end. And can you imagine why he is principally afraid of death? He fears that I may marry again.
#CURT.
Then he loves you.
#ALICE CHASE.
Probably. But that does not prevent him from hating me.
#CURT.
It is called love - hatred, and it hails from the pit! - Does he like you to play for him?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, but only horrid melodies - for instance, that awful "The Entry of the Boyars." When he hears it he loses his head and wants to dance.
#CURT.
Does he dance?
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, he is very funny at times.
#CURT.
One thing - pardon me for asking. Where are the children?
#ALICE CHASE.
Perhaps you don't know that two of them are dead?
#CURT.
So you have had that to face also?
#ALICE CHASE.
What is there I have not faced?
#CURT.
But the other two?
#ALICE CHASE.
In the city. They couldn't stay at home. For he set them against me.
#CURT.
And you set them against him?
#ALICE CHASE.
Of course. And then parties were formed, votes bought, bribes given - and in order not to spoil the children completely we had to part from them. What should have been the uniting link became the seed of dissension; what is held the blessing of the home turned into a curse - well, I believe sometimes that we belong to a cursed race!
#CURT.
Yes, is it not so - ever since the Fall?
#ALICE CHASE.
What fall?
#CURT.
That of our first parents.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, I thought you meant something else!
#ALICE CHASE.
Curt, my kinsman, my childhood friend - I have not always acted toward you as I should. But now I am being punished, and you are having your revenge.
#CURT.
No revenge! Nothing of that kind here! Hush!
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you recall one Sunday while you were engaged - and I had invited you for dinner -
#CURT.
Never mind!
#ALICE CHASE.
I must speak! Have pity on me! When you came to dinner, we had gone away, and you had to leave again.
#CURT.
You had received an invitation yourselves - what is that to speak of!
#ALICE CHASE.
Curt, when to - day, a little while ago, I asked you to stay for supper, I thought we had something left in the pantry. And there is not a thing, not even a piece of bread -
#CURT.
Weeping] Alice - poor Alice!
#ALICE CHASE.
But when he comes home and wants something to eat, and there is nothing - then he gets angry. You have never seen him angry! O, God, what humiliation!
#CURT.
Will you not let me go out and arrange for something?
#ALICE CHASE.
There is nothing to be had on this island.
#CURT.
Not for my sake, but for his and yours - let me think up something - something. We must make the whole thing seem laughable when he comes. I'll propose that we have a drink, and in the meantime I'll think of something. Put him in good humour; play for him, any old nonsense. Sit down at the piano and make yourself ready -
#ALICE CHASE.
Look at my hands - are they fit to play with? I have to wipe glasses and polish brass, sweep floors, and make fires -
#CURT.
But you have two servants?
#ALICE CHASE.
So we have to pretend because he is an officer - but the servants are leaving us all the time, so that often we have none at all - most of the time, in fact. How am I to get out of this - this about supper? Oh, if only fire would break out in this house!
#CURT.
Don't, Alice, don't!
#ALICE CHASE.
If the sea would rise and take us away!
#CURT.
No, no, no, I cannot listen to you!
#ALICE CHASE.
What will he say, what will he say - Don't go, Curt, don't go away from me!
#CURT.
No, dear Alice - I shall not go.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, but when you are gone -
#CURT.
Has he ever laid hands on you?
#ALICE CHASE.
On me? Oh, no, for he knew that then I should have left him. One has to preserve some pride.
#CURT.
Is he coming?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, that's he.
#CURT.
What in the world are we to do?
#ALICE CHASE.
I don't know, I don't know!
#CAPTAIN.
There! Leisure now! Well, has she had time to make her complaints? Is she not unhappy - hey?
#CURT.
How's the weather outside? -
#CAPTAIN.
Half storm - Sir Bluebeard with the maiden in the tower; and outside stands the sentry with drawn sabre to guard the pretty maiden - and then come the brothers, but the sentry is there. Look at him. Hip - hip! That's a fine sentry. Look at him. Malbrough s'en va - t - en guerre! Let us dance the sword dance! Curt ought to see it!
#CURT.
No, let us have "The Entry of the Boyars" instead!
#CAPTAIN.
Oh, you know that one, do you? - Alice in the kitchen apron, come and play. Come, I tell you!
#CAPTAIN.
Now you have been black - guarding me!
#ALICE CHASE.
Shall we have it again? Lord Jesus!
#CURT.
What is it? What is it?
#ALICE CHASE.
Is he dead?
#CURT.
I don't know. Come and help me.
#ALICE CHASE.
I cannot touch him - is he dead?
#CURT.
No - he lives.
#CAPTAIN.
What was it? What was it?
#CURT.
You fell down.
#CAPTAIN.
Did anything happen?
#CURT.
You fell on the floor. What is the matter with you?
#CAPTAIN.
With me? Nothing at all. I don't know of anything. What are you staring at me for?
#CURT.
You are ill.
#CAPTAIN.
What nonsense is that? You go on playing, Alice - Oh, now it's back again!
#ALICE CHASE.
Can't you see that you are ill?
#CAPTAIN.
Don't shriek! It is only a fainting spell.
#CURT.
We must call a doctor - I'll use your telephone -
#CAPTAIN.
I don't want any doctor.
#CURT.
You must! We have to call him for our own sake - otherwise we shall be held responsible -
#CAPTAIN.
I'll show him the door if he comes here. I'll shoot him. Oh, now it's there again!
#CURT.
Now I am going to telephone!
#CAPTAIN.
Will you give me a glass of water?
#ALICE CHASE.
I suppose I have to!
#CAPTAIN.
How amiable!
#ALICE CHASE.
Are you ill?
#CAPTAIN.
Please pardon me for not being well.
#ALICE CHASE.
Will you take care of yourself then?
#CAPTAIN.
You won't do it, I suppose?
#ALICE CHASE.
No, of that you may be sure!
#CAPTAIN.
The hour is come for which you have been waiting so long.
#ALICE CHASE.
The hour you believed would never come.
#CAPTAIN.
Don't be angry with me!
#CURT.
Oh, it's too bad -
#ALICE CHASE.
What did he say?
#CURT.
He rang off without a word.
#ALICE CHASE.
There is the result of your limitless arrogance!
#CAPTAIN.
I think I am growing worse - Try to get a doctor from the city.
#ALICE CHASE.
We shall have to use the telegraph then.
#CAPTAIN.
Do you - know - how to use it?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, I do.
#CAPTAIN.
So - o! Well, go on then - But isn't she treacherous! Come over here and sit by me. Take my hand. I sit here and fall - can you make it out? Down something - such a queer feeling.
#CURT.
Have you had any attack like this before?
#CAPTAIN.
Never -
#CURT.
While you are waiting for an answer from the city, I'll go over to the doctor and have a talk with him. Has he attended you before?
#CAPTAIN.
He has.
#CURT.
Then he knows your case.
#ALICE CHASE.
There will be an answer shortly. It is very kind of you, Curt. But come back soon.
#CURT.
As soon as I can.
#CAPTAIN.
Curt is kind! And how he has changed.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, and for the better. It is too bad, however, that he must be dragged into our misery just now.
#CAPTAIN.
But good for us - I wonder just how he stands. Did you notice that he wouldn't speak of his own affairs?
#ALICE CHASE.
I did notice it, but then I don't think anybody asked him.
#CAPTAIN.
Think, what a life! And ours! I wonder if it is the same for all people?
#ALICE CHASE.
Perhaps, although they don't speak of it as we do.
#CAPTAIN.
At times I have thought that misery draws misery, and that those who are happy shun the unhappy. That is the reason why we see nothing but misery.
#ALICE CHASE.
Have you known anybody who was happy?
#CAPTAIN.
Let me see! No - Yes - the Ekmarks.
#ALICE CHASE.
You don't mean it! She had to have an operation last year -
#CAPTAIN.
That's right. Well, then I don't know - yes, the Von Kraffts.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, the whole family lived an idyllic life, well off, respected by everybody, nice children, good marriages - right along until they were fifty. Then that cousin of theirs committed a crime that led to a prison term and all sorts of after - effects. And that was the end of their peace. The family name was dragged in the mud by all the newspapers. The Krafft murder case made it impossible for the family to appear anywhere, after having been so much thought of. The children had to be taken out of school. Oh, heavens!
#CAPTAIN.
I wonder what my trouble is?
#ALICE CHASE.
What do you think?
#CAPTAIN.
Heart or head. It is as if the soul wanted to fly off and turn into smoke.
#ALICE CHASE.
Have you any appetite?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, how about the supper?
#ALICE CHASE.
I'll ask Jenny.
#CAPTAIN.
Why, she's gone!
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, yes, yes!
#CAPTAIN.
Ring for Christine so that I can get some fresh water.
#ALICE CHASE.
I wonder - She doesn't hear.
#CAPTAIN.
Go and look - just think, if she should have left also!
#ALICE CHASE.
What is this? Her trunk is in the hallway - packed.
#CAPTAIN.
Then she has gone.
#ALICE CHASE.
This is hell!
#CAPTAIN.
And everything at once! And then Curt had to turn up just in time to get a look into this mess of ours! If there be any further humiliation in store, let it come this moment!
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you know what I suspect? Curt went away and will not come back.
#CAPTAIN.
I believe it of him.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, we are cursed -
#CAPTAIN.
What are you talking of?
#ALICE CHASE.
Don't you see how everybody shuns us?
#CAPTAIN.
I don't mind! There is the answer. Hush, I can hear it - Nobody can spare the time. Evasions! The rabble!
#ALICE CHASE.
That's what you get because you have despised your physicians - and failed to pay them.
#CAPTAIN.
That is not so!
#ALICE CHASE.
Even when you could, you didn't care to pay their bills because you looked down upon their work, just as you have looked down upon mine and everybody else's. They don't want to come. And the telephone is cut off because you didn't think that good for anything either. Nothing is good for anything but your rifles and guns!
#CAPTAIN.
Don't stand there and talk nonsense -
#ALICE CHASE.
Everything comes back.
#CAPTAIN.
What sort of superstition is that? Talk for old women!
#ALICE CHASE.
You will see! Do you know that we owe Christine six months' wages?
#CAPTAIN.
Well, she has stolen that much.
#ALICE CHASE.
But I have also had to borrow money from her.
#CAPTAIN.
I think you capable of it.
#ALICE CHASE.
What an ingrate you are! You know I borrowed that money for the children to get into the city.
#CAPTAIN.
Curt had a fine way of coming back! A rascal, that one, too! And a coward! He didn't dare to say he had had enough, and that he found the doctor's party more pleasant - He's the same rapscallion as ever!
#CURT.
Well, my dear Edgar, this is how the matter stands - the doctor knows everything about your heart -
#CAPTAIN.
My heart?
#CURT.
You have long been suffering from calcification of the heart -
#CAPTAIN.
Stone heart?
#CURT.
And -
#CAPTAIN.
Is it serious?
#CURT.
Well, that is to say -
#CAPTAIN.
It is serious.
#CURT.
Yes.
#CAPTAIN.
Fatal?
#CURT.
You must be very careful. First of all: the cigar must go. And next: no more whiskey! Then, to bed!
#CAPTAIN.
No, I don't want that! Not to bed! That's the end! Then you never get up again. I shall sleep on the couch to - night. What more did he say?
#CURT.
He was very nice about it and will come at once if you call him.
#CAPTAIN.
Was he nice, the hypocrite? I don't want to see him! I can at least eat?
#CURT.
Not to - night. And during the next few days nothing but milk.
#CAPTAIN.
Milk! I cannot take that stuff into my mouth.
#CURT.
Better learn how!
#CAPTAIN.
I am too old to learn. Oh, there it is again now!
#ALICE CHASE.
What did the doctor tell you?
#CURT.
That he may die.
#ALICE CHASE.
Thank God!
#CURT.
Take care, Alice, take care! And now, go and get a pillow and a blanket and I'll put him here on the couch. Then I'll sit on the chair here all night.
#ALICE CHASE.
And I?
#CURT.
You go to bed. Your presence seems only to make him worse.
#ALICE CHASE.
Command! I shall obey, for you seem to mean well toward both of us.
#CURT.
Mark you - toward both of you! And I shall not mix in any partisan squabbles.
#CAPTAIN.
So, they have left me, the rascals! Who is it? What do you want?
#OLD WOMAN.
I just wanted to close the door, sir.
#CAPTAIN.
Why should you? Why should you?
#OLD WOMAN.
Because it blew open just as I passed by.
#CAPTAIN.
Wanted to steal, did you?
#OLD WOMAN.
Not much here to take away, Christine said.
#CAPTAIN.
Christine?
#OLD WOMAN.
Good night, sir, and sleep well!
#CAPTAIN.
Who was that at the door? Anybody?
#ALICE CHASE.
Why, it was old Mary from the poorhouse who just went by.
#CAPTAIN.
Are you sure?
#ALICE CHASE.
Are you afraid?
#CAPTAIN.
I, afraid? Oh, no!
#ALICE CHASE.
As you don't want to go to bed, you can lie here.
#CAPTAIN.
I'll lie here.
#CAPTAIN.
Curt, don't go away from me!
#CURT.
I am going to stay up with you all night. Alice is going to bed.
#CAPTAIN.
Good night then, Alice.
#ALICE CHASE.
Good night, Curt.
#CURT.
Good night.
#CURT.
Don't you want to take off your boots?
#CAPTAIN.
No, a warrior should always be armed.
#CURT.
Are you expecting a battle then?
#CAPTAIN.
Perhaps! Curt, you are the only human being to whom I ever disclosed anything of myself. Listen to me! - If I die to - night - look after my children!
#CURT.
I will do so.
#CAPTAIN.
Thank you - I trust in you!
#CURT.
Can you explain why you trust me?
#CAPTAIN.
We have not been friends, for friendship is something I don't believe in, and our families were born enemies and have always been at war -
#CURT.
And yet you trust me?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, and I don't know why. Do you think I am going to die?
#CURT.
You as well as everybody. There will be no exception made in your case.
#CAPTAIN.
Are you bitter?
#CURT.
Yes - are you afraid of death? Of the wheelbarrow and the garden bed?
#CAPTAIN.
Think, if it were not the end!
#CURT.
That's what a great many think!
#CAPTAIN.
And then?
#CURT.
Nothing but surprises, I suppose.
#CAPTAIN.
But nothing at all is known with certainty?
#CURT.
No, that's just it! That is why you must be prepared for everything.
#CAPTAIN.
You are not childish enough to believe in a hell?
#CURT.
Do you not believe in it - you, who are right in it?
#CAPTAIN.
That is metaphorical only.
#CURT.
The realism with which you have described yours seems to preclude all thought of metaphors, poetical or otherwise.
#CAPTAIN.
If you only knew what pangs I suffer!
#CURT.
Of the body?
#CAPTAIN.
No, not of the body.
#CURT.
Then it must be of the spirit, for no other alternative exists.
#CAPTAIN.
I don't want to die!
#CURT.
Not long ago you wished for annihilation.
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, if it be painless.
#CURT.
Apparently it is not!
#CAPTAIN.
Is this annihilation then?
#CURT.
The beginning of it.
#CAPTAIN.
Good night.
#CURT.
Good night.
#ALICE CHASE.
Is he asleep?
#CURT.
Yes, since the time when the sun should have risen.
#ALICE CHASE.
What kind of night did he have?
#CURT.
He slept now and then, but he talked a good deal.
#ALICE CHASE.
Of what?
#CURT.
He argued about religion like a schoolboy, but with a pretension of having solved all the world riddles. Finally, toward morning, he invented the immortality of the soul.
#ALICE CHASE.
For his own glory.
#CURT.
Exactly! He is actually the most conceited person I have ever met. "I am; consequently God must be."
#ALICE CHASE.
You have become aware of it? Look at those boots. With those he would have trampled the earth flat, had he been allowed to do so. With those he has trampled down other people's fields and gardens. With those he has trampled on some people's toes and other people's heads - Man - eater, you have got your bullet at last!
#CURT.
He would be comical were he not so tragical; and there are traces of greatness in all his narrow - mindedness - Have you not a single good word to say about him?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, if he only does not hear it; for if he hears a single word of praise he develops megalomania on the spot.
#CURT.
He can hear nothing now, for he has had a dose of morphine.
#ALICE CHASE.
Born in a poor home, with many brothers and sisters, Edgar very early had to support the family by giving lessons, as the father was a ne'er - do - well if nothing worse. It must be hard for a young man to give up all the pleasures of youth in order to slave for a bunch of thankless children whom he has not brought into the world. I was a little girl when I saw him, as a young man, going without an overcoat in the winter while the mercury stood at fifteen below zero - his little sisters wore kersey coats - it was fine, and I admired him, but his ugliness repelled me. Is he not unusually ugly?
#CURT.
Yes, and his ugliness has a touch of the monstrous at times. Whenever we fell out, I noticed it particularly. And when, at such times, he went away, his image assumed enormous forms and proportions, and he literally haunted me.
#ALICE CHASE.
Think of me then! However, his earlier years as an officer were undoubtedly a martyrdom. But now and then he was helped by rich people. This he will never admit, and whatever has come to him in that way he has accepted as a due tribute, without giving thanks for it.
#CURT.
We were to speak well of him.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes - after he is dead. But then I recall nothing more.
#CURT.
Have you found him cruel?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes - and yet he can show himself both kind and susceptible to sentiment. As an enemy he is simply horrible.
#CURT.
Why did he not get the rank of major?
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, you ought to understand that! They didn't want to raise a man above themselves who had already proved himself a tyrant as an inferior. But you must never let on that you know this. He says himself that he did not want promotion - Did he speak of the children?
#CURT.
Yes, he was longing for Judith.
#ALICE CHASE.
I thought so - Oh! Do you know what Judith is? His own image, whom he has trained for use against me. Think only, that my own daughter - has raised her hand against me!
#CURT.
That is too much!
#ALICE CHASE.
Hush! He is moving - Think if he overheard us! He is full of trickery also.
#CURT.
He is actually waking up.
#ALICE CHASE.
Does he not look like an ogre? I am afraid of him!
#CAPTAIN.
It is morning - at last!
#CURT.
How are you feeling?
#CAPTAIN.
Not so very bad.
#CURT.
Do you want a doctor?
#CAPTAIN.
No - I want to see Judith - my child!
#CURT.
Would it not be wise to set your house in order before - or if something should happen?
#CAPTAIN.
What do you mean? What could happen?
#CURT.
What may happen to all of us.
#CAPTAIN.
Oh, nonsense! Don't you believe that I die so easily! And don't rejoice prematurely, Alice!
#CURT.
Think of your children. Make your will so that your wife at least may keep the household goods.
#CAPTAIN.
Is she going to inherit from me while I am still alive?
#CURT.
No, but if something happens she ought not to be turned into the street. One who has dusted and polished and looked after these things for twenty - five years should have some right to remain in possession of them. May I send word to the regimental lawyer?
#CAPTAIN.
No!
#CURT.
You are a cruel man - more cruel than I thought you!
#CAPTAIN.
Now it is back again!
#ALICE CHASE.
There are some people in the kitchen - I have to go down there.
#CURT.
Yes, go. Here is not much to be done.
#CAPTAIN.
Well, Curt, what are you going to do about your quarantine?
#CURT.
Oh, that will be all right.
#CAPTAIN.
No; I am in command on this island, so you will have to deal with me - don't forget that!
#CURT.
Have you ever seen a quarantine station?
#CAPTAIN.
Have I? Before you were born. And I'll give you a piece of advice: don't place your disinfection plant too close to the shore.
#CURT.
I was thinking that the nearer I could get to the water the better -
#CAPTAIN.
That shows how much you know of your business. Water, don't you see, is the element of the bacilli, their life element?
#CURT.
But the salt water of the sea is needed to wash away all the impurity.
#CAPTAIN.
Idiot! Well, now, when you get a house for yourself I suppose you'll bring home your children?
#CURT.
Do you think they will let themselves be brought?
#CAPTAIN.
Of course, if you have got any backbone! It would make a good impression on the people if you fulfilled your duties in that respect also -
#CURT.
I have always fulfilled my duties in that respect.
#CAPTAIN.
- in the one respect where you have proved yourself most remiss -
#CURT.
Have I not told you -
#CAPTAIN.
- for one does not desert one's children like that -
#CURT.
Go right on!
#CAPTAIN.
As your relative - a relative older than yourself - I feel entitled to tell you the truth, even if it should prove bitter - and you should not take it badly -
#CURT.
Are you hungry?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, I am.
#CURT.
Do you want something light?
#CAPTAIN.
No, something solid.
#CURT.
Then you would be done for.
#CAPTAIN.
Is it not enough to be sick, but one must starve also?
#CURT.
That's how the land lies.
#CAPTAIN.
And neither drink nor smoke? Then life is not worth much!
#CURT.
Death demands sacrifices, or it comes at once.
#ALICE CHASE.
These are for you.
#CAPTAIN.
For me! Will you please let me look?
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, they are only from the non - commissioned officers, the bandmen, and the gunners.
#CAPTAIN.
You are jealous.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, no. If it were laurel wreaths, that would be another matter - but those you can never get.
#CAPTAIN.
Hm! - Here's a telegram from the Colonel - read it, Curt. The Colonel is a gentleman after all - though he is something of an idiot. And this is from - what does it say? It is from Judith! Please telegraph her to come with the next boat. And here - yes, one is not quite without friends after all, and it is fine to see them take thought of a sick man, who is also a man of deserts above his rank, and a man free of fear or blemish.
#ALICE CHASE.
I don't quite understand - are they congratulating you because you are sick?
#CAPTAIN.
Hyena!
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, we had a doctor here on the island who was so hated that when he left they gave a banquet - after him, and not for him!
#CAPTAIN.
Put the flowers in water - I am not easily caught, and all people are a lot of rabble, but, by heavens, these simple tributes are genuine - they cannot be anything but genuine!
#ALICE CHASE.
Fool!
#CURT.
Judith says she cannot come because the steamer is held back by the storm.
#CAPTAIN.
Is that all?
#CURT.
No - o - there is a postscript.
#CAPTAIN.
Out with it!
#CURT.
Well, she asks her father not to drink so much.
#CAPTAIN.
Impudence! That's like children! That's my only beloved daughter - my Judith - my idol!
#ALICE CHASE.
And your image!
#CAPTAIN.
Such is life. Such are its best joys - Hell!
#ALICE CHASE.
Now you get the harvest of your sowing. You have set her against her own mother and now she turns against the father. Tell me, then, that there is no God!
#CAPTAIN.
What does the Colonel say?
#CURT.
He grants leave of absence without any comment.
#CAPTAIN.
Leave of absence? I have not asked for it.
#ALICE CHASE.
No, but I have asked for it.
#CAPTAIN.
I don't accept it.
#ALICE CHASE.
Order has already been issued.
#CAPTAIN.
That's none of my concern!
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you see, Curt, that for this man exist no laws, no constitutions, no prescribed human order? He stands above everything and everybody. The universe is created for his private use. The sun and the moon pursue their courses in order to spread his glory among the stars. Such is this man: this insignificant captain, who could not even reach the rank of major, and at whose strutting everybody laughs, while he thinks himself feared; this poor wretch who is afraid in the dark and believes in barometers: and all this in conjunction with and having for its climax - a barrowful of manure that is not even prime quality!
#CAPTAIN.
Have you asked Curt to breakfast?
#ALICE CHASE.
No.
#CAPTAIN.
Get us, then, at once two nice tenderloin steaks.
#ALICE CHASE.
Two?
#CAPTAIN.
I am going to have one myself.
#ALICE CHASE.
But we are three here.
#CAPTAIN.
Oh, you want one also? Well, make it three then.
#ALICE CHASE.
Where am I to get them? Last night you asked Curt to supper, and there was not a crust of bread in the house. Curt has been awake all night without anything to eat, and he has had no coffee because there is none in the house and the credit is gone.
#CAPTAIN.
She is angry at me for not dying yesterday.
#ALICE CHASE.
No, for not dying twenty - five years ago - for not dying before you were born!
#CAPTAIN.
Listen to her! That's what happens when you institute a marriage, my dear Curt. And it is perfectly clear that it was not instituted in heaven.
#CAPTAIN.
However, say what you will, now I am going on duty. If anybody calls for me, I am at the battery. Stand aside!
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, go! You always go, always show your back, whenever the fight becomes too much for you. And then you let your wife cover the retreat - you hero of the bottle, you arch - braggart, you arch - liar! Fie on you!
#CURT.
This is bottomless!
#ALICE CHASE.
And you don't know everything yet.
#CURT.
Is there anything more -
#ALICE CHASE.
But I am ashamed -
#CURT.
Where is he going now? And where does he get the strength?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, you may well ask! Now he goes down to the non - commissioned officers and thanks them for the flowers - and then he eats and drinks with them. And then he speaks ill of all the other officers - If you only knew how many times he has been threatened with discharge! Nothing but sympathy for his family has saved him. And this he takes for fear of his superiority. And he hates and maligns the very women - wives of other officers - who have been pleading our cause.
#CURT.
I have to confess that I applied for this position in order to find peace by the sea - and of your circumstances I knew nothing at all.
#ALICE CHASE.
Poor Curt! And how will you get something to eat?
#CURT.
Oh, I can go over to the doctor's - but you? Will you not permit me to arrange this for you?
#ALICE CHASE.
If only he does not learn of it, for then he would kill me.
#CURT.
Look, he stands right in the wind out there on the rampart.
#ALICE CHASE.
He is to be pitied - for being what he is!
#CURT.
Both of you are to be pitied! But what can be done?
#ALICE CHASE.
I don't know - The mail brought a batch of unpaid bills also, and those he did not see.
#CURT.
It may be fortunate to escape seeing things at times.
#ALICE CHASE.
He has unbuttoned his cloak and lets the wind strike his chest. Now he wants to die!
#CURT.
That is not what he wants, I think, for a while ago, when he felt his life slipping away, he grabbed hold of mine and began to stir in my affairs as if he wanted to crawl into me and live my life.
#ALICE CHASE.
That is just his vampire nature - to interfere with other people's destinies, to suck interest out of other existences, to regulate and arrange the doings of others, since he can find no interest whatever in his own life. And remember, Curt, don't ever admit him into your family life, don't ever make him acquainted with your friends, for he will take them away from you and make them his own. He is a perfect magician in this respect. Were he to meet your children, you would soon find them intimate with him, and he would be advising them and educating them to suit himself - but principally in opposition to your wishes.
#CURT.
Alice, was it not he who took my children away from me at the time of the divorce?
#ALICE CHASE.
Since it is all over now - yes, it was he.
#CURT.
I have suspected it, but never had any certainty. It was he!
#ALICE CHASE.
When you placed your full trust in my husband and sent him to make peace between yourself and your wife, he made love to her instead, and taught her the trick that gave her the children.
#CURT.
Oh, God! God in heaven!
#ALICE CHASE.
There you have another side of him.
#CURT.
Do you know, last night - when he thought himself dying - then - he made me promise that I should look after his children!
#ALICE CHASE.
But you don't want to revenge yourself on my children?
#CURT.
Yes - by keeping my promise. I shall look after your children.
#ALICE CHASE.
You could take no worse revenge, for there is nothing he hates so much as generosity.
#CURT.
Then I may consider myself revenged - without any revenge.
#ALICE CHASE.
I love revenge as a form of justice, and I am yearning to see evil get its punishment.
#CURT.
You still remain at that point?
#ALICE CHASE.
There I shall always remain, and the day I forgave or loved an enemy I should be a hypocrite.
#CURT.
It may be a duty not to say everything, Alice, not to see everything. It is called forbearance, and all of us need it.
#ALICE CHASE.
Not I! My life lies clear and open, and I have always played my cards straight.
#CURT.
That is saying a good deal.
#ALICE CHASE.
No, it is not saying enough. Because what I have suffered innocently for the sake of this man, whom I never loved -
#CURT.
Why did you marry?
#ALICE CHASE.
Who can tell? Because he took me, seduced me! I don't know. And then I was longing to get up on the heights -
#CURT.
And deserted your art?
#ALICE CHASE.
Which was despised! But you know, he cheated me! He held out hopes of a pleasant life, a handsome home - and there was nothing but debts; no gold except on the uniform - and even that was not real gold. He cheated me!
#CURT.
Wait a moment! When a young man falls in love, he sees the future in a hopeful light: that his hopes are not always realized, one must pardon. I have the same kind of deceit on my own conscience without thinking myself dishonest - What is it you see on the rampart?
#ALICE CHASE.
I want to see if he has fallen down.
#CURT.
Has he?
#ALICE CHASE.
No - worse luck! He is cheating me all the time.
#CURT.
Then I shall call on the doctor and the lawyer.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, dear Curt, go. I shall sit here and wait. And I have learned how to wait!
#CURT.
Good day, Alice.
#ALICE CHASE.
Good day, Curt. Sit down.
#CURT.
The steamer is just coming in.
#ALICE CHASE.
Then I know what's in store, for he is on board.
#CURT.
Yes, he is, for I caught the glitter of his helmet - What has he been doing in the city?
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, I can figure it out. He dressed for parade, which means that he saw the Colonel, and he put on white gloves, which means that he made some calls.
#CURT.
Did you notice his quiet manner yesterday? Since he has quit drinking and become temperate, he is another man: calm, reserved, considerate -
#ALICE CHASE.
I know it, and if that man had always kept sober he would have been a menace to humanity. It is perhaps fortunate for the rest of mankind that he made himself ridiculous and harmless through his whiskey.
#CURT.
The spirit in the bottle has chastised him - But have you noticed since death put its mark on him that he has developed a dignity which elevates? And is it not possible that with this new idea of immortality may have come a new outlook upon life?
#ALICE CHASE.
You are deceiving yourself. He is conjuring up something evil. And don't you believe what he says, for he lies with premeditation, and he knows the art of intriguing as no one else -
#CURT.
Why, Alice, what does this mean? Your hair has turned gray in these two nights!
#ALICE CHASE.
No, my friend, it has long been gray, and I have simply neglected to darken it since my husband is as good as dead. Twenty - five years in prison - do you know that this place served as a prison in the old days?
#CURT.
Prison - well, the walls show it.
#ALICE CHASE.
And my complexion! Even the children took on prison color in here.
#CURT.
I find it hard to imagine children prattling within these walls.
#ALICE CHASE.
There was not much prattling done either. And those two that died perished merely from lack of light.
#CURT.
What do you think is coming next?
#ALICE CHASE.
The decisive blow at us two. I caught a familiar glimmer in his eye when you read out that telegram from Judith. It ought, of course, to have been directed against her, but she, you know, is inviolate, and so his hatred sought you.
#CURT.
What are his intentions in regard to me, do you think?
#ALICE CHASE.
Hard to tell, but he possesses a marvellous skill in nosing out other people's secrets - and did you notice how, all day yesterday, he seemed to be living in your quarantine; how he drank a life - interest out of your existence; how he ate your children alive? A cannibal, I tell you - for I know him. His own life is going, or has gone -
#CURT.
I also have that impression of his being already on the other side. His face seems to phosphoresce, as if he were in a state of decay - and his eyes flash like will - o' - the - wisps over graves or morasses - Here he comes! Tell him you thought it possible he might be jealous.
#ALICE CHASE.
No, he is too self - conceited. "Show me the man of whom I need to be jealous!" Those are his own words.
#CURT.
So much the better, for even his faults carry with them a certain merit - Shall I get up and meet him anyhow?
#ALICE CHASE.
No, be impolite, or he will think you false. And if he begins to lie, pretend to believe him. I know perfectly how to translate his lies, and get always at the truth with the help of my dictionary. I foresee something dreadful - but, Curt, don't lose your self - control! My own advantage in our long struggle has been that I was always sober, and for that reason in full control of myself. He was always tripped by his whiskey - Now we shall see!
#CAPTAIN.
Good day. Pardon me for sitting down like this, but I feel a little tired. and CURT. Good day. Welcome home.
#ALICE CHASE.
How are you feeling?
#CAPTAIN.
Splendid! Only a little tired -
#ALICE CHASE.
What news from the city?
#CAPTAIN.
Oh, a little of everything. I saw the doctor, among other things, and he said it was nothing at all - that I might live twenty years, if I took care of myself.
#ALICE CHASE.
Now he is lying. Why, that's fine, my dear.
#CAPTAIN.
So much for that.
#ALICE CHASE.
Don't say a word, but let him begin - then he will show his cards.
#CAPTAIN.
Did you say anything?
#ALICE CHASE.
No, not a word.
#CAPTAIN.
Well, Curt!
#ALICE CHASE.
There - now he is coming out.
#CAPTAIN.
Well, I went to the city, as you know. Mm - mm, I picked up acquaintances - and among others - a young cadet in the artillery. As - we are in need of cadets right here, I arranged with the Colonel to let him come here. This ought to please you, especially when I inform you that - he is - your own son!
#ALICE CHASE.
The vampire - don't you see?
#CURT.
Under ordinary circumstances that ought to please a father, but in my case it will merely be painful.
#CAPTAIN.
I don't see why it should!
#CURT.
You don't need to - it is enough that I don't want it.
#CAPTAIN.
Oh, you think so? Well, then, you ought to know that the young man has been ordered to report here, and that from now on he has to obey me.
#CURT.
Then I shall force him to seek transfer to another regiment.
#CAPTAIN.
You cannot do it, as you have no rights over your son.
#CURT.
No?
#CAPTAIN.
No, for the court gave those rights to the mother.
#CURT.
Then I shall communicate with the mother.
#CAPTAIN.
You don't need to.
#CURT.
Don't need to?
#CAPTAIN.
No, for I have already done so. Yah!
#ALICE CHASE.
Now he must die!
#CURT.
Why, he is a cannibal!
#CAPTAIN.
So much for that! Did you say anything?
#ALICE CHASE.
No - have you grown hard of hearing?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, a little - but if you come nearer to me I can tell you something between ourselves.
#ALICE CHASE.
That is not necessary - and a witness is sometimes good to have for both parties.
#CAPTAIN.
You are right; witnesses are sometimes good to have! But, first of all, did you get that will?
#ALICE CHASE.
The regimental lawyer drew it up himself.
#CAPTAIN.
In your favor - good! So much for that! Yah!
#ALICE CHASE.
Did you ever see such a man?
#CURT.
That is no man!
#CAPTAIN.
Well, Alice, this was what I wanted to say -
#ALICE CHASE.
Go on, please.
#CAPTAIN.
On account of your long cherished desire to quit this miserable existence in an unhappy marriage; on account of the lack of feeling with which you have treated your husband and children, and on account of the carelessness you have shown in the handling of our domestic economy, I have, during this trip to the city, filed an application for divorce in the City Court.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh - and your grounds?
#CAPTAIN.
Besides the grounds already mentioned, I have others of a purely personal nature. As it has been found that I may live another twenty years, I am contemplating a change from this unhappy marital union to one that suits me better, and I mean to join my fate to that of some woman capable of devotion to her husband, and who also may bring into the home not only youth, but - let us say - a little beauty!
#ALICE CHASE.
You are welcome!
#CAPTAIN.
She throws away the ring. The witness will please take notice.
#ALICE CHASE.
And you intend to turn me out in order to put another woman into my home?
#CAPTAIN.
Yah!
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, then, we'll speak plain language! Cousin Curt, that man is guilty of an attempt to murder his wife.
#CURT.
An attempt to murder?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, he pushed me into the water.
#CAPTAIN.
Without witnesses!
#ALICE CHASE.
He lies again - Judith saw it!
#CAPTAIN.
Well, what of it?
#ALICE CHASE.
She can testify to it.
#CAPTAIN.
No, she cannot, for she says that she didn't see anything.
#ALICE CHASE.
You have taught the child to lie!
#CAPTAIN.
I didn't need to, for you had taught her already.
#ALICE CHASE.
You have met Judith?
#CAPTAIN.
Yah!
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
#CAPTAIN.
The fortress has surrendered. The enemy will be permitted to depart in safety on ten minutes' notice. Ten minutes - watch on the table!
#ALICE CHASE.
What is it?
#CAPTAIN.
I don't know.
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you want anything - a drink?
#CAPTAIN.
Whiskey? No, I don't want to die - You! Don't touch me! Ten minutes, or the garrison will be massacred. Ten minutes!
#CURT.
What kind of man is this?
#ALICE CHASE.
He is a demon, and no man!
#CURT.
What does he want with my son?
#ALICE CHASE.
He wants him as hostage in order to be your master - he wants to isolate you from the authorities of the island - Do you know that the people around here have named this island "Little Hell"?
#CURT.
I didn't know that - Alice, you are the first woman who ever inspired me with compassion - all others have seemed to me to deserve their fate.
#ALICE CHASE.
Don't desert me now! Don't leave me, for he will beat me - he has been doing so all these twenty - five years - in the presence of the children - and he has pushed me into the water -
#CURT.
Having heard this, I place myself absolutely against him. I came here without an angry thought, without memory of his former slanders and attempts to humiliate me. I forgave him even when you told me that he was the man who had parted me from my children - for he was ill and dying - but now, when he wants to steal my son, he must die - he or I!
#ALICE CHASE.
Good! No surrender of the fortress! But blow it up instead, with him in it, even if we have to keep him company! I am in charge of the powder!
#CURT.
There was no malice in me when I came here, and I wanted to run away when I felt myself infected with your hatred, but now I am moved by an irresistible impulse to hate this man, as I hate everything that is evil. What can be done?
#ALICE CHASE.
I have learned the tactics from him. Drum up his enemies and seek allies.
#CURT.
Just think - that he should get hold of my wife! Why didn't those two meet a life - time ago? Then there would have been a battle - royal that had set the earth quaking.
#ALICE CHASE.
But now these souls have spied each other - and yet they must part. I guess what is his most vulnerable spot - I have long suspected it -
#CURT.
Who is his most faithful enemy on the island?
#ALICE CHASE.
The Quartermaster.
#CURT.
Is he an honest man?
#ALICE CHASE.
He is. And he knows what I - I know too - he knows what the Sergeant - Major and the Captain have been up to.
#CURT.
What they have been up to? You don't mean -
#ALICE CHASE.
Defalcations!
#CURT.
This is terrible! No, I don't want to have any finger in that mess!
#ALICE CHASE.
Ha - ha! You cannot hit an enemy.
#CURT.
Formerly I could, but I can do so no longer.
#ALICE CHASE.
Why?
#CURT.
Because I have discovered - that justice is done anyhow.
#ALICE CHASE.
And you could wait for that? Then your son would already have been taken away from you. Look at my gray hairs - just feel how thick it still is, for that matter - He intends to marry again, and then I shall be free - to do the same - I am free! And in ten minutes he will be under arrest down below, right under us - right under us - and I shall dance above his head - I shall dance "The Entry of the Boyars" - ha - ha - ha - ha! And I shall play on the piano so that he can hear it. Oh, the tower is opening its gates, and the sentry with the drawn sabre will no longer be guarding me, but him - Malrough s'en va - t - en guerre! Him, him, him, the sentry is going to guard!
#CURT.
Alice, are you, too, a devil?
#ALICE CHASE.
These we will take along when we depart - the laurels of triumph! And fluttering ribbons! A little dusty, but eternally green - like my youth - I am not old, Curt?
#CURT.
With shining eyes] You are a devil!
#ALICE CHASE.
In "Little Hell" - Listen! Now I shall fix my hair - , dress in two minutes - go to the Quartermaster in two minutes - and then, up in the air with the fortress!
#CURT.
You are a devil!
#ALICE CHASE.
That's what you always used to say when we were children. Do you remember when we were small and became engaged to each other? Ha - ha! You were bashful, of course -
#CURT.
Alice!
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, you were! And it was becoming to you. Do you know there are gross women who like modest men? And there are said to be modest men who like gross women - You liked me a little bit, didn't you?
#CURT.
I don't know where I am!
#ALICE CHASE.
With an actress whose manners are free, but who is an excellent lady otherwise. Yes! But now I am free, free, free! Turn away and I'll change my waist!
#ALICE CHASE.
It looks like Christmas Eve here.
#CURT.
Well?
#ALICE CHASE.
Thank me! Six witnesses, and four of them solid as rock. The report has been made, and the answer will come here by telegraph - right here, into the heart of the fortress.
#CURT.
So!
#ALICE CHASE.
You should say "thanks" instead of "so."
#CURT.
Why has he lit so many candles?
#ALICE CHASE.
Because he is afraid of the dark, of course. Look at the telegraph key - does it not look like the handle of a coffee mill? I grind, I grind, and the beans crack as when you pull teeth -
#CURT.
What has he been doing in the room here?
#ALICE CHASE.
It looks as if he intended to move. Down below, that's where you are going to move!
#CURT.
Don't, Alice - I think it's distressing! He was the friend of my youth, and he showed me kindness many times when I was in difficulty - He should be pitied!
#ALICE CHASE.
And how about me, who have done nothing wrong, and who have had to sacrifice my career to that monster?
#CURT.
How about that career? Was it so very brilliant?
#ALICE CHASE.
What are you saying? Do you know who I am, what I have been?
#CURT.
Now, now!
#ALICE CHASE.
Are you beginning already?
#CURT.
Already?
#ALICE CHASE.
You bite me!
#CURT.
Yes, I want to bite your throat and suck your blood like a lynx. You have aroused the wild beast in me - that beast which I have tried for years to kill by privations and self - inflicted tortures. I came here believing myself a little better than you two, and now I am the vilest of all. Since I first saw you - in all your odious nakedness - and since my vision became warped by passion, I have known the full strength of evil. What is ugly becomes beautiful; what is good becomes ugly and mean - Come here and I'll choke you - with a kiss!
#ALICE CHASE.
Behold the mark of the shackles that you have broken. I was a slave, and you set me free.
#CURT.
But I am going to bind you -
#ALICE CHASE.
You?
#CURT.
I!
#ALICE CHASE.
For a moment I thought you were -
#CURT.
Pious?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, you prated about the fall of man -
#CURT.
Did I?
#ALICE CHASE.
And I thought you had come here to preach -
#CURT.
You thought so? In an hour we shall be in the city, and then you shall see what I am -
#ALICE CHASE.
Then we will go to the theatre to - night, just to show ourselves. The shame will be his if I run away, don't you see!
#CURT.
I begin to understand that prison is not enough -
#ALICE CHASE.
No, it is not - there must be shame also. strange world! You commit a shameful act, and the shame falls on him.
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, if the world be so stupid -
#CURT.
It is as if these prison walls had absorbed all the corruption of the criminals, and it gets into you if you merely breathe this air. You were thinking of the theatre and the supper, I suppose. I was thinking of my son.
#ALICE CHASE.
Fogey!
#ALICE CHASE.
Tout beau!
#CURT.
Forgive me!
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes - on your knees! Down on your face! Kiss my foot! And don't you ever do it again! Get up!
#CURT.
Where have I landed? Where am I?
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, you know!
#CURT.
I believe almost -
#CAPTAIN.
Curt, may I have a talk with you - alone?
#ALICE CHASE.
Is it about that departure in safety?
#CAPTAIN.
Curt, will you kindly sit down here by me a little while? And, Alice, will you please grant me a moment - of peace!
#ALICE CHASE.
What is up now? New signals! Please be seated. And listen to the words of age and wisdom - And if a telegram should come - tip me off!
#CAPTAIN.
Can you explain a fate like mine, like ours?
#CURT.
No more than I can explain my own!
#CAPTAIN.
What can be the meaning of this jumble?
#CURT.
In my better moments I have believed that just this was the meaning - that we should not be able to catch a meaning, and yet submit -
#CAPTAIN.
Submit? Without a fixed point outside myself I cannot submit.
#CURT.
Quite right, but as a mathematician you should be able to seek that unknown point when several known ones are given -
#CAPTAIN.
I have sought it, and - I have not found it!
#CURT.
Then you have made some mistake in your calculations - do it all over again!
#CAPTAIN.
I should do it over again? Tell me, where did you get your resignation?
#CURT.
I have none left. Don't overestimate me.
#CAPTAIN.
As you may have noticed, my understanding of the art of living has been - elimination! That means: wipe out and pass on! Very early in life I made myself a bag into which I chucked my humiliations, and when it was full I dropped it into the sea. I don't think any man ever suffered so many humiliations as I have. But when I wiped them out and passed on they ceased to exist.
#CURT.
I have noticed that you have wrought both your life and your environment out of your poetical imagination.
#CAPTAIN.
How could I have lived otherwise? How could I have endured?
#CURT.
How are you doing?
#CAPTAIN.
Poorly. Then comes a moment when the faculty for what you call poetical imagination gives out. And then reality leaps forth in all its nakedness - It is frightful! Look here, my dear friend - forgive me! - When I was in the city and consulted the doctor he said that I was played out - and that I couldn't live much longer.
#CURT.
Was that what he said?
#CAPTAIN.
That's what he said!
#CURT.
So it was not true?
#CAPTAIN.
What? Oh - no, that was not true.
#CURT.
Was the rest of it not true either?
#CAPTAIN.
What do you mean?
#CURT.
That my son was ordered to report here as cadet?
#CAPTAIN.
I never heard of it.
#CURT.
Do you know - your ability to wipe out your own misdeeds is miraculous!
#CAPTAIN.
I don't understand what you are talking of.
#CURT.
Then you have come to the end!
#CAPTAIN.
Well, there is not much left!
#CURT.
Tell me, perhaps you never applied for that divorce which would bring your wife into disgrace?
#CAPTAIN.
Divorce? No, I have not heard of it. CURT, Will you admit, then, that you have been lying?
#CAPTAIN.
You employ such strong words, my friend. All of us need forbearance.
#CURT.
Oh, you have come to see that?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, I have come to see that - And for this reason, Curt, please forgive me! Forgive everything!
#CURT.
That was a manly word! But I have nothing to forgive you. And I am not the man you believe me to be. No longer now! Least of all one worthy of receiving your confessions!
#CAPTAIN.
Life seemed so peculiar - so contrary, so malignant - ever since my childhood - and people seemed so bad that I grew bad also -
#CURT.
Is it possible to close off an instrument like that?
#CAPTAIN.
Hardly.
#CURT.
Who is Sergeant - Major Östberg?
#CAPTAIN.
An honest fellow, but something of a busybody, I should say.
#CURT.
And who is the Quartermaster?
#CAPTAIN.
He is my enemy, of course, but I have nothing bad to say of him.
#CURT.
What are they doing with the lantern out on the battery?
#CAPTAIN.
Do you see a lantern?
#CURT.
Yes, and people moving about.
#CAPTAIN.
I suppose it is what we call a service squad.
#CURT.
What is that? few men and a corporal. Probably some poor wretch that has to be locked up.
#CURT.
Oh!
#CAPTAIN.
Now, when you know Alice, how do you like her?
#CURT.
I cannot tell - I have no understanding of people at all. She is as inexplicable to me as you are, or as I am myself. For I am reaching the age when wisdom makes this acknowledgment: I know nothing, I understand nothing; But when I observe an action, I like to get at the motive behind it. Why did you push her into the water?
#CAPTAIN.
I don't know. It merely seemed quite natural to me, as she was standing on the pier, that she ought to be in the water.
#CURT.
Have you ever regretted it?
#CAPTAIN.
Never!
#CURT.
That's strange!
#CAPTAIN.
Of course, it is! So strange that I cannot realise that I am the man who has been guilty of such a mean act.
#CURT.
Have you not expected her to take some revenge?
#CAPTAIN.
Well, she seems to have taken it in full measure; and that, too, seems no less natural to me.
#CURT.
What has so suddenly brought you to this cynical resignation?
#CAPTAIN.
Since I looked death in the face, life has presented itself from a different viewpoint. Tell me, if you were to judge between Alice and myself, whom would you place in the right?
#CURT.
Neither of you. But to both of you I should give endless compassion - perhaps a little more of it to you!
#CAPTAIN.
Give me your hand, Curt!
#CURT.
Old boy!
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, how harmonious! Oh, friendship! Has there been no telegram yet?
#CURT.
No.
#ALICE CHASE.
This delay makes me impatient, and when I grow impatient I push matters along - Look, Curt, how I give him the final bullet. And now he'll bite the grass! First, I load - I know all about rifle practice, the famous rifle practice of which less than 5,000 copies were sold - and then I aim - fire! How is your new wife? The young, beautiful, unknown one? You don't know! But I know how my lover is doing. He is well, although still a little bashful! You wretch, whom I have never loved - you, who were too conceited to be jealous - you never saw how I was leading you by the nose!
#ALICE CHASE.
Help! Help!
#CAPTAIN.
Judith, avenge me!
#ALICE CHASE.
Hooray! He's dead!
#CAPTAIN.
Not yet! Judith! Judith!
#ALICE CHASE.
Now I go - with you!
#CURT.
Go back to the hell whence you came! Good - bye for ever!
#CAPTAIN.
Don't leave me Curt; she will kill me!
#ALICE CHASE.
Don't desert me, Curt - don't desert us!
#CURT.
Good - bye!
#ALICE CHASE.
The wretch! That's a friend for you!
#CAPTAIN.
Forgive me, Alice, and come here - come quick!
#ALICE CHASE.
That's the worst rascal and hypocrite I have met in my life! Do you know, you are a man after all!
#CAPTAIN.
Listen, Alice! I cannot live much longer.
#ALICE CHASE.
Is that so?
#CAPTAIN.
The doctor has said so.
#ALICE CHASE.
Then there was no truth in the rest either?
#CAPTAIN.
No.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, what have I done!
#CAPTAIN.
There is help for everything.
#ALICE CHASE.
No, this is beyond helping!
#CAPTAIN.
Nothing is beyond helping, if you only wipe it out and pass on.
#ALICE CHASE.
But the telegram - the telegram!
#CAPTAIN.
Which telegram?
#ALICE CHASE.
Are we then cast out? Must this happen? I have sprung a mine under myself, under us. Why did you have to tell untruths? And why should that man come here to tempt me? We are lost! Your magnanimity might have helped everything, forgiven everything!
#CAPTAIN.
What is it that cannot be forgiven? What is it that I have not already forgiven you?
#ALICE CHASE.
You are right - but there is no help for this.
#CAPTAIN.
I cannot guess it, although I know your ingenuity when it comes to villanies -
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, if I could only get out of this, I should care for you - I should love you, Edgar!
#CAPTAIN.
Listen to me! Where do I stand?
#ALICE CHASE.
Don't you think anybody can help us - well, no man can!
#CAPTAIN.
Who could then help?
#ALICE CHASE.
I don't know - Think of it, what is to become of the children with their name dishonoured -
#CAPTAIN.
Have you dishonoured that name?
#ALICE CHASE.
Not I! Not I! And then they must leave school! And as they go out into the world, they will be lonely as we, and cruel as we - Then you didn't meet Judith either, I understand now?
#CAPTAIN.
No, but wipe it out!
#ALICE CHASE.
Now ruin is overtaking us! Don't listen!
#CAPTAIN.
I am not going to listen, dear child - just calm yourself!
#ALICE CHASE.
Don't listen! Don't listen!
#CAPTAIN.
Lisa, child, I am stopping up my ears.
#ALICE CHASE.
God, help us! The squad is coming - God in heaven!
#ALICE CHASE.
That is over now! It was nothing!
#CAPTAIN.
What kind of secrets are these?
#ALICE CHASE.
Don't ask! It is over now! you please, child.
#ALICE CHASE.
You would not have spoken like that three days ago - what has done it?
#CAPTAIN.
Well, dear, when I fell down that first time, I went a little way on the other side of the grave. What I saw has been forgotten, but the impression of it still remains.
#ALICE CHASE.
And it was? hope - for something better!
#ALICE CHASE.
Something better?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes. That this could be the real life, I have, in fact, never believed: it is death - or something still worse!
#ALICE CHASE.
And we -
#CAPTAIN.
Have probably been set to torment each other - so it seems at least!
#ALICE CHASE.
Have we tormented each other enough?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, I think so! And upset things! Suppose we put things to rights? And clean house?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, if it can be done.
#CAPTAIN.
It can't be done in one day - no, it can't!
#ALICE CHASE.
In two, then! Many days!
#CAPTAIN.
Let us hope so! So you didn't get free this time after all! But then, you didn't get me locked up either! Yes, I know you wanted to put me in prison, but I wipe it out. I suppose you have done worse than that - And I was innocent of those defalcations.
#ALICE CHASE.
And now you intend me to become your nurse?
#CAPTAIN.
If you are willing!
#ALICE CHASE.
What else could I do?
#CAPTAIN.
I don't know!
#ALICE CHASE.
These are the eternal torments! Is there, then, no end to them?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, if we are patient. Perhaps life begins when death comes.
#ALICE CHASE.
If it were so!
#CAPTAIN.
You think Curt a hypocrite?
#ALICE CHASE.
Of course I do!
#CAPTAIN.
And I don't! But all who come near us turn evil and go their way. Curt was weak, and the evil is strong! How commonplace life has become! Formerly blows were struck; now you shake your fist at the most! I am fairly certain that, three months from now, we shall celebrate our silver wedding - with Curt as best man - and with the Doctor and Gerda among the guests. The Quartermaster will make the speech and the Sergeant - Major will lead the cheering. And if I know the Colonel right, he will come on his own invitation - Yes, you may laugh! But do you recall the silver wedding of Adolph - in the Fusiliers? The bride had to carry her wedding ring on the right hand, because the groom in a tender moment had chopped off her left ring finger with his dirk. Are you crying? No, I believe you are laughing! Yes, child, partly we weep and partly we laugh. Which is the right thing to do? - Don't ask me! The other day I read in a newspaper that a man had been divorced seven times - which means that he had been married seven times - and finally, at the age of ninety - eight, he ran away with his first wife and married her again. Such is love! If life be serious, or merely a joke, is more than I can decide. Often it is most painful when a joke, and its seriousness is after all more agreeable and peaceful. But when at last you try to be serious, somebody comes and plays a joke on you - as Curt, for instance! Do you want a silver wedding? Oh, say yes! They will laugh at us, but what does it matter? We may laugh also, or keep serious, as the occasion may require.
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, all right!
#CAPTAIN.
Silver wedding, then! Wipe out and pass on! Therefore, let us pass on!
#JUDITH.
Why don't you come and play tennis?
#ALLAN.
I am very busy -
#JUDITH.
Didn't you see that I had made my bicycle point toward the oak, and not away from it?
#ALLAN.
Yes, I saw it.
#JUDITH.
Well, what does it mean?
#ALLAN.
It means - that you want me to come and play tennis - but my duty - I have some problems to work out - and your father is a rather exacting teacher -
#JUDITH.
Do you like him?
#ALLAN.
Yes, I do. He takes such interest in all his pupils -
#JUDITH.
He takes an interest in everything and everybody. Won't you come?
#ALLAN.
You know I should like to - but I must not!
#JUDITH.
I'll ask papa to give you leave.
#ALLAN.
Don't do that. It will only cause talk.
#JUDITH.
Don't you think I can manage him? He wants what I want.
#ALLAN.
I suppose that is because you are so hard.
#JUDITH.
You should be hard also.
#ALLAN.
I don't belong to the wolf family.
#JUDITH.
Then you are a sheep.
#ALLAN.
Rather that.
#JUDITH.
Tell me why you don't want to come and play tennis?
#ALLAN.
You know it.
#JUDITH.
Tell me anyhow. The Lieutenant -
#ALLAN.
Yes, you don't care for me at all, but you cannot enjoy yourself with the Lieutenant unless I am present, so you can see me suffer.
#JUDITH.
Am I as cruel as that? I didn't know it.
#ALLAN.
Well, now you know it.
#JUDITH.
Then I shall do better hereafter, for I don't want to be cruel, I don't want to be bad - in your eyes.
#ALLAN.
You say this only to fasten your hold on me. I am already your slave, but it does not satisfy you. The slave must be tortured and thrown to the wild beasts. You have already that other fellow in your clutches - what do you want with me then? Let me go my own way, and you can go yours.
#JUDITH.
Do you send me away? Then I go! As second cousins, we shall have to meet now and then, but I am not going to bother you any longer.
#JUDITH.
Don't be afraid, I am going at once - I wanted only to see how the Master of Quarantine lives - White and gold - a Bechstein grand - well, well! We are still in the fort since papa was pensioned - in the tower where mamma has been kept twenty - five years - and we are there on sufferance at that. You - you are rich -
#ALLAN.
We are not rich.
#JUDITH.
So you say, but you are always wearing fine clothes - but whatever you wear, for that matter, is becoming to you. Do you hear what I say?
#ALLAN.
I do.
#JUDITH.
How can you hear when you keep on figuring, or whatever you are doing?
#ALLAN.
I don't use my eyes to listen with.
#JUDITH.
Your eyes - have you ever looked at them in the mirror?
#ALLAN.
Go away!
#JUDITH.
You despise me, do you?
#ALLAN.
Why, girl, I am not thinking of you at all.
#JUDITH.
Archimedes is deep in his figures when the soldier comes and cuts him down.
#ALLAN.
Don't touch my papers!
#JUDITH.
That's what Archimedes said also. Now you are thinking something foolish - you are thinking that I can not live without you -
#ALLAN.
Why can't you leave me alone?
#JUDITH.
Be courteous, and I'll help you with your examinations -
#ALLAN.
You?
#JUDITH.
Yes, I know the examiners -
#ALLAN.
And what of it?
#JUDITH.
Don't you know that one should stand well with the teachers?
#ALLAN.
Do you mean your father and the Lieutenant?
#JUDITH.
And the Colonel!
#ALLAN.
And then you mean that your protection would enable me to shirk my work?
#JUDITH.
You are a bad translator -
#ALLAN.
Of a bad original -
#JUDITH.
Be ashamed!
#ALLAN.
So I am - both on your behalf and my own! I am ashamed of having listened to you - Why don't you go?
#JUDITH.
Because I know you appreciate my company - Yes, you manage always to pass by my window. You have always some errand that brings you into the city with the same boat that I take. You cannot go for a sail without having me to look after the jib.
#ALLAN.
But a young girl shouldn't say that kind of things!
#JUDITH.
Do you mean to say that I am a child?
#ALLAN.
Sometimes you are a good child, and sometimes a bad woman. Me you seem to have picked to be your sheep.
#JUDITH.
You are a sheep, and that's why I am going to protect you.
#ALLAN.
The wolf makes a poor shepherd! You want to eat me - that is the secret of it, I suppose. You want to put your beautiful eyes in pawn to get possession of my head.
#JUDITH.
Oh, you have been looking at my eyes? I didn't expect that much courage of you.
#ALLAN.
Get out of my way, or -
#JUDITH.
Or?
#ALLAN.
If you were a boy - bah! But you are a girl.
#JUDITH.
And then?
#ALLAN.
If you had any pride at all, you would be gone, as you may regard yourself as shown the door.
#JUDITH.
I'll get back at you for that!
#ALLAN.
I don't doubt it!
#JUDITH.
I - shall - get - back - at you for that!
#CURT.
Where are you going, Allan?
#ALLAN.
Oh, is that you?
#CURT.
Who was it that left in such hurry - so that the bushes shook?
#ALLAN.
It was Judith.
#CURT.
She is a little impetuous, but a fine girl.
#ALLAN.
When a girl is cruel and rude, she is always said to be a fine girl.
#CURT.
Don't be so severe, Allan! Are you not satisfied with your new relatives?
#ALLAN.
I like Uncle Edgar -
#CURT.
Yes, he has many good sides. How about your other teachers - the Lieutenant, for instance?
#ALLAN.
He's so uncertain. Sometimes he seems to have a grudge against me.
#CURT.
Oh, no! You just go here and make people "seem" this or that. Don't brood, but look after your own affairs, do what is proper, and leave others to their own concerns.
#ALLAN.
So I do, but - they won't leave me alone. They pull you in - as the cuttlefish down at the landing - they don't bite, but they stir up vortices that suck -
#CURT.
You have some tendency to melancholia, I think. Don't you feel at home here with me? Is there anything you miss?
#ALLAN.
I have never been better off, but - there is something here that smothers me.
#CURT.
Here by the sea? Are you not fond of the sea?
#ALLAN.
Yes, the open sea. But along the shores you find eelgrass, cuttlefish, jellyfish, sea - nettles, or whatever they are called.
#CURT.
You shouldn't stay indoors so much. Go out and play tennis.
#ALLAN.
Oh, that's no fun!
#CURT.
You are angry with Judith, I guess?
#ALLAN.
Judith?
#CURT.
You are so exacting toward people - it is not wise, for then you become isolated.
#ALLAN.
I am not exacting, but - It feels as if I were lying at the bottom of a pile of wood and had to wait my turn to get into the fire - and it weighs on me - all that is above weighs me down.
#CURT.
Bide your turn. The pile grows smaller -
#ALLAN.
Yes, but so slowly, so slowly. And in the meantime I lie here and grow mouldy.
#CURT.
It is not pleasant to be young. And yet you young ones are envied.
#ALLAN.
Are we? Would you change?
#CURT.
No, thanks!
#ALLAN.
Do you know what is worse than anything else? It is to sit still and keep silent while the old ones talk nonsense - I know that I am better informed than they on some matters - and yet I must keep silent. Well, pardon me, I am not counting you among the old.
#CURT.
Why not?
#ALLAN.
Perhaps because we have only just now become acquainted -
#CURT.
And because - your ideas of me have undergone a change?
#ALLAN.
Yes.
#CURT.
During the years we were separated, I suppose you didn't always think of me in a friendly way?
#ALLAN.
No.
#CURT.
Did you ever see a picture of me?
#ALLAN.
One, and it was very unfavourable.
#CURT.
And old - looking?
#ALLAN.
Yes.
#CURT.
Ten years ago my hair turned gray in a single night - it has since then resumed its natural color without my doing anything for it - Let us talk of something else! There comes your aunt - my cousin. How do you like her?
#ALLAN.
I don't want to tell!
#CURT.
Then I shall not ask you.
#ALICE CHASE.
Good morning, Curt.
#CURT.
Leave us, please.
#ALICE CHASE.
He will be here in a moment, so you need not feel embarrassed.
#CURT.
And why should I?
#ALICE CHASE.
You, with your strictness -
#CURT.
Toward myself, yes -
#ALICE CHASE.
Of course - Once I forgot myself, when in you I saw the liberator, but you kept your self - control - and for that reason we have a right to forget - what has never been.
#CURT.
Forget it then!
#ALICE CHASE.
However - I don't think he has forgotten -
#CURT.
You are thinking of that night when his heart gave out and he fell on the floor - and when you rejoiced too quickly, thinking him already dead?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes. Since then he has recovered; but when he gave up drinking, he learned to keep silent, and now he is terrible. He is up to something that I cannot make out -
#CURT.
Your husband, Alice, is a harmless fool who has shown me all sorts of kindnesses -
#ALICE CHASE.
Beware of his kindnesses. I know them.
#CURT.
Well, well -
#ALICE CHASE.
He has then blinded you also? Can you not see the danger? Don't you notice the snares?
#CURT.
No.
#ALICE CHASE.
Then your ruin is certain.
#CURT.
Oh, mercy!
#ALICE CHASE.
Think only, I have to sit here and see disaster stalking you like a cat - I point at it, but you cannot see it.
#CURT.
Allan, with his unspoiled vision, cannot see it either. He sees nothing but Judith, for that matter, and this seems to me a safeguard of our good relationship.
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you know Judith? flirtatious little thing, with a braid down her back and rather too short skirts -
#ALICE CHASE.
Exactly! But the other day I saw her dressed up in long skirts - and then she was a young lady - and not so very young either, when her hair was put up.
#CURT.
She is somewhat precocious, I admit.
#ALICE CHASE.
And she is playing with Allan.
#CURT.
That's all right, so long as it remains play.
#ALICE CHASE.
So that is all right? - Now Edgar will be here soon, and he will take the easy - chair - he loves it with such passion that he could steal it.
#CURT.
Why, he can have it!
#ALICE CHASE.
Let him sit over there, and we'll stay here. And when he talks - he is always talkative in the morning - when he talks of insignificant things, I'll translate them for you -
#CURT.
Oh, my dear Alice, you are too deep, far too deep. What could I have to fear as long as I look after my quarantine properly and otherwise behave decently?
#ALICE CHASE.
You believe in justice and honour and all that sort of thing.
#CURT.
Yes, and it is what experience has taught me. Once I believed the very opposite - and paid dearly for it!
#ALICE CHASE.
Now he's coming!
#CURT.
I have never seen you so frightened before.
#ALICE CHASE.
My bravery was nothing but ignorance of the danger.
#CURT.
Danger? Soon you'll have me frightened too!
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, if I only could - There!
#ALICE CHASE.
Let him speak first.
#CAPTAIN.
This is a splendid chair you have here, dear Curt; perfectly splendid.
#CURT.
I'll give it to you, if you will accept it.
#CAPTAIN.
That was not what I meant -
#CURT.
But I mean it seriously. How much have I not received from you?
#CAPTAIN.
Oh, nonsense! And when I sit here, I can overlook the whole island, all the walks; I can see all the people on their verandahs, all the ships on the sea, that are coming in and going out. You have really happened on the best piece of this island, which is certainly not an island of the blessed. Or what do you say, Alice? Yes, they call it "Little Hell," and here Curt has built himself a paradise, but without an Eve, of course, for when she appeared, then the paradise came to an end. I say - do you know that this was a royal hunting lodge?
#CURT.
So I have heard.
#CAPTAIN.
You live royally, you, but, if I may say so myself, you have me to thank for it.
#ALICE CHASE.
There - now he wants to steal you.
#CURT.
I have to thank you for a good deal.
#CAPTAIN.
Fudge! Tell me, did you get the wine cases?
#CURT.
Yes.
#CAPTAIN.
And you are satisfied?
#CURT.
Quite satisfied, and you may tell your dealer so.
#CAPTAIN.
His goods are always prime quality -
#ALICE CHASE.
At second - rate prices, and you have to pay the difference.
#CAPTAIN.
What did you say, Alice? Nothing!
#CAPTAIN.
Well, when this quarantine station was about to be established, I had in mind applying for the position - and so I made a study of quarantine methods.
#ALICE CHASE.
Now he's lying!
#CAPTAIN.
And I did not share the antiquated ideas concerning disinfection which were then accepted by the government. For I placed myself on the side of the Neptunists - so called because they emphasise the use of water -
#CURT.
Beg your pardon, but I remember distinctly that it was I who preached water, and you fire, at that time. Nonsense!
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, I remember that, too.
#CAPTAIN.
You?
#CURT.
I remember it so much the better because -
#CAPTAIN.
Well, it's possible, but it does not matter. However - we have now reached a point where a new state of affairs - just a moment! - has begun to prevail - and when the methods of quarantining are about to become revolutionized.
#CURT.
By the by, do you know who is writing those stupid articles in that periodical?
#CAPTAIN.
No, I don't know, but why do you call them stupid?
#ALICE CHASE.
Look out! It is he who writes them.
#CURT.
He? - Not very well advised, at least.
#CAPTAIN.
Well, are you the man to judge of that?
#ALICE CHASE.
Are we going to have a quarrel?
#CURT.
Not at all.
#CAPTAIN.
It is hard to keep peace on this island, but we ought to set a good example -
#CURT.
Yes, can you explain this to me? When I came here I made friends with all the officials and became especially intimate with the regimental auditor - as intimate as men are likely to become at our age. And then, in a little while - it was shortly after your recovery - one after another began to grow cold toward me - and yesterday the auditor avoided me on the promenade. I cannot tell you how it hurt me! Have you noticed any ill - feeling toward yourself?
#CAPTAIN.
No, on the contrary.
#ALICE CHASE.
Don't you understand that he has been stealing your friends?
#CURT.
I wondered whether it might have anything to do with this new stock issue to which I refused to subscribe.
#CAPTAIN.
No, no - But can you tell me why you didn't subscribe?
#CURT.
Because I have already put my small savings into your soda factory. And also because a new issue means that the old stock is shaky.
#CAPTAIN.
That's a splendid lamp you have. Where did you get it?
#CURT.
In the city, of course.
#ALICE CHASE.
Look out for your lamp!
#CURT.
You must not think that I am ungrateful or distrustful, Edgar.
#CAPTAIN.
No, but it shows small confidence to withdraw from an undertaking which you have helped to start.
#CURT.
Why, ordinary prudence bids everybody save himself and what is his.
#CAPTAIN.
Save? Is there any danger then? Do you think anybody wants to rob you?
#CURT.
Why such sharp words?
#CAPTAIN.
Were you not satisfied when I helped you to place your money at six per cent.?
#CURT.
Yes, and even grateful.
#CAPTAIN.
You are not grateful - it is not in your nature, but this you cannot help.
#ALICE CHASE.
Listen to him!
#CURT.
My nature has shortcomings enough, and my struggle against them has not been very successful, but I do recognise obligations -
#CAPTAIN.
Show it then! Why, what is this? A death notice? The Health Commissioner is dead.
#ALICE CHASE.
Now he is speculating in the corpse -
#CAPTAIN.
This is going to bring about certain - changes -
#CURT.
In what respect?
#CAPTAIN.
That remains to be seen.
#ALICE CHASE.
Where are you going?
#CAPTAIN.
I think I'll have to go to the city - Oh, I hope you will pardon my absent - mindedness.
#CURT.
No harm done.
#CAPTAIN.
Why, that's Allan's drawing case. Where is the boy?
#CURT.
He is out playing with the girls.
#CAPTAIN.
That big boy? I don't like it. And Judith must not be running about like that. You had better keep an eye on your young gentleman, and I'll look after my young lady. Splendid tone in this instrument. A Steinbech, isn't it? Bechstein.
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, you are well fixed. Thank me for bringing you here.
#ALICE CHASE.
He lies, for he tried to keep you away.
#CAPTAIN.
Well, good - bye for a while. I am going to take the next boat.
#ALICE CHASE.
Well?
#CURT.
Well?
#ALICE CHASE.
I can't see through his plans yet. But - tell me one thing. This envelope he looked at - from whom is the letter?
#CURT.
I am sorry to admit - it was my one secret.
#ALICE CHASE.
And he ferreted it out. Can you see that he knows witchery, as I have told you before? Is there anything printed on the envelope?
#CURT.
Yes - "The Citizens' Union."
#ALICE CHASE.
Then he has guessed your secret. You want to get into the Riksdag, I suppose. And now you'll see that he goes there instead of you.
#CURT.
Has he ever thought of it?
#ALICE CHASE.
No, but he is thinking of it now. I read it on his face while he was looking at the envelope.
#CURT.
That's why he has to go to the city?
#ALICE CHASE.
No, he made up his mind to go when he read the death notice.
#CURT.
What has he to gain by the death of the Health Commissioner?
#ALICE CHASE.
Hard to tell! Perhaps the man was an enemy who had stood in the way of his plans.
#CURT.
If he be as terrible as you say, then there is reason to fear him.
#ALICE CHASE.
Didn't you hear how he wanted to steal you, to tie your hands by means of pretended obligations that do not exist? For instance, he has done nothing to get you this position, but has, on the contrary, tried to keep you out of it. He is a man - thief, an insect, one of those wood - borers that eat up your insides so that one day you find yourself as hollow as a dying pine tree. He hates you, although he is bound to you by the memory of your youthful friendship -
#CURT.
How keen - witted we are made by our hatreds!
#ALICE CHASE.
And stupid by our loves - blind and stupid!
#CURT.
Oh, no, don't say that!
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you know what is meant by a vampire? They say it is the soul of a dead person seeking a body in which it may live as a parasite. Edgar is dead - ever since he fell down on the floor that time. You see, he has no interests of his own, no personality, no initiative. But if he can only get hold of some other person he hangs on to him, sends down roots into him, and begins to flourish and blossom. Now he has fastened himself on you.
#CURT.
If he comes too close I'll shake him off.
#ALICE CHASE.
Try to shake off a burr! Listen: do you know why he does not want Judith and Allan to play?
#CURT.
I suppose he is concerned about their feelings.
#ALICE CHASE.
Not at all. He wants to marry Judith to - the Colonel!
#CURT.
That old widower!
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes.
#CURT.
Horrible! And Judith?
#ALICE CHASE.
If she could get the General, who is eighty, she would take him in order to bully the Colonel, who is sixty. To bully, you know, that's the aim of her life. To trample down and bully - there you have the motto of that family.
#CURT.
Can this be Judith? That maiden fair and proud and splendid?
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, I know all about that! May I sit here and write a letter?
#CURT.
With pleasure.
#ALICE CHASE.
Now we'll try our hand at the art of war. I failed once when I tried to slay my dragon. But now I have mastered the trade.
#CURT.
Do you know that it is necessary to load before you fire?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, and with ball cartridges at that!
#ALICE CHASE.
Allan!
#ALICE CHASE.
You should not be afraid of me, Allan - I am not dangerous to you - What is wrong? Are you sick?
#ALLAN.
Yes.
#ALICE CHASE.
In what way?
#ALLAN.
I don't know.
#ALICE CHASE.
Have you a headache?
#ALLAN.
No.
#ALICE CHASE.
And your chest? Pain?
#ALLAN.
Yes.
#ALICE CHASE.
Pain - pain - as if your heart wanted to melt away. And it pulls, pulls -
#ALLAN.
How do you know?
#ALICE CHASE.
And then you wish to die - that you were already dead - and everything seems so hard. And you can only think of one thing - always the same - but if two are thinking of the same thing, then sorrow falls heavily on one of them. That's the sickness which no one can cure. You cannot eat and you cannot drink; you want only to weep, and you weep so bitterly - especially out in the woods where nobody can see you, for at that kind of sorrow all men laugh - men who are so cruel! Dear me! What do you want of her? Nothing! You don't want to kiss her mouth, for you feel that you would die if you did. When your thoughts run to her, you feel as if death were approaching. And it is death, child - that sort of death - which brings life. But you don't understand it yet! I smell violets - it is herself. It is she, it is she everywhere, none but she! Oh, oh, oh! Poor boy! Poor boy! Oh, how it hurts, how it hurts! There, there! Cry - cry to your heart's content. There now! Then the heart grows lighter - But now, Allan, rise up and be a man, or she will not look at you - she, the cruel one, who is not cruel. Has she tormented you? With the Lieutenant? You must make friends with the Lieutenant, so that you two can talk of her. That gives a little ease also.
#ALLAN.
I don't want to see the Lieutenant!
#ALICE CHASE.
Now look here, little boy, it won't be long before the Lieutenant seeks you out in order to get a chance to talk of her. For - Well, shall I be nice and tell you? He is just as unhappy as you are.
#ALLAN.
No?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, indeed, and he needs somebody to whom he may unburden his heart when Judith has wounded him. You seem to rejoice in advance?
#ALLAN.
Does she not want the Lieutenant?
#ALICE CHASE.
She does not want you either, dear boy, for she wants the Colonel. Is it raining again? Well, the handkerchief you cannot have, for Judith is careful about her belongings and wants her dozen complete. Yes, my boy, such is Judith. Sit over there now, while I write another letter, and then you may do an errand for me.
#LIEUTENANT.
I say, Cadet - Please be seated.
#ALICE CHASE.
Please be seated.
#LIEUTENANT.
I beg your pardon, madam -
#ALICE CHASE.
Never mind! Please sit down and keep the Cadet company - he is feeling a little lonely here on the island.
#LIEUTENANT.
It is awfully hot.
#ALLAN.
Rather.
#LIEUTENANT.
Have you finished the sixth book yet?
#ALLAN.
I have just got to the last proposition.
#LIEUTENANT.
That's a tough one. Have you - played tennis to - day?
#ALLAN.
No - o - the sun was too hot.
#LIEUTENANT.
Yes, it's awfully hot to - day!
#ALLAN.
Yes, it is very hot.
#LIEUTENANT.
Have you - been out sailing to - day?
#ALLAN.
No - o, I couldn't get anybody to tend the jib.
#LIEUTENANT.
Could you - trust me sufficiently to let me tend the jib?
#ALLAN.
That would be too great an honor for me, Lieutenant.
#LIEUTENANT.
Not at all, not at all! Do you think - the wind might be good enough to - day - about dinner - time, say, for that's the only time I am free?
#ALLAN.
It always calms down about dinner - time, and - that's the time Miss Judith has her lesson.
#LIEUTENANT.
Oh, yes, yes! Hm! Do you think -
#ALICE CHASE.
Would one of you young gentlemen care to deliver a letter for me? - to Miss Judith? Both of you? Well, the more safely my errand will be attended to. If you please, Lieutenant, I should like to have that handkerchief. My daughter is very careful about her things - there is a touch of pettiness in her nature - Give me that handkerchief! I don't wish to laugh at you, but you must not make yourself ridiculous - needlessly. And the Colonel does not like to play the part of an Othello. Away with you now, young men, and try to hide your feelings as much as you can.
#ALICE CHASE.
Allan!
#ALLAN.
Yes, Aunt.
#ALICE CHASE.
Stay here, unless you want to inflict more suffering on yourself than you can bear.
#ALLAN.
But he is going!
#ALICE CHASE.
Let him burn himself. But take care of yourself.
#ALLAN.
I don't want to take care of myself.
#ALICE CHASE.
And then you cry afterward. And so I get the trouble of consoling you.
#ALLAN.
I want to go!
#ALICE CHASE.
Go then! But come back here, young madcap, and I'll have the right to laugh at you.
#CURT.
Alice, I have received an anonymous letter that is bothering me.
#ALICE CHASE.
Have you noticed that Edgar has become another person since he put off the uniform? I could never have believed that a coat might make such a difference.
#CURT.
You didn't answer my question.
#ALICE CHASE.
It was no question. It was a piece of information. What do you fear?
#CURT.
Everything!
#ALICE CHASE.
He went to the city. And his trips to the city are always followed by something dreadful.
#CURT.
But I can do nothing because I don't know from which quarter the attack will begin.
#ALICE CHASE.
We'll see whether I have guessed it.
#CURT.
Will you help me then?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes - but no further than my own interests permit. My own - that is my children's.
#CURT.
I understand that! Do you hear how silent everything is - here on land, out on the sea, everywhere?
#ALICE CHASE.
But behind the silence I hear voices - mutterings, cries!
#CURT.
Hush! I hear something, too - no, it was only the gulls.
#ALICE CHASE.
But I hear something else! And now I am going to the post - office - with this letter!
#JUDITH.
Can I borrow your wrench?
#ALLAN.
No, you cannot.
#JUDITH.
You are discourteous now, because you think I am running after you.
#ALLAN.
I am nothing at all, but I ask merely to be left alone.
#JUDITH.
Allan!
#ALLAN.
Yes, what is it?
#JUDITH.
You mustn't be angry with me!
#ALLAN.
I am not.
#JUDITH.
Will you give me your hand on that?
#ALLAN.
I don't want to shake hands with you, but I am not angry - What do you want with me anyhow?
#JUDITH.
Oh, but you're stupid!
#ALLAN.
Well, let it go at that.
#JUDITH.
You think me cruel, and nothing else.
#ALLAN.
No, for I know that you are kind too - you can be kind!
#JUDITH.
Well - how can I help - that you and the Lieutenant run around and weep in the woods? Tell me, why do you weep? Tell me now - I never weep. And why have you become such good friends? Of what do you talk while you are walking about arm in arm? Allan, you'll soon see what kind I am and whether I can strike a blow for one I like. And I want to give you a piece of advice - although I have no use for tale - bearing. Be prepared!
#ALLAN.
For what?
#JUDITH.
Trouble.
#ALLAN.
From what quarter?
#JUDITH.
From the quarter where you least expect it.
#ALLAN.
Well, I am rather used to disappointment, and life has not brought me much that was pleasant What's in store now?
#JUDITH.
You poor boy - give me your hand! Look at me! Don't you dare to look at me?
#LIEUTENANT.
I beg your pardon! I thought that -
#JUDITH.
Tell me, Lieutenant, will you be my friend and ally?
#LIEUTENANT.
If you'll do me the honour -
#JUDITH.
Yes - a word only - don't desert Allan when disaster overtakes him.
#LIEUTENANT.
What disaster?
#JUDITH.
You'll soon see - this very day perhaps. Do you like Allan?
#LIEUTENANT.
The young man is my best pupil, and I value him personally also on account of his strength of character - Yes, life has moments when strength is required to bear up, to endure, to suffer, in a word!
#JUDITH.
That was more than one word, I should say. However, you like Allan?
#LIEUTENANT.
Yes.
#JUDITH.
Look him up then, and keep him company.
#LIEUTENANT.
It was for that purpose I came here - for that and no other. I had no other object in my visit.
#JUDITH.
I had not supposed anything of that kind - of the kind you mean! Allan went that way.
#LIEUTENANT.
Yes - I'll do what you ask.
#JUDITH.
Do, please.
#ALICE CHASE.
What are you doing here?
#JUDITH.
I wanted to borrow a wrench.
#ALICE CHASE.
Will you listen to me a moment?
#JUDITH.
Of course, I will.
#JUDITH.
But tell me quickly what you want to say. I don't like long lectures.
#ALICE CHASE.
Lectures? Well, then - put up your hair and put on a long dress.
#JUDITH.
Why?
#ALICE CHASE.
Because you are no longer a child. And you are young enough to need no coquetry about your age.
#JUDITH.
What does that mean?
#ALICE CHASE.
That you have reached marriageable age. And your way of dressing is causing scandal.
#JUDITH.
Then I shall do what you say.
#ALICE CHASE.
You have understood then?
#JUDITH.
Oh, yes.
#ALICE CHASE.
And we are agreed?
#JUDITH.
Perfectly.
#ALICE CHASE.
On all points?
#JUDITH.
Even the tenderest!
#ALICE CHASE.
Will you at the same time cease playing - with Allan?
#JUDITH.
It is going to be serious then?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes.
#JUDITH.
Then we may just as well begin at once.
#ALICE CHASE.
It is not proper to make your toilet in a strange place.
#JUDITH.
Am I all right this way? Then I am ready. Come now who dares!
#ALICE CHASE.
Now at last you look decent. And leave Allan in peace after this.
#JUDITH.
I don't understand what you mean?
#ALICE CHASE.
Can't you see that he is suffering?
#JUDITH.
Yes, I think I have noticed it, but I don't know why. I don't suffer!
#ALICE CHASE.
That is your strength. But the day will come - oh, yes, you shall know what it means. Go home now, and don't forget - that you are wearing a long skirt.
#JUDITH.
Must you walk differently then?
#ALICE CHASE.
Just try.
#JUDITH.
Oh, my feet are tied; I am caught, I cannot run any longer!
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, child, now the walking begins, along the slow road toward the unknown, which you know already, but must pretend to ignore. Shorter steps, and much slower - much slower! The low shoes of childhood must go, Judith, and you have to wear boots. You don't remember when you laid aside baby socks and put on shoes, but I do!
#JUDITH.
I can never stand this!
#ALICE CHASE.
And yet you must - must!
#JUDITH.
Good - bye then!
#CURT.
So you're already here?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes.
#CURT.
Has he come back?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes.
#CURT.
How did he appear?
#ALICE CHASE.
In full dress - so he has called on the Colonel. And he wore two orders.
#CURT.
Two? I knew he was to receive the Order of the Sword on his retirement. But what can the other one be?
#ALICE CHASE.
I am not very familiar with those things, but there was a white cross within a red one.
#CURT.
It is a Portuguese order then. Let me see - tell me, didn't his articles in that periodical deal with quarantine stations in Portuguese harbours?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, as far as I can recall.
#CURT.
And he has never been in Portugal?
#ALICE CHASE.
Never.
#CURT.
But I have been there.
#ALICE CHASE.
You shouldn't be so communicative. His ears and his memory are so good.
#CURT.
Don't you think Judith may have helped him to this honour?
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, I declare! There are limits - and you have passed them.
#CURT.
Are we to quarrel now?
#ALICE CHASE.
That depends on you. Don't meddle with my interests.
#CURT.
If they cross my own, I have to meddle with them, although with a careful hand. Here he comes!
#ALICE CHASE.
And now it is going to happen.
#CURT.
What is - going to happen?
#ALICE CHASE.
We shall see!
#CURT.
Let it come to open attack then, for this state of siege is getting on my nerves. I have not a friend left on the island.
#ALICE CHASE.
Wait a minute! You sit on this side - he must have the easy - chair, of course - and then I can prompt you.
#CAPTAIN.
Good day! Here's the meeting place.
#ALICE CHASE.
You are tired - sit down. Make yourself comfortable.
#CAPTAIN.
This is all right. You're too kind.
#ALICE CHASE.
Be careful - he's suspicious of us.
#CAPTAIN.
What was that you said?
#ALICE CHASE.
He must have been drinking.
#CAPTAIN.
No - o, he has not. Well - how have you been amusing yourselves?
#ALICE CHASE.
And you?
#CAPTAIN.
Are you looking at my orders?
#ALICE CHASE.
No - o!
#CAPTAIN.
I guess not, because you are jealous - Other - wise it is customary to offer congratulations to the recipient of honours.
#ALICE CHASE.
We congratulate you.
#CAPTAIN.
We get things like these instead of laurel wreaths, such as they give to actresses.
#ALICE CHASE.
That's for the wreaths at home on the walls of the tower -
#CAPTAIN.
Which your brother gave you -
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, how you talk!
#CAPTAIN.
Before which I have had to bow down these twenty - five years - and which it has taken me twenty - five years to expose.
#ALICE CHASE.
You have seen my brother?
#CAPTAIN.
Rather! And you, Curt - you don't say anything, do you?
#CURT.
I am waiting.
#CAPTAIN.
Well, I suppose you know the big news?
#CURT.
No.
#CAPTAIN.
It is not exactly agreeable for me to be the one who -
#CURT.
Oh, speak up!
#CAPTAIN.
The soda factory has gone to the wall -
#CURT.
That's decidedly unpleasant! Where does that leave you?
#CAPTAIN.
I am all right, as I sold out in time.
#CURT.
That was sensible.
#CAPTAIN.
But how about you?
#CURT.
Done for!
#CAPTAIN.
It's your own fault. You should have sold out in time, or taken new stock.
#CURT.
So that I could lose that too.
#CAPTAIN.
No, for then the company would have been all right.
#CURT.
Not the company, but the directors, for in my mind that new subscription was simply a collection for the benefit of the board.
#CAPTAIN.
And now I ask whether such a view of the matter will save your money?
#CURT.
No, I shall have to give up everything.
#CAPTAIN.
Everything?
#CURT.
Even my home, the furniture -
#CAPTAIN.
But that's dreadful!
#CURT.
I have experienced worse things.
#CAPTAIN.
That's what happens when amateurs want to speculate.
#CURT.
You surprise me, for you know very well that if I had not subscribed, I should have been boycotted. The supplementary livelihood of the coast population, toilers of the sea, inexhaustible capital, inexhaustible as the sea itself - philanthropy and national prosperity - Thus you wrote and printed - And now you speak of it as speculation!
#CAPTAIN.
What are you going to do now?
#CURT.
Have an auction, I suppose.
#CAPTAIN.
You had better.
#CURT.
What do you mean?
#CAPTAIN.
What I said! For there are going to be some changes -
#CURT.
On the island?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes - as, for instance, - your quarters are going to be exchanged for somewhat simpler ones.
#CURT.
Well, well.
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, the plan is to place the quarantine station on the outside shore, near the water.
#CURT.
My original idea!
#CAPTAIN.
I don't know about that - for I am not familiar with your ideas on the subject. However it seems then quite natural that you dispose of the furniture, and it will attract much less notice - the scandal!
#CURT.
What?
#CAPTAIN.
The scandal! For it is a scandal to come to a new place and immediately get into financial troubles which must result in a lot of annoyance to the relatives - particularly to the relatives.
#CURT.
Oh, I guess I'll have to bear the worst of it.
#CAPTAIN.
I'll tell you one thing, my dear Curt: if I had not stood by you in this matter, you would have lost your position.
#CURT.
That too?
#CAPTAIN.
It comes rather hard for you to keep things in order - complaints have been made against your work.
#CURT.
Warranted complaints?
#CAPTAIN.
Yah! For you are - in spite of your other respectable qualities - a careless fellow - Don't interrupt me! You are a very careless fellow!
#CURT.
How strange!
#CAPTAIN.
However - the suggested change is going to take place very soon. And I should advise you to hold the auction at once or sell privately.
#CURT.
Privately? And where could I find a buyer in this place?
#CAPTAIN.
Well, I hope you don't expect me to settle down in the midst of your things? That would make a fine story - hm! - especially when I - think of what happened - once upon a time -
#CURT.
What was that? Are you referring to what did not happen?
#CAPTAIN.
You are so silent, Alice? What is the matter, old girl? Not blue, I hope?
#ALICE CHASE.
I sit here and think -
#CAPTAIN.
Goodness! Are you thinking? But you have to think quickly, keenly, and correctly, if it is to be of any help! So do your thinking now - one, two, three! Ha - ha! You can't! Well, then, I must try - Where is Judith?
#ALICE CHASE.
Somewhere.
#CAPTAIN.
Where is Allan? Where is the Lieutenant? I say, Curt - what are you going to do with Allan now?
#CURT.
Do with him?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, you cannot afford to keep him in the artillery now.
#CURT.
Perhaps not.
#CAPTAIN.
You had better get him into some cheap infantry regiment - up in Norrland, or somewhere.
#CURT.
In Norrland?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, or suppose you turned him into something practical at once? If I were in your place, I should get him into some business office - why not? In these enlightened times - yah! Alice is so uncommonly silent! Yes, children, this is the seesawing seesaw board of life - one moment high up, looking boldly around, and the next way down, and then upward again, and so on - So much for that - Did you say anything? We may expect company here in a few days.
#ALICE CHASE.
Were you speaking to me?
#CAPTAIN.
We may expect company in a few days - notable company!
#ALICE CHASE.
Who?
#CAPTAIN.
Behold - you're interested! Now you can sit there and guess who is coming, and between guesses you may read this letter over again.
#ALICE CHASE.
My letter? Opened? Back from the mail?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, as the head of the family and your guardian, I look after the sacred interests of the family, and with iron hand I shall cut short every effort to break the family ties by means of criminal correspondence. Yah! I am not dead, you know, but don't take offence now because I am going to raise us all out of undeserved humility - undeserved on my own part, at least!
#ALICE CHASE.
Judith! Judith!
#CAPTAIN.
And Holofernes? I, perhaps? Pooh!
#CURT.
Who is that man?
#ALICE CHASE.
How can I tell?
#CURT.
We are beaten.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes - beyond a doubt.
#CURT.
He has stripped me of everything, but so cleverly that I can accuse him of nothing.
#ALICE CHASE.
Why, no - you owe him a debt of gratitude instead!
#CURT.
Does he know what he is doing?
#ALICE CHASE.
No, I don't think so. He follows his nature and his instincts, and just now he seems to be in favour where fortune and misfortune are being meted out.
#CURT.
I suppose it's the Colonel who is to come here.
#ALICE CHASE.
Probably. And that is why Allan must go.
#CURT.
And you find that right?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes.
#CURT.
Then our ways part.
#ALICE CHASE.
A little - but we shall come together again.
#CURT.
Probably.
#ALICE CHASE.
And do you know where?
#CURT.
Here.
#ALICE CHASE.
You guess it?
#CURT.
That's easy! He takes the house and buys the furniture.
#ALICE CHASE.
I think so, too. But don't desert me!
#CURT.
Not for a little thing like that.
#ALICE CHASE.
Good - bye.
#CURT.
Good - bye.
#ALICE CHASE.
At last I have got you to come here! But, I cannot be so cruel as to wish you welcome to your own home -
#CURT.
Oh, why not? I have passed through three forced sales - and worse than that - It doesn't matter to me.
#ALICE CHASE.
Did he call you?
#CURT.
It was a formal command, but on what basis I don't understand.
#ALICE CHASE.
Why, he is not your superior!
#CURT.
No, but he has made himself king of the island. And if there be any resistance, he has only to mention the Colonel's name, and everybody submits. Tell me, is it to - day the Colonel is coming?
#ALICE CHASE.
He is expected - but I know nothing with certainty - Sit down, please.
#CURT.
Nothing has been changed here.
#ALICE CHASE.
Don't think of it! Don't renew the pain!
#CURT.
The pain? I find it merely a little strange. Strange as the man himself. Do you know, when I made his acquaintance as a boy, I fled him. But he was after me. Flattered, offered services, and surrounded me with ties - I repeated my attempt at escape, but in vain - And now I am his slave!
#ALICE CHASE.
And why? He owes you a debt, but you appear as the debtor.
#CURT.
Since I lost all I had, he has offered me help in getting Allan through his examinations -
#ALICE CHASE.
For which you will have to pay dearly! You are still a candidate for the Riksdag?
#CURT.
Yes, and, so far as I can see, there is nothing in my way.
#ALICE CHASE.
Is Allan really going to leave to - day?
#CURT.
Yes, if I cannot prevent it.
#ALICE CHASE.
That was a short - lived happiness.
#CURT.
Short - lived as everything but life itself, which lasts all too long.
#ALICE CHASE.
Too long, indeed! - Won't you come in and wait in the sitting - room? Even if it does not trouble you, it troubles me - these surroundings!
#CURT.
If you wish it -
#ALICE CHASE.
I feel ashamed, so ashamed that I could wish to die - but I can alter nothing!
#CURT.
Let us go then - as you wish it.
#ALICE CHASE.
And somebody is coming too.
#CAPTAIN.
Sit down, my boy, and let me have a talk with you.
#CAPTAIN.
It's raining to - day - otherwise I could sit here comfortably and look at the sea. Well? - You don't like to go, do you?
#ALLAN.
I don't like to leave my father.
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, your father - he is rather an unfortunate man. And parents rarely understand the true welfare of their children. That is to say - there are exceptions, of course. Hm! Tell me, Allan, have you any communication with your mother?
#ALLAN.
Yes, she writes now and then -
#CAPTAIN.
Do you know that she is your guardian?
#ALLAN.
Yes.
#CAPTAIN.
Now, Allan, do you know that your mother has authorised me to act in her place?
#ALLAN.
I didn't know that!
#CAPTAIN.
Well, you know it now. And, therefore, all discussions concerning your career are done with - And you are going to Norrland.
#ALLAN.
But I have no money.
#CAPTAIN.
I have arranged for what you need.
#ALLAN.
All I can do then is to thank you, Uncle.
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, you are grateful - which everybody is not. Hm! - The Colonel - do you know the Colonel?
#ALLAN.
No, I don't.
#CAPTAIN.
The Colonel - is my special friend - as you know, perhaps. Hm! The Colonel has wished to show his interest in my family, including my wife's relatives. Through his intercession, the Colonel has been able to provide the means needed for the completion of your course. Now you understand the obligation under which you and your father are placed toward the Colonel. Have I spoken with sufficient plainness? Go and pack your things now. The money will be handed to you at the landing. And now good - bye, my boy.
#JUDITH.
Is that you, Allan!
#ALLAN.
Is that you, Judith?
#JUDITH.
You don't know me any longer? Where have you been all this time? What are you looking at? My long dress - and my hair - You have not seen me like this before?
#ALLAN.
No - o -
#JUDITH.
Do I look like a married woman?
#JUDITH.
What are you doing here?
#ALLAN.
I am saying good - bye.
#JUDITH.
What? You are going - away?
#ALLAN.
I am transferred to Norrland.
#JUDITH.
To Norrland? When are you going?
#ALLAN.
To - day.
#JUDITH.
Whose doing is this?
#ALLAN.
Your father's.
#JUDITH.
That's what I thought! I wish you had stayed over to - day.
#ALLAN.
In order to meet the Colonel?
#JUDITH.
What do you know about the Colonel? - Is it certain that you are going?
#ALLAN.
There is no other choice. And now I want it myself.
#JUDITH.
Why do you want it now?
#ALLAN.
I want to get away from here - out into the world!
#JUDITH.
It's too close here? Yes, Allan, I understand you - it's unbearable here - here, where they speculate - in soda and human beings!
#JUDITH.
As you know, Allan, I possess that fortunate nature which cannot suffer - but - now I am learning!
#ALLAN.
You?
#JUDITH.
Yes - now it's beginning! Oh, how it hurts - oh!
#ALLAN.
What is it?
#JUDITH.
I don't know - I choke - I think I'm going to die!
#ALLAN.
Judith?
#JUDITH.
Oh! Is this the way it feels? Is this the way - poor boys!
#ALLAN.
I should smile, if I were as cruel as you are.
#JUDITH.
I am not cruel, but I didn't know better - You must not go!
#ALLAN.
I have to!
#JUDITH.
Go then - but give me a keepsake!
#ALLAN.
What have I to give you?
#JUDITH.
You! - No, I can never live through this! I suffer, I suffer - What have you done to me? I don't want to live any longer! Allan, don't go - not alone! Let us go together - we'll take the small boat, the little white one - and we'll sail far out, with the main sheet made fast - the wind is high - and we sail till we founder out there, way out, where there is no eelgrass and no jelly - fish - What do you say? - But we should have washed the sails yesterday - they should be white as snow - for I want to see white in that moment - and you swim with your arm about me until you grow tired - and then we sink - There would be style in that, a good deal more style than in going about here lamenting and smuggling letters that will be opened and jeered at by father - Allan! Do you hear?
#ALLAN.
Judith! Judith! Why were you not like this before?
#JUDITH.
I didn't know - how could I tell what I didn't know?
#ALLAN.
And now I must go away from you! But I suppose it is the better, the only thing! I cannot compete with a man - like -
#JUDITH.
Don't speak of the Colonel!
#ALLAN.
Is it not true?
#JUDITH.
It is true - and it is not true.
#ALLAN.
Can it become wholly untrue?
#JUDITH.
Yes, so it shall - within an hour!
#ALLAN.
And you keep your word? I can wait, I can suffer, I can work - Judith!
#JUDITH.
Don't go yet! How long must I wait? year.
#JUDITH.
One? I shall wait a thousand years, and if you do not come then, I shall turn the dome of heaven upside down and make the sun rise in the west - Hush, somebody is coming! Allan, we must part - take me into your arms! But you must not kiss me. There, go now! Go now!
#ALLAN.
No, I cannot go! I cannot go away from you - not now!
#JUDITH.
If you could only see how beautiful you are now! If you could only see yourself!
#ALLAN.
Oh, no, a man cannot be beautiful. But you, Judith! You - that you - oh, I saw that, when you were kind, another Judith appeared - and she's mine! - But if you don't keep faith with me now, then I shall die!
#JUDITH.
I think I am dying even now - Oh, that I might die now, just now, when I am so happy -
#ALLAN.
Somebody is coming!
#JUDITH.
Let them come! I fear nothing in the world hereafter. But I wish you could take me along under your cloak. And then I should fly with you to Norrland. What are we to do in Norrland? Become a Fusilier - one of those that wear plumes on their hats? There's style in that, and it will be becoming to you.
#JUDITH.
What are you doing, Mr. Madcap? Your lips will get black. And then I cannot kiss you when you go! Come, and I'll go with you!
#ALLAN.
No, then I should be placed under arrest.
#JUDITH.
I'll go with you to the guard - room.
#ALLAN.
They wouldn't let you! We must part now!
#JUDITH.
I am going to swim after the steamer - and then you jump in and save me - and it gets into the newspapers, and we become engaged. Shall we do that?
#ALLAN.
You can still jest?
#JUDITH.
There will always be time for tears - Say good - bye now! -
#ALLAN.
You'll get wet, Judith.
#JUDITH.
What do I care!
#ALICE CHASE.
What is this? - Get up and let me look at you.
#ALICE CHASE.
You are not sick - And I am not going to console you.
#JUDITH.
Come along to the telegraph office, Lieutenant.
#LIEUTENANT.
If I can be of any service - but I don't think it's quite proper -
#JUDITH.
So much the better! I want you to compromise me - but without any illusions on your part - Go ahead, please!
#CAPTAIN.
Let him come in.
#CURT.
You want to speak to me?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes, I have quite a number of important things to tell you. Sit down.
#CURT.
I am all ears.
#CAPTAIN.
Well, then! - You know that our quarantine system has been neglected during nearly a century - hm!
#ALICE CHASE.
That's the candidate for the Riksdag who speaks now.
#CAPTAIN.
But with the tremendous development witnessed by our own day in -
#ALICE CHASE.
The communications, of course! CAPTAIN. - all kinds of ways the government has begun to consider improvements. And for this purpose the Board of Health has appointed inspectors - hm!
#ALICE CHASE.
He's giving dictation.
#CAPTAIN.
You may as well learn it now as later - I have been appointed an inspector of quarantines.
#CURT.
I congratulate - and pay my respects to my superior at the same time.
#CAPTAIN.
On account of ties of kinship our personal relations will remain unchanged. However - to speak of other things - At my request your son Allan has been transferred to an infantry regiment in Norrland.
#CURT.
But I don't want it.
#CAPTAIN.
Your will in this case is subordinate to the mother's wishes - and as the mother has authorised me to decide, I have formed this decision.
#CURT.
I admire you!
#CAPTAIN.
Is that the only feeling you experience at this moment when you are to part from your son? Have you no other purely human feelings?
#CURT.
You mean that I ought to be suffering?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes.
#CURT.
It would please you if I suffered. You wish me to suffer.
#CAPTAIN.
You suffer? - Once I was taken sick - you were present and I can still remember that your face expressed nothing but undisguised pleasure.
#ALICE CHASE.
That is not true! Curt sat beside your bed all night and calmed you down when your qualms of conscience became too violent - but when you recovered you ceased to be thankful for it -
#CAPTAIN.
Consequently Allan will have to leave us.
#CURT.
And who is going to pay for it?
#CAPTAIN.
I have done so already - that is to say, we - a syndicate of people interested in the young man's future. syndicate?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes - and to make sure that everything is all right you can look over these subscription lists.
#CURT.
Lists? These are begging letters?
#CAPTAIN.
Call them what you please.
#CURT.
Have you gone begging on behalf of my son?
#CAPTAIN.
Are you ungrateful again? An ungrateful man is the heaviest burden borne by the earth.
#CURT.
Then I am dead socially! And my candidacy is done for!
#CAPTAIN.
What candidacy?
#CURT.
For the Riksdag, of course.
#CAPTAIN.
I hope you never had any such notions - particularly as you might have guessed that I, as an older resident, intended to offer my own services, which you seem to underestimate.
#CURT.
Oh, well, then that's gone, too!
#CAPTAIN.
It doesn't seem to trouble you very much.
#CURT.
Now you have taken everything - do you want more?
#CAPTAIN.
Have you anything more? And have you anything to reproach me with? Consider carefully if you have anything to reproach me with.
#CURT.
Strictly speaking, no! Everything has been correct and legal as it should be between honest citizens in the course of daily life -
#CAPTAIN.
You say this with a resignation which I would call cynical. But your entire nature has a cynical bent, my dear Curt, and there are moments when I feel tempted to share Alice's opinion of you - that you are a hypocrite, a hypocrite of the first water.
#CURT.
So that's Alice's opinion?
#ALICE CHASE.
It was - once. But not now, for it takes true heroism to bear what you have borne - or it takes something else!
#CAPTAIN.
Now I think the discussion may be regarded as closed. You, Curt, had better go and say good - bye to Allan, who is leaving with the next boat.
#CURT.
So soon? Well, I have gone through worse things than that.
#CAPTAIN.
You say that so often that I am beginning to wonder what you went through in America?
#CURT.
What I went through? I went through misfortunes. And it is the unmistakable right of every human being to suffer misfortune.
#CAPTAIN.
There are self - inflicted misfortunes - were yours of that kind?
#CURT.
Is not this a question of conscience?
#CAPTAIN.
Do you mean to say you have a conscience?
#CURT.
There are wolves and there are sheep, and no human being is honoured by being a sheep. But I'd rather be that than a wolf!
#CAPTAIN.
You don't recognise the old truth, that everybody is the maker of his own fortune?
#CURT.
Is that a truth?
#CAPTAIN.
And you don't know that a man's own strength -
#CURT.
Yes, I know that from the night when your own strength failed you, and you lay flat on the floor.
#CAPTAIN.
A deserving man like myself - yes, look at me - For fifty years I have fought - against a world - but at last I have won the game, by perseverance, loyalty, energy, and - integrity!
#ALICE CHASE.
You should leave that to be said by others!
#CAPTAIN.
The others won't say it because they are jealous. However - we are expecting company - my daughter Judith will to - day meet her intended - Where is Judith?
#ALICE CHASE.
She is out.
#CAPTAIN.
In the rain? Send for her.
#CURT.
Perhaps I may go now?
#CAPTAIN.
No, you had better stay. Is Judith dressed - Properly?
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, so - so - Have you definite word from the Colonel that he is coming?
#CAPTAIN.
Yes - that is to say, he will take us by surprise, as it is termed. And I am expecting a telegram from him - any moment. I'll be back at once.
#ALICE CHASE.
There you see him as he is! Can he be called human?
#CURT.
When you asked that question once before, I answered no. Now I believe him to be the commonest kind of human being of the sort that possess the earth. Perhaps we, too, are of the same kind - making use of other people and of favourable opportunities?
#ALICE CHASE.
He has eaten you and yours alive - and you defend him?
#CURT.
I have suffered worse things. And this man - eater has left my soul unharmed - that he couldn't swallow!
#ALICE CHASE.
What "worse" have you suffered?
#CURT.
And you ask that?
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you wish to be rude?
#CURT.
No, I don't wish to - and therefore - don't ask again!
#CAPTAIN.
The telegram was already there, however - Please read it, Alice, for I cannot see - Read it! You need not go, Curt.
#CAPTAIN.
Well? Don't you find it pleasing?
#CAPTAIN.
Who is it from?
#ALICE CHASE.
From the Colonel.
#CAPTAIN.
So I thought - and what does the Colonel say?
#ALICE CHASE.
This is what he says: "On account of Miss Judith's impertinent communication over the telephone, I consider the relationship ended - for ever!"
#CAPTAIN.
Once more, if you please.
#ALICE CHASE.
"On account of Miss Judith's impertinent communication over the telephone, I consider the relationship ended - for ever!"
#CAPTAIN.
It is Judith!
#ALICE CHASE.
And there is Holofernes!
#CAPTAIN.
And what are you?
#ALICE CHASE.
Soon you will see!
#CAPTAIN.
This is your doing!
#ALICE CHASE.
No!
#CAPTAIN.
This is your doing!
#ALICE CHASE.
No! There you got what was coming to you!
#CAPTAIN.
Don't be angry at me - I am very sick -
#ALICE CHASE.
Are you? I am glad to hear it.
#CURT.
Let us put him to bed.
#ALICE CHASE.
No, I don't want to touch him.
#CAPTAIN.
You must not be angry at me! Look after my children!
#CURT.
This is sublime! I am to look after his children, and he has stolen mine!
#ALICE CHASE.
Always the same self - deception!
#CAPTAIN.
Look after my children! Blub - blub - blub - blub.
#ALICE CHASE.
At last that tongue is checked! Can brag no more, lie no more, wound no more! You, Curt, who believe in God, give Him thanks on my behalf. Thank Him for my liberation from the tower, from the wolf, from the vampire!
#CURT.
Not that way, Alice!
#ALICE CHASE.
Where is your own strength now? Tell me? Where is your energy? Oh, you can still squirt venom, you viper - then I'll tear the tongue out of your throat! The head is off, but still it blushes! - O, Judith, glorious girl, whom I have carried like vengeance under my heart - you, you have set us free, all of us! - ? If you have more heads than one, Hydra, we'll take them! Think only that justice exists on the earth! Sometimes I dreamed it, but I could never believe it. Curt, ask God to pardon me for misjudging Him. Oh, there is justice! So I will become a sheep, too! Tell Him that, Curt! A little success makes us better, but adversity alone turns us into wolves.
#ALICE CHASE.
The Captain has had a stroke - will you please help us to roll out the chair?
#LIEUTENANT.
Madam -
#ALICE CHASE.
What is it?
#LIEUTENANT.
Well, Miss Judith -
#ALICE CHASE.
Help us with this first - then you can speak of Miss Judith afterward.
#ALICE CHASE.
Away with the carcass! Out with it, and let's open the doors! The place must be aired! Ugh!
#CURT.
Are you going to desert him? wrecked ship is deserted, and the crew save their lives - I'll not act as undertaker to a rotting beast! Drainmen and dissectors may dispose of him! A garden bed would be too good for that barrowful of filth! Now I am going to wash and bathe myself in order to get rid of all this impurity - if I can ever cleanse myself completely!
#CURT.
Who is there? Judith! Judith! JUDITH. He is gone!
#CURT.
Who?
#JUDITH.
Allan is gone!
#CURT.
Without saying good - bye?
#JUDITH.
He did to me, and he sent his love to you, Uncle.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, that was it!
#JUDITH.
He is gone!
#CURT.
He will come back, little girl.
#ALICE CHASE.
Or we will go after him!
#CURT.
And leave him? What would the world -
#ALICE CHASE.
The world - bah! Judith, come into my arms! Do you want to go after him?
#JUDITH.
How can you ask?
#ALICE CHASE.
But your father is sick.
#JUDITH.
What do I care!
#ALICE CHASE.
This is Judith! Oh, I love you, Judith!
#JUDITH.
And besides, papa is never mean - and he doesn't like cuddling. There's style to papa, after all.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, in a way!
#JUDITH.
And I don't think he is longing for me after that telephone message - Well, why should he pester me with an old fellow? No, Allan, Allan! I want to go to Allan!
#ALICE CHASE.
Think of it, that flowers can grow out of dirt!
#ALICE CHASE.
Well?
#LIEUTENANT.
Yes, Miss Judith -
#ALICE CHASE.
Is the feeling of those letters that form her name so sweet on your lips that it makes you forget him who is dying?
#LIEUTENANT.
Yes, but she said -
#ALICE CHASE.
She? Say rather Judith then! But first of all - how goes it in there?
#LIEUTENANT.
Oh, in there - it's all over!
#ALICE CHASE.
All over? O, God, on my own behalf and that of all mankind, I thank Thee for having freed us from this evil! Your arm, if you please - I want to go outside and get a breath - breathe!
#ALICE CHASE.
Did he say anything before the end came?
#LIEUTENANT.
Miss Judith's father spoke a few words only.
#ALICE CHASE.
What did he say?
#LIEUTENANT.
He said: "Forgive them, for they know not what they do!"
#ALICE CHASE.
Inconceivable!
#LIEUTENANT.
Yes, Miss Judith's father was a good and noble man.
#ALICE CHASE.
Curt!
#ALICE CHASE.
It is over!
#CURT.
Oh!
#ALICE CHASE.
Do you know what his last words were? No, you can never guess it. "Forgive them, for they know not what they do!"
#CURT.
Can you translate it?
#ALICE CHASE.
I suppose he meant that he had always done right and died as one that had been wronged by life.
#CURT.
I am sure his funeral sermon will be fine.
#ALICE CHASE.
And plenty of flowers - from the non - commissioned officers.
#CURT.
Yes.
#ALICE CHASE.
About a year ago he said something like this: "It looks to me as if life were a tremendous hoax played on all of us!"
#CURT.
Do you mean to imply that he was playing a hoax on us up to the very moment of death?
#ALICE CHASE.
No - but now, when he is dead, I feel a strange inclination to speak well of him.
#CURT.
Well, let us do so!
#LIEUTENANT.
Miss Judith's father was a good and noble man.
#ALICE CHASE.
Listen to that!
#CURT.
"They know not what they do." How many times did I not ask you whether he knew what he was doing? And you didn't think he knew. Therefore, forgive him!
#ALICE CHASE.
Riddles! Riddles! But do you notice that there is peace in the house now? The wonderful peace of death. Wonderful as the solemn anxiety that surrounds the coming of a child into the world. I hear the silence - and on the floor I see the traces of the easy - chair that carried him away - And I feel that now my own life is ended, and I am starting on the road to dissolution! Do you know, it's queer, but those simple words of the Lieutenant - and his is a simple mind - they pursue me, but now they have become serious. My husband, my youth's beloved - yes, perhaps you laugh! - he was a good and noble man - nevertheless!
#CURT.
Nevertheless? And a brave one - as he fought for his own and his family's existence!
#ALICE CHASE.
What worries! What humiliations! Which he wiped out - in order to pass on!
#CURT.
He was one who had been passed by! And that is to say much! Alice, go in there!
#ALICE CHASE.
No, I cannot do it! For while we have been talking here, the image of him as he was in his younger years has come back to me - I have seen him, I see him - now, as when he was only twenty - I must have loved that man!
#CURT.
And hated him!
#ALICE CHASE.
And hated! - Peace be with him!
