#FENTON.
Fortune, my foe, why dost thou frown on me, And will thy favors never greater be? Wilt thou, I say, forever breed me pain, And wilt thou not restore my joys again?
#BUTLER.
More to the light!
#DRISCOLL.
Ah! Softly, Myles!
#JOHN TALBOT.
Ah!
#FENTON.
Jack! Jack Talbot! What is it that you see?
#JOHN TALBOT.
What should I see but Cromwell's watch - fires along the boreen? What else should I see, and the night as black as the mouth of hell? What else should I see, and a pest choke your throat with your fool's questions, Dick Fenton!
#FENTON.
God 'a' mercy - Captain Talbot!
#DRISCOLL.
God's love! I bade ye have a care, Myles Butler.
#BUTLER.
It's a stout heart you have in you, Phelimy Driscoll - you to be crying out for a scratch. It's better you would have been, you and the like of you, to be stopping at home with your mother.
#DRISCOLL.
You - you dare - you call me - coward? Ye black liar! I'll lesson ye! I'll -
#BUTLER.
A'Heaven's name, ha' done with that hanging tune! Ha' done, Dick Fenton! We're not yet at the gallows' foot.
#FENTON.
Nay, Myles, for us 'tis like to be nothing half so merry as the gallows.
#BUTLER.
Hold your fool's tongue!
#NEWCOMBE.
Oh! Oh!
#JOHN TALBOT.
What was that?
#FENTON.
'Twas naught but young Newcombe that cried out in the clutch of a nightmare.
#BUTLER.
'Tis time Kit Newcombe rose and stood his watch.
#JOHN TALBOT.
Nay, 'tis only a boy. Let him sleep while he can! Let him sleep!
#BUTLER.
Turn and turn at the watch, 'tis but fair. Stir yonder sluggard awake, Dick!
#FENTON.
Aye.
#JOHN TALBOT.
Who gives commands here? Sit you down, Fenton! To your place, Myles Butler!
#BUTLER.
Captain of the Gate! D'ye mark the high tone of him, Dick?
#JOHN TALBOT.
You're out there, Myles. There is but one Captain of the Gate of Connaught - he who set me here - my cousin, Hugh Talbot.
#BUTLER.
Aye, and it's a deal you'll need to be growing, ere you fill Hugh Talbot's shoes.
#JOHN TALBOT.
And that's a true word! But 'twas Hugh Talbot's will that I should command, here at the Bridge of Cashala. And as long as breath is in me I -
#DRISCOLL.
Water! Water! Myles! Dick! Will ye give me to drink, lads? Jack Talbot! I'm choked wi' thirst.
#JOHN TALBOT.
There's never a drop of water left us, Phelimy, lad.
#FENTON.
Owen Bourke drained the last of it, God rest him!
#BUTLER.
'Tis likely our clever new Captain of the Gate will hit on some shift to fill our empty casks.
#JOHN TALBOT.
Not the new Captain of the Gate. The old Captain of the Gate - Hugh Talbot. He'll be here this day - this hour, maybe.
#FENTON.
That tale grows something old, Jack Talbot.
#JOHN TALBOT.
He swore he'd bring us succor. He - Driscoll! Are you gone mad? Stand you back from that door!
#DRISCOLL.
Let me forth! The spring - 'tis just below - there on the river - bank! Let me slip down to it - but a moment - and drink!
#JOHN TALBOT.
Cromwell's soldiers hold the spring.
#DRISCOLL.
I care not! Let me forth and drink! Let me forth!
#JOHN TALBOT.
'T would be to your death.
#BUTLER.
And what will he get but his death if he stay here, Captain Talbot?
#DRISCOLL.
I'm choked! I'm choked, I tell ye! Let me go, Jack Talbot! Let me go!
#NEWCOMBE.
God's pity! No! no! no!
#DRISCOLL.
God shield us!
#BUTLER.
Silence that whelp!
#FENTON.
Clear to the rebel camp they'll hear him!
#JOHN TALBOT.
Newcombe! Kit Newcombe!
#NEWCOMBE.
Ah, God! Keep them from me! Keep them from me!
#JOHN TALBOT.
Ha' done! Ha' done!
#NEWCOMBE.
Not that! Not the butt of the muskets! Not that! Not that!
#JOHN TALBOT.
Wake! You're dreaming!
#DRISCOLL.
'Tis ill luck! 'Tis ill luck comes of such dreaming!
#NEWCOMBE.
Drogheda! I dreamed I was at Drogheda, where my brother - my brother - they beat out his brains - Cromwell's men - with their clubbed muskets - they -
#FENTON.
English officers that serve amongst the Irish - 't is thus that Cromwell uses them!
#BUTLER.
English officers - aye, like ourselves!
#JOHN TALBOT.
Be quiet, Kit! You're far from Drogheda - here at the Bridge of Cashala.
#BUTLER.
Aye, safe in Cashala Gatehouse, with five hundred of Cromwell's men sitting down before it.
#JOHN TALBOT.
Keep your watch, Butler!
#NEWCOMBE.
You give orders? You still command, Jack? Where's Captain Talbot, then?
#BUTLER.
Aye, where is Captain Talbot?
#JOHN TALBOT.
You say -
#FENTON.
We all say it.
#JOHN TALBOT.
Even thou, Dick?
#DRISCOLL.
He does not come! Hugh Talbot does not come!
#FENTON.
He bade us hold the bridge one day. We've held it three days now.
#BUTLER.
And where is Hugh Talbot with the aid he promised?
#JOHN TALBOT.
He promised. He has never broken faith. He will bring us aid.
#FENTON.
Aye, if he be living!
#DRISCOLL.
Living? You mean that he - Och, he's dead! Hugh Talbot's dead! And we're destroyed! We're destroyed!
#NEWCOMBE.
The butt of the muskets!
#FENTON.
God!
#JOHN TALBOT.
Take up your piece!
#BUTLER.
Renounce me if I do!
#FENTON.
I stand with you, Myles Butler. Make terms for us, John Talbot, or, on my soul, we'll make them for ourselves.
#JOHN TALBOT.
Surrender?
#NEWCOMBE.
Will Cromwell spare us, an we yield ourselves now? Will he spare us? Will he -
#FENTON.
'Tis our one chance.
#NEWCOMBE.
Give me that white rag!
#FENTON.
Here's a staff!
#JOHN TALBOT.
A black curse on you!
#BUTLER.
We'll not be butchered like oxen in the shambles!
#JOHN TALBOT.
Your oaths!
#BUTLER.
We'll not fight longer to be knocked on the head at the last.
#NEWCOMBE.
No! No! Not that! Out with the flag, Dick! light here at the grating!
#JOHN TALBOT.
Hark!
#DRISCOLL.
The bugle! They're upon us!
#BUTLER.
What was that?
#JOHN TALBOT.
You swore to hold the bridge.
#BUTLER.
Swore to hold it one day. We've held it three days now.
#FENTON.
And the half of us are slain.
#NEWCOMBE.
And we've no water - and no food!
#JOHN TALBOT.
We have powder in plenty.
#DRISCOLL.
We can't drink powder. Ah, for God's love, be swift, Dick Fenton! Be swift!
#JOHN TALBOT.
You shall not show that white flag!
#BUTLER.
God's death! We shall! Help me here, Phelimy! summons to parley. What see you, Fenton?
#FENTON.
Torches coming from the boreen, and a white flag beneath them. I can see the faces. Look, Jack! A'God's name! Look!
#DRISCOLL.
What is it you're seeing?
#FENTON.
It is -
#JOHN TALBOT.
'Tis Hugh Talbot comes! 'Tis the Captain of the Gate!
#BUTLER.
With them? A prisoner?
#JOHN TALBOT.
No, no! No prisoner! He wears his sword.
#FENTON.
Then he'll have made terms with them! Terms!
#NEWCOMBE.
Terms for us! Terms for us!
#JOHN TALBOT.
I told ye truth. He has come. Hugh Talbot has come.
#HUGH TALBOT.
Open! I come alone, and in peace. Open unto me!
#JOHN TALBOT.
Who goes there?
#HUGH TALBOT.
The Captain of the Gate!
#HUGH TALBOT.
Well, lads?
#NEWCOMBE.
We thought - we thought - that you - that you -
#FENTON.
What terms will they grant us, sir?
#JOHN TALBOT.
Sir, we have held the bridge.
#HUGH TALBOT.
You five -
#JOHN TALBOT.
Bourke is dead, sir, and Tregarris, and Langdale, and - and James Talbot, my brother.
#DRISCOLL.
And we've had no water, sir, these many hours.
#HUGH TALBOT.
So! You're wounded, Phelimy.
#DRISCOLL.
'Tis not worth heeding, sir.
#HUGH TALBOT.
Kit! Kit! A light here! Dick, you've your pouch under your hand?
#FENTON.
'Tis here, sir.
#HUGH TALBOT.
Leave the window, Myles! They've promised us a half hour's truce - and Cromwell's a man of his word.
#NEWCOMBE.
He'll let us pass free now, sir, will he not?
#HUGH TALBOT.
You're not afraid, Kit? Faith, no, sir. No! Not now!
#HUGH TALBOT.
Sit ye down, Phelimy, lad! You look dead on your feet. Give me to see that arm! Jack Talbot! Who taught ye to leave your powder uncovered, where lighted match was laid?
#BUTLER.
My blame, sir.
#JOHN TALBOT.
We opened the keg, and then -
#FENTON.
Truth, we did not cover it again, being somewhat pressed for time.
#HUGH TALBOT.
And you never thought, maybe, that in that keg there was powder enough to blow the bridge of Cashala to hell?
#JOHN TALBOT.
It seemed a matter of small moment, sir.
#HUGH TALBOT.
Small moment! Powder enough, put case ye set it there, at the stairhead - d'ye follow me? - powder enough to make an end of Cashala Bridge for all time - aye, and of all within the Gatehouse. You never thought on that, eh?
#JOHN TALBOT.
We had so much to think on, sir.
#HUGH TALBOT.
I did suspect as much. So I came hither to recall the powder to your minds.
#DRISCOLL.
We thought - We thought maybe you would not be coming at all, sir. Maybe you would be dead.
#HUGH TALBOT.
Well? What an if I had been dead? You had your orders. You did not dream of giving up the Bridge of Cashala - eh, Myles Butler?
#BUTLER.
No, sir.
#HUGH TALBOT.
Nor you, Dick Fenton?
#FENTON.
Sir, I - No!
#HUGH TALBOT.
Good lads! The wise heads were saying I was a stark fool to set you here at Cashala. But I said: I can be trusting the young riders that are learning their lessons in war from me. I'll be safe putting my honor into their hands. And I was right, wasn't I, Phelimy Driscoll?
#DRISCOLL.
Give us the chance, sir, and we'll be holding Cashala, even against the devil himself!
#FENTON.
Aye, well said!
#HUGH TALBOT.
Sure,'tis a passing good substitute for the devil sits yonder in Cromwell's tent.
#NEWCOMBE.
Cromwell!
#HUGH TALBOT.
Aye, he was slaying your brother at Drogheda, Kit, and a fine, gallant lad your brother was. And I'm thinking you're like him, Kit. Else I shouldn't be trusting you here at Cashala.
#NEWCOMBE.
I - I - Will they let us keep our swords?
#HUGH TALBOT.
Well, it's with yourselves it lies, whether you'll keep them or not.
#FENTON.
He means - we mean - on what terms, sir, do we surrender?
#HUGH TALBOT.
Surrender? Terms?
#JOHN TALBOT.
We thought, sir, from your coming under their white flag - perhaps you had made terms for us.
#HUGH TALBOT.
How could I make terms?
#NEWCOMBE.
Captain!
#HUGH TALBOT.
How could I make terms that you would hear to? Cashala Bridge is the gate of Connaught.
#JOHN TALBOT.
Yes.
#HUGH TALBOT.
Give Cromwell Cashala Bridge, and he'll be on the heels of our women and our little ones. At what price would ye be selling their safety?
#DRISCOLL.
Cromwell - when he takes us - when he takes us -
#NEWCOMBE.
He'll knock us on the head!
#HUGH TALBOT.
Yes. At the last. Your five lives against our people's safety. You'd not give up the bridge?
#JOHN TALBOT.
Five? Our five? But you - you are the sixth.
#FENTON.
You stay with us, Captain. And then we'll fight - you'll see how we shall fight.
#HUGH TALBOT.
I shall be seeing you fight, perhaps, but I cannot stay now at Cashala.
#DRISCOLL.
Ye won't be staying with us?
#BUTLER.
Now, on my soul! Is this your faith, Hugh Talbot? One liar I've followed, Charles Stuart, the son of a liar, and now a second liar -
#JOHN TALBOT.
A plague choke you!
#HUGH TALBOT.
Ha' done, Jack! Ha' done! What more, Myles Butler?
#BUTLER.
Tell us whither you go, when you turn your back on us that shall die at Cashala - you that come walking under the rebel flag - that swore to bring us aid - and have not brought it! Tell us whither you go now!
#HUGH TALBOT.
Well, I'm a shade doubtful, Myles, my lad, though hopeful of the best.
#BUTLER.
'Tis to Cromwell you go - you that have made your peace with him - that have sold us -
#DRISCOLL.
Captain! A' God's name, what is it that you're meaning?
#HUGH TALBOT.
I mean that you shall hold the Bridge of Cashala - whatever happen to you - whatever happen to me -
#FENTON.
To you? Captain Talbot!
#HUGH TALBOT.
I am going unto Cromwell - as you said, Myles. I gave my promise.
#DRISCOLL.
Your promise?
#JOHN TALBOT.
We - have been very blind. So - they made you prisoner?
#HUGH TALBOT.
Aye, Jack. When I tried to cut my way through to bring you aid. And they granted me this half hour on my parole to come unto you.
#JOHN TALBOT.
To come -
#HUGH TALBOT.
To counsel you to surrender. And I have given you counsel. Hold the bridge! Hold it! Whatever they do!
#DRISCOLL.
Captain! Captain Talbot! God of Heaven! If you go back - 'tis killed you'll be among them! little sooner than you lads? Aye, true!
#FENTON.
They cannot! Even Cromwell -
#HUGH TALBOT.
Tut, tut, Dick! It's little ye know of Cromwell.
#JOHN TALBOT.
Then - you mean -
#HUGH TALBOT.
An you surrender Cashala, we may all six pass free. An you hold Cashala, they will hang me, here before your eyes.
#BUTLER.
God forgive me!
#HUGH TALBOT.
You have your orders. Hold the bridge!
#JOHN TALBOT.
No, no! You shan't go forth!
#FENTON.
God's mercy, no!
#HUGH TALBOT.
Are you stark crazed?
#FENTON.
You shall stay with us.
#JOHN TALBOT.
What's your pledged word to men that know not honor?
#HUGH TALBOT.
My word. Unbar the door, Jack. Why, lad, we're traveling the same road.
#FENTON.
God! But we'll give them a good fight at the last. Take up your musket, Kit.
#NEWCOMBE.
But I - Captain! When you are gone, I - I -
#HUGH TALBOT.
I'll not be far. You'll hold the bridge?
#JOHN TALBOT.
Aye, sir.
#BUTLER.
We've powder enough - you said it, sir, - laid there at the stairhead, to blow the bridge to hell.
#HUGH TALBOT.
Aye, Myles, you've hit it!
#BUTLER.
Not yet, sir!
#HUGH TALBOT.
Hereafter, then. God speed you, lads!
#JOHN TALBOT.
Speed you, sir! You have - Hugh Talbot's orders. Take your pieces! Driscoll! Newcombe! Butler!
#BUTLER.
Aye! We have Hugh Talbot's orders.
#JOHN TALBOT.
Are you meaning -
#BUTLER.
It's not I will be failing him now!
#FENTON.
God! They waste no time.
#JOHN TALBOT.
Already - they have dared -
#FENTON.
Here - this moment - under our very eyes!
#DRISCOLL.
Christ Jesus!
#JOHN TALBOT.
Kit! Kit Newcombe!
#NEWCOMBE.
I cannot! I -
#JOHN TALBOT.
Look forth! Look! And remember - when you meet them - remember! Lads! The time is short. His orders!
#FENTON.
Yonder, at the stairhead.
#BUTLER.
Aye.
#NEWCOMBE.
Not that! Not that death! No! No!
#JOHN TALBOT.
Be silent! And look yonder! Driscoll! Fetch the light! Newcombe! Come! You have your places, all.
#DRISCOLL.
But, Captain! The sixth man - where will the sixth man be standing?
#JOHN TALBOT.
Sixth?
#FENTON.
What sixth?
#DRISCOLL.
The blind eyes of ye! Yonder!
#VOICE OUTSIDE.
For the last time: will you surrender you?
#JOHN TALBOT.
No! Not while our commander stands with us!
#VOICE OUTSIDE.
And who might your commander be?
#JOHN TALBOT.
Hugh Talbot, the Captain of the Gate! The light here, Phelimy.
