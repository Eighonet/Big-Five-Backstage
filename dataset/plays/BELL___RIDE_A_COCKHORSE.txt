#TIMOTHY.
Jim, are you asleep?
#JIM.
Yes, sound, are you?
#TIMOTHY.
Yes. I do think it's so boring being in bed, don't you?
#JIM.
Horrid. I hate being asleep.
#TIMOTHY.
But it's so difficult to keep awake sometimes, even if one has a book to look at.
#JIM.
I can't think why Nurse doesn't like us to bring our book to bed. This is just the time to have it. It gives one nice dreams. Look, I've got mine.
#TIMOTHY.
It would be safer to wait till she's been.
#JIM.
Perhaps it would.
#TIMOTHY.
I do like it when Nurse looks in very softly and then says to Mother outside, "They're sound asleep, ma'am," when we're awake all the time!
#JIM.
Take care, here she comes.
#TIMOTHY.
Now the book!
#JIM.
Read something very nice. Then we can think about it afterwards. That will keep us awake.
#TIMOTHY.
Oh, this is the one I like - "Ride a cock - horse to Banbury Cross, To see a fine lady upon a white horse: Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes, She shall have music wherever she goes."
#JIM.
Oh yes, I love that one. Let's talk about it.
#TIMOTHY.
What do you think a cock - horse is?
#JIM.
I can't imagine. Do you think it's a horse with a cock's head?
#TIMOTHY.
Oh, I wonder if he'd be like our Chanticleer, all white with a beautiful red comb.
#JIM.
Or perhaps he'd be like our Rooster, all black and speckly. I wonder if he'd crow all the same, as our cocks do in the morning under our windows.
#TIMOTHY.
Oh dear, how funny Chanticleer would look with a horse's body! or is it a cock's head and a horse's body?
#JIM.
You couldn't ride him so easily.
#TIMOTHY.
I should think it's a great big cock and wings sticking out like that , and with a beautiful horse's back and a long tail. Oh, I should like to ride him!
#JIM.
So should I.
#TIMOTHY.
And what about the fine lady? What do you think Banbury Cross is like?
#JIM.
Oh, there's the picture. Look, it's a great stone thing; and there's the fine lady all in white, with a crown on.
#TIMOTHY.
I wish there was a picture of the cock - horse too.
#JIM.
, I should like to ride on it - and - go to see the fine lady.
#TIMOTHY.
Yes, we'd go to Banbury Cross and - see - her.
#FIRST CHILD.
Oh, I'm so out of breath.
#SECOND CHILD.
Let's rest a little.
#THIRD CHILD.
Yes, till the Procession comes.
#FOURTH CHILD.
Oh, look! there's someone coming.
#TIMOTHY.
There, Rooster, we've just done it. You are a good one to go.
#JIM.
So are you, Chanticleer.
#FIRST CHILD.
Oh, are you the beginning of the procession, please?
#JIM.
What procession?
#CHILD.
The fine lady that is coming on a white horse - the Queen of the Revels.
#TIMOTHY.
What are revels?
#CHILD.
Games and dancing and all sorts of fun.
#TIMOTHY.
Oh, how nice!
#CHILD.
Isn't it!
#JIM.
I am glad we came.
#TIMOTHY.
So am I.
#CHILDREN.
Hooray! Hooray! Here she comes.
#CROWD.
Hooray! Hooray!
#MASTER.
Here is the list of the Revels - the first will be a race.
#JIM.
That will be fun. I like seeing races.
#MASTER.
First race, Cock - horses - three times round Banbury Cross. How many entries?
#JIM.
Do you suppose that's us?
#TIMOTHY.
I don't see any others.
#MASTER.
Any entries?
#JIM.
Cock - horse Chanticleer, ridden by Jim.
#TIMOTHY.
Cock - horse Rooster, ridden by Tim.
#MASTER.
One, two, three, off! dead heat - no prize.
#JIM.
No prize?
#MASTER.
No. Don't talk. Next revel, a dance.
#MASTER.
Next revel, crowing competition.
#CHILD.
That's not fair - he's a professional.
#ANOTHER CHILD.
Never mind! Well done, Rooster.
#TIMOTHY.
No, no, Rooster, leave off now. You've got the prize. Jim, we must ride back now. Why, that's Chanticleer crowing outside!
#JIM.
What's that crowing? Where am I?
#TIMOTHY.
I've been dreaming I was riding a cock - horse.
#JIM.
And I dreamt I saw the fine lady. Oh, I'm so sleepy.
#NURSE.
What, asleep still! Come, it's time to get up. And you've been taking a book to bed, you naughty boys, and reading it instead of going to sleep. That's why you're so tired this morning. What's it about? Why, what absurd stuff! Ride a cock - horse to Banbury Cross, To see a fine lady upon a white horse: With rings on her fingers, and bells on her toes, She shall have music -
