#ROSEMARY.
Thank you, James. If any one calls I am not at home.
#JAMES.
Yes, Miss.
#ROSEMARY.
You may add that I am engaged in writing my auto - autobiography.
#JAMES.
Yes, Miss.
#ROSEMARY.
It's what every one writes, isn't it, James?
#JAMES.
I believe so, Miss.
#ROSEMARY.
Thank you. Oh, James?
#JAMES.
Yes, Miss?
#ROSEMARY.
What is an autobiography?
#JAMES.
Well, I couldn't rightly say, Miss - not to explain it properly.
#ROSEMARY.
Oh, James! . I thought you knew everything.
#JAMES.
In the ordinary way, yes, Miss, but every now and then -
#ROSEMARY.
It's very upsetting.
#JAMES.
Yes, Miss. . How would it be to write a play instead? Very easy work, they tell me.
#ROSEMARY.
Yes, that's much better. I'll write a play. Thank you, James.
#JAMES.
Not at all, Miss.
#ROSEMARY.
Make - Believe. M - a - k - e hyphen B - e - l - Now which way is it? That looks wrong. So does that. Oh, dear!
#JAMES.
Yes, Miss?
#ROSEMARY.
James, I have decided to call my play Make - Believe.
#JAMES.
Yes, Miss.
#ROSEMARY.
When you spell "believe," it is "i - e," isn't it?
#JAMES.
Yes, Miss.
#ROSEMARY.
I thought at first it was "e - i."
#JAMES.
Now you mention it, I think it is, Miss.
#ROSEMARY.
Oh, James! Aren't you certain?
#JAMES.
M - a - k - e, make, B - e - l -
#ROSEMARY.
Yes. I got as far as that.
#JAMES.
B - e - l -
#ROSEMARY.
You see, James, it spoils the play if you have an accident to the very first word of it.
#JAMES.
Yes, Miss. B - e - l - I've noticed sometimes that if one writes a word careless - like on the blotting - paper, and then looks at it with the head on one side, there's a sort of instinct comes over one, as makes one say "Rotten." One can then write it the other way more hopeful.
#ROSEMARY.
I've tried that.
#JAMES.
Then might I suggest, Miss, that you give it another name altogether? As it might be, "Susan's Saturday Night," all easy words to spell, or "Red Revenge," or -
#ROSEMARY.
I must call it Make - Believe, because it's all of the play I've thought of so far.
#JAMES.
Quite so, Miss. Then how would it be to spell it wrong on purpose? It comes funnier that way sometimes.
#ROSEMARY.
Does it?
#JAMES.
Yes, Miss. Makes 'em laugh.
#ROSEMARY.
Oh! . Well, which is the wrong way?
#JAMES.
Ah, there you've got me again, Miss.
#ROSEMARY.
I know what I'll do. I'll spell it "i - e"; and if it's right, then I'm right, and if it's wrong, then I'm funny.
#JAMES.
Yes, Miss. That's the safest.
#ROSEMARY.
Thank you, James.
#JAMES.
Not at all, Miss.
#ROSEMARY.
Make - Believe. A Christmas Entertainment - No, play - a Christmas Play in three acts. Er -
#JAMES.
Beg pardon, Miss, but the Misses and Masters Hubbard are without, and crave admittance.
#ROSEMARY.
All nine of them?
#JAMES.
Without having counted them, Miss, I should say that the majority of them were present.
#ROSEMARY.
Did you say that I was not at home?
#JAMES.
Yes, Miss. They said that, this being their house, and you being a visitor, if you had been at home, then you wouldn't have been here. Yumour on the part of Master Bertram, Miss.
#ROSEMARY.
It's very upsetting when you're writing a play.
#JAMES.
Yes, Miss. Perhaps they could help you with it. The more the merrier, as you might say.
#ROSEMARY.
What a good idea, James. Admit them.
#JAMES.
Yes, Miss. The Misses Ada, Caroline, Elsie, Gwendoline, and Isabel Hubbard, The Masters Bertram, Dennis, Frank, and Harold Hubbard.
#ROSEMARY.
How do you do?
#ADA.
Rosemary, darling, what are you doing?
#BERTRAM.
It's like your cheek, bagging our room.
#CAROLINE.
Hush, Bertram. We ought always to be polite to our visitors when they stay with us. I am sure, if Rosemary wants our room -
#DENNIS.
Oh, chuck it!
#ADA.
Oh, I say, she's writing a play! { THE BOYS. Coo! I say, shove me into it. What's { it about? Bet it's awful rot. { { THE GIRLS. Oh, Rosemary! Am I in it? Do tell us { about it. Is it for Christmas?
#ROSEMARY.
James, could you - ?
#JAMES.
Quiet, there, quiet! Down, Master Dennis, down! Miss Gwendoline, if you wouldn't mind - Thank you.
#ROSEMARY.
Thank you, James. . Yes, it's a play for Christmas, and it is called "Make - Believe," and that's all I'm certain about yet, except that we're all going to be in it.
#BERTRAM.
Then I vote we have a desert island -
#DENNIS.
And pirates -
#FRANK.
And cannibals -
#HAROLD.
Cannibals eating people - Oo!
#CAROLINE.
Harold! How would you like to be eaten by a cannibal?
#DENNIS.
Oh, chuck it! How would you like to be a cannibal and have nobody to eat?
#ADA.
Let it be a fairy - story, Rosemary, darling. It's so much prettier.
#ELSIE.
With a lovely princess -
#GWENDOLINE.
And a humble woodcutter who marries her -
#ISABEL.
P'itty P'incess.
#BERTRAM.
Princesses are rot.
#ELSIE.
So are pirates!
#CAROLINE.
I should like something about Father Christmas, and snow, and waits, and a lovely ball, and everybody getting nice presents and things.
#DENNIS.
Bags I all the presents.
#ROSEMARY.
James, I must have silence.
#JAMES.
Silence, all!
#ROSEMARY.
Thank you. . You will be interested to hear that I have decided to have a Fairy Story and a Desert Island and a Father Christmas.
#ALL.
Good!
#ROSEMARY.
I shall begin with the Fairy Story. James, how do you begin a play? I mean when you've got the title.
#JAMES.
Well, Miss Rosemary, seeing that it's to be called "Make - Believe," why not make - believe as it's written already?
#ROSEMARY.
What a good idea, James!
#JAMES.
All that is necessary is for the company to think very hard of what they want, and - there we are! Saves all the bother of writing and spelling and what not.
#ROSEMARY.
James, how clever you are!
#JAMES.
So - so, Miss Rosemary.
#ROSEMARY.
Now then, let's all think together. Are you all ready?
#ALL.
Yes!
#ROSEMARY.
Then one, two, three - Go!
#PRINCESS.
Good morning, Woodcutter.
#WOODCUTTER.
Good morning.
#PRINCESS.
Good morning, Woodcutter.
#WOODCUTTER.
Good morning.
#PRINCESS.
Don't you ever say anything except good morning?
#WOODCUTTER.
Sometimes I say good - bye.
#PRINCESS.
You are a cross woodcutter to - day.
#WOODCUTTER.
I have work to do.
#PRINCESS.
You are still cutting wood? Don't you ever do anything else?
#WOODCUTTER.
Well, you are still a Princess; don't you ever do anything else?
#PRINCESS.
Now, that's not fair, Woodcutter. You can't say I was a Princess yesterday, when I came and helped you stack your wood. Or the day before, when I tied up your hand where you had cut it. Or the day before that, when we had our meal together on the grass. Was I a Princess then?
#WOODCUTTER.
Somehow I think you were. Somehow I think you were saying to yourself, "Isn't it sweet of a Princess to treat a mere woodcutter like this?"
#PRINCESS.
I think you're perfectly horrid. I've a good mind never to speak to you again. And - and I would, if only I could be sure that you would notice I wasn't speaking to you.
#WOODCUTTER.
After all, I'm just as bad as you. Only yesterday I was thinking to myself how unselfish I was to interrupt my work in order to talk to a mere Princess.
#PRINCESS.
Yes, but the trouble is that you don't interrupt your work.
#WOODCUTTER.
Madam, I am at your service.
#PRINCESS.
I wish I thought you were.
#WOODCUTTER.
Surely you have enough people at your service already. Princes and Chancellors and Chamberlains and Waiting Maids.
#PRINCESS.
Yes, that's just it. That's why I want your help. Particularly in the matter of the Princes.
#WOODCUTTER.
Why, has a suitor come for the hand of her Royal Highness?
#PRINCESS.
Three suitors. And I hate them all.
#WOODCUTTER.
And which are you going to marry?
#PRINCESS.
I don't know. Father hasn't made up his mind yet.
#WOODCUTTER.
And this is a matter which father - which His Majesty decides for himself?
#PRINCESS.
Why, of course! You should read the History Books, Woodcutter. The suitors to the hand of a Princess are always set some trial of strength or test of quality by the King, and the winner marries his daughter.
#WOODCUTTER.
Well, I don't live in a Palace, and I think my own thoughts about these things. I'd better get back to my work.
#PRINCESS.
Woodcutter!
#WOODCUTTER.
Oh, are you there? I thought you were married by this time.
#PRINCESS.
I don't want to be married. I mean, not to any of those three.
#WOODCUTTER.
You can't help yourself.
#PRINCESS.
I know. That's why I wanted you to help me.
#WOODCUTTER.
Can a simple woodcutter help a Princess?
#PRINCESS.
Well, perhaps a simple one couldn't, but a clever one might.
#WOODCUTTER.
What would his reward be?
#PRINCESS.
His reward would be that the Princess, not being married to any of her three suitors, would still be able to help him chop his wood in the mornings. . I am helping you, aren't I?
#WOODCUTTER.
Oh, decidedly.
#PRINCESS.
I thought I was.
#WOODCUTTER.
It is kind of a great lady like yourself to help so humble a fellow as I.
#PRINCESS.
I'm not very great.
#WOODCUTTER.
There's enough of you to make a hundred men unhappy.
#PRINCESS.
And one man happy?
#WOODCUTTER.
And one man very, very happy.
#PRINCESS.
I wonder who he'll be. . Woodcutter, if you were a Prince, would you be my suitor?
#WOODCUTTER.
One of three?
#PRINCESS.
Oo, would you kill the others? With that axe?
#WOODCUTTER.
I would not kill them, in order to help His Majesty make up his mind about his son - in - law. But if the Princess had made up her mind - and wanted me -
#PRINCESS.
Yes?
#WOODCUTTER.
Then I would marry her, however many suitors she had.
#PRINCESS.
Well, she's only got three at present.
#WOODCUTTER.
What is that to me?
#PRINCESS.
Oh, I just thought you might want to be doing something to your axe.
#WOODCUTTER.
My axe?
#PRINCESS.
Yes. You see, she has made up her mind.
#WOODCUTTER.
You mean - But - but I'm only a woodcutter.
#PRINCESS.
That's where you'll have the advantage of them, when it comes to axes.
#WOODCUTTER.
Princess! My Princess!
#PRINCESS.
Woodcutter! My woodcutter! My, oh so very slow and uncomprehending, but entirely adorable woodcutter!
#WOODCUTTER.
But what will His Majesty say?
#PRINCESS.
All sorts of things. . Do you really love me, woodcutter, or have I proposed to you under a misapprehension?
#WOODCUTTER.
I adore you!
#PRINCESS.
I thought you did. But I wanted to hear you say it. If I had been a simple peasant, I suppose you would have said it a long time ago?
#WOODCUTTER.
I expect so.
#PRINCESS.
Yes. . Well, now we must think of a plan for making Mother like you.
#WOODCUTTER.
Might I just kiss you again before we begin?
#PRINCESS.
Well, I don't quite see how I am to stop you.
#WOODCUTTER.
There!
#PRINCESS.
Oh, Woodcutter, woodcutter, why didn't you do that the first day I saw you? Then I needn't have had the bother of proposing to you. What is it?
#WOODCUTTER.
Somebody coming. The King!
#PRINCESS.
Oh! I must fly!
#WOODCUTTER.
But you'll come back?
#PRINCESS.
Perhaps.
#KING.
Ah! and a seat all ready for us. How satisfying.
#QUEEN.
I don't know why you dragged me here.
#KING.
As I told you, my love, to be alone.
#QUEEN.
Well, you aren't alone.
#KING.
Pooh, he doesn't matter. . Well now, about these three Princes. They are getting on my mind rather. It is time we decided which one of them is to marry our beloved child. The trouble is to choose between them.
#QUEEN.
As regards appetite, there is nothing to choose between them. They are three of the heartiest eaters I have met for some time.
#KING.
You are right. The sooner we choose one of them, and send the other two about their business, the better. There were six peaches on the breakfast - table this morning. Did I get one? No.
#QUEEN.
Did I get one? No.
#KING.
Did our darling child get one - not that it matters? No.
#QUEEN.
It is a pity that the seven - headed bull died last year.
#KING.
Yes, he had a way of sorting out competitors for the hand of our beloved one that was beyond all praise. One could have felt quite sure that, had the three competitors been introduced to him, only one of them would have taken any further interest in the matter.
#QUEEN.
And even he mightn't have taken any interest in his meals.
#KING.
However, those days are over. We must think of a new test. Somehow I think that, in a son - in - law, moral worth is even more to be desired than mere brute strength. Now my suggestion is this: that you should disguise yourself as a beggar woman and approach each of the three princes in turn, supplicating their charity. In this way we shall discover which of the three has the kindest heart. What do you say, my dear?
#QUEEN.
An excellent plan. If you remember, I suggested it myself yesterday.
#KING.
Well, of course, it had been in my mind for some time. I don't claim that the idea is original; it has often been done in our family. Well then, if you will get ready, my dear, I will go and find our three friends and see that they come this way.
#PRINCESS.
Well, Woodcutter, what did I tell you?
#WOODCUTTER.
What did you tell me?
#PRINCESS.
Didn't you listen to what they said?
#WOODCUTTER.
I didn't listen, but I couldn't help hearing.
#PRINCESS.
Well, I couldn't help listening. And unless you stop it somehow, I shall be married to one of them to - night.
#WOODCUTTER.
Which one?
#PRINCESS.
The one with the kindest heart - whichever that is.
#WOODCUTTER.
Supposing they all three have kind hearts?
#PRINCESS.
They won't. They never have. In our circles when three Princes come together, one of them has a kind heart and the other two haven't. Haven't you read any History at all?
#WOODCUTTER.
I have no time for reading. But I think it's time History was altered a little. We'll alter it this afternoon.
#PRINCESS.
What do you mean?
#WOODCUTTER.
Leave this to me. I've got an idea.
#PRINCESS.
Oh, how clever of you! But what do you want me to do?
#WOODCUTTER.
You know the glade over there where the brook runs through it? Wait for me there.
#PRINCESS.
I obey my lord's commands.
#RED PRINCE.
Ah, fellow. . Fellow! . I said fellow!
#WOODCUTTER.
Were you speaking to me, my lord?
#RED PRINCE.
There is no other fellow here that I can see.
#WOODCUTTER.
Yes, you must have meant me.
#RED PRINCE.
Yes, of course I meant you, fellow. Have you seen the Princess come past this way? I was told she was waiting for me here.
#WOODCUTTER.
She is not here, my lord. My lord, are you one of the Princes who is seeking the hand of the Princess.
#RED PRINCE.
I am, fellow.
#WOODCUTTER.
His Majesty the King was here a while ago. He is to make his decision between you this afternoon. I think I can help you to be the lucky one, my lord.
#RED PRINCE.
You suggest that I take an unfair advantage over my fellow - competitors?
#WOODCUTTER.
I suggest nothing, my lord. I only say that I can help you.
#RED PRINCE.
Well, I will allow you to help me.
#WOODCUTTER.
Thank you. Then I will give you this advice. If a beggar woman asks you for a crust of bread this afternoon, remember - it is the test!
#RED PRINCE.
The test! But I haven't got a crust of bread!
#WOODCUTTER.
Wait here and I will get you one.
#RED PRINCE.
My good fellow, I am extremely obliged to you, and if ever I can do anything for you, such as returning a crust to you of similar size, or even lending you another slightly smaller one, or - Ah, thank you, my man, thank you.
#WOODCUTTER.
I would suggest, my lord, that you should take a short walk in this direction , and stroll back casually in a few minutes' time when the Queen is here.
#RED PRINCE.
Thank you, my man, thank you. WOODCUTTER. Hullo!
#BLUE PRINCE.
Hullo!
#WOODCUTTER.
What do you want?
#BLUE PRINCE.
The Princess.
#WOODCUTTER.
She's not here.
#BLUE PRINCE.
Oh!
#WOODCUTTER.
Are you one of the Princes who is wooing the Princess?
#BLUE PRINCE.
Yes.
#WOODCUTTER.
I believe I could help your Royal Highness.
#WOODCUTTER.
It would perhaps be not Quite fair to the others.
#BLUE PRINCE.
Don't mind.
#WOODCUTTER.
Well then, listen.
#BLUE PRINCE.
I'm listening.
#WOODCUTTER.
If you come back in five minutes, you will see a beggar woman sitting here. She will ask you for a crust of bread. You must give it to her, for it is the way His Majesty has chosen of testing your kindness of heart.
#BLUE PRINCE.
No bread.
#WOODCUTTER.
I will give you some.
#BLUE PRINCE.
Do.
#WOODCUTTER.
Here you are.
#BLUE PRINCE.
Thanks.
#WOODCUTTER.
Not at all, I'm very glad to have been able to help you.
#BLUE PRINCE.
Thanks.
#YELLOW PRINCE.
Ah, come hither, my man, come hither.
#WOODCUTTER.
You want me, sir?
#YELLOW PRINCE.
Come hither, my man. Tell me, has her Royal Highness the Princess passed this way lately?
#WOODCUTTER.
The Princess?
#YELLOW PRINCE.
Yes, the Princess, my bumpkin. But perhaps you have been too much concerned in your own earthy affairs to have noticed her. You - ah - cut wood, I see.
#WOODCUTTER.
Yes, sir, I am a woodcutter. most absorbing life. Some day we must have a long talk about it. But just now I have other business waiting for me. With your permission, good friend, I will leave you to your faggots.
#WOODCUTTER.
Beg your pardon, sir, but are you one of those Princes that want to marry our Princess?
#YELLOW PRINCE.
I had hoped, good friend, to obtain your permission to do so. I beg you not to refuse it.
#WOODCUTTER.
You are making fun of me, sir.
#YELLOW PRINCE.
Discerning creature.
#WOODCUTTER.
All the same, I can help you.
#YELLOW PRINCE.
Then pray do so, log - chopper, and earn my everlasting gratitude.
#WOODCUTTER.
The King has decided that whichever of you three Princes has the kindest heart shall marry his daughter.
#YELLOW PRINCE.
Then you will be able to bear witness to him that I have already wasted several minutes of my valuable time in condescending to a mere faggot - splitter. Tell him this and the prize is mine. Princess, I embrace you.
#WOODCUTTER.
The King will not listen to me. But if you return here in five minutes, you will find an old woman begging for bread. It is the test which their Majesties have arranged for you. If you share your last crust with her -
#YELLOW PRINCE.
Yes, but do I look as if I carried a last crust about with me?
#WOODCUTTER.
But see, I will give you one.
#YELLOW PRINCE.
Yes, but -
#WOODCUTTER.
Put it in your pocket, and when -
#YELLOW PRINCE.
But, my dear bark - scraper, have you no feeling for clothes at all? How can I put a thing like this in my pocket? I beg you to wrap it up. Here take this. Neatly, I pray you. Perhaps a little of this round it would make it more tolerable. You think so? I leave it to you. I trust your taste entirely. . Leaving a loop for the little finger, I entreat you . so. In about five minutes, you said? We will be there. We thank you.
#KING.
Now then, my love, if you will sit down on that log there - excellent - I think perhaps you should remove the crown. There! Now the disguise is perfect.
#QUEEN.
You're sure they are coming? It's a very uncomfortable seat.
#KING.
I told them that the Princess was waiting for them here. Their natural disappointment at finding I was mistaken will make the test of their good nature an even more exacting one. My own impression is that the Yellow Prince will be the victor.
#QUEEN.
Oh, I hate that man.
#KING.
Well, well, perhaps it will be the Blue one.
#QUEEN.
If anything, I dislike him more intensely.
#KING.
Or even the Red.
#QUEEN.
Ugh! I can't bear him.
#KING.
Fortunately, dear, you are not called upon to marry any of them. It is for our darling that we are making the great decision. Listen! I hear one coming. I will hide in the cottage and take note of what happens.
#QUEEN.
Oh, sir, can you kindly spare a crust of bread for a poor old woman! Please, pretty gentleman!
#BLUE PRINCE.
Bread . Bread . Ah! Bread!
#QUEEN.
Oh, thank you, sir. May you be rewarded for your gentle heart.
#BLUE PRINCE.
Thank you. blessing on you, sir.
#BLUE PRINCE.
Thank you. Bread.
#QUEEN.
Ah, you have saved the life of a poor old woman -
#BLUE PRINCE.
Eat it.
#QUEEN.
I - er - you - er -
#BLUE PRINCE.
What?
#QUEEN.
I'm almost too happy to eat, sir. Leave a poor old woman alone with her happiness, and -
#BLUE PRINCE.
Not too happy. Too weak. Help you eat. Good! . Again! Now! Last piece! Good. . Better now?
#QUEEN.
Much.
#BLUE PRINCE.
Good day.
#QUEEN.
Good day, kind gentleman.
#BLUE PRINCE.
Small piece left over. Good - bye.
#QUEEN.
Ugh! What a man!
#KING.
Well, well, my dear, we have discovered the winner.
#QUEEN.
Detestable person!
#KING.
The rest of the competition is of course more in the nature of a formality -
#QUEEN.
Thank goodness.
#KING.
However, I think that it will prevent unnecessary discussion afterwards if we - Take care, here is another one.
#QUEEN.
Could you spare a crust of bread, sir, for a poor hungry old woman? crust of bread, madam? Certainly. As luck will have it, I have a crust on me. My last one, but - your need is greater than mine. Eat, I pray.
#QUEEN.
Th - thank you, sir.
#RED PRINCE.
Not at all. Come, eat. Let me have the pleasure of seeing you eating.
#QUEEN.
M - might I take it home with me, pretty gentleman?
#RED PRINCE.
No, no. I must see you eating. Come! I will take no denial.
#QUEEN.
Th - thank you, sir. Won't you share it with me?
#RED PRINCE.
No, I insist on your having it all. I am in the mood to be generous. Oblige me by eating it now for I am in a hurry; yet I will not go until you have eaten. You eat but slowly. Did you deceive me when you said you were hungry?
#QUEEN.
N - no. I'm very hungry.
#RED PRINCE.
That's better. Now understand - however poor I am, I can always find a crust of bread for an old woman. Always! Remember this when next you are hungry. . You spoke? Finished?
#QUEEN.
Yes, thank you, pretty gentleman.
#RED PRINCE.
There's a piece on the ground there that you dropped. Finished?
#QUEEN.
Yes, thank you, pretty gentleman.
#RED PRINCE.
Then I will leave you, madam. Good morning.
#YELLOW PRINCE.
My poor woman, you are in distress. It pains me to see it, madam, it pains me terribly. Can it be that you are hungry? I thought so, I thought so. Give me the great pleasure, madam, of relieving your hunger. See , my own poor meal. Take it! It is yours.
#QUEEN.
I am not hungry.
#YELLOW PRINCE.
Ah, madam, I see what it is. You do not wish to deprive me. You tell yourself, perchance, that it is not fitting that one in your station of life should partake of the meals of the highly born. You are not used, you say, to the food of Princes. Your rougher palate -
#QUEEN.
Did you say food of princes?
#YELLOW PRINCE.
Where was I, madam? You interrupted me. No matter - eat. Ah, now I remember. I was saying that your rougher palate -
#QUEEN.
No! No! Not bread!
#YELLOW PRINCE.
Bread, madam, the staff of life. Come, madam, will you not eat? What can be more delightful than a crust of bread by the wayside?
#KING.
Quick, quick, find the Princess.
#YELLOW PRINCE.
The Princess - find the Princess!
#WOODCUTTER.
Go to her, but don't show that you know me.
#PRINCESS.
Father!
#KING.
Ah, my dear, you're just in time. Your mother -
#PRINCESS.
My mother?
#KING.
Yes, yes. A little plan of mine - of hers - your poor mother. Dear, dear!
#PRINCESS.
But what's the matter?
#KING.
She is suffering from a surfeit of bread, and -
#WOODCUTTER.
Poor old woman! She has fainted from exhaustion. Let me give her some -
#QUEEN.
No, no, not bread! I will not have any more bread.
#WOODCUTTER.
Drink this, my poor woman.
#QUEEN.
Did you say drink?
#PRINCESS.
Oh, sir, you have saved my mother's life!
#WOODCUTTER.
Not at all.
#KING.
I thank you, my man, I thank you.
#QUEEN.
My deliverer! Tell me who you are!
#PRINCESS.
It is my mother, the Queen, who asks you.
#WOODCUTTER.
The Queen!
#KING.
Yes, yes. Certainly, the Queen.
#WOODCUTTER.
Pardon, your Majesty. I am a woodcutter, who lives alone here, far away from courts.
#QUEEN.
Well, you've got more sense in your head than any of the Princes that I've seen lately. You'd better come to court.
#PRINCESS.
You will be very welcome, sir.
#QUEEN.
And you'd better marry the Princess.
#KING.
Isn't that perhaps going a little too far, dear?
#QUEEN.
Well, you wanted kindness of heart in your son - in - law, and you've got it. And he's got common sense too. Tell me, what do you think of bread as - as a form of nourishment?
#WOODCUTTER.
One can have too much of it.
#QUEEN.
Exactly my view. There you are, you see.
#KING.
Well, if you insist. The great thing, of course, is that our darling child should be happy.
#PRINCESS.
I will do my best, father.
#KING.
Then the marriage will take place this evening. Let the revels begin.
#CURATE.
Ah, our young friend, Oliver! And how are we this morning, dear lad?
#OLIVER TURTON.
All right, thanks.
#CURATE.
That's well, that's well. Deep in our studies, I see, deep in our studies. And what branch of Knowledge are we pursuing this morning?
#OLIVER TURTON.
"Marooned in the Pacific," or "The Pirate's Bride."
#CURATE.
Dear, dear, what will Miss Pinniger say to this interruption of our studies?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Silly old beast.
#CURATE.
Tut - tut, dear lad, that is not the way to speak of our mentors and preceptors. So refined and intelligent a lady as Miss Pinniger. Indeed I came here to see her this morning on a little matter of embroidered vestments. Where is she, dear lad?
#OLIVER TURTON.
It isn't nine yet.
#CURATE.
Past nine, past nine.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Je - hoshaphat!
#CURATE.
Oliver! Oliver! My dear lad! Swearing at your age! Really, I almost feel it my duty to inform your aunt -
#OLIVER TURTON.
Fat lot of swearing in just mentioning one of the Kings of Israel.
#CURATE.
Of Judah, dear boy, of Judah. To be ignorant on such a vital matter makes it even more reprehensible. I cannot believe that our dear Miss Pinniger has so neglected your education that -
#GOVERNESS.
Ah, Mr. Smilax; how pleasant to see you!
#CURATE.
My dear Miss Pinniger! You will forgive me for interrupting you in your labours, but there is a small matter of - ah! -
#GOVERNESS.
Certainly, Mr. Smilax. I will walk down to the gate with you. Oliver, where is Geraldine?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Aunt Jane wanted her.
#GOVERNESS.
Well, you should be at your lessons. It's nine o'clock. The fact that I am momentarily absent from the room should make no difference to your zeal.
#OLIVER TURTON.
No, Miss Pinniger.
#CURATE.
For men must work, Oliver, men must work. How doth the little busy bee - Yes, Miss Pinniger, I am with you.
#OLIVER TURTON.
It was a summer evening - It was a summer evening - Old Kaspar's work was done. It was a summer evening, Old Kaspar's work was done -
#JILL.
Where's Pin?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Hallo, Jill. Gone off with Dearly Belovéd. Her momentary absence from the room should make no difference to your zeal, my dear Geraldine. And what are we studying this morning, dear child? It was a summer evening, Old Kaspar's work was done.
#JILL.
Is that Pin?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Pin and Dearly Belovéd between them. She's a bit batey this morning.
#JILL.
And all my sums have done themselves wrong. What's nine times seven, Oliver?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Fifty - six. Old Kaspar's work was done. Jolly well wish mine was. And he before his cottage door. Fat lot of good my learning this stuff if I'm going to be a sailor. I bet Beatty didn't mind what happened to rotten old Kaspar when he saw a German submarine.
#JILL.
Six and carry five. Aunt Jane has sent for the doctor to look at my chest.
#OLIVER TURTON.
What's the matter with your chest?
#JILL.
I blew my nose rather loud at prayers this morning.
#OLIVER TURTON.
I say, Jill, you are going it!
#JILL.
It wasn't my fault, Oliver. Aunt Jane turned over two pages at once and made me laugh, so I had to turn it into a blow.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Bet you what you like she knew.
#JILL.
Of course she did, and she'll tell the doctor, and he'll be as beastly as he can. What did she say to you for being late?
#OLIVER TURTON.
I said somebody had bagged my sponge, and she wouldn't like me to come down to prayers all unsponged, and she said, "Excuses, Oliver, always excuses! Leave me. I will see you later." Suppose that means I've got to go to bed this afternoon. Jill, if I do, be sporty and bring me up "Marooned in the Pacific."
#JILL.
They'll lock the door. They always do.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Then I shall jolly well go up for a handkerchief this morning, and shove it in the bed, just in case. Cavé - here's Pin. returns to find them full of zeal.
#GOVERNESS.
Well, Oliver, have you learnt your piece of poetry?
#OLIVER TURTON.
I - I think so, Miss Pinniger.
#GOVERNESS.
Close the book, and stand up and say it. Well?
#OLIVER TURTON.
It was a summer evening -
#GOVERNESS.
The title and the author first, Oliver. Everything in its proper order.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Oh, I say, I didn't know I had to learn the title.
#JILL.
After Blenheim.
#GOVERNESS.
Geraldine, kindly attend to your own work.
#OLIVER TURTON.
After Blenheim. It was a summer evening.
#GOVERNESS.
After Blenheim, by Robert Southey. One of our greatest poets.
#OLIVER TURTON.
After Blenheim, by Robert Southey, one of our greatest poets. It was a summer evening, Old Kaspar's work was done - er - Old Kaspar's work was done - er - work was done, er .
#GOVERNESS.
And he before -
#OLIVER TURTON.
Oh yes, of course. And he before - er - and he before - er - It was a summer evening, Old Kaspar's work was done, and he before - er - and he before - Er, it was a summer evening -
#GOVERNESS.
So you have already said, Oliver.
#OLIVER TURTON.
I just seem to have forgotten this bit, Miss Pinniger. And he before -
#GOVERNESS.
Well, what was he before?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Blenheim? Oh no, it was after Blenheim.
#GOVERNESS.
His cottage door.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Oo, yes. And he before his cottage door was sitting in the sun. Was sitting in the sun. Er - er -
#GOVERNESS.
You have a cough, Oliver. Perhaps the doctor had better see you when he comes to see Geraldine.
#OLIVER TURTON.
It was just something tickling my throat, Miss Pinniger. Er - it was a summer evening.
#GOVERNESS.
You haven't learnt it, Oliver?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Yes, I have, Miss Pinniger, only I can't quite remember it. And he before his cottage door -
#GOVERNESS.
Is it any good, Geraldine, asking you if you have got any of your sums right?
#JILL.
I've got one, Miss Pinniger . nearly right . except for some of the figures.
#GOVERNESS.
Well, we shall have to spend more time at our lessons, that's all. This afternoon - ah - er -
#AUNT JANE.
I'm sorry to interrupt lessons, Miss Pinniger, but I have brought the Doctor to see Geraldine. You will like her to go to her room?
#DR. BEVAN.
No, no, dear lady. There is no need. Her pulse - dear, dear! Her tongue - tut - tut! A milk diet, plenty of rice - pudding, and perhaps she would do well to go to bed this afternoon.
#AUNT JANE.
I will see to it, doctor.
#JILL.
I feel quite well.
#DR. BEVAN.
A dangerous symptom. Plenty of rice - pudding.
#GOVERNESS.
Oliver was coughing just now.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Shut up!
#DR. BEVAN.
Ah! His pulse - tut - tut! His tongue - Dear, dear! The same treatment, dear lady, as prescribed in the other case.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Beast!
#AUNT JANE.
Castor - oil, liquorice - powder, ammoniated quinine - anything of that nature, doctor?
#DR. BEVAN.
As necessary, dear lady, as necessary. The system must be stimulated. Nature must be reinforced.
#AUNT JANE.
Which do they dislike least? and JILL. Liquorice - powder!
#DR. BEVAN.
Then concentrate on the other two, dear lady.
#AUNT JANE.
Thank you, doctor.
#GOVERNESS.
We will now go on with our lessons. Oliver, you will have opportunities in your bedroom this afternoon of learning your poetry. By the way, I had better have that book which you were reading when I came in just now.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Which book?
#JILL.
Miss Pinniger, if you're multiplying rods, poles, or perches by nine, does it matter if -
#GOVERNESS.
I am talking to Oliver, Geraldine. Where is that book, Oliver?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Oh, I know the one you mean. I must have put it down somewhere.
#GOVERNESS.
Perhaps you put it in your desk.
#OLIVER TURTON.
My desk?
#JILL.
You see, it's all gone wrong here, and I think I must have multiplied - I think I must have multiplied -
#GOVERNESS.
Thank you, I will take it.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Oh yes, this is the one.
#GOVERNESS.
And I will speak to your aunt at once about the behaviour of both of you.
#OLIVER TURTON.
I don't care.
#JILL.
I did try to help you, Oliver.
#OLIVER TURTON.
You wait. Won't I jolly well bag something of hers one day, just when she wants it.
#JILL.
I'm afraid you'll find the afternoon rather tiring without your book. What will you do?
#OLIVER TURTON.
I suppose I shall have to think.
#JILL.
What shall you think about?
#OLIVER TURTON.
I shall think I'm on my desert island.
#JILL.
Which desert island?
#OLIVER TURTON.
The one I always pretend I'm on when I'm thinking.
#JILL.
Isn't there any one else on it ever?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Oo, lots of pirates and Dyaks and cannibals and - other people.
#JILL.
What sort of other people?
#OLIVER TURTON.
I shan't tell you. This is a special think I thought last night. As soon as I thought of it, I decided to keep it for a moment of great emergency.
#JILL.
Oh! . Oliver? Yes?
#JILL.
Let me be on your desert island this time. Because I did try to help you.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Well - well - Well, you can if you like.
#JILL.
Oh, thank you, Oliver. Won't you tell me what it's about, and then we can both think it together this afternoon.
#OLIVER TURTON.
I expect you'll think all sorts of silly things that never happen on a desert island.
#JILL.
I'll try not to, Oliver, if you tell me.
#OLIVER TURTON.
All right.
#JILL.
Go on.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Well, you see, I've been wrecked, you see, and the ship has foundered with all hands, you see, and I've been cast ashore on a desert island, you see.
#JILL.
Haven't I been cast ashore too?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Well, you will be this afternoon, of course. Well, you see, we land on the island, you see, and it's a perfectly ripping island, you see, and - and we land on it, you see, and. . * * * * *
#OLIVER TURTON.
Tread carefully, Jill, there are lots of deadly rattlesnakes about.
#JILL.
Oli - ver!
#OLIVER TURTON.
You hear the noise of their rattles sometimes when the sun is sinking behind the swamp. There!
#JILL.
Oh, Oliver, are they very deadly? Because if they are, I don't think I shall like your island.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Those aren't. I always have their teeth taken out when ladies are coming. Besides, it's daylight now.
#JILL.
Oh, what a lovely island! I think it's lovely, Oliver.
#OLIVER TURTON.
It's pretty decent, isn't it? Won't you lie down? I generally lie down here and watch the turtles coming out of the sea to deposit their eggs on the sand.
#JILL.
How many do they de - deposit usually, Oliver?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Oh, three - or a hundred. Just depends how hungry I am. Have a bull's - eye, won't you?
#JILL.
Oh, did you bring some?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Bring some? Oh, you mean from the wreck?
#JILL.
Yes, from the wreck. I mean besides the axe and the bag of nails and the gunpowder.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Couldn't. The ship sank with all hands before I could get them. But it doesn't matter, because I recognise this as the bull's - eye tree.
#JILL.
Oh, Oliver, how lovely! Thank you.
#OLIVER TURTON.
There was nothing but breadfruit trees here the first time I was marooned on it. Rotten things to have on a decent island. So I planted a bull's - eye tree, and a barley - sugar - cane grove, and one or two other things, and made a jolly ripping place of it.
#JILL.
What's that tree over there?
#OLIVER TURTON.
That one? Rice - pudding tree.
#JILL.
Oliver! Take me back to the boat at once.
#OLIVER TURTON.
I say, shut up, Jill. You didn't think I meant it for you, did you?
#JILL.
But there's only you and me on the island.
#OLIVER TURTON.
What about the domestic animals? I suppose they've got to eat.
#JILL.
Oh, how lovely! Have we got a goat and a parrot, and a - a -
#OLIVER TURTON.
Much better than that. Look in that cage there.
#JILL.
Oh, is that a cage? I never noticed it. What do I do?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Here, I'll show you What do you think of that?
#JILL.
Oliver!
#OLIVER TURTON.
I thought of that in bed one night. Spiffing idea, isn't it? I've got some other ones in the plantation over there. Awfully good specimens. I feed 'em on rice - pudding.
#JILL.
Can this one talk?
#OLIVER TURTON.
I'm teaching it. Come up there.
#DR. BEVAN.
Ninety - nine, ninety - nine .
#OLIVER TURTON.
That's all it can say at present. I'm going to give it a swim in the lagoon to - morrow. I want to see if there are any sharks. If there aren't, then we can bathe there afterwards.
#JILL.
Have you given it a name yet? I think I should like to call it Fluffkins.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Righto! Good night, Fluffkins. Time little doctors were in bed.
#JILL.
Well, I think it's a lovely island.
#OLIVER TURTON.
If there's anything you want, you know, you've only got to say so. Pirates or anything like that. There's a ginger - beer well if you're thirsty.
#JILL.
I'm quite happy, Oliver, thank you.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Jill, you didn't ever want to marry a pirate, did you?
#JILL.
I hadn't thought about it much, Oliver dear.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Because I can get you an awfully decent pirate, if you like, and if I was his brother - in - law it would be ripping. I've often been marooned with him, of course, but never as his brother - in - law.
#JILL.
Why don't you marry his daughter and be his son - in - law?
#OLIVER TURTON.
He hasn't got a daughter.
#JILL.
Well, you could think him one.
#OLIVER TURTON.
I don't want to. If ever I'm such a silly ass as to marry, which I'm jolly well not going to be, I shall marry a - a dusky maiden. Jill, be sporty. All girls have to get married some time. It's different with men.
#JILL.
Very well, Oliver. I don't want to spoil your afternoon.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Good biz.
#PIRATE CHIEF.
Gentles, your servant. Commodore Crookshank, at your service. Better known on the Spanish Main as One - eared Eric.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Glad to meet you, Commodore. I'm - er - Two - toed Thomas, the Terror of the Dyaks. But you may call me Oliver, if you like. This is my sister Jill - the Pride of the Pampas.
#PIRATE CHIEF.
Charmed!
#JILL.
Don't mention it, Commodore.
#OLIVER TURTON.
My sister wants to marry you. Er - carry on.
#JILL.
Won't you sit down, Commodore?
#PIRATE CHIEF.
Thank you, madam. The other side if I may. I shall hear better if you condescend to accept me.
#JILL.
Oh, I'm so sorry! I was forgetting about your ear.
#PIRATE CHIEF.
Don't mention it. A little discussion in the La Plata river with a Spanish gentleman. At the end of it I was an ear short and he was a head short. It was considered in the family that I had won.
#JILL.
Well, Commodore?
#PIRATE CHIEF.
Won't you call me Eric?
#JILL.
I am waiting, Eric.
#PIRATE CHIEF.
Madam, I am not a marrying man, not to any extent, but if you would care to be Mrs. Crookshank, I'd undertake on my part to have the deck swabbed every morning, and to put a polish on the four - pounder that you could see your pretty face in.
#JILL.
Eric, how sweet of you. But I think you must speak to my brother in the library first. Oli - ver!
#OLIVER TURTON.
Hallo! Settled it?
#JILL.
It's all settled, Oliver, between Eric and myself, but you will want to ask him about his prospects, won't you?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Yes, yes, of course.
#PIRATE.
I shall be very glad to tell you anything I can, sir. I think I may say that I am doing fairly well in my profession.
#OLIVER TURTON.
What's your ship? A sloop or a frigate? brigantine.
#JILL.
Oh, that's what Oliver puts on his hair when he goes to a party.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Shut up, Jill! A brigantine? Ah yes, a rakish craft, eh, Commodore?
#PIRATE.
Extremely rakish.
#OLIVER TURTON.
And how many pieces of eight have you?
#PIRATE.
Nine thousand.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Ah! What's nine times eight?
#JILL.
Nine times eight.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Nine times eight.
#PIRATE.
Nine times eight.
#JILL.
Seventy - two.
#PIRATE.
I made it seventy - one, but I expect you're right.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Then you've seventy - two thousand pieces altogether?
#PIRATE.
Yes, sir, about that.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Any doubloons?
#PIRATE.
Hundreds of 'em.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Ingots of gold?
#PIRATE.
Lashings of 'em.
#JILL.
And he's going to polish up the four - pounder until I can see my face in it.
#OLIVER TURTON.
I was just going to ask you about your guns. You've got 'em fore and aft of course?
#PIRATE.
Yes, sir. A four - pounder fore and a half - pounder haft.
#OLIVER TURTON.
And do you ever have brothers - in - law in your ship?
#PIRATE.
Well, I never have had yet, but I have always been looking about for one.
#JILL.
Oh, Oliver, isn't Eric a nice man?
#OLIVER TURTON.
I suppose the captain's brother - in - law is generally the first man to board the Spaniard with his cutlass between his teeth?
#PIRATE.
You might almost say always. Many a ship on the Spanish Main I've had to leave unboarded through want of a brother - in - law. They're touchy about it somehow. Unless the captain's brother - in - law comes first they get complaining.
#OLIVER TURTON.
And there's just one other thing. If the brigantine happened to put in at an island for water, and the captain's brother - in - law happened - just happened - to be a silly ass and go and marry a dusky maiden, whom he met on the beach -
#PIRATE.
Bless you, it's always happening to a captain's brother - in - law.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Then, Captain Crookshank, you may take my sister!
#JILL.
Thank you, Oliver.
#JILL.
I'm so pleased to meet my brother's future wife. It's so nice of you to come to see me. You will have some tea, won't you? I wanted to see you, because I can tell you so many little things about my brother, which I think you ought to know. You see, Eric - my husband -
#TUA-HEETA.
Ereec?
#JILL.
Yes. I wish you could see him. He's so nice - looking. But I'm afraid he won't be home to tea. That's the worst of marrying a sailor. They are away so much. Well, I was telling you about Oliver. I think it would be better if you knew at once that - he doesn't like rice - pudding.
#TUA-HEETA.
Rice - poodeeng?
#JILL.
Yes, he hates it. It is very important that you should remember that. Then there's another thing - He dislikes - Oh, there you are, Jane. You've been a very long time answering the bell.
#AUNT JANE.
I'm so sorry ma'am, I was just dressing.
#JILL.
Excuses, Jane, always excuses. Leave me. Take a week's notice. YOU must excuse my maid. She's very stupid. Tea at once, Jane. What was I saying? Oh yes, about Oliver. He doesn't care for cod - liver oil in the way that some men do. You would be wise not to force it on him just at first. . Have you any idea where you are going to live?
#TUA-HEETA.
Live?
#JILL.
I expect Oliver will wish to reside at Hammersmith, so convenient for the City. You'll like Hammersmith. You'll go to St. Paul's Church, I expect. The Vicar will be sure to call. Ah, here's tea. You're very slow, Jane.
#AUNT JANE.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
#JILL.
It's no good being sorry. Take another week's notice. You must forgive my talking to my maid. She wants such a lot of looking after. That will do, Jane, Dear, dear, how clumsy you are. What wages am I giving you now? shilling a month, ma'am.
#JILL.
Well, we'd better make it ninepence. Servants are a great nuisance, aren't they? Jane is a peculiarly stupid person. She used to be aunt to my brother, and I have only taken her on out of charity. Milk? Sugar?
#TUA-HEETA.
Thank you.
#JILL.
I hope you like China. Well, as I was saying - You can clear away, Jane.
#AUNT JANE.
Yes, ma'am.
#JILL.
Oh, Oliver, I love your island. I've been thinking things all by myself. You're married to Tua - heeta. You don't mind, do you?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Not at all, Jill. Make yourself at home. I've just been trying the doctor in the lagoon. There were sharks there, after all, so we'll have to find another place for bathing. Oh, and I shot an elephant. What would you like to do now?
#JILL.
Just let's lie here and see what happens. Oh, what a lovely bird! Is it an ostrich?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Silly! It's a cassowary, of course.
#JILL.
What's a cassowary?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Jill! Don't you remember the rhyme? I wish I were a cassowary Upon the plains of Timbuctoo And then I'd eat a missionary - And hat and gloves and hymn - book too!
#JILL.
Is that all they're for?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Well, what else would you want them for?
#MISSIONARY.
I am sorry to intrude upon your privacy, dear friends, but have you observed a cassowary on this island, apparently looking for something?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Yes, we saw one just now.
#MISSIONARY.
Dear, dear, dear. You didn't happen to ask him what was the object of his researches?
#JILL.
He went so quickly.
#MISSIONARY.
I wonder if you have ever heard of a little rhyme which apparently attributes to the bird in question, when residing in the level pastures of Timbuctoo, an unholy lust for the body and appurtenances thereto of an unnamed clerical gentleman? and JILL. Yes! Rather!
#MISSIONARY.
Dear, dear! Fortunately - I say fortunately - this is not Timbuctoo! I take it that a cassowary residing in other latitudes is of a more temperate habit. His appetite, I venture to suggest, dear lady, would be under better restraint. That being so, I may perhaps safely - Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear! This is terrible! You said, I think, that the - ah - bird in question was moving in this direction?
#OLIVER TURTON.
That's right.
#MISSIONARY.
Then I shall move, hastily yet with all due precaution, in that direction. I beg your - Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear!
#CANNIBAL.
Boria, boria, boo!
#MISSIONARY.
Yes, my dear sir, it is as you say, a beautiful morning.
#CANNIBAL.
Boria, boria, boo!
#MISSIONARY.
But I was just going a little walk - in this direction - if you will permit me.
#CANNIBAL.
Boria, boria, boo!
#MISSIONARY.
I have noticed it, my dear sir, I have often made that very observation to my parishioners.
#CANNIBAL.
Boria, boria, boo!
#MISSIONARY.
Oh, what's he saying?
#OLIVER TURTON.
He says it's his birthday to - morrow.
#CANNIBAL.
Wurra, wurra wug!
#OLIVER TURTON.
And will you come to the party?
#MISSIONARY.
My dear sir, it is most kind of you to invite me, but a prior engagement in a different part of the country - a totally unexpected call upon me in another locality - will unfortunately -
#MISSIONARY.
Come in! . As I was saying, my dear sir - Can't you see I'm engaged - Oh dear, dear, dear, dear, dear!
#PIRATE.
Steward! Steward!
#STEWARD.
Yes, sir, coming, sir.
#THE CHIEF.
Now then, tumble up, my lad. I would carouse. Circulate the dry ginger.
#STEWARD.
Yes, sir, going, sir.
#THE CHIEF.
Look lively, my lad, look lively.
#STEWARD.
Yes, sir, coming, sir.
#THE CHIEF.
Gentlemen! The crew of the Cocktail will carouse - One! Two! Three! Four! So! . Steward!
#STEWARD.
Yes, sir, here, sir.
#THE CHIEF.
The carouse is over.
#STEWARD.
Yes, sir.
#THE CHIEF.
Having passed an hour thus in feasting and song -
#GOVERNESS.
Oliver! Oliver! Jill! You may get up now and come down to tea.
#THE CHIEF.
Having, as I say, slept off our carouse -
#GOVERNESS.
Oliver! Jill! Oh, I beg your pardon, I - er -
#THE CHIEF.
Pray do not mention it. You were asking - was l - looking for a small boy - Oliver -
#THE CHIEF.
Oliver? Have we any Olivers on board? 1ST PIRATE. NO, Captain. Only Bath Olivers.
#THE CHIEF.
You cannot be referring to my brother - in - law, hight Two - Toed Thomas, the Terror of the Dyaks?
#GOVERNESS.
Oh no, no - Just a small boy and his sister - Jill.
#THE CHIEF.
Have we any Jills on board? 2ND PIRATE. No, Captain. Only gills of rum.
#THE CHIEF.
You cannot be referring to Mrs. Crookshank, styled the Pride of the Pampas?
#GOVERNESS.
Oh no, no, I am so sorry. Perhaps I - er -
#THE CHIEF.
Wait, woman. Ernest, offer your seat to the lady.
#GOVERNESS.
Oh please don't trouble, I'm getting out at the next station - I mean I - 6TH PIRATE. Sit down!
#THE CHIEF.
Thank you. Cecil, have you your pencil and notebook with you? 1ST PIRATE. Ay, ay, Captain.
#THE CHIEF.
Then we will cross - examine the prisoner. Name?
#GOVERNESS.
Pinniger. 1ST PIRATE. Pincher.
#THE CHIEF.
Christian names, if any?
#GOVERNESS.
Letitia. 1ST PIRATE. Letisher - how would you spell it, Captain?
#THE CHIEF.
Spell it like a sneeze. Age?
#GOVERNESS.
Twenty - three.
#THE CHIEF.
Habits - untruthful. Appearance - against her. Got that? 1ST PIRATE. Yes, sir.
#THE CHIEF.
And what are you for?
#GOVERNESS.
I teach. Oliver and Jill, you know.
#THE CHIEF.
And what do you teach them?
#GOVERNESS.
Oh, everything. Arithmetic, French, Geography, History, Dancing -
#THE CHIEF.
A moment! I would take counsel with Percy. Percy, what shall we ask her in Arithmetic? Excellent. If you really are a teacher as you say, answer me this question. The brigantine Cocktail is in longitude 40° 39' latitude 22° 50', sailing closehauled on the port tack at 8 knots in a 15 - knot nor' - nor' westerly breeze - how soon before she sights the Azores?
#GOVERNESS.
I - I - I'm afraid I - You see - I -
#THE CHIEF.
Arithmetic rotten. 1ST PIRATE. Arithmetic rotten.
#THE CHIEF.
Basil, ask her a question in French. 3RD PIRATE. What would the mate of a French frigate say if he wanted to say in French, "Avast there, ye lubbering swab" to a friend like?
#GOVERNESS.
Oh, but I hardly - I -
#THE CHIEF.
French futile. 1ST PIRATE. French futile.
#THE CHIEF.
I don't suppose it's much use, Francis. But try her in Geography. 4TH PIRATE. Well now, lady. If you was wanting a nice creek to lay up cosy in, atween Dago Point and the Tortofitas, where would you run to?
#GOVERNESS.
It - run to? But that isn't - of course I -
#THE CHIEF.
Geography ghastly. 1ST PIRATE. Geography ghastly.
#THE CHIEF.
Give her a last chance, Mervyn. See if she knows any history. 5TH PIRATE. I suppose you couldn't tell me what year it was when old John Cann took the Saucy Codfish over Black Tooth Reef and laid her alongside the Spaniard in the harbour there, and up comes the Don in his nightcap. "Shiver my timbers," he says in Spanish, "but there's only one man in the whole of the Spanish Main," he says, "and that's John Cann," he says, "who could - "
#THE CHIEF.
She couldn't. History hopeless. 1ST PIRATE. History hopeless.
#THE CHIEF.
What else do you teach?
#GOVERNESS.
Music, dancing - er - but I don't think -
#THE CHIEF.
Steward!
#STEWARD.
Yes, sir, coming, sir.
#THE CHIEF.
Concertina.
#STEWARD.
Yes, sir, going, sir.
#THE CHIEF.
Can you dance a hornpipe?
#GOVERNESS.
No, I -
#THE CHIEF.
Dancing dubious. 1ST PIRATE. Dancing dubious.
#STEWARD.
Concertina, sir.
#THE CHIEF.
Give it to the woman.
#GOVERNESS.
I'm afraid I - 1ST PIRATE. What shall I say, sir? Music mouldy or music measly?
#THE CHIEF.
Gentlemen, I think you will agree with me that the woman Pinniger has proved that she is utterly incapable of teaching anybody anything. Twenty - five years, man and boy, I have sailed the Spanish Main, and with the possible exception of a dumb and half - witted negro whom I shipped as cook in '64, I have never met any one so profoundly lacking in intellect. I propose, therefore, that for the space of twenty - four hours the woman Pinniger should be incarcerated in the smuggler's cave, in the company of a black beetle of friendly temperament.
#GOVERNESS.
Mercy! Mercy! 1ST PIRATE. I should like to second that.
#THE CHIEF.
Those in favour - ay! Contrary - No! The motion is carried. maiden in distress! I will rescue her. Oh! Carry on, Commodore.
#THE CHIEF.
Go, find that black beetle, and having found it, introduce it circumspectly by the back door.
#PIRATES.
Ay, ay, sir.
#OLIVER TURTON.
All the same, you know, I jolly well should like to rescue somebody.
#JILL.
Oo, rescue me, Oliver.
#THE CHIEF.
Two - toed Thomas, Terror of the Dyaks, and Pest of the North Pacific, truly thou art a well - plucked one. Wilt fight me for the wench?
#OLIVER TURTON.
I will.
#THE CHIEF.
Swords?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Pistols.
#THE CHIEF.
At twenty paces?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Across a handkerchief.
#THE CHIEF.
Done! Have you got a handkerchief? I think I must have left mine on the dressing - table.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Mine's rather - Jill, haven't you got one?
#JILL.
I know I had one, but I -
#THE CHIEF.
This is an ill business. Five - and - thirty duels have I fought - and never before been delayed for lack of a handkerchief.
#JILL.
Ah, here it is.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Jill, you must give the word. JILL. Are you ready?
#THE CHIEF.
Listen! The Spanish Fleet is engaged!
#JILL.
I thought it was our tea gong.
#THE CHIEF.
Ah, perhaps you're right.
#OLIVER TURTON.
I say, we oughtn't to miss tea. Come on, Jill.
#THE CHIEF.
But you'll come back? We shall always be waiting here for you whenever you want us.
#JILL.
Yes, we'll come back, won't we, Oliver?
#OLIVER TURTON.
Oo, rather.
#JILL.
Good - bye, good - bye.
#OLIVER TURTON.
Good - bye, you chaps.
#JILL.
And thank you all for a very pleasant afternoon.
#MR.
and MRS. HUBBARD, in faultless evening dress, are at home, MR. reading a magazine, MRS. HUBBARD with her hands in her lap. She sighs.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Dearest, you sighed?
#MRS. HUBBARD.
No, no, Henry. In a luxurious and well - appointed home such as this, why should I sigh?
#MR. HUBBARD.
True, dear. Not only is it artistically furnished, as you say, but it is also blessed with that most precious of all things - a library.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Yes, yes, Henry, we have much to be thankful for.
#MR. HUBBARD.
We have indeed. But I am selfish. Would you care to read?
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Thank you, thank you, Henry.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Darling, you did sigh. Tell me what grieves you.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Little Isabel. Her cough troubles me.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Isabel?
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Yes, dear, our youngest. Don't you remember, she comes after Harold?
#MR. HUBBARD.
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I - dear me, have we got nine already?
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Darling, say you don't think it's too many.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Oh no, no, not at all, my love . After all, it isn't as if they were real children.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Henry! How can you say they are not real?
#MR. HUBBARD.
Well, I mean they're only the children we thought we'd like to have if Father Christmas gave us any.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
They are just as real to me as if they were here in the house. Ada, Bertram, Caroline, the high - spirited Dennis, pretty Elsie with the golden ringlets, dear little fair - haired Frank -
#MR. HUBBARD.
Darling one, Frank has curly brown hair. It was an understood thing that you should choose the girls, and I should choose the boys. When we decided to take - A, B, C, D, E, F - a sixth child, it was my turn for a boy, and I selected Frank. He has curly brown hair and a fondness for animals.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
I daresay you're right, dear. Of course it is a little confusing when you never see your children.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Well, well, perhaps some day Father Christmas will give us some.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Why does he neglect us so, Henry? We hang up our stockings every year, but he never seems to notice them. Even a diamond necklace or a few oranges or a five - shilling postal order would be something.
#MR. HUBBARD.
It is very strange. Possibly the fact that the chimney has not been swept for some years may have something to do with it. Or he may have forgotten our change of address. I cannot help feeling that if he knew how we had been left to starve in this way he would be very much annoyed.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
And clothes. I have literally nothing but what I am standing up in - I mean sitting down in.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Nor I, my love. But at least it will be written of us in the papers that the Hubbards perished in faultless evening dress. We are a proud race, and if Father Christmas deliberately cuts us off in this way, let us go down proudly. . Shall we go on reading or would you like to walk up and down the room? Fortunately these simple pleasures are left to us.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
I've finished this page.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Have another, my love.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Some one at the door! Who could it be?
#MR. HUBBARD.
Just make the room look a little more homey, dear, in case it's any one important.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Well?
#MR. HUBBARD.
A letter.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Quick!
#MR. HUBBARD.
Father Christmas! An invitation to Court! "Father Christmas at Home, 25th December. Jollifications, 11.59 P.M." My love, he has found us at last!
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Henry, how gratifying!
#MR. HUBBARD.
Yes. But we can't go.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
No, I have no clothes.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Nor I.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
How can I possibly go without a diamond necklace? None of the Montmorency - Smythe women has ever been to Court without a diamond necklace.
#MR. HUBBARD.
The Hubbards are a proud race. No male Hubbard would dream of appearing at Court without a gentleman's gold Albert watch - chain. . Besides, there is another thing. There will be many footmen at Father Christmas's Court, who will doubtless require coppers pressed into their palms. My honour would be seriously affected, were I compelled to whisper to them that I had no coppers.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
It is very unfortunate. Father Christmas may have hundreds of presents waiting for us.
#MR. HUBBARD.
True. But how would it be to hang up our stockings again this evening - now that we know he knows we are here? I would suggest tied on to the door - knocker, to save him the trouble of coming down the chimney.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Henry, I wonder! But of course we will.
#MR. HUBBARD.
I almost wish now that my last suit had been a knickerbocker one. However, we must do what we can with a sock.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
I hope Father Christmas won't give me a bicycle. A stocking never sets so well after it has had a bicycle in it.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Now, dear, I will go down and put them in position. Let us hope that fortune will be kind to us.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Let us hope so, darling. And quickly. For it is a trifle cold.
#PETER ABLEWAYS.
Friends, are we all assembled?
#JONAS HUMPHREY.
Ay, ay, Peter Ableways, assembled and met together in a congregation, for the purpose of lifting up our voices in joyous thanksgiving, videlicet the singing of a carol or other wintry melody.
#JENNIFER LING.
Keep your breath for your song, Master Humphrey. That last "Alleluia" of yours was a poor windy thing, lacking grievously in substance.
#JONAS.
It is so. I never made much of an Alleluia. It is not in my nature somehow. 'Tis a vain boastful thing an Alleluia.
#MARTHA PORRITT.
Are we to begin soon, Master Ableways? My feet are cold.
#JONAS.
What matter the feet, Martha Porritt, if the heart be warm with loving - kindness and seasonable emotions?
#MARTHA.
Well, nothing of me will be warm soon.
#JENNIFER.
Ay, let's begin, Peter Ableways, while we carry the tune in our heads. It is ill searching for the notes in the middle of the carol, as some singers do.
#PETER.
Well spoken, Mistress Jennifer. Now listen all, while I unfold the nature of the entertainment. Item - A carol or birth song to draw the attention of all folk to the company here assembled and the occasion celebrated. Item - Applause and the clapping of hands. Item - A carol or song of thanksgiving. Item - A collection.
#JONAS.
An entertainment well devised, Master Ableways, sobeit the words of the second song remain with me after I am delivered of the first.
#MARTHA.
Are we to begin soon, Master Ableways? My feet are cold.
#PETER.
Are we all ready, friends? I will say one - two - three - and at "three" I pray you all to give it off in a hearty manner from the chest. One - two -
#JONAS.
Hold, hold, Master Ableways! Does it begin - No, that's the other one. Ay, ay - I have it now - and bursting to get out of me. Proceed, Peter Ableways.
#PETER.
One - two - three -
#PETER.
Well sung, all.
#HUMPHREY.
The applause followed, good Master Peter, as ordained. Moreover, I have the tune of the second song ready within me. Likewise a la - la - la or two to replace such words as I have forgotten.
#MARTHA.
Don't forget the collection, Master Ableways.
#PETER.
Ay, the collection.
#HUMPHREY.
Nay, not so fast, Master Peter. It would be ill if the good folk thought that our success this night were to be estimated by an empty hat. Place some of our money in it, Master Ableways. Where money is, money will come.
#JENNIFER.
Ay, it makes a pleasing clink.
#PETER.
True, Mistress Jennifer. Master Humphrey speaks true.
#MARTHA.
Are we to go on, Master Ableways? My feet are cold.
#PETER.
So, a warming noise.
#HUMPHREY.
To it again, gentles.
#PETER.
Are all ready? One - two - three!
#PETER.
Well sung, all.
#HUMPHREY.
Have you the hat, Master Peter?
#PETER.
Ay, friend, all is ready.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Good evening, friends.
#PETER.
Good evening, sir.
#MR. HUBBARD.
What is this? Aha! Money!
#PETER.
Remember the carol singers, sir.
#MR. HUBBARD.
My dear friends, I will always remember you. This is most generous. I shall never forget your kindness. This is most unexpected. But not the less welcome, not the less - I think there's a ha'penny down there that I missed - thank you. As I was saying, unexpected but welcome. I thank you heartily. Good evening, friends.
#PETER.
Well! . Well! . Well, friends, let us to the next house. We have got all that we can get here.
#MARTHA.
Master Ableways!
#PETER.
Ay, lass!
#MARTHA.
My feet aren't so cold now.
#BILL.
Wotcher get, Liz? 'Ow's that?
#LIZZIE.
H'st!
#BILL.
What is it?
#LIZZIE.
Copper!
#BILL.
'Ere, quick, get rid of these. 'Ide 'em in the snow, or -
#LIZZIE.
Bill! Look! We can come back for 'em as soon as 'e's gone.
#POLICEMAN.
Now then, move along there.
#MR. HUBBARD.
My darling, what do you think? Father Christmas has sent you a little present.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Henry! Has he sent you one too?
#MR. HUBBARD.
Observe!
#MRS. HUBBARD.
How sweet of him! I wonder what mine is. What is yours, darling?
#MR. HUBBARD.
I haven't looked yet, my love. Perhaps just a few nuts or something of that sort, with a card attached saying, "To wish you the old, old wish." We must try not to be disappointed, whatever it is, darling.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Of course, Henry. After all, it is the kindly thought which really matters.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Certainly. All the same, I hope - Will you look in yours, dear, first, or shall I?
#MRS. HUBBARD.
I think I should like to, darling. It feels so exciting. Henry!
#MR. HUBBARD.
My love! Now you will be able to go to Court. You must say that your husband is unfortunately in bed with a bad cold. You can tell me all about it when you come home. I shall be able to amuse myself with -
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Henry! My love! gentleman's gold hunter and Albert watch - chain. My darling!
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Let's put them on at once, Henry, and see how they suit us.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Allow me, my love.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Now I feel really dressed again! Oh, I wish we had a looking - glass.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Try in here, my darling.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
How perfectly sweet! . Now let me put your watch - chain on for you, dear.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Does it suit me, darling?
#MRS. HUBBARD.
You look fascinating, Henry!
#MR. HUBBARD.
Well, well, we ought to be starting. My watch makes it 11.58. Hasn't it got a sweet tick?
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Sweet! But starting where, Henry? Do you mean we can really - But you haven't any money.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Money? Heaps of it.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Father Christmas?
#MR. HUBBARD.
Undoubtedly, my love. Brought round to the front door just now by some of his messengers. By the way, dear - hadn't we better put these on before we start?
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Of course. How silly of me!
#MR. HUBBARD.
Really this is a very handsome watch - chain.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
It becomes you admirably, Henry.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Thank you, dear. There's just one little point. Father Christmas is sometimes rather shy about acknowledging the presents he gives. He hates being thanked. If, therefore, he makes any comment on your magnificent necklace or my handsome watch - chain, we must say that they have been in the family for some years.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Of course, dear.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Well, now we're ready.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Darling one, don't you think we might bring the children?
#MR. HUBBARD.
Of course, dear! How forgetful of me! . Children - 'shun! Number! Right turn!
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Darling one, I almost seem to hear them!
#MR. HUBBARD.
Are you ready, my love?
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Yes, Henry.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Quick march!
#SEVERAL USHERS.
Father Christmas!
#FATHER CHRISTMAS.
Good evening, everybody. 1ST USHER. Mr. and Mrs. Henry Hubbard!
#MR. HUBBARD.
Thank you, my man, thank you. 2ND USHER. Mr. and Mrs. Henry Hubbard.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Not at all, my man, not at all.
#FATHER CHRISTMAS.
I am delighted to welcome you to my Court. How are you both?
#MR. HUBBARD.
Very well, thank you, sir. My wife has a slight cold in one foot, owing to -
#MRS. HUBBARD.
A touch of gout, sir, inherited from my ancestors, the Montmorency - Smythes.
#FATHER CHRISTMAS.
Dear me, it won't prevent you dancing, I hope?
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Oh no, sir.
#FATHER CHRISTMAS.
That's right. We shall have a few more friends coming in soon. You have been giving each other presents already, I see. I congratulate you, madam, on your husband's taste.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Oh no, this is a very old heirloom of the Montmorency - Smythe family.
#MR. HUBBARD.
An ancestress of Mrs. Hubbard's - a lady - in - waiting at the Tottenham Court - at the Tudor Court - was fortunate enough to catch the eye of - er -
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Elizabeth.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Queen Elizabeth, and - er -
#FATHER CHRISTMAS.
I see. You are lucky, madam, to have such beautiful jewels. And this delightful gold Albert watch - chain -
#MR. HUBBARD.
Presented to an ancestor of mine, Sir Humphrey de Hubbard, at the battle of - er -
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Agincourt.
#MR. HUBBARD.
As you say, dear, Agincourt. By King Richard the - I should say William the - well, by the King.
#FATHER CHRISTMAS.
How very interesting.
#MR. HUBBARD.
Yes. My ancestor clove a scurvy knave from the chaps to the chine. I don't quite know how you do that, but I gather that he inflicted some sort of a scratch upon his adversary, and the King rewarded him with this handsome watch - chain.
#USHERS.
Mr. Robinson Crusoe!
#FATHER CHRISTMAS.
How do you do?
#CRUSOE.
I'm a little late, I'm afraid, sir. My raft was delayed by adverse gales.
#USHERS.
Miss Riding Hood!
#FATHER CHRISTMAS.
How do you do?
#RIDING HOOD.
I hope I am in time, sir. I had to look in on my grandmother on the way here.
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Do come and see me, Mr. Crusoe. Any Friday. I should like your advice about my parrot. He's moulting in all the wrong places.
#MR. HUBBARD.
I don't know if you're interested in wolves at all, Miss Hood. I heard a very good story about one the other day.
#USHERS.
Baron Bluebeard!
#FATHER CHRISTMAS.
How do you do?
#BLUEBEARD.
I trust you have not been waiting for me, sir. I had a slight argument with my wife before starting, which delayed me somewhat.
#USHERS.
Princess Goldilocks!
#FATHER CHRISTMAS.
How do you do?
#GOLDILOCKS.
I brought the youngest bear with me - do you mind? Say, how do you do, darling? Will you give him a little porridge, please, and if you have got a nice bed where he could rest a little afterwards - he gets tired so quickly.
#USHER.
Certainly, your Royal Highness.
#GOLDILOCKS.
Are we going to dance? How lovely!
#FATHER CHRISTMAS.
You will dance, won't you?
#MRS. HUBBARD.
I think not just at first, thank you.
#GOLDILOCKS.
Come along!
#CRUSOE.
I am a little out of practice - er - but if you don't mind - er -
#BLUEBEARD.
May I have the pleasure?
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Be careful, dear; he has a very bad reputation.
#RIDING HOOD.
You don't eat people, do you?
#BLUEBEARD.
Never!
#RIDING HOOD.
Oh then, I don't mind. But I do hate being eaten.
#CRUSOE.
Princess Goldilocks, may I speak to you on a matter of some importance to me?
#GOLDILOCKS.
I wish you would.
#CRUSOE.
Alone.
#GOLDILOCKS.
Do you mind? You can have your turn afterwards.
#BLUEBEARD.
Shall we adjourn to the Buffet?
#RIDING HOOD.
Oh, do let's.
#CRUSOE.
Princess, I am a lonely man.
#GOLDILOCKS.
Yes, Robinson?
#CRUSOE.
I am not much of a one for society, and I don't quite know how to put these things, but - er - if you would like to share my island, should so love to have you there.
#GOLDILOCKS.
Oh, Robbie!
#CRUSOE.
I have a very comfortable house, and a man - servant, and an excellent view from the south windows, and several thousands of acres of good rough - shooting, and - oh, do say you'll come!
#GOLDILOCKS.
May I bring my bears with me?
#CRUSOE.
Of course! I ought to have said that. I have a great fondness for animals.
#GOLDILOCKS.
How sweet of you! But perhaps I ought to warn you that we all like porridge. Have you -
#CRUSOE.
I have a hundred acres of oats.
#GOLDILOCKS.
Then, Robinson, I am yours. There! Now tell me - did you make all your clothes yourself?
#CRUSOE.
All of them.
#GOLDILOCKS.
How wonderful of you! Really you hardly seem to want a wife. Enter, then, BLUEBEARD and RIDING HOOD
#BLUEBEARD.
Perhaps I ought to tell you at once, Miss Riding Hood, that I have been married before.
#RIDING HOOD.
Yes?
#BLUEBEARD.
My last wife unfortunately died just before I started out here this evening.
#RIDING HOOD.
Did you kill her?
#BLUEBEARD.
I - I - I -
#RIDING HOOD.
Are you quite a nice man, Bluebeard?
#BLUEBEARD.
W - what do you mean? I am a very rich man. If you will marry me, you will live in a wonderful castle, full of everything that you want.
#RIDING HOOD.
That will be rather jolly.
#BLUEBEARD.
But there is one room into which you must never go. Here is the key of it.
#RIDING HOOD.
But if I'm never to go into it, I shan't want the key.
#BLUEBEARD.
You - you must have the key.
#RIDING HOOD.
Why?
#BLUEBEARD.
The - the others all had it.
#RIDING HOOD.
Bluebeard, you aren't going to talk about your other wives all the time, are you?
#BLUEBEARD.
N - no.
#RIDING HOOD.
Then don't be silly. And take this key, and go and tidy up that ridiculous room of yours, and when it's nice and clean, and when you've shaved off that absurd beard, perhaps I'll marry you.
#BLUEBEARD.
Madam!
#RIDING HOOD.
Don't do it here. You'll want some hot water.
#BLUEBEARD.
This is too much, this is -
#RIDING HOOD.
You're putting it in the wrong way round.
#BLUEBEARD.
Thank you.
#RIDING HOOD.
Well, do you want to marry me?
#BLUEBEARD.
Yes!
#RIDING HOOD.
Sure?
#BLUEBEARD.
More than ever. You're the first woman I've met who hasn't been afraid of me.
#RIDING HOOD.
Are you very alarming? Wolves frighten me sometimes, but not just silly men. . All right then. But you'll do what I said?
#BLUEBEARD.
Beloved one, I will do anything for you. But enough of this. Let us get on to the great event of the evening. Ladies and gentlemen, are you all assembled? Then silence, please, for
#FATHER CHRISTMAS.
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to see you here at my Court this evening; and in particular my friends Mr. and Mrs. Hubbard, of whom I have been too long neglectful. However, I hope to make up for it to - night. Disclose the Christmas Tree!
#FATHER CHRISTMAS.
Distribute the presents!
#USHER.
Here is the nominal roll, sir.
#MR. HUBBARD.
What's this? Ada, Bertram, Caroline - My darling one!
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Henry! Our children at last! Oh, are they all - all there?
#MR. HUBBARD.
We'll soon see, dear. Ada!
#ADA.
Father!
#MR. HUBBARD.
Bertram! . . Frank!
#FRANK.
Father!
#MR. HUBBARD.
There you are, darling, I told you he had curly brown hair. . Gwendoline!
#MRS. HUBBARD.
Oh thank you so much. It is sweet of you.
#MR. HUBBARD.
We are slightly overcome. Do you mind if we just dance it off. Come on, children!
