#HYMN OF PRAISE.
Never - ending adoration To the Cross of our salvation! The Serpent is hurled To the deepest abyss; The Lamb rules the world; All is peace, all is bliss.
#POTAMON THE GOLDSMITH.
Hist, good friend—when comes the Emperor?
#THE SOLDIER.
I cannot tell.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
The Emperor? Did not some one ask about the Emperor? The Emperor will come a little before midnight—just before. I had it from Memnon himself.
#EUNAPIUS.
Out of the way, heathen!
#THE FRUIT-SELLER.
Softly, sir!
#POTAMON.
The swine grumbles!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Dog, dog!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Grumbling at a well - dressed Christian—at a man of the Emperor’s own faith!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Into the gutter with you!
#POTAMON.
That’s right. Wallow there, along with your gods!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Take that—and that—and that!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
And this—and this! I’ll baste your god - detested skin for you!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
It is much to be desired that some one should bring this scene to our blessed Emperor’s ears. The Emperor has lately expressed his displeasure at the way in which we Christian citizens consort with the heathen, just as if no gulf divided us——
#POTAMON.
You refer to that placard in the market - places? I too have read it. And I hold that, as there is both true and false gold in the world——
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
——we ought not to clip every one with the same shears; that is my way of thinking. There are still zealous souls among us, praise be to God!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
We are far from being zealous enough, dear brethren! See how boldly these scoffers hold up their heads. How many of this rabble, think you, bear the sign of the cross or of the fish on their arms?
#POTAMON.
Not many—and yet they actually swarm in front of the Imperial Chapel——
#PHOCION THE DYER.
——on such a thrice - sacred night as this——
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
——blocking the way for true sons of the Church——
#A PAINTED WOMAN.
Are Donatists true sons of the Church?
#PHOCION THE DYER.
What? A Donatist? Are you a Donatist?
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
What then? Are not you one? May the lightning blast your tongue!
#POTAMON.
May plague and boils——! Donatist! You carrion! You rotten tree!
#POTAMON.
Right, right!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
You brand for Satan’s furnace!
#POTAMON.
Right! Give it him; give it him, dear brother.
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Hold your tongue get you behind me. I know you now;—you are Potamon the Manichæan! Manichæan? A stinking heretic! Faugh, faugh!
#POTAMON.
Heyday! Why, you are Phocion the Dyer, of Antioch! The Cainite!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Woe is me, I have held communion with falsehood!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Woe is me, I have helped a son of Satan!
#EUNAPIUS THE BARBER.
Take that for your help!
#PHOCION THE DYER.
Oh, you abandoned hound!
#POTAMON.
Accursed, accursed be ye both!
#THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD.
The Emperor comes!
#HYMN OF PRAISE.
The Serpent is hurled To the deepest abyss;— The Lamb rules the world,— All is peace, all is bliss!
#THE EMPEROR.
Where is Gallus?
#JULIAN.
Gallus? What would you with Gallus?
#THE EMPEROR.
There, I caught you!
#JULIAN.
Sire——!
#THE EMPRESS.
Come; come!
#THE EMPEROR.
Conscience cried aloud. What are you two plotting?
#JULIAN.
We?
#THE EMPEROR.
You and he!
#THE EMPRESS.
Oh, come; come, Constantius!
#THE EMPEROR.
So black a deed! What did the oracle answer?
#JULIAN.
The oracle! By my Holy Redeemer——
#THE EMPEROR.
If any one maligns you, he shall pay for it at the stake. Oh, let us hold together, Julian! Dear kinsman, let us hold together!
#JULIAN.
Everything lies in your hands, my beloved lord!
#THE EMPEROR.
My hands——!
#JULIAN.
Oh, stretch them in mercy over us!
#THE EMPEROR.
My hands? What was in your mind as to my hands?
#JULIAN.
The Emperor’s hands are white and cool.
#THE EMPEROR.
What else should they be? What was in your mind? There I caught you again!
#JULIAN.
They are like rose - leaves in this moonlight night.
#THE EMPEROR.
Well, well, well, Julian!
#THE EMPRESS.
Forward; it is time.
#THE EMPEROR.
To go in before the presence of the Lord! I—I! Oh, pray for me Julian! They will offer me the consecrated wine. I see it! It glitters in the golden chalice like serpents’ eyes—— Bloody eyes——! Oh, Jesus Christ, pray for me!
#THE EMPRESS.
The Emperor is ill——!
#THE PRINCESS HELENA.
Where is Caesarius? The physician, the physician—summon him!
#THE EMPRESS.
Memnon, good Memnon!
#JULIAN.
Sire, have pity, and send me far from here.
#THE EMPEROR.
Where would you go?
#JULIAN.
To Egypt. I would fain go to Egypt, if you think fit. So many go thither—into the great solitude.
#THE EMPEROR.
Into the great solitude? Ha! In solitude one broods. I forbid you to brood.
#JULIAN.
I will not brood, if only you will let me——Here my anguish of soul increases day by day. Evil thoughts flock around me. For nine days I have worn a hair shirt, and it has not protected me; for nine nights I have lashed myself with thongs, but scourging does not banish them.
#THE EMPEROR.
We must be steadfast, Julian! Satan is very busy in all of us. Speak with Hekebolius——
#THE SLAVE MEMNON.
It is time now——
#THE EMPEROR.
No, no, I will not——
#THE SLAVE MEMNON.
Come, gracious lord;—come, I say.
#THE EMPEROR.
Forward to the house of the Lord!
#THE SLAVE MEMNON.
The other matter afterwards——
#THE EMPEROR.
I must see Gallus.
#THE EMPRESS.
Fear nothing!
#THE EMPEROR.
Remain without. Come not into the church with those thoughts in your mind. When you pray before the altar, it is to call down evil upon me.—Oh, lay not that sin upon your soul, my beloved kinsman!
#A PARALYTIC.
Oh, mightiest ruler on earth, let me touch the hem of thy garment, that I may become whole.
#A BLIND MAN.
Pray for me, anointed of the Lord, that my sight may be restored!
#THE EMPEROR.
Be of good cheer, my son!—Memnon, scatter silver among them. In, in!
#JULIAN.
What would he with Gallus? On this sacred night he cannot think to——! Oh, if I did but know—— Look where you go, friend!
#THE BLIND MAN.
I am blind, my lord!
#JULIAN.
Still blind! Can you not yet see so much as yonder glittering star? Fie! man of little faith! Did not God’s anointed promise to pray for your sight?
#THE BLIND MAN.
Who are you, that mock at a blind brother? brother in unbelief and blindness.
#A VOICE.
Julian, Julian!
#JULIAN.
Ah!
#VALSIN.
Julian!
#JULIAN.
Stand, stand;—I am armed. Beware!
#A YOUNG MAN.
Hush! It is I——
#JULIAN.
Stand where you are! Do not come near me, fellow!
#THE YOUNG MAN.
Oh, do you not remember Agathon——?
#JULIAN.
Agathon! What say you? Agathon was a boy——
#AGATHON.
Six years ago.—I knew you at once.
#JULIAN.
Agathon;—by the holy cross, but I believe it is!
#AGATHON.
Look at me; look well——
#JULIAN.
Friend of my childhood! Playmate! Dearest of them all! And you are here? How wonderful! You have come all the long way over the mountains, and then across the sea,—the whole long way from Cappadocia?
#AGATHON.
I came two days ago, by ship, from Ephesus. Oh, how I have sought in vain for you these two days. At the palace gates the guards would not let me pass, and——
#JULIAN.
Did you speak my name to any one? or say that you were in search of me?
#AGATHON.
No, I dared not, because——
#JULIAN.
There you did right; never let any one know more than you needs must——. Come hither, Agathon; out into the full moonlight, that I may see you.—How you have grown, Agathon;—how strong you look.
#AGATHON.
And you are paler.
#JULIAN.
I cannot thrive in the air of the palace. I think it is unwholesome here.—’Tis far otherwise at Makellon. Makellon lies high. No other town in Cappadocia lies so high; ah, how the fresh snow - winds from the Taurus sweep over it——! Are you weary, Agathon?
#AGATHON.
Oh, in no wise.
#JULIAN.
Let us sit down nevertheless. It is so quiet and lonely here. Close together; so! —“Can any good thing come out of Cappadocia,” they say. Yes—friends can come. Can anything be better? How was it possible that I did not know you at once? Oh, my beloved treasure, is it not just as when we were boys——?
#AGATHON.
I at your feet, as of old.
#JULIAN.
No, no, no——!
#AGATHON.
Oh, let me kneel thus!
#JULIAN.
Oh, Agathon, it is a sin and a mockery to kneel to me. If you but knew how sinful I have become. Hekebolius, my beloved teacher, is sorely concerned about me, Agathon. He could tell you—— How thick and moist your hair has grown; and how it curls.—But Mardonius—how goes it with him? His hair must be almost white now?
#AGATHON.
It is snow - white.
#JULIAN.
How well Mardonius could interpret Homer! I am sure my old Mardonius has not his like at that.—Heroes embattled against heroes—and the gods above fanning the flames. I saw it all, as with my eyes.
#AGATHON.
Then your mind was set on being a great and victorious warrior.
#JULIAN.
They were happy times, those six years in Cappadocia. Were the years longer then than now? It seems so, when I think of all they contained—— Yes, they were happy years. We at our books, and Gallus on his Persian horse. He swept over the plain like the shadow of a cloud.—Oh, but one thing you must tell me. The church——?
#AGATHON.
The church? Over the Holy Mamas’s grave?
#JULIAN.
Which Gallus and I built Gallus finished his aisle; but I——; mine never fully prospered.—How has it gone on since?
#AGATHON.
Not at all. The builders said it was impossible as you had planned it.
#JULIAN.
No doubt, no doubt. I wronged them in thinking them incapable. Now I know why it was not to be. I must tell you, Agathon;—Mamas was a false saint.
#AGATHON.
The Holy Mamas?
#JULIAN.
That Mamas was never a martyr. His whole legend was a strange delusion. Hekebolius has, with infinite research, arrived at the real truth, and I myself have lately composed a slight treatise on the subject—a treatise, my Agathon, which certain philosophers are said, strangely enough, to have mentioned with praise in the lecture - rooms—— The Lord keep my heart free from vanity! The evil tempter has countless wiles; one can never know——. That Gallus should succeed and I fail! Ah, my Agathon, when I think of that church - building, I see Cain’s altar——
#AGATHON.
Julian!
#JULIAN.
God will have none of me, Agathon!
#AGATHON.
Ah, do not speak so! Was not God strong in you when you led me out of the darkness of heathendom, and gave me light over all my days—child though you then were!
#JULIAN.
All that is like a dream to me.
#AGATHON.
And yet so blessed a truth.
#JULIAN.
If only it were so now!—Where did I find the words of fire? The air seemed full of hymns of praise—a ladder from earth to heaven— Did you see it?
#AGATHON.
What?
#JULIAN.
The star that fell; there, behind the two cypresses. Have I told you what my mother dreamed the night before I was born?
#AGATHON.
I do not recall it.
#JULIAN.
No, no, I remember—I heard of it after we parted.
#AGATHON.
What did she dream?
#JULIAN.
My mother dreamed that she gave birth to Achilles.
#AGATHON.
Is your faith in dreams as strong as ever?
#JULIAN.
Why do you ask?
#AGATHON.
You shall hear; it concerns what has driven me to cross the sea——
#JULIAN.
You have a special errand here? I had quite forgotten to ask you—— strange errand; so strange that I am lost in doubt and disquietude. There is so much I should like to know first—about life in the city—about yourself—and the Emperor——
#JULIAN.
Tell me the truth, Agathon—with whom have you spoken before meeting me?
#AGATHON.
With no one.
#JULIAN.
When did you arrive?
#AGATHON.
I have told you—two days ago.
#JULIAN.
And already you want to know——? What would you know about the Emperor? Has any one set you on to——? Oh, forgive me, Agathon, my friend!
#AGATHON.
What? Why?
#JULIAN.
Hush!—No, it was nothing—only a bird in the bushes—— I am very happy here. Wherefore should you doubt it? Have I not all my family gathered here? at least—all over whom a gracious Saviour has held his hand.
#AGATHON.
And the Emperor is as a father to you?
#JULIAN.
The Emperor is beyond measure wise and good.
#AGATHON.
Julian, is the rumour true that you are one day to be the Emperor’s successor?
#JULIAN.
Speak not of such dangerous matters. I know not what foolish rumours are abroad.—Why do you question me so much? Not a word will I answer till you have told me what brings you to Constantinople.
#AGATHON.
I come at the bidding of the Lord God.
#JULIAN.
If you love your Saviour or your salvation, get you home again. Speak softy; a boat is coming in—— What would you here? Kiss the splinter of the holy cross?—Get you home again, I say! Know you what Constantinople has become in these last fifteen months? A Babylon of blasphemy.—Have you not heard—do you not know that Libanius is here?
#AGATHON.
Ah, Julian, I know not Libanius.
#JULIAN.
Secluded Cappadocian! Happy region, where his voice and his teaching have found no echo.
#AGATHON.
Ah, he is one of those heathen teachers of falsehood——?
#JULIAN.
The most dangerous of them all.
#AGATHON.
Surely not more dangerous than Aedesius of Pergamus?
#JULIAN.
Aedesius!—who now thinks of Aedesius of Pergamus? Aedesius is in his dotage——
#AGATHON.
Is he more dangerous than even that mysterious Maximus?
#JULIAN.
Maximus? Do not speak of that mountebank. Who knows anything certain of Maximus?
#AGATHON.
He avers that he has slept three years in a cave beyond Jordan.
#JULIAN.
Hekebolius holds him an impostor, and doubtless he is not far wrong—— No, no, Agathon—Libanius is the most dangerous. Our sinful earth has writhed, as it were, under this scourge. Portents foretold his coming. A pestilential sickness slew men by thousands in the city. And then, when it was over, in the month of November, fire rained from heaven night by night. Nay, do not doubt it, Agathon! I have myself seen the stars break from their spheres, plunge down towards earth, and burn out on the way. Since then he has lectured here, the philosopher, the orator. All proclaim him the king of eloquence; and well they may. I tell you he is terrible. Youths and men flock around him; he binds their souls in bonds, so that they must follow him; denial flows seductively from his lips, like songs of the Trojans and the Greeks——
#AGATHON.
Oh, you too have sought him Julian!
#JULIAN.
I!—God preserve me from such a sin. Should any rumours come to your ears, believe them not. ’Tis not true that I have sought out Libanius by night, in disguise. All contact with him would be a horror to me. Besides, the Emperor has forbidden it, and Hekebolius still more strictly.—All believers who approach that subtle man fall away and turn to scoffers. And not they alone. His words are borne from mouth to mouth, even into the Emperor’s palace. His airy mockery, his incontrovertible arguments, his very lampoons seem to blend with my prayers;—they are to me like those monsters in the shape of birds who befouled all the food of a pious wandering hero of yore. I sometimes feel with horror that my gorge rises at the true meat of the Word—— Were the empire mine, I would send you the head of Libanius on a charger!
#AGATHON.
But how can the Emperor tolerate this? How can our pious, Christian Emperor——?
#JULIAN.
The Emperor? Praised be the Emperor’s faith and piety! But the Emperor has no thoughts for anything but this luckless Persian war. All minds are full of it. No one heeds the war that is being waged here, against the Prince of Golgotha. Ah, my Agathon, it is not now as it was two years ago. Then the two brothers of the Mystic Maximus had to pay for their heresies with their lives. You do not know what mighty allies Libanius has. One or other of the lesser philosophers is now and then driven from the city; on him no one dares lay a finger. I have begged, I have implored both Hekebolius and the Empress to procure his banishment. But no, no!—What avails it to drive away the others? This one man poisons the air for all of us. Oh, thou my Saviour, if I could but flee from all this abomination of heathendom! To live here is to live in the lion’s den——
#AGATHON.
Julian—what was that you said?
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes; only a miracle can save us?
#AGATHON.
Oh, then listen! That miracle has happened.
#JULIAN.
What mean you?
#AGATHON.
You shall hear, Julian; for now I can no longer doubt that it is you it concerns. What sent me to Constantinople was a vision—— vision, you say! heavenly revelation——
#JULIAN.
Oh, for God’s pity’s sake, speak!—Hush, do not speak. Wait—some one is coming. Stand here, quite carelessly;—look unconcerned.
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Let nothing fall into the water, my joyous Gregory! Remember, what you carry is more precious than gold.
#JULIAN.
Your pardon,—is aught that a man may carry more precious than gold?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Can you buy back the fruits of your life for gold?
#JULIAN.
True; true. But why, then, do you entrust them to the treacherous waters?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
The favour of man is more treacherous still.
#JULIAN.
That word was wisdom. And whither do you sail with your treasures?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
To Athens.
#JULIAN.
To Athens! Then, oh man of wealth, you do not own your own riches.
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
How so?
#JULIAN.
Is it the part of a wise man to take owls to Athens?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
My owls cannot endure the church - lights here in the imperial city. Give me your hand, Sallust.
#SALLUST.
By the gods, it is he!
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
He——?
#SALLUST.
On my life, ’tis he! I know him;—I have seen him with Hekebolius.
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Ah!
#JULIAN.
When you complained of the church - lights, I wondered whether it were not rather the imperial light of the lecture - halls that shone too bright in your eyes.
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Envy cannot hide under the short cloak.
#JULIAN.
What cannot hide shows forth.
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
You have a sharp tongue, noble Galilean.
#JULIAN.
Why Galilean? What proclaims me a Galilean?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Your court apparel.
#JULIAN.
There is a philosopher beneath it; for I wear a very coarse shirt.—But tell me, what do you seek in Athens?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
What did Pontius Pilate seek?
#JULIAN.
Nay, nay! Is not truth here, where Libanius is?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
H’m!—Libanius? Libanius will soon be silent. Libanius is weary of the strife, my lord!
#JULIAN.
Weary? He—the invulnerable, the ever - victorious——?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
He is weary of waiting for his peer.
#JULIAN.
Now you jest, stranger! Where can Libanius hope to find his peer?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
His peer exists.
#JULIAN.
Who? Where? Name him?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
It might be dangerous.
#JULIAN.
Why?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Are you not a courtier?
#JULIAN.
And what then?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Would you be foolhardy enough to praise the Emperor’s successor?
#JULIAN.
Ah!
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
If you betray me, I shall deny all!
#JULIAN.
I betray no man; never fear, never fear!—The Emperor’s successor, you say? I cannot tell whom you mean; the Emperor has chosen no successor.—But why this jesting? Why did you speak of Libanius’s peer?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Yes or no—is there at the imperial court a youth who, by force and strict commandment, by prayers and persuasions, is held aloof from the light of the lecture - halls?
#JULIAN.
That is done to keep his faith pure.
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Has this young man so scant faith in his faith? What can he know about his faith? What does a soldier know of his shield until he has proved it in battle?
#JULIAN.
True, true;—but they are loving kinsmen and teachers, I tell you——
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Phrases, my lord! Let me tell you this: it is for the Emperor’s sake that his young kinsman is held aloof from the philosophers. The Emperor has not the divine gift of eloquence. Doubtless the Emperor is great; but he cannot endure that his successor should shine forth over the empire——
#JULIAN.
And you dare to——!
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Ay, ay, you are wroth on your master’s account, but——
#JULIAN.
Far from it; on the contrary—that is to say—— Listen; my place is somewhat near that young prince. I would gladly learn—— Go apart, Agathon; I must speak alone with this man. You said “shine forth”? “Shine forth over the empire?” What do you know, what can any of you know, of Prince Julian?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Can Sirius be hidden by a cloud? Will not the restless wind tear a rift in it here or there, so that——
#JULIAN.
Speak plainly, I beg you.
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
The palace and the church are as a double cage wherein the prince is mewed up. But the cage is not close enough. Now and then he lets fall an enigmatic word; the court vermin—forgive me, sir—the courtiers spread it abroad in scorn; its deep meaning does not exist for these gentlefolk—your pardon, sir—for most of them it does not exist.
#JULIAN.
For none. You may safely say for none.
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Yet surely for you; and at any rate for us.—— Yes, he could indeed shine forth over the empire! Are there not legends of his childhood in Cappadocia, when, in disputation with his brother Gallus, he took the part of the gods, and defended them against the Galilean?
#JULIAN.
That was in jest, mere practice in rhetoric——
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
What has not Mardonius recorded of him? And afterwards Hekebolius! What art was there not even in his boyish utterances—what beauty, what grace in the light play of his thoughts!
#JULIAN.
You think so?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Yes, in him we might indeed find an adversary to fear and yet to long for. What should hinder him from reaching so honourable an eminence? He lacks nothing but to pass through the same school through which Paul passed, and passed so unscathed that, when he afterwards joined the Galileans, he shed more light than all the other apostles together, because he possessed knowledge and eloquence! Hekebolius fears for his pupil’s faith. Oh, I know it well; the fear is his. Does he forget then, in his exceeding tenderness of conscience, that he himself, in his youth, has drunk of those very springs from which he would now have his pupil debarred? Or think you it was not from us that he learned to use the weapons of speech which he now wields against us with such renowned dexterity?
#JULIAN.
True, true; undeniably true!
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
And what gifts has this Hekebolius in comparison with the gifts which declared themselves so marvellously in that princely boy, who, it is said, in Cappadocia, upon the graves of the slain Galileans, proclaimed a doctrine which I hold to be erroneous, and by so much the more difficult to instil, but which he nevertheless proclaimed with such fervour of spirit that—if I may believe a very widespread rumour—a multitude of children of his own age were carried away by him, and followed him as his disciples! Ah, Hekebolius is like the rest of you—more jealous than zealous; that is why Libanius has waited in vain.
#JULIAN.
What has Libanius said? Tell me, I conjure you, in the name of God?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
He has said all that you have just heard. And he has said still more. He has said: “Behold yon princely Galilean; he is an Achilles of the spirit.”
#JULIAN.
Achilles! My mother’s dream!
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
There, in the open lecture - halls, lies the field of battle. Light and gladness encompass the fighters and the fray. Javelins of speech hurtle through the air; keen swords of wit clash in the combat; the blessed gods sit smiling in the clouds——
#JULIAN.
Oh, away from me with your heathendom——
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
——and the heroes go home to their tents, their arms entwined, their hearts untouched by rancour, their cheeks aglow, the blood coursing swiftly through every vein, admired, applauded, and with laurels on their brows. Ah, where is Achilles? I cannot see him. Achilles is wroth——
#JULIAN.
Achilles is unhappy!—But can I believe it? Oh, tell me—my brain is dizzy—has Libanius said all this?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
What brought Libanius to Constantinople? Had he any other end than to achieve the illustrious friendship of a certain youth?
#JULIAN.
Speak the truth! No, no; this cannot be true. How reconcile it with the scoffs and jibes that——? Who scoffs at one whose friendship he would seek?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Wiles of the Galileans to build up a wall of wrath and hate between the two champions.
#JULIAN.
Yet you will not deny that it was Libanius——?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
I will deny everything to the uttermost.
#JULIAN.
The lampoons were not his?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Not one of them. They have all been hatched in the palace, and spread abroad under his name——
#JULIAN.
Ah, what do you tell me——?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
What I will avouch before all the world. You have a sharp tongue—who knows but that you yourself——
#JULIAN.
I——! But can I believe this? Libanius did not write them? Not one of them?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
No, no!
#JULIAN.
Not even those infamous lines about Atlas with the crooked shoulders?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
No, no, I tell you.
#JULIAN.
Nor that foolish and ribald verse about the ape in court dress?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Ha, ha; that came from the church, not from the lecture - hall. You disbelieve it? I tell you it was Hekebolius——
#JULIAN.
Hekebolius!
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Yes, Hekebolius, Hekebolius himself, to breed hatred between his enemy and his pupil——
#JULIAN.
Ah, if it were so!
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
If that blinded and deceived young man had known us philosophers, he would not have dealt so hardly with us.
#JULIAN.
Of what are you speaking?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
It is too late now. Farewell, my lord!
#JULIAN.
Friend and brother, who are you?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
One who sorrows to see the God - born go to ruin.
#JULIAN.
What do you call the God - born?
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
The Uncreated in the Ever - changing.
#JULIAN.
Still I am in the dark.
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
There is a whole glorious world to which you Galileans are blind. In it our life is one long festival, amid statues and choral songs, foaming goblets in our hands, and our locks entwined with roses. Airy bridges span the gulfs between spirit and spirit, stretching away to the farthest orbs in space—— I know one who might be king of all that vast and sunlit realm.
#JULIAN.
Ay, at the cost of his salvation!
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
What is salvation? Reunion with the primal deeps.
#JULIAN.
Yes, in conscious life. Reunion for me, as the being I am!
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Reunion like that of the raindrop with the sea, like that of the crumbling leaf with the earth that bore it.
#JULIAN.
Oh, had I but learning! Had I but the weapons to use against you!
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Take to yourself weapons, young man! The lecture - hall is the armoury of intellect and talent——
#JULIAN.
Ah!
#THE PHILOSOPHER.
Look at those joyous youths yonder. There are Galileans among them. Errors in things divine cause no discord among us. Farewell! You Galileans have sent truth into exile. See, now, how we bear the buffets of fate. See, we hold high our wreath - crowned heads. So we depart—shortening the night with song, and awaiting Helios.
#JULIAN.
Who was he, that mysterious man?
#AGATHON.
Listen to me, Julian——?
#JULIAN.
He understood me! And Libanius himself, the great, incomparable Libanius——! Only think, Agathon, Libanius has said—— Oh, how keen must the heathen eye not be!
#AGATHON.
Trust me, this meeting was a work of the Tempter!
#JULIAN.
I can no longer endure to live among these people. It was they, then, who wrote those abominable lampoons! They make a mockery of me here; they laugh behind my back; not one of them believes in the power that dwells in me. They ape my gait; they distort my manners and my speech; Hekebolius himself——! Oh, I feel it—Christ is deserting me; I grow evil here.
#AGATHON.
Oh, though you know it not—you, even you, stand under special grace.
#JULIAN.
I am he with whom Libanius longs to measure swords. How strange a wish! Libanius accounts me his peer. It is me he awaits——
#AGATHON.
Hear and obey: Christ awaits you!
#JULIAN.
What mean you, friend?
#AGATHON.
The vision that sent me to Constantinople——
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes, the vision; I had almost forgotten it. A revelation, you said? Oh, speak, speak!
#AGATHON.
It was at home in Cappadocia, a month ago or a little more. There went a rumour abroad that the heathens had again begun to hold secret meetings by night in the temple of Cybele——
#JULIAN.
How foolhardy! Are they not strictly forbidden——
#AGATHON.
Therefore all we believers arose in wrath. The magistrates ordered the temple to be pulled down, and we broke in pieces the abominable idols. The more zealous among us were impelled by the Spirit of the Lord to go still further. With singing of psalms, and with sacred banners at our head, we marched through the town and fell upon the godless like messengers of wrath; we took from them their treasures; many houses were set on fire, and heathens not a few perished in the flames; still more we slew in the streets as they fled. Oh, it was a marvellous time for the glory of God!
#JULIAN.
And then? The vision, my Agathon!
#AGATHON.
For three whole nights and days the Lord of Vengeance was strong in us. But at last the weak flesh could no longer keep pace with the willing spirit, and we desisted from the pursuit—— I lay upon my bed; I could neither wake nor sleep. I felt, as it were, an inward hollowness, as though the spirit had departed out of me. I lay in burning heat; I tore my hair, I wept, I prayed, I sang;—I cannot tell what came over me—— Then, on a sudden, I saw before me by the wall a white and shining light, and in the radiance stood a man in a long cloak. A glory encircled his head; he held a reed in his hand, and fixed his gaze mildly upon me.
#JULIAN.
You saw that!
#AGATHON.
I saw it. And then he spoke and said: “Agathon; arise, seek him out who shall inherit the empire; bid him enter the lion’s den and do battle with the lions.”
#JULIAN.
Do battle with the lions! Oh, strange, strange!—Ah, if it were——! The meeting with that philosopher—A revelation; a message to me—; am I the chosen one?
#AGATHON.
Assuredly you are!
#JULIAN.
Do battle with the lions!—Yes, I see it;—so it must be, my Agathon! It is God’s will that I should seek out Libanius——
#AGATHON.
No, no; hear me out!
#JULIAN.
——worm from him all his arts and his learning—smite the unbelievers with their own weapons—fight, fight like Paul—conquer like Paul, in the cause of the Lord!
#AGATHON.
No, no! that was not the intent.
#JULIAN.
Can you doubt it? Libanius—is he not strong as the mountain lion, and is not the lecture - hall——?
#AGATHON.
I tell you it is not so; for the vision added: “Proclaim to the chosen one that he shall shake the dust of the imperial city from his feet, and never more enter its gates.”
#JULIAN.
Are you sure of that, Agathon?
#AGATHON.
Absolutely sure.
#JULIAN.
Not here, then! Do battle with, the lions? Where, where? Oh, where shall I find light?
#JULIAN.
Gallus!
#GALLUS.
What now? Who is that man?
#JULIAN.
Agathon.
#GALLUS.
What Agathon? You have so many strange companions——Ah, by heaven, it is the Cappadocian! You have grown quite a man——
#JULIAN.
Do you know, Gallus—the Emperor has asked for you.
#GALLUS.
Just now? To - night?
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes; he wanted to speak with you. He seemed greatly angered.
#GALLUS.
How know you that? What did he say?
#JULIAN.
I did not understand it. He asked what some oracle had answered.
#GALLUS.
Ah!
#JULIAN.
Hide nothing from me. What is the matter?
#GALLUS.
Death or banishment is the matter.
#AGATHON.
Gracious Saviour!
#JULIAN.
I feared as much! But no, the Empress spoke hopefully. Oh, say on, say on!
#GALLUS.
What shall I say? How should I know more than you? If the Emperor spoke of an oracle, a certain messenger must have been intercepted, or some one must have betrayed me—— messenger?—Gallus, what have you dared to do?
#GALLUS.
How could I live any longer this life of doubt and dread? Let him do with me as he pleases; anything is better than this——
#JULIAN.
Have a care, Gallus! What is this about a messenger?
#GALLUS.
I have addressed a question to the priests of Osiris in Abydus——
#JULIAN.
Ah, the oracle! The heathen oracle——!
#GALLUS.
The heathenism might be forgiven me; but—well, why should you not know it?—I have inquired as to the issue of the Persian war——
#JULIAN.
What madness!—Gallus—I see it in your face: you have asked other questions!
#GALLUS.
No more; I have not asked——
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes; you have inquired as to a mighty man’s life or death!
#GALLUS.
And if I had? What can be of more moment to both of us?
#JULIAN.
Be silent, madman!
#GALLUS.
Away from me! You may cringe before him like a cur; but I have no mind to endure it longer. I will cry it aloud in all the market - places—— Have you seen him, Cappadocian? Have you seen the murderer?
#JULIAN.
Gallus! Brother!
#AGATHON.
The murderer!
#GALLUS.
The murderer in the purple robe; my father’s murderer, my step - mother’s, my eldest brother’s——
#JULIAN.
Oh, you are calling down destruction upon us!
#GALLUS.
Eleven heads in one single night; eleven bodies; our whole house.—Ah, but be sure conscience is torturing him; it shivers through the marrow of his bones like a swarm of serpents.
#JULIAN.
Do not listen to him! Away, away!
#GALLUS.
Stay;—you look pale and disordered; is it you that have betrayed me?
#JULIAN.
I! Your own brother——!
#GALLUS.
What matter for that! Brotherhood protects no one in our family. Confess that you have secretly spied upon my doings! Who else should it be? Think you I do not know what people are whispering? The Emperor designs to make you his successor.
#JULIAN.
Never! I swear to you, my beloved Gallus, it shall never be! I will not. One mightier than he has chosen me.—Oh, trust me, Gallus: my path is marked out for me. I will not go thither, I tell you. Oh, God of Hosts—I on the imperial throne! No, no, no!
#GALLUS.
Ha - ha; well acted, mummer!
#JULIAN.
Ay, you may scoff, since you know not what has happened. Myself, I scarcely know. Oh, Agathon—if this head were to be anointed! Would it not be an apostasy—a deadly sin? Would not the Lord’s holy oil burn me like molten lead?
#GALLUS.
Were that so, then were our august kinsman balder than Julius Caesar.
#JULIAN.
Beware how you speak! Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s——
#GALLUS.
My father’s blood——your father’s and your mother’s——!
#JULIAN.
Oh, what know we of those horrors? We were children then. The soldiers were chiefly to blame; it was the rebels—evil counsellors——
#GALLUS.
The Emperor’s successor rehearses his part!
#JULIAN.
Oh, Gallus, would I might die or be banished in your stead! I am wrecking my soul here. I ought to forgive—and I cannot. Evil grows in me; hate and revenge whisper in my ear——
#GALLUS.
There he comes!
#JULIAN.
Be prudent, my beloved brother!—Ah, Hekebolius!
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Is that you, my Julian? Ah, I have again passed a heavy hour for your sake.
#JULIAN.
Alas! I fear that happens too often.
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Christ is wroth against you, my son! It is your froward spirit that angers him; it is your unloving thoughts, and all this worldly vanity——
#JULIAN.
I know it, my Hekebolius! You so often tell me so.
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Even now I lifted up my soul in prayer for your amendment. Oh, it seemed as though our otherwise so gracious Saviour repulsed my prayer,—as though he would not listen to me; he suffered my thoughts to wander upon trifling things.
#JULIAN.
You prayed for me? Oh, loving Hekebolius, you pray even for us dumb animals—at least when we wear court dress?
#HEKEBOLIUS.
What mean you, my son?
#JULIAN.
Hekebolius, how could you write those shameful verses? I swear by all that is high and holy——
#JULIAN.
I see in your eyes that you are lying! I have full assurance that you wrote them. How could you do it, I ask—and under the name of Libanius, too?
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Well, well, my dearly beloved, since you know it, I——
#JULIAN.
Ah, Hekebolius! Deceit, and lies, and treachery——
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Behold, my precious friend, how deep is my love for you! I dare all to save the soul of that man who shall one day be the Lord’s anointed. If, in my zeal for you, I have had recourse to deceit and lies, I know that a gracious God has found my course well pleasing in his sight, and has stretched forth his hand to sanction it.
#JULIAN.
How blind have I been! Let me press these perjured fingers——
#HEKEBOLIUS.
The Emperor!
#THE EMPEROR.
Oh, blessed peace of heaven in my heart.
#THE EMPRESS.
Do you feel yourself strengthened, my Constantius?
#THE EMPEROR.
Yes, yes! I saw the living Dove hovering over me. It took away the burden of all my sin.—Now I dare venture much, Memnon!
#THE SLAVE MEMNON.
Lose not a moment, sire!
#THE EMPEROR.
There they both stand.
#GALLUS.
Do me no ill!
#THE EMPEROR.
Gallus! Kinsman! Lo, in the light of the Easter stars, I choose the man who lies nearest my heart.—Bow all to the earth. Hail Gallus Caesar!
#THE EMPRESS.
Constantius!
#GALLUS.
Caesar!
#JULIAN.
Ah!
#THE EMPEROR.
Away from me! What would you? Is not Gallus the elder? What hopes have you been cherishing? What rumours have you, in your blind presumption——? Away; away! Caesar!
#THE EMPEROR.
My heir and my successor. In three days you will set out for the army in Asia. I know the Persian war is much on your mind——
#GALLUS.
Oh, my most gracious sire——!
#THE EMPEROR.
Thank me in deeds, my beloved Gallus! King Sapor lies west of the Euphrates. I know how solicitous you are for my life; be it your task, then, to crush him. And you, Julian, my pious friend and brother—so it needs must be.
#JULIAN.
All blessings on the Emperor’s will!
#THE EMPEROR.
Call down no blessings! Yet listen—I have thought of you too. Know, Julian, that now you can breathe freely in Constantinople——
#JULIAN.
Yes, praise be to Christ and the Emperor!
#THE EMPEROR.
You know it already? Who has told you?
#JULIAN.
What, sire?
#THE EMPEROR.
That Libanius is banished?
#JULIAN.
Libanius—banished!
#THE EMPEROR.
I have banished him to Athens.
#JULIAN.
Ah!
#THE EMPEROR.
Yonder lies his ship; he sails to - night.
#JULIAN.
He himself; he himself!
#THE EMPEROR.
You have long wished it. I have not hitherto been able to fulfil your desire; but now——; let this be a slight requital to you, my Julian——
#JULIAN.
Sire, do me one grace more.
#THE EMPEROR.
Ask what you will.
#JULIAN.
Let me go to Pergamus. You know the old Aedesius teaches there—— very strange wish. You, among the heathens——?
#JULIAN.
Aedesius is not dangerous; he is a high - minded old man, drawing towards the grave——
#THE EMPEROR.
And what would you with him, brother?
#JULIAN.
I would learn to do battle with the lions.
#THE EMPEROR.
I understand your pious thought. And you are not afraid——; you think yourself strong enough——?
#JULIAN.
The Lord God has called me with a loud voice. Like Daniel, I go fearless and joyful into the lions’ den.
#THE EMPEROR.
Julian!
#JULIAN.
To - night, without knowing it, you have yourself been his instrument. Oh, let me go forth to purge the world!
#GALLUS.
Humour him, sire; it will prevent his brooding on higher things.
#THE EMPRESS.
I implore you, Constantius—set no bar to this vehement longing.
#HEKEBOLIUS.
Great Emperor, let him go to Pergamus. I fear I am losing hold of him here, and now ’tis no longer of such moment.
#THE EMPEROR.
How could I deny you anything in such an hour? Go with God, Julian!
#JULIAN.
Oh, thanks—thanks!
#THE EMPEROR.
And now to a banquet of rejoicing! My Capuan cook has invented some new fast - dishes, carp - necks in Chios wine, and—— Forward;—your place is next to me, Gallus Caesar!
#GALLUS.
Helena, what a marvellous change of fortune!
#HELENA.
Oh, Gallus, dawn is breaking over our hopes.
#GALLUS.
I can scarce believe it! Who has brought it about?
#HELENA.
Hush!
#GALLUS.
You, my beloved? Or who—who?
#HELENA.
Memnon’s Spartan dog.
#GALLUS.
What do you mean?
#HELENA.
Memnon’s dog. Julian kicked it; this is Memnon’s revenge.
#THE EMPEROR.
Why so silent, Eusebia?
#THE EMPRESS.
Oh, Constantius—how could you make such a choice!
#THE EMPEROR.
Eleven ghosts demanded it.
#THE EMPRESS.
Woe upon us; this will not appease the ghosts.
#THE EMPEROR.
Flute - players! Why are the rascals silent? Play, play!
#JULIAN.
Gallus his successor; and I—free, free, free!
#AGATHON.
Marvellously are the counsels of the Lord revealed.
#JULIAN.
Heard you what passed?
#AGATHON.
Yes, everything.
#JULIAN.
And to - morrow, my Agathon, to - morrow to Athens!
#AGATHON.
To Athens? ’Tis to Pergamus you go.
#JULIAN.
Hush! You do not know——; we must be cunning as serpents. First to Pergamus—and then to Athens!
#AGATHON.
Farewell, my lord and friend!
#JULIAN.
Will you go with me, Agathon?
#AGATHON.
I cannot. I must go home; I have my little brother to care for.
#JULIAN.
There they are weighing anchor.—A fair wind to you, winged lion; Achilles follows in your wake. Ah!
#AGATHON.
What was that?
#JULIAN.
Yonder fell a star.
#BASIL.
What mean these wild cries? ship has come in from Ephesus.
#BASIL.
With new scholars?
#GREGORY.
Yes.
#BASIL.
Then we shall have a night of tumult. Come, Gregory; let us not witness all this unseemliness.
#GREGORY.
Look yonder. Is that a pleasanter sight?
#BASIL.
Prince Julian——; with roses in his hair, his face aflame——
#GREGORY.
Ay, and after him that reeling, glassy - eyed crew. Hear how the halting tongues babble with wine! They have sat the whole day in Lykon’s tavern.
#BASIL.
And many of them are our own brethren, Gregory; they are Christian youths——
#GREGORY.
So they call themselves. Did not Lampon call himself a Christian—he who betrayed the oil - seller Zeno’s daughter? And Hilarion of Agrigentum, and the two others, who did what I shudder to name——
#PRINCE JULIAN.
Aha! See, see—the Cappadocian Castor and Pollux.
#BASIL.
He has caught sight of us. I will go; I cannot endure to see him in this mood.
#GREGORY.
I will remain; he needs a friend.
#MANY IN THE CROWD.
Long live the light of Athens! Long live the lover of wisdom and eloquence!
#JULIAN.
All your flattery is wasted. Not another verse shall you have to - day.
#SALLUST.
When our leader is silent, life seems empty, as on the morning after a night’s carouse.
#JULIAN.
If we must needs do something, let it be something new. Let us hold a mock trial.
#THE WHOLE CROWD.
Yes, yes, yes; Prince Julian on the judgment - seat!
#JULIAN.
Have done with the Prince, friends——
#SALLUST.
Ascend the judgment - seat, incomparable one!
#JULIAN.
How could I presume——? There stands the man. Who is so learned in the law as Gregory of Nazianzus?
#SALLUST.
That is true!
#JULIAN.
To the judgment - seat, my wise Gregory; I am the prisoner at the bar.
#GREGORY.
I beg you, friend, let me stand out.
#JULIAN.
To the judgment - seat, I say! To the judgment - seat. What is my transgression?
#SOME VOICES.
Yes, what shall it be? Choose yourself!
#SALLUST.
Let it be something Galilean, as we of the ungodly say.
#JULIAN.
Right; something Galilean. I have it. I have refused to pay tribute to the Emperor——
#MANY VOICES.
Ha - ha; well bethought! Excellent!
#JULIAN.
Here am I, dragged forward by the nape of the neck, with my hands pinioned——
#SALLUST.
Blind judge—I mean since Justice is blind—behold this desperate wretch; he has denied to pay tribute to the Emperor.
#JULIAN.
Let me throw one word into the scales of judgment. I am a Greek citizen. How much does a Greek citizen owe the Emperor?
#GREGORY.
What the Emperor demands.
#JULIAN.
Good; but how much—answer now as though the Emperor himself were in court—how much has the Emperor a right to demand?
#GREGORY.
Everything.
#JULIAN.
Answered as though the Emperor were present indeed! But now comes the knotty point; for it is written: Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s—and unto God the things that are God’s.
#GREGORY.
And what then?
#JULIAN.
Then tell me, oh sagacious judge—how much of what is mine belongs to God?
#GREGORY.
Everything.
#JULIAN.
And how much of God’s property may I give to the Emperor?
#GREGORY.
Dear friends, no more of this sport.
#THE SCHOLARS.
Yes, yes; answer him.
#JULIAN.
How much of God’s property has the Emperor a right to demand?
#GREGORY.
I will not answer. This is unseemly both towards God and the Emperor. Let me go.
#MANY VOICES.
Make a ring round him!
#JULIAN.
Hold him fast! What, you most luckless of judges, you have bungled the Emperor’s cause, and now you seek to escape? You would flee? Whither, whither? To the Scythians? Bring him before me! Tell me you servants that - are - to - be of the Emperor and of wisdom—has he not attempted to elude the Emperor’s power?
#THE SCHOLARS.
Yes, yes.
#JULIAN.
And what punishment do you award to such a misdeed?
#VOICES.
Death! Death in a wine - jar!
#JULIAN.
Let us reflect. Let us answer as though the Emperor himself were present. What limit is there to the Emperor’s power?
#SOME OF THE CROWD.
The Emperor’s power has no limits.
#JULIAN.
So I should think. But to want to escape from the infinite, my friends, is not that madness?
#THE SCHOLARS.
Yes, yes; the Cappadocian is mad!
#JULIAN.
And what, then, is madness? How did our forefathers conceive of it? What was the doctrine of the Egyptian priests? And what says Maximus the Mystic and the other philosophers of the East? They say that the divine enigma reveals itself in the brainsick. Our Gregory—in setting himself up against the Emperor—is thus in special league with Heaven.—Make libations of wine to the Cappadocian; sing songs to our Gregory’s praise;—a statue of honour for Gregory of Nazianzus!
#THE SCHOLARS.
Praise to the Cappadocian! Praise to the Cappadocian’s judge!
#LIBANIUS.
Ah, see—is not my brother Julian dispensing wisdom in the open market - place?
#JULIAN.
Say folly, dear friend; wisdom has departed the city.
#LIBANIUS.
Has wisdom departed the city?
#JULIAN.
Or is on the point of departing; for are not you also bound for the Piraeus?
#LIBANIUS.
I, my brother? What should I want at the Piraeus?
#JULIAN.
Our Libanius, then, is the only teacher who does not know that a ship has just arrived from Ephesus.
#LIBANIUS.
Why, my friend, what have I to do with that ship?
#JULIAN.
It is loaded to the water’s edge with embryo philosophers——
#LIBANIUS.
They come from Ephesus!
#JULIAN.
Is not gold equally weighty whencesoever it may come?
#LIBANIUS.
Gold? Ha - ha! The golden ones Maximus keeps to himself; he does not let them go. What sort of scholars is Ephesus wont to send us? Shopkeepers’ sons, the first - born of mechanics. Gold say you, my Julian? I call it lack of gold. But I will turn this lack of gold to account, and out of it I will mint for you young men a coin of true and weighty metal. For may not a precious lesson in life, set forth in ingenious and attractive form, be compared to a piece of full - weighted golden currency?— Hear then, if you have a mind to. Was it not said that certain men had rushed eagerly down to the Piraeus? Who are they, these eager ones? Far be it from me to mention names; they call themselves lovers and teachers of wisdom. Let us betake ourselves in thought to the Piraeus. What is passing there at this moment, even as I stand here in this circle of kindly listeners? I will tell you what is passing. Those men who give themselves out as lovers and dispensers of wisdom, are crowding upon the gangway, jostling, wrangling, biting, forgetting all decorum, and throwing dignity to the winds. And why? To be the first in the field,—to pounce upon the best dressed youths, to lead them home, to entertain them, hoping in the end to make profit out of them in all possible ways. What a shamefaced, empty awakening, as after a debauch, if it should presently appear—ha - ha - ha!—that these youths have scarcely brought with them the wherewithal to pay for their supper of welcome! Learn from this, young men, how ill it becomes a lover of wisdom, and how little it profits him, to run after good things other than the truth.
#JULIAN.
Oh, my Libanius, when I listen to you with closed eyes, I seem lapped in the sweet dream that Diogenes has once more arisen in our midst.
#LIBANIUS.
Your lips are princely spendthrifts of praise, beloved of my soul!
#JULIAN.
Far from it. And yet I had almost interrupted your homily for in this case, one of your colleagues will scarce find himself disappointed.
#LIBANIUS.
My friend is jesting.
#JULIAN.
Your friend assures you that the two sons of the governor, Milo, are on board.
#LIBANIUS.
What do you say?
#JULIAN.
That the new Diogenes who secures them as his pupils will scarce need to drink out of the hollow of his hand for poverty.
#LIBANIUS.
The sons of the Governor Milo! That noble Milo, who sent the Emperor seven Persian horses, with saddles embroidered with pearls——?
#JULIAN.
Many thought that too mean a gift for Milo.
#LIBANIUS.
Very true. Milo ought to have sent a poem, or perhaps a well - polished speech, or a letter. Milo is a nobly - endowed man; all Milo’s family are nobly - endowed.
#JULIAN.
Especially the two young men.
#LIBANIUS.
No doubt, no doubt. For the sake of their beneficent and generous father, I pray the gods that they may fall into good hands. After all, then, you were right, my Julian; the ship brought real gold from Ephesus. For are not intellectual gifts the purest of gold? But I cannot rest; these young men’s welfare is, in truth, a weighty matter; so much depends on who first gains control of them. My young friends, if you think as I do, we will hold out a guiding hand to these two strangers, help them to make the wisest choice of teacher and abode, and——
#SALLUST.
I will go with you!
#THE SCHOLARS.
To the Piraeus! To the Piraeus!
#SALLUST.
We will fight like wild boars for Milo’s sons!
#JULIAN.
See how they go leaping like a troop of fauns. How they lick their lips at the thought of the feast that awaits them this evening. If there is one thing they would sigh to God for at this moment, it is that he would empty their stomachs of their breakfasts.
#GREGORY.
Julian——
#JULIAN.
Look at me; I am sober.
#GREGORY.
I know that. You are temperate in all things. And yet you share this life of theirs.
#JULIAN.
Why not? Do you know, or do I, when the thunderbolt will fall? Then why not make the most of the bright and sunlit day? Do you forget that I dragged out my childhood and the first years of my youth in gilded slavery? It had become a habit, I might almost say a necessity to me, to live under a weight of dread. And now? This stillness as of the grave on the Emperor’s part;—this sinister silence! I left Pergamus without the Emperor’s permission; the Emperor said nothing. I went of my own will to Nicomedia; I lived there, and studied with Nikokles and others; the Emperor gave no sign. I came to Athens, and sought out Libanius, whom the Emperor had forbidden me to see;—the Emperor has said nothing to this day. How am I to interpret this?
#GREGORY.
Interpret it in charity, Julian.
#JULIAN.
Oh, you do not know——! I hate this power without me, terrible in action, more terrible when at rest.
#GREGORY.
Be frank, my friend, and tell me whether it is this alone that has led you into all these strange ways?
#JULIAN.
What mean you by strange ways?
#GREGORY.
Is the rumour true, that you pass your nights in searching out the heathen mysteries in Eleusis?
#JULIAN.
Oh, pooh! I assure you there is little to be learnt from those riddle - mongering dreamers. Let us talk no more about them.
#GREGORY.
Then it is true! Oh, Julian, how could you seek such shameful intercourse?
#JULIAN.
I must live, Gregory,—and this life at the university is no life at all. This Libanius! I shall never forgive him the great love I once bore him! At my first coming, how humbly and with what tremors of joy did I not enter the presence of this man, bowing myself before him, kissing him, and calling him my great brother.
#GREGORY.
Yes, we Christians all thought that you went too far.
#JULIAN.
And yet I came here in exaltation of spirit. I saw, in my fancy, a mighty contest between us two,—the world’s truth in pitched battle against God’s truth.—What has it all come to? Libanius never seriously desired that contest. He never desired any contest whatever; he cares only for his own interest. I tell you, Gregory—Libanius is not a great man.
#GREGORY.
Yet all enlightened Greece proclaims him great. great man he is not, I tell you. Once only have I seen Libanius great: that night in Constantinople. Then he was great, because he had suffered a great wrong, and because he was filled with a noble wrath. But here! Oh, what have I not seen here? Libanius has great learning, but he is no great man. Libanius is greedy; he is vain; he is eaten up with envy. See you not how he has writhed under the fame which I—largely, no doubt, owing to the indulgence of my friends—have been so fortunate as to acquire? Go to Libanius, and he will expound to you the inward essence and the outward signs of all the virtues. He has them ready to hand, just as he has the books in his library. But does he exercise these virtues? Is his life at one with his teaching? He a successor of Socrates and of Plato—ha - ha! Did he not flatter the Emperor, up to the time of his banishment? Did he not flatter me at our meeting in Constantinople, that meeting which he has since attempted, most unsuccessfully, to present in a ludicrous light! And what am I to him now? Now he writes letters to Gallus, to Gallus Caesar, to the Emperor’s heir, congratulating him on his successes against the Persians, although these successes have as yet been meagre enough, and Gallus Caesar is not distinguished either for learning or for any considerable eloquence.—And this Libanius the Greeks persist in calling the king of the philosophers! Ah, I will not deny that it stirs my indignation. I should have thought, to tell the truth, that the Greeks might have made a better choice, if they had noted a little more closely the cultivators of wisdom and eloquence, who of late years——
#BASIL OF CAESAREA.
Letters! Letters from Cappadocia!
#GREGORY.
For me too?
#BASIL.
Yes, here; from your mother.
#GREGORY.
My pious mother!
#JULIAN.
Is it your sister who writes to you?
#BASIL.
Yes, it is Makrina. Her news is both sad and strange.
#JULIAN.
What is it? Tell me.
#BASIL.
First of your noble brother Gallus. He rules sternly in Antioch.
#JULIAN.
Yes, Gallus is hard.—Does Makrina write “sternly.”
#BASIL.
Makrina writes “bloodily”——
#JULIAN.
Ah, I thought as much! Why did the Emperor marry him to that dissolute widow, that Constantina?
#GREGORY.
Oh, what unheard - of infamy!
#JULIAN.
What is it, friend?
#GREGORY.
Does Makrina say nothing of what is happening in Antioch?
#BASIL.
Nothing definite. What is it? You are pale——
#GREGORY.
You knew the noble Clemazius, the Alexandrian?
#BASIL.
Yes, yes; what of him?
#GREGORY.
He is murdered, Basil!
#BASIL.
What do you say? Murdered?
#GREGORY.
I call it murdered;—they have executed him without law or judgment.
#JULIAN.
Who? Who has executed him?
#GREGORY.
Yes, who? How can I say who? My mother tells the story thus: Clemazius’s mother - in - law was inflamed with an impure love for her daughter’s husband; but as she could not move him to wrong, she gained some back - stairs access to the palace——
#JULIAN.
What palace?
#GREGORY.
My mother writes only “the palace.”
#JULIAN.
Well? And then——?
#GREGORY.
It is only known that she presented a very costly jewel to a great and powerful lady to procure a death - warrant——
#JULIAN.
Ah, but they did not get it!
#GREGORY.
They got it, Julian.
#JULIAN.
Oh, Jesus!
#BASIL.
Horrible! And Clemazius——?
#GREGORY.
The death - warrant was sent to the governor, Honoratus. That weak man dared not disobey so high a command. Clemazius was thrown into prison and executed early next morning, without being suffered, my mother writes, to open his lips in his own defence.
#JULIAN.
Burn these dangerous letters; they might bring us all to ruin.
#BASIL.
Such open violence in the midst of a great city! Where are we; where are we?
#JULIAN.
Aye, you may well ask where we are! A Christian murderer, a Christian adulteress, a Christian——!
#GREGORY.
Denunciations will not mend this matter. What do you intend to do? I will go no more to Eleusis; I will break off all dealings with the heathen, and thank the Lord my God that he spared me the temptations of power.
#GREGORY.
Good; but then?
#JULIAN.
I do not understand you——
#GREGORY.
Then listen. The murder of Clemazius is not all, believe me. This unheard - of infamy has descended like a plague on Antioch. All evil things have awakened, and are swarming forth from their lairs. My mother writes that it seems as though some pestilent abyss had opened. Wives denounce their husbands, sons their fathers, priests the members of their own flock——
#JULIAN.
This will spread yet further. The abomination will corrupt us all.—— Oh, Gregory, would I could fly to the world’s end——!
#GREGORY.
Your place is at the world’s navel, Prince Julian.
#JULIAN.
What would you have me do?
#GREGORY.
You are this bloody Caesar’s brother. Stand forth before him—he calls himself a Christian—and cast his crime in his teeth; smite him to the earth in terror and remorse——
#JULIAN.
Madman, of what are you thinking?
#GREGORY.
Is your brother dear to you? Would you save him?
#JULIAN.
I once loved Gallus above all others.
#GREGORY.
Once——?
#JULIAN.
So long as he was only my brother. But now——; is he not Caesar? Gregory,—Basil,—oh, my beloved friends,—I tremble for my life, I draw every breath in fear, because of Gallus Caesar. And you ask me to defy him to his face, me, whose very existence is a danger to him?
#GREGORY.
Why came you to Athens? You gave out loudly in all quarters that Prince Julian was setting forth from Constantinople to do battle with philosophy, falsely so called—to champion Christian truth against heathen falsehood. What have you done of all this?
#JULIAN.
Ah, ’twas not here that the battle was to be.
#GREGORY.
No, it was not here,—not with phrase against phrase, not with book against book, not with the idle word - fencing of the lecture - room! No, Julian, you must go forth into life itself, with your own life in your hands——
#JULIAN.
I see it; I see it!
#GREGORY.
Yes, as Libanius sees it! You mocked at him. You said he knew the essence and the outward signs of all the virtues, but his doctrine was only a doctrine to him. How much of you belongs to God? How much may the Emperor demand?
#JULIAN.
You said yourself it was unseemly——
#GREGORY.
Towards whom? Towards God or the Emperor?
#JULIAN.
Well then: shall we go together?
#GREGORY.
I have my little circle; I have my family to watch over. I have neither the strength nor the gifts for a larger task.
#JULIAN.
To the bacchanal!
#BASIL.
Julian!
#JULIAN.
To the bacchanal, friends!
#BASIL.
Julian, will you listen to me!
#JULIAN.
See, see! They have taken their new friends to the bath, and anointed their hair. See how they swing their cudgels; how they yell and thump the pavement! What say you, Pericles? Methinks I can hear your wrathful shade——
#BASIL.
Come, come!
#JULIAN.
Ah, look at the man they are driving naked among them. Now come the dancing - girls. Ah, do you see what——!
#BASIL.
Fie! Fie!—turn your eyes away!
#JULIAN.
Tell me, Basil, why was the heathen sin so beautiful?
#BASIL.
You are mistaken, friend; beautiful things have been said and sung of this heathen sin; but it was not beautiful.
#JULIAN.
Oh, how can you say so? Was not Alcibiades beautiful when, flushed with wine, he stormed at night like a young god through the streets of Athens? Was he not beautiful in his very audacity when he insulted Hermes and battered at the citizens’ doors,—when he summoned their wives and daughters forth, while within the women trembled, and, in breathless, panting silence, wished for nothing better than to——?
#BASIL.
Oh listen to me, I beg and entreat you.
#JULIAN.
Was not Socrates beautiful in the symposium? And Plato, and all the joyous revellers? Yet they did such things, as, but to be accused of them, would make those Christian swine out there call down upon themselves the curse of God. Think of Oedipus, Medea, Leda——
#BASIL.
Poetry, poetry; you confound fancies with facts.
#JULIAN.
Are not mind and will in poetry subject to the same laws as in fact? And then look at our holy scriptures, both the old and new. Was sin beautiful in Sodom and Gomorrah? Did not Jehovah’s fire avenge what Socrates shrank not from?—Oh, as I live this life of revel and riot, I often wonder whether truth is indeed the enemy of beauty!
#BASIL.
And in such an hour can you sigh after beauty? Can you so easily forget what you have just heard——?
#JULIAN.
Not a word more of those horrors! We will shake off all thoughts of Antioch—— Tell me, what does Makrina write further? There was something more; I remember, you said——; what was it you called the rest of her news?
#BASIL.
Strange.
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes;—what was it?
#BASIL.
She writes of Maximus in Ephesus——
#JULIAN.
The Mystic?
#BASIL.
Yes; that inscrutable man. He has appeared once more; this time in Ephesus. All the region around is in a ferment. Maximus is on all lips. Either he is a juggler or he has made a baleful compact with certain spirits. Even Christians are strangely allured by his impious signs and wonders.
#JULIAN.
More, more; I entreat you!
#BASIL.
There is no more about him. Makrina only writes that she sees in the coming again of Maximus a proof that we are under the wrath of the Lord. She believes that great afflictions are in store for us, by reason of our sins.
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes, yes!—Tell me, Basil: your sister is surely a remarkable woman.
#BASIL.
She is, indeed.
#JULIAN.
When you repeat to me passages from her letters, I seem to be listening to something full and perfect, such as I have long sighed for. Tell me, is she still bent on renouncing this world, and living in the wilderness?
#BASIL.
That is her steadfast intent.
#JULIAN.
Is it possible? She on whom all gifts seem to have been lavished? She who, ’tis known, is both young and beautiful; she, who has riches in prospect, and in possession such learning as is very rare in a woman! Do you know, Basil, I long to see her? What has she to do in the wilderness?
#BASIL.
I have told you how her affianced lover died. She regards him as her expectant bridegroom, to whom she owes her every thought, and whom she is pledged to meet unsullied.
#JULIAN.
Strange how many feel the attraction of solitude in these times.—When you write to Makrina, you may tell her that I too——
#BASIL.
She knows that, Julian; but she does not believe it.
#JULIAN.
Why not? What does she write?
#BASIL.
I pray you, friend, spare me——
#JULIAN.
If you love me, do not hide from me one word she writes.
#BASIL.
Read, if you must—it begins there.
#JULIAN.
“Whenever you write of the Emperor’s young kinsman, who is your friend, my soul is filled with a great and radiant joy——” O Basil! lend me your eye; read for me.
#BASIL.
“Your account of the fearless confidence wherewith he came to Athens was to me as a picture from the ancient chronicles. Yes, I see in him David born again, to smite the champions of the heathen. God’s spirit watch over him in the strife, now and for ever.”
#JULIAN.
Enough of that! She too? What is it that you all, as with one mouth, demand of me? Have I sealed you a bond to do battle with the lions of power——?
#BASIL.
How comes it that all believers look towards you in breathless expectation?
#JULIAN.
Give it to me; let me see. “God’s spirit watch over him in the strife, now and for ever.”— Oh, Basil, if I could——! But I feel like Daedalus, between sky and sea. An appalling height and an abysmal depth.—What sense is there in these voices calling to me, from east and west, that I must save Christendom? Where is it, this Christendom that I am to save? With the Emperor or with Caesar? I think their deeds cry out, “No, no!” Among the powerful and high - born;—among those sensual and effeminate courtiers who fold their hands over their full bellies, and quaver: “Was the Son of God created out of nothing?” Or among the men of enlightenment, those who, like you and me, have drunk in beauty and learning from the heathen fountains? Do not most of our fellows lean to the Arian heresy, which the Emperor himself so greatly favours?—And then the whole ragged rabble of the Empire, who rage against the temples, who massacre heathens and the children of heathens! Is it for Christ’s sake? Ha ha! see how they fall to fighting among themselves for the spoils of the slain.—Ask Makrina if Christendom is to be sought in the wilderness,—on the pillar where the stylite - saint stands on one leg? Or is it in the cities? Perhaps among those bakers in Constantinople who lately took to their fists to decide whether the Trinity consists of three individuals or of three hypostases!—Which of all these would Christ acknowledge if he came down to earth again?—Out with your Diogenes - lantern, Basil! Enlighten this pitchy darkness.—Where is Christendom?
#BASIL.
Seek the answer where it is ever to be found in evil days.
#JULIAN.
Hold me not aloof from the well of your wisdom! Slake my thirst, if you can. Where shall I seek and find?
#BASIL.
In the writings of holy men.
#JULIAN.
The same despairing answer. Books,—always books! When I came to Libanius, it was: books, books! I come to you,—books, books, books! Stones for bread! I cannot live on books;—it is life I hunger for,—face - to - face communion with the spirit. Was it a book that made Saul a seer? Was it not a flood of light that enveloped him, a vision, a voice——?
#BASIL.
Do you forget the vision and the voice which that Agathon of Makellon——?
#JULIAN.
An enigmatic message; an oracle I cannot interpret. Was I the chosen one? The “heir to the empire,” it said. And what empire——? That matter is beset with a thousand uncertainties. Only this I know: Athens is not the lion’s den. But where, where? Oh, I grope like Saul in the darkness. If Christ would have aught of me, he must speak plainly. Let me touch the nail - wound——
#BASIL.
And yet it is written——
#JULIAN.
I know all that is written. This “it is written” is not the living truth. Do you not feel disgust and nausea, as on board ship in a windless swell, heaving to and fro between life, and written doctrine, and heathen wisdom and beauty? There must come a new revelation. Or a revelation of something new. It must come, I say;—the time is ripe.—Ah, a revelation! Oh, Basil, could your prayers call down that upon me! A martyr’s death, if need be——! A martyr’s death—ah, it makes me dizzy with its sweetness; the crown of thorns on my brow——! That! I had forgotten that! One thing alone have I learnt in Athens.
#BASIL.
What, Julian?
#JULIAN.
The old beauty is no longer beautiful, and the new truth is no longer true.
#LIBANIUS.
Now we have him; now we have him!
#JULIAN.
Him? I thought you would have had them both.
#LIBANIUS.
Both of whom?
#JULIAN.
Milo’s sons.
#LIBANIUS.
Ah, yes, I have them too. But we have him, my Julian!
#JULIAN.
Whom, dear brother?
#LIBANIUS.
He has caught himself in his own net!
#JULIAN.
Aha—a philosopher then?
#LIBANIUS.
The enemy of all wisdom.
#JULIAN.
Who, who, I ask?
#LIBANIUS.
Do you really not know? Have you not heard the news about Maximus?
#JULIAN.
Maximus? Oh, pray tell me——
#LIBANIUS.
Who could fail to see whither that restless visionary was tending,—step by step towards madness——?
#JULIAN.
In other words, towards the highest wisdom.
#LIBANIUS.
Ah, that is a figure of speech. But now is the time to act, to seize the opportunity. You, our dearly - prized Julian, you are the man. You are the Emperor’s near kinsman. The hopes of all true friends of wisdom are fixed upon you, both here and in Nikomedia——
#JULIAN.
Listen, oh excellent Libanius,—seeing I am not omniscient——
#LIBANIUS.
Know, then, that Maximus has lately made open avowal of what lies at the bottom of his teaching.
#JULIAN.
And do you blame him for that?
#LIBANIUS.
He has averred that he has power over spirits and shades of the dead.
#JULIAN.
Libanius!
#LIBANIUS.
All on board the ship were full of the most marvellous stories, and here—— , here, my colleague, Eusebius, writes at length on the subject.
#JULIAN.
Spirits and shades——
#LIBANIUS.
At Ephesus lately, in a large assembly both of his partisans and his opponents. Maximus applied forbidden arts to the statue of Hecate. It took place in the goddess’s temple. Eusebius writes that he himself was present, and saw everything from first to last. All was in pitch - black darkness. Maximus uttered strange incantations; then he chanted a hymn, which no one understood. Then the marble torch in the statue’s hand burst into flame——
#BASIL.
Impious doings!
#JULIAN.
And then——?
#LIBANIUS.
In the strong bluish light, they all saw the statue’s face come to life and smile at them.
#JULIAN.
What more?
#LIBANIUS.
Terror seized on the minds of most. All rushed towards the doors. Many have lain sick or raving ever since. But he himself—would you believe it, Julian?—in spite of the fate that befell his two brothers in Constantinople, he goes boldly forward on his reckless and scandalous way.
#JULIAN.
Scandalous? Call you that way scandalous? Is not this the end of all wisdom. Communion between spirit and spirit——
#BASIL.
Oh, dear, misguided friend——!
#LIBANIUS.
More than scandalous, I call it! What is Hecate? What are the gods, as a whole, in the eyes of enlightened humanity? We have happily left far behind us the blind old singer’s days. Maximus ought to know better than that. Has not Plato—and we others after him—shed the light of interpretation over the whole? Is it not scandalous now, in our own days, to seek to enshroud afresh in riddles and misty dreams this admirable, palpable, and, let me add, this laboriously constructed edifice of ideas and interpretations which we, as lovers of wisdom, as a school, as——
#JULIAN.
Basil, farewell! I see a light on my path!
#BASIL.
I will not let you go; I will hold you fast!
#JULIAN.
No one shall withhold me;—kick not against the pricks——
#LIBANIUS.
What frenzy is this? Friend, brother, colleague, whither would you go?
#JULIAN.
Thither, thither, where torches light themselves and where statues smile!
#LIBANIUS.
And you can do this! You, Julian, our pride, our light, our hope,—you can think of rushing to bewildered Ephesus, to give yourself into a juggler’s power! Know that in the hour you so deeply debase yourself, in that same hour you throw away all that bright renown for learning and eloquence which, during these years in Pergamos and Nikomedia, and especially here in the great school of Athens——
#JULIAN.
Oh, the school, the school! Do you pore over your books;—you have pointed my way to the man for whom I have been seeking.
#LIBANIUS.
This princely youth is a menace to enlightenment.
#BASIL.
Prince Julian is a menace to more than that.
#EUTHERIUS.
Yes, yes; I assure you it is as I say.
#GREGORY.
Impossible! Do not make sport of us.
#BASIL.
You are jesting, friend! How can your master expect us? Not a creature knew of our leaving Athens; nothing has detained us on our way; we have kept pace with the clouds and the wild cranes.
#EUTHERIUS.
Look around; see yonder table. His daily fare is herbs and bread.
#GREGORY.
Ay, truly; all our senses bear you witness;—wine - flagons, wreathed with flowers and leaves; lamps and fruits; incense filling the hall with its odour; flute - players before the door——
#EUTHERIUS.
Early this morning he sent for me. He seemed unwontedly happy, for he paced the room to and fro, rubbing his hands. “Prepare a rich banquet,” said he, “for before evening I look for two friends from Athens——”
#BASIL.
Is he there?
#JULIAN.
I see you! I have you! Thanks, thanks, for sending your spirits to herald your bodies!
#GREGORY.
Julian!
#BASIL.
My friend and brother!
#JULIAN.
I have been like a lover, languishing for the pressure of your hands. The court vermin, eager for certain persons’ applause, called me an ape;—oh, would I had an ape’s four hands, to squeeze yours all at once!
#GREGORY.
But explain——; your servants meet us with flutes before the door, want to lead us to the bath, to anoint our hair and deck us with roses——
#JULIAN.
I saw you last night. The moon was full, you see,—and then is the spirit always strangely alert within me. I sat at the table in my library, and had fallen asleep, weary, oh! so weary, my friends, with research and writing. Of a sudden it seemed as though a storm - wind filled the house; the curtain was swept flapping aloft, and I looked out into the night, far over the sea. I heard sweet singing; and the singers were two large birds, with women’s faces. They flew slanting towards the shore; there they dropped gently earthwards; the bird - forms melted away like a white mist, and, in a soft, glimmering light, I saw you two.
#GREGORY.
Are you sure of all this?
#JULIAN.
Were you thinking of me? Were you speaking of me last night?
#BASIL.
Yes, yes—forward in the prow——
#JULIAN.
What time of the night was it?
#GREGORY.
What was the time of your vision?
#JULIAN.
An hour after midnight.
#GREGORY.
Strange!
#JULIAN.
You see! Ha - ha; you see?
#BASIL.
Ah, then it is true——
#JULIAN.
What? What is true?
#BASIL.
The rumour of the mysterious arts you practise here.
#JULIAN.
Oh, what will not rumour exaggerate?—But tell me, what has rumour found to say? I am told there are many reports afloat concerning me. If I could believe some people’s assurances, it would seem that there are few men in the empire so much talked about as I.
#GREGORY.
That you may safely believe.
#JULIAN.
And what says Libanius to all this? He could never endure that the multitude should be busied with any one but himself. And what say all my never - to - be - forgotten friends in Athens? They know I am in disgrace with the Emperor and the whole court?
#GREGORY.
You? I have frequent intelligence from the court; but my brother Caesarius makes no mention of that.
#JULIAN.
I cannot interpret it otherwise, good Gregory! From all sides they think it needful to watch me. The other day, Gallus Caesar sent his chaplain Aëtius hither, to find out whether I hold fast to the orthodox faith.
#BASIL.
Well——?
#JULIAN.
I am seldom absent from matins in the church. Moreover, I reckon the martyrs among the noblest of men; for truly it is no light matter to endure so great torments, ay, and death itself, for the sake of one’s creed. On the whole, I believe Aëtius departed well content with me.
#BASIL.
Julian,—for the sake of our true friendship,—open your heart fully to us.
#JULIAN.
I am the happiest man on earth, dear friends! And Maximus—ay, he is rightly named—Maximus is the greatest man that has ever lived.
#GREGORY.
We only wished to see you, my lord!
#JULIAN.
Can this estrange brother from brother? You shrink in affright from the inexplicable. Oh, I do not wonder. So I, too, shrank before my eyes were opened, and I divined that which is the kernel of life.
#BASIL.
What do you call the kernel of life?
#JULIAN.
Maximus knows it. In him is the new revelation.
#BASIL.
And it has been imparted to you?
#JULIAN.
Almost. I am on the eve of learning it. This very night Maximus has promised me——
#GREGORY.
Maximus is a visionary, or else he is deceiving you——!
#JULIAN.
How dare you judge of these hidden things? They are beyond your learning, my Gregory! Fearful is the way into the glory of glories. Those dreamers in Eleusis were near the right track; Maximus found it, and I after him—by his help. I have wandered through chasms of darkness. dead swampy water lay on my left—I believe it was a stream that had forgotten to flow. Piercing voices shrilled through the night confusedly, suddenly, and, as it were, without cause. Now and then I saw a bluish light; dreadful shapes floated past me;—I went on and on in deathly fear; but I endured the trial to the end.— Since then—oh, beloved ones—with this my body transformed to spirit, I have passed far into the land of paradise; I have heard the angels chant their hymns of praise; I have gazed at the midmost light——
#GREGORY.
Woe to this ungodly Maximus! Woe to this devil - devoted heathen juggler!
#JULIAN.
Blindness, blindness! Maximus pays homage to his precursor and brother—to both his great brothers, the law - giver of Sinai and the seer of Nazareth.—— Would you know how the spirit of realisation filled me?—It happened on a night of prayer and fasting. I perceived that I was wafted far—far out into space, and beyond time; for there was broad and sun - shimmering day around me, and I stood alone on a ship, with drooping sails, in the midst of the glassy, gleaming Aegean sea. Islands towered aloft in the distance, like dim, still banks of clouds, and the ship lay heavily, as though sleeping, upon the wine - blue plain.— Then behold! the plain became more and more transparent, lighter, thinner; at last, it was no longer there, and my ship hung over a fearful, empty abyss. No verdure down there, no sunlight,—only the dead, black, slimy bottom of the sea, in all its ghastly nakedness.—— But above, in the boundless dome, which before had seemed to me empty,—there was life; there invisibility clothed itself in form, and silence became sound.—Then I grasped the great redeeming realisation.
#GREGORY.
What realisation do you mean?
#JULIAN.
That which is, is not; and that which is not, is.
#BASIL.
Oh, you are going to wreck and ruin in this maze of mists and gleams! Do not miracles happen? Do not both omens and certain strange appearances among the stars declare that the divine will destines me to issues yet unrevealed?
#GREGORY.
Do not believe such signs; you cannot know whose work they are.
#JULIAN.
Am I not to believe in fortunate omens which events have already borne out? Know, my friends, that a great revolution is at hand. Gallus Caesar and I shall ere long share the dominion of the earth—he as Emperor, and I as—what shall I call it? the unborn cannot be called by a name, for it has none. So no more of this till the time be fulfilled. But of Caesar I dare speak.—Have you heard of the vision for which Apollinaris, a citizen of Sidon, has been imprisoned and put to the torture?
#BASIL.
No, no; how can we know——?
#JULIAN.
Apollinaris declared that he heard some one knocking many times at his door by night. He arose, and went out from his house; and lo! there he saw an apparition—whether man or woman, he could not tell. And the apparition spoke to him, and bade him make ready a purple robe, such as newly - chosen rulers wear. But when Apollinaris, in affright, would have declined so dangerous a task, the apparition vanished, and only a voice cried: “Go, go, Apollinaris, and speedily prepare the purple robe.”
#GREGORY.
Was this the sign that you said events had borne out?
#JULIAN.
Seven days later Caesar’s wife died in Bithynia. Constantina has always been his bad angel; therefore she had to be removed, in accordance with the change in the divine will. Three weeks after Constantina’s death, the Emperor’s emissary, the tribune Scudilo, came with a great retinue to Antioch, greeted Gallus Caesar with imperial honours, and invited him, in the Emperor’s name, to visit the imperial camp at Rome.—Caesar’s journey from province to province is now like a conqueror’s progress. In Constantinople he has held races in the hippodrome, and the multitude loudly acclaimed him when he, though as yet but Caesar by title, stood forth after the manner of the earlier Emperors, and gave the crown to Corax, the winner in the race. Thus marvellously does God again exalt our house, which had sunk under sin and persecution.
#GREGORY.
Strange! In Athens other reports were abroad.
#JULIAN.
I have certain information. The purple robe will soon be needed, Gregory! How, then, can I doubt as to the things which Maximus has foretold as near at hand for me? To - night the last veil falls. Here shall the great enigma be made manifest. Oh, stay with me, my brothers—stay with me through this night of anxiety and expectation! When Maximus comes you shall witness——
#BASIL.
Never!
#GREGORY.
It cannot be; we are on our way home to Cappadocia.
#JULIAN.
And what has driven you in such haste from Greece?
#BASIL.
My mother is a widow, Julian!
#GREGORY.
My father is feeble, both in body and mind; he needs my support.
#JULIAN.
Oh, at least remain at the hostelry; only until to - morrow——!
#GREGORY.
Impossible; our travelling companions start at daybreak.
#JULIAN.
At daybreak? Before midnight the day might dawn for you.
#BASIL.
Julian, let me not set forth in too great sorrow of soul. Tell me,—when Maximus has interpreted all riddles for you,—what then?
#JULIAN.
Do you remember that river whereof Strabo writes—that river which rises in the Lybian mountains? It grows, and grows in its course; but when it is at its greatest, it oozes into the desert sands, and buries itself in the entrails of the earth, whence it arose.
#BASIL.
Say not that you long for death, Julian!
#JULIAN.
What you slavishly hope for after death, ’tis the aim of the great mystery to win for all the initiated, here in our earthly life. ’Tis regeneration that Maximus and his disciples seek,—’tis our lost likeness to the godhead. Wherefore so full of doubt, my brothers? Why do you stand there as though before something insurmountable? I know what I know. In each successive generation there has been one soul wherein the pure Adam has been born again; he was strong in Moses the lawgiver; in the Macedonian Alexander he had power to subdue the world; he was well - nigh perfect in Jesus of Nazareth. But see, Basil——all of them lacked what is promised to me—the pure woman!
#BASIL.
Julian, Julian!
#GREGORY.
Blasphemer—to this has your pride of heart brought you!
#BASIL.
Oh, Gregory, he is sick and beside himself!
#JULIAN.
Why all this scornful doubt? Is it my small stature that witnesses against me? Ha, ha; I tell you this gross and fleshly generation shall pass away. That which is to come shall be conceived rather in the soul than in the body. In the first Adam, soul and body were equally balanced, as in those statues of the god Apollo. Since then the balance has been lost. Was not Moses tongue - tied? Had not his arms to be supported when he held them up in imprecation, there by the Red Sea? Did not the Macedonian need ever to be fired by strong drinks and other artificial aids? And Jesus of Nazareth, too? Was he not feeble in body? Did he not fall asleep in the ship, whilst the others kept awake? Did he not faint under the cross, that cross which the Jew Simon carried with ease? The two thieves did not faint.—You call yourselves believers, and yet have so little faith in miraculous revelation. Wait, wait—you shall see; the Bride shall surely be given me; and then—hand in hand will we go forth to the east, where some say that Helios is born,—we will hide ourselves in the solitudes, as the godhead hides itself, seek out the grove on the banks of Euphrates, find it, and there—oh glory of glories!—thence shall a new race, perfect in beauty and in balance, go forth over the earth; there, ye book - worshipping doubters, there shall the empire of the spirit be founded!
#BASIL.
Oh, well may I wring my hands in sorrow for your sake. Are you the same Julian who, three years ago, came out of Constantinople?
#JULIAN.
Then I was blind, as you are now; I knew only the way that stops short at doctrine.
#GREGORY.
Know you where your present way ends?
#JULIAN.
Where the path and the goal are one.—For the last time, Gregory, Basil—I implore you to stay with me. The vision I had last night,—that and many other things, point to a mysterious bond between us. To you, my Basil, I had so much to say. You are the head of your house; and who knows whether all the blessings that are promised me—may not come through you and yours——
#BASIL.
Never! No one with my good will shall ever be led away by your frenzies and your wild dreams.
#JULIAN.
Ah, why talk of will? I see a hand writing on the wall; soon I shall interpret the writing.
#GREGORY.
Come, Basil.
#JULIAN.
Oh, my friends, my friends!
#GREGORY.
Between us there is a gulf from this day forward.
#JULIAN.
Ay, go! Go, go!—What do you two learned men know? What bring you from the city of wisdom? You, my strong, masterful Gregory,—and you, Basil, more girl than man—you know only two streets in Athens, the street to the schools, and the street to the church; of the third street toward Eleusis and further, you know naught; and still less——. Ah!
#JULIAN.
At last!
#JULIAN.
Is the time come?
#MAXIMUS.
Art thou pure in soul and body?
#JULIAN.
I have fasted and anointed myself.
#MAXIMUS.
Then may the night’s high festival begin!
#JULIAN.
Maximus,—what is this?
#MAXIMUS.
Roses in the hair! Sparkling wine! See, see the lovely limbs at play!
#JULIAN.
And amid this whirl of the senses you would——?
#MAXIMUS.
Sin lies only in thy sense of sinfulness.
#JULIAN.
Roses in the hair! Sparkling wine! Ah! What was in the wine? spark of that fire which Prometheus stole.
#JULIAN.
My senses exchange their functions; I hear brightness and I see music.
#MAXIMUS.
Wine is the soul of the grape. The freed and yet willing captive. Logos in Pan!
#THE DANCING-GIRLS.
Would’st thou know liberty? Drain Bacchus’ blood;— Rock on the rhythm - sea, Float with its flood!
#JULIAN.
Yes, Yes; there is freedom in intoxication. Canst thou interpret this rapture?
#MAXIMUS.
This intoxication is thy marriage with the soul of nature.
#JULIAN.
Sweet riddle; tempting, alluring——! What was that? Why didst thou laugh?
#JULIAN.
There is whispering on my left hand! The silk cushions rustle—— Maximus, we are not alone!
#MAXIMUS.
We are five at table!
#JULIAN.
Symposium with the spirits!
#MAXIMUS.
With the shades.
#JULIAN.
Name my guests!
#MAXIMUS.
Not now. Hark, hark!
#JULIAN.
What is that? There is a rushing, as of a storm, through the house——
#MAXIMUS.
Julian! Julian! Julian!
#JULIAN.
Speak, speak! What is befalling us?
#MAXIMUS.
The hour of annunciation is upon thee!
#JULIAN.
Ah!
#MAXIMUS.
Thine eye toward the light!
#JULIAN.
Yonder?
#MAXIMUS.
Yes, yes!
#THE GIRLS’ SONG.
Night spreads her snares for thee, All - seeing night; Laughing - eyed Luxury Lures to delight.
#JULIAN.
Maximus! Maximus!
#MAXIMUS.
Seest thou aught?
#JULIAN.
Yes.
#MAXIMUS.
What seest thou?
#JULIAN.
I see a shining countenance in the light.
#MAXIMUS.
Man, or woman?
#JULIAN.
I know not.
#MAXIMUS.
Speak to it.
#JULIAN.
Dare I?
#MAXIMUS.
Speak! speak!
#JULIAN.
Why was I born?
#A VOICE IN THE LIGHT.
To serve the spirit.
#MAXIMUS.
Does it answer?
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes.
#MAXIMUS.
Ask further.
#JULIAN.
What is my mission?
#VALSIN.
To establish the empire.
#JULIAN.
What empire?
#VALSIN.
The empire.
#JULIAN.
And by what way?
#VALSIN.
By the way of freedom.
#JULIAN.
Speak clearly! What is the way of freedom?
#VALSIN.
The way of necessity.
#JULIAN.
And by what power?
#VALSIN.
By willing.
#JULIAN.
What shall I will?
#VALSIN.
What thou must.
#JULIAN.
It pales; it vanishes——! Speak, speak! What must I will?
#VALSIN.
Julian!
#MAXIMUS.
Gone?
#JULIAN.
Gone.
#MAXIMUS.
Dost thou now see clearly?
#JULIAN.
Now less than ever. I hang in the void over the yawning deep—midway between light and darkness. What is the empire?
#MAXIMUS.
There are three empires.
#JULIAN.
Three?
#MAXIMUS.
First that empire which was founded on the tree of knowledge; then that which was founded on the tree of the cross——
#JULIAN.
And the third?
#MAXIMUS.
The third is the empire of the great mystery; that empire which shall be founded on the tree of knowledge and the tree of the cross together, because it hates and loves them both, and because it has its living sources under Adam’s grove and under Golgotha.
#JULIAN.
And this empire shall come——?
#MAXIMUS.
It stands on the threshold. I have counted and counted——
#JULIAN.
The whispering again! Who are my guests?
#MAXIMUS.
The three corner - stones under the wrath of necessity.
#JULIAN.
Who, who?
#MAXIMUS.
The three great helpers in denial.
#JULIAN.
Name them!
#MAXIMUS.
I cannot; I know them not;—but I could show them to thee——
#JULIAN.
Then show me them! At once, Maximus——!
#MAXIMUS.
Beware——!
#JULIAN.
At once; at once! I will see them; I will speak with them, one by one.
#MAXIMUS.
The guilt be on thy head. Take shape and come to sight, thou first - elected lamb of sacrifice!
#JULIAN.
Ah!
#MAXIMUS.
What seest thou?
#JULIAN.
There he lies; just by the corner.—He is great as Hercules, and beautiful,—yet no, not—— Speak to me if thou canst!
#A VOICE.
What wouldst thou know?
#JULIAN.
What was thy task in life?
#VALSIN.
My sin.
#JULIAN.
Why didst thou sin?
#VALSIN.
Why was I not my brother?
#JULIAN.
Palter not with me. Why didst thou sin?
#VALSIN.
Why was I myself?
#JULIAN.
And what didst thou will, being thyself?
#VALSIN.
What I must.
#JULIAN.
And wherefore must thou?
#VALSIN.
I was myself.
#JULIAN.
Thou art sparing of words.
#MAXIMUS.
In vino veritas.]
#JULIAN.
Thou hast hit it, Maximus? Bathe thee in the fumes of wine, my pallid guest! Refresh thee. Feel, feel—it mounts aloft like the smoke of sacrifice.
#VALSIN.
The smoke of sacrifice does not always mount.
#JULIAN.
Why does that scar redden on thy brow? Nay, nay,—draw not the hair over it; What is it?
#VALSIN.
The mark.
#JULIAN.
H’m; no more of that. And what fruit has thy sin borne?
#VALSIN.
The most glorious.
#JULIAN.
What callest thou the most glorious?
#VALSIN.
Life.
#JULIAN.
And the ground of life?
#VALSIN.
Death.
#JULIAN.
And of death?
#VALSIN.
Ah, that is the riddle!
#JULIAN.
Gone!
#MAXIMUS.
Gone?
#JULIAN.
Yes.
#MAXIMUS.
Didst thou know him?
#JULIAN.
Yes.
#MAXIMUS.
Who was it?
#JULIAN.
Cain.
#MAXIMUS.
By that way, then! Ask no more!
#JULIAN.
The second, Maximus!
#MAXIMUS.
No, no, no; I will not!
#JULIAN.
The second, I say! Thou hast sworn that I should fathom the meaning of certain things. The second, Maximus. I will see him; I will know my guests!
#MAXIMUS.
Thou hast willed it, not I. Arise and come to light, thou willing slave, thou who didst help at the world’s next great turning - point.
#JULIAN.
No nearer!
#MAXIMUS.
Dost thou see him?
#JULIAN.
Yes.
#MAXIMUS.
How dost thou see him?
#JULIAN.
I see him as a red - bearded man. His garments are rent, and he has a rope round his neck—— Speak to him, Maximus!
#MAXIMUS.
’Tis thou must speak.
#JULIAN.
What wast thou in life?
#A VOICE.
The twelfth wheel of the world chariot.
#JULIAN.
The twelfth? The fifth is reckoned useless.
#VALSIN.
But for me, whither had the chariot rolled?
#JULIAN.
Whither did it roll by means of thee? Into the glory of glories.
#JULIAN.
Why didst thou help?
#VALSIN.
Because I willed.
#JULIAN.
What didst thou will?
#VALSIN.
What I must.
#JULIAN.
Who chose thee?
#VALSIN.
The master.
#JULIAN.
Did the master foreknow when he chose thee?
#VALSIN.
Ah, that is the riddle!
#MAXIMUS.
Thou art silent.
#JULIAN.
He is no longer here.
#MAXIMUS.
Didst thou know him?
#JULIAN.
Yes.
#MAXIMUS.
How was he called in life?
#JULIAN.
Judas Iscariot.
#MAXIMUS.
The abyss blossoms; the night betrays itself!
#JULIAN.
Forth with the third!
#MAXIMUS.
He shall come! Come forth, thou third corner - stone! Come forth, thou third great freed - man under necessity! What seest thou?
#JULIAN.
I see nothing.
#MAXIMUS.
And yet he is here. By Solomon’s seal, by the eye in the triangle—I conjure thee—come to sight!—— What seest thou now?
#JULIAN.
Nothing, nothing!
#MAXIMUS.
Come forth, thou——! Ah! lightning in the night! I see it;—all art is in vain.
#JULIAN.
Why? Speak, speak!
#MAXIMUS.
The third is not yet among the shades.
#JULIAN.
He lives?
#MAXIMUS.
Yes, he lives.
#JULIAN.
And here, sayest thou——!
#MAXIMUS.
Here, or there, or among the unborn;—I know not——
#JULIAN.
Thou liest! Thou art deceiving me! Here, here thou saidst——!
#MAXIMUS.
Let go my cloak!
#JULIAN.
Then it is thou, or I! But which of us?
#MAXIMUS.
Let go my cloak, Julian!
#JULIAN.
Which of us? Which? All hangs on that!
#MAXIMUS.
Thou knowest more than I. What said the voice in the light?
#JULIAN.
The voice in the light——! The empire! The empire? To found the empire——!
#MAXIMUS.
The third empire!
#JULIAN.
No; a thousand times no! Away, corrupter! I renounce thee and all thy works——
#MAXIMUS.
And necessity?
#JULIAN.
I defy necessity! I will not serve it! I am free, free, free!
#MAXIMUS.
What is this alarm and shrieking——?
#JULIAN.
Strange men are forcing their way into the house——
#MAXIMUS.
They are maltreating your servants; they will murder us!
#JULIAN.
Fear not; us no one can hurt.
#THE CHAMBERLAIN EUTHERIUS.
My lord, my lord!
#JULIAN.
What is that noise without?
#EUTHERIUS.
Strange men have surrounded the house; they have set a watch at all the doors; they are making their way in—almost by force. Here they come, my lord! Here they are!
#LEONTES.
Pardon, a thousand pardons, most gracious lord——
#JULIAN.
What do I see!
#LEONTES.
Your servants would have hindered me from entering; and as my errand was of the utmost moment——
#JULIAN.
You here, in Ephesus, my excellent Leontes!
#LEONTES.
I have travelled night and day, as the Emperor’s envoy.
#JULIAN.
To me? What would the Emperor with me? I swear I am unwitting of any crime. I am sick, Leontes! This man——attends me as my physician.
#LEONTES.
Permit me, my gracious lord——!
#JULIAN.
Why do you force your way into my house? What is the Emperor’s will?
#LEONTES.
His will is to gladden you, my lord, by a great and weighty announcement.
#JULIAN.
I pray you, let me know what announcement you bring.
#LEONTES.
My most noble lord,—with praise to your good fortune and my own, I hail you Caesar.
#THE QUAESTOR’S FOLLOWERS.
Long live Julian Caesar!
#MAXIMUS.
Caesar!
#JULIAN.
Caesar! Stand up, Leontes! What mad words are these!
#LEONTES.
I do but deliver the Emperor’s commands. Caesar!—Ah, where is Gallus?
#LEONTES.
Oh, do not ask me.
#JULIAN.
Where is Gallus? Tell me, I conjure you,—where is Gallus?
#LEONTES.
Gallus Caesar is with his beloved wife.
#JULIAN.
Dead?
#LEONTES.
In bliss, with his wife.
#JULIAN.
Dead! dead! Gallus dead! Dead in the midst of his triumphal progress! But when,—and where?
#LEONTES.
Oh, my dear lord, spare me——
#GREGORY OF NAZIANZUS.
I must go to him! Aside, I say!—Julian!
#JULIAN.
Gregory, brother,—after all, you come again?
#GREGORY.
Is it true, what rumour is scattering like a storm of arrows over the city?
#JULIAN.
I am myself transfixed by one of its arrows. Dare I believe in this blending of good hap and of ill?
#GREGORY.
For Christ’s sake, bid the tempter avaunt!
#JULIAN.
The Emperor’s commands, Gregory!
#GREGORY.
You will trample on your brother’s bloody corpse——
#JULIAN.
Bloody——?
#GREGORY.
Know you it not? Gallus Caesar was murdered.
#JULIAN.
Murdered?
#LEONTES.
Ah, who is this audacious——?
#JULIAN.
Murdered? Murdered? Tell me he lies!
#LEONTES.
Gallus Caesar has fallen through his own misdeeds.
#JULIAN.
Murdered!—Who murdered him?
#LEONTES.
What has occurred was inevitable, my noble lord! Gallus Caesar madly misused his power here in the East. He was no longer content with his rank as Caesar. His conduct, both in Constantinople and elsewhere on his progress, showed clearly what was in his mind.
#JULIAN.
’Tis not his crime I would know, but the rest.
#LEONTES.
Oh, let me spare a brother’s ears. brother’s ears can bear what a son’s ears have borne. Who killed him?
#LEONTES.
The tribune Scudilo, who escorted him, thought it advisable to have him executed.
#JULIAN.
Where? Not in Rome?
#LEONTES.
No, my lord; it happened on the journey thither,—in the city of Pola, in Illyria.
#JULIAN.
The Emperor is great and righteous.—The last of the race, Gregory!—The Emperor Constantius is great.
#LEONTES.
Noble Caesar, deign to array yourself——
#JULIAN.
Red! Away with it! Was it this he wore at Pola——?
#LEONTES.
This comes fresh from Sidon.
#JULIAN.
From Sidon! The purple robe——!
#MAXIMUS.
Apollinaris’s vision!
#GREGORY.
Julian! Julian!
#LEONTES.
See, this is sent to you by your kinsman, the Emperor. He bids me tell you that, childless as he is, he looks to you to heal this the deepest wound of his life. He wishes to see you in Rome. Afterwards, it is his will that you should go, as Caesar, to Gaul. The border tribes of the Alemanni have passed the Rhine, and made a dangerous inroad into the empire. He builds securely on the success of your campaign against the barbarians. Certain things have been revealed to him in dreams, and his last word to me at my departure was that he was assured you would succeed in establishing the empire.
#JULIAN.
Establish the empire! The voice in the light, Maximus!
#MAXIMUS.
Sign against sign.
#LEONTES.
How, noble Caesar?
#JULIAN.
I also have been forewarned of certain things; but this——
#GREGORY.
Say no, Julian! ’Tis the wings of destruction they would fasten on your shoulders.
#LEONTES.
Who are you, that defy the Emperor?
#GREGORY.
My name is Gregory; I am the son of the Bishop of Nazianzus;—do with me what you will.
#JULIAN.
He is my friend and brother; let no one touch him!
#BASIL OF CAESAREA.
Take not the purple, Julian!
#JULIAN.
You, too, my faithful Basil.
#BASIL.
Take it not! For the Lord God’s sake——
#JULIAN.
What terrifies you so in this?
#BASIL.
The horrors that will follow.
#JULIAN.
Through me shall the empire be established.
#BASIL.
Christ’s empire?
#JULIAN.
The Emperor’s great and beautiful empire.
#BASIL.
Was that the empire which shone before your eyes when, as a child, you preached the word beside the Cappadocian martyrs’ graves? Was that the empire you set forth from Constantinople to establish on earth? Was that the empire——?
#JULIAN.
Mists, mists;—all that lies behind me like a wild dream.
#BASIL.
’Twere better you yourself should be at the bottom of the sea, with a mill - stone about your neck, than that that dream should lie behind you.—— See you not the work of the tempter? All the glory of the world is laid at your feet.
#MAXIMUS.
Sign against sign, Caesar!
#JULIAN.
One word, Leontes! Whither do you lead me?
#LEONTES.
To Rome, my lord.
#JULIAN.
That is not what I ask. Whither do you lead me: to fortune and power,—or to the shambles?
#LEONTES.
Oh, my lord, so odious a suspicion——
#JULIAN.
My brother’s body can scarce have mouldered yet.
#LEONTES.
I can silence all doubt. This letter from the Emperor, which I had thought to hand you in private—— letter? What does he write?—— Ah, Helena! Oh, Leontes! Helena,—Helena to me!
#LEONTES.
The Emperor gives her to you, my lord! He gives you his beloved sister, for whom Gallus Caesar begged in vain.
#JULIAN.
Helena to me! The unattainable attained!—But she, Leontes——?
#LEONTES.
At my departure he took the Princess by the hand and led her to me. A flush of maiden blood swept over her lovely cheeks, she cast down her eyes, and said: “Greet my dear kinsman, and let him know that he has ever been the man whom——”
#JULIAN.
Go on, Leontes!
#LEONTES.
These words were all she spoke, the modest and pure woman.
#JULIAN.
The pure woman!—How marvellously is all fulfilled! Robe me in the purple!
#MAXIMUS.
You have chosen?
#JULIAN.
Chosen, Maximus!
#MAXIMUS.
Chosen, in spite of sign against sign?
#JULIAN.
Here is no sign against sign. Maximus, Maximus, seer though you be, you have been blind. Robe me in the purple!
#BASIL.
It is done!
#MAXIMUS.
Light and victory be to him who wills!
#LEONTES.
And now to the Governor’s palace; the people would fain greet Caesar.
#JULIAN.
Caesar, in his exaltation, remains what he was,—the poor lover of wisdom, who owes all to the Emperor’s grace.—To the Governor’s palace, my friends!
#VOICES AMONG THE QUAESTOR’S RETINUE.
Room, room for Julian Caesar!
#BASIL.
Gregory? Whatever comes of this—let us hold together.
#GREGORY.
Here is my hand.
#THE PRINCESS HELENA.
What a multitude! The whole city streams out to meet them.—Hark! Myrrha,—do you not hear flutes and drums?
#MYRRHA.
Yes, I think I can hear——
#HELENA.
You lie! The noise is too great; you can hear nothing. Oh, this torturing uncertainty! Not to know whether he comes as a conqueror or as a fugitive.
#MYRRHA.
Fear not, my noble mistress; Caesar has always returned a conqueror.
#HELENA.
Ay, hitherto; after all his lesser encounters. But this time, Myrrha! This great, fearful battle. All these conflicting rumours. If Caesar were victorious, why should he have sent that letter to the city magistrates, forbidding them to meet him with shows of honour outside the gates?
#MYRRHA.
Oh, you know well, my lady, how little your noble husband cares for such things.
#HELENA.
Yes, yes, that is true. And had he been defeated—they must have known it in Rome—would the Emperor have sent us this envoy who is to arrive to - day, and whose courier has brought me all these rich ornaments and gifts? Ah, Eutherius! Well? Well?
#THE CHAMBERLAIN EUTHERIUS.
My Princess, it is impossible to obtain any trustworthy tidings——
#HELENA.
Impossible? You are deceiving me! The soldiers themselves must surely know——
#EUTHERIUS.
They are only barbarian auxiliaries who are coming in—Batavians and others—and they know nothing.
#HELENA.
Oh, have I deserved this torture? Sweet, holy Christ, have I not called upon Thee day and night—— Ah, my Julian! I hear him!—Julian; my beloved!
#JULIAN CAESAR.
Helena!
#EUTHERIUS.
My noble Caesar!
#JULIAN.
Helena!—Bar all the doors, Eutherius!
#HELENA.
Defeated! Pursued!
#EUTHERIUS.
My lord!
#JULIAN.
Double guards at all the doors; let no one pass! Tell me: has any emissary arrived from the Emperor?
#EUTHERIUS.
No, my lord; but one is expected.
#JULIAN.
Go, go! Away with you.
#HELENA.
Then all is over with us?
#JULIAN.
Who knows? If we are cautious, the storm may yet——
#HELENA.
After such a defeat——?
#JULIAN.
Defeat? What are you talking of, my beloved?
#HELENA.
Have not the Alemanni defeated you?
#JULIAN.
If they had, you would not have seen me alive.
#HELENA.
Then, Lord of Heaven, what has happened?
#JULIAN.
The worst, Helena;—a stupendous victory.
#HELENA.
Victory, you say! A stupendous victory? You have conquered, and yet——?
#JULIAN.
You know not how I stand. You see only the gilded outside of all a Caesar’s misery.
#HELENA.
Julian!
#JULIAN.
Can you blame me for having hidden it from you? Did not both duty and shame constrain me——? Ah, what is this? What a change——!
#HELENA.
What? What?
#JULIAN.
How these months have changed you! Helena, you have been ill?
#HELENA.
No, no; but tell me——
#JULIAN.
Yes, you have been ill! You must be ill now;—your fever - flushed temples, the blue rings round your eyes——
#HELENA.
Oh, ’tis nothing, my beloved! Do not look at me, Julian! ’Tis only anxiety and wakeful nights on your account; ardent prayers to the Blessed One on the cross——
#JULIAN.
Spare yourself, my treasure; it is more than doubtful whether such zeal is of any avail.
#HELENA.
Fie; you speak impiously.—But tell me of your own affairs, Julian! I implore you, hide nothing from me.
#JULIAN.
Nothing can now be hidden. Since the Empress’s death, I have taken no single step here in Gaul that has not been evilly interpreted at court. If I went cautiously to work with the Alemanni, I was called timorous or inert. They laughed at the philosopher, ill at ease in his coat of mail. If I gained an advantage over the barbarians, I was told that I ought to have done more.
#HELENA.
But all your friends in the army——
#JULIAN.
Who, think you, are my friends in the army? I have not one, my beloved Helena! Yes, one single man—the knight Sallust, of Perusia, to whom, during our marriage feast at Milan, I had to refuse a slight request. He magnanimously came to me in the camp, appealed to our old friendship in Athens, and begged leave to stand at my side in all dangers. But what does Sallust count for at the imperial court? He is one of those whom they call heathens. He can be of no help to me.—And the others! Arbetio, the tribune, who left me in the lurch when I was blockaded by the Senones! Old Severus, burdened with the sense of his own impotence, yet unable to reconcile himself to my new strategy! Or think you I can depend on Florentius, the captain of the Praetorians? I tell you, that turbulent man is filled with the most unbridled ambitions.
#HELENA.
Ah, Julian!
#JULIAN.
If I could but come to the bottom of their intrigues! Every week secret letters pass between the camp and Rome. Everything I do is set down and distorted. No slave in the empire is so fettered as Caesar. Would you believe it, Helena, even my cook has to abide by a bill of fare sent to him by the Emperor; I may not alter it, either by adding or countermanding a single dish!
#HELENA.
And all this you have borne in secrecy——!
#JULIAN.
All know it, except you. All mock at Caesar’s powerlessness. I will bear it no longer! I will not bear it!
#HELENA.
But the great battle——? Tell me,—has rumour exaggerated——?
#JULIAN.
Rumour could not exaggerate.—Hush; what was that? No, no; I only thought—— I may say that in these months I have done all that mortal man could do. Step by step, and in spite of all hindrances in my own camp, I drove the barbarians back towards the eastern frontier. Before Argentoratum, with the Rhine at his back, King Knodomar gathered all his forces together. He was joined by five kings and ten lesser princes. But before he had collected the necessary boats for his retreat in case of need, I led my army to the attack.
#HELENA.
My hero, my Julian!
#JULIAN.
Lupicinus, with the spearmen and the light - armed troops, outflanked the enemy on the north; the old legions, under Severus, drove the barbarians more and more to the eastward, towards the river; our allies, the Batavians, under the faithful Bainabaudes, stood gallantly by the legions; and when Knodomar saw that his case was desperate, he tried to make off southwards, in order to reach the islands. But before he could escape, I sent Florentius to intercept him with the Praetorian guards and the cavalry. Helena, I dare not say it aloud, but certain it is that treachery or envy had nearly robbed me of the fruits of victory. The Roman cavalry recoiled time after time before the barbarians, who threw themselves down on the ground and stabbed the horses in the belly. Defeat stared us in the face——
#HELENA.
But the God of Battles was with you!
#JULIAN.
I seized a standard, fired the Imperial Guards by my shouts, made them a hasty address, which was, perhaps, not quite unworthy of a more enlightened audience, and then, rewarded by the soldiers’ acclamations, I plunged headlong into the thickest of the fight.
#HELENA.
Julian! Oh, you do not love me!
#JULIAN.
At that moment you were not in my thoughts. I wished to die; for I despaired of victory. But it came, my love! It seemed as though lightnings of terror flashed from our lance - points. I saw Knodomar, that redoutable warrior—ah, you have seen him too—I saw him fleeing on foot from the battlefield, and with him his brother Vestralp, and the kings Hortar and Suomar, and all who had not fallen by our swords.
#HELENA.
Oh, I can see it; I can see it! Blessed Saviour, ’twas thou that didst again send forth the destroying angels of the Milvian Bridge!
#JULIAN.
Never have I heard such shrieks of despair; never seen such gaping wounds as those we trampled on, as we waded through the slain. The river did the rest; the drowning men struggled among themselves until they rolled over, and went to the bottom. Most of the princes fell living into our hands; Knodomar himself had sought refuge in a bed of reeds; one of his attendants betrayed him, and our bowmen sent a shower of arrows into his hiding - place, but without hitting him. Then, of his own accord, he gave himself up.
#HELENA.
And after such a victory do you not feel secure?
#JULIAN.
On the very evening of the victory an accident occurred, a trifle——
#HELENA.
An accident?
#JULIAN.
I prefer to call it so. In Athens we used to speculate much upon Nemesis.—My victory was so overwhelming, Helena; my position had, as it were, got out of balance; I do not know——
#HELENA.
Oh, speak, speak; you put me on the rack!
#JULIAN.
It was a trifle, I tell you. I ordered the captive Knodomar to be brought before me, in the presence of the army. Before the battle, he had threatened that I should be flayed alive when I fell into his hands. Now he came towards me with faltering steps, trembling in every limb. Crushed by disaster, as the barbarians are apt to be, he cast himself down before me, embraced my knees, shed tears, and begged for his life.
#HELENA.
His mighty frame quivering with dread—I can see the prostrate Knodomar.—Did you kill him, my beloved?
#JULIAN.
I could not kill that man. I granted him his life, and promised to send him as a prisoner to Rome.
#HELENA.
Without torturing him?
#JULIAN.
Prudence bade me deal mercifully with him. But then—I cannot tell how it happened—with a cry of overflowing gladness, the barbarian sprang up, stretched his pinioned hands into the air, and, half ignorant as he is of our language, shouted with a loud voice: “Praise be to thee, Julian, thou mighty Emperor!”
#HELENA.
Ah!
#JULIAN.
My attendants were inclined to laugh; but the barbarian’s shout flew like a lightning - flash through the surrounding soldiery, kindling as it went. “Long live the Emperor Julian,” those who stood nearest repeated; and the cry spread around in wider and ever wider circles to the furthest distance. ’Twas as though some Titan had hurled a mighty rock far out into the ocean;—oh, my beloved, forgive me the heathen similitude, but——
#HELENA.
Emperor Julian! He said Emperor Julian!
#JULIAN.
What did the rude Aleman know of Constantius, whom he had never seen? I, his conqueror, was in his eyes the greatest——
#HELENA.
Yes, yes; but the soldiers——?
#JULIAN.
I rebuked them sternly; for I saw at a glance how Florentius, Severus, and certain others stood silently by, white with fear and wrath.
#HELENA.
Yes, yes, they—but not the soldiers.
#JULIAN.
Before a single night had passed my secret foes had distorted the affair. “Caesar has induced Knodomar to proclaim him Emperor,” the story went, “and in requital he has granted the barbarian his life.” And, thus inverted, the news has travelled to Rome.
#HELENA.
Are you sure of that? And through whom?
#JULIAN.
Ah, through whom? through whom? I myself wrote at once to the Emperor and told him everything, but——
#HELENA.
Well—and how did he answer?
#JULIAN.
As usual. You know his ominous silence when he means to strike a blow.
#HELENA.
I believe you misinterpret all this. It must be so. You will see that his envoy will soon assure you of——
#JULIAN.
I am assured, Helena! Here, in my bosom, I have some intercepted letters, which——
#HELENA.
Oh, Lord my God, let me see!
#JULIAN.
By - and - by. And all this after the services I have rendered him! I have put a stop to the inroads of the Alemanni for years to come, whilst he himself has suffered defeat after defeat on the Danube, and the army in Asia seems to make no way against the Persians. Shame and disaster on all sides, except here, where he placed a reluctant philosopher at the head of affairs. Yet none the less am I the scorn of the court. Even after the last great victory, they have lampooned me, and called me Victorinus. This must come to an end.
#HELENA.
So I, too, think.
#JULIAN.
On such terms, what is the title of Caesar worth?
#HELENA.
No; you are right, Julian; things cannot go on thus!
#JULIAN.
Helena, could you follow me?
#HELENA.
Have no fear for me; I will not fail you.
#JULIAN.
Then away from all this thankless toil; away to the solitude I have sighed for so long——!
#HELENA.
What do you say? Solitude!
#JULIAN.
With you, my beloved; and with my dear books, that I have so seldom been able to open here, save only on my sleepless nights.
#HELENA.
Ah, that is what you mean!
#JULIAN.
What else?
#HELENA.
Ay, truly; what else?
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes—I ask, what else?
#HELENA.
Julian—how did the barbarian king hail you?
#JULIAN.
Helena!
#HELENA.
What was the name that echoed through the ranks of the legions?
#JULIAN.
Rash woman; there may be an eavesdropper at every door!
#HELENA.
Why should you fear eavesdroppers? Is not God’s grace upon you? Have you not been victorious in every encounter?—I see the Saviour calling upon you; I see the angel with the flaming sword, who cleared the way for my father when he drove Maxentius into the Tiber!
#JULIAN.
Shall I rebel against the ruler of the empire?
#HELENA.
Only against those who stand between you. Oh, go, go; smite them with the lightning of your wrath; put an end to this harassing, joyless life! Gaul is an outer wilderness. I am so cold here, Julian! I pine for home, for the sunshine of Rome and Greece.
#JULIAN.
For home and your brother?
#HELENA.
Constantius is but a wreck.
#JULIAN.
Helena!
#HELENA.
I can bear it no longer, I tell you. Time is flying. Eusebia is gone; her empty seat invites me to honour and greatness, while I am ageing——
#JULIAN.
You are not ageing; you are young and fair!
#HELENA.
No, no, no! Time speeds; I cannot bear this patiently; life slips away from me!
#JULIAN.
How temptingly beautiful, how divine you are!
#HELENA.
Am I so indeed, Julian?
#JULIAN.
You are the only woman I have loved,—the only one who has loved me.
#HELENA.
I am older than you. I will not age still more. When all is over, then——
#JULIAN.
Hush! I will hear no more.
#HELENA.
Constantius is dying by inches; he hangs by a hair over the grave. Oh, my beloved Julian, you have the soldiers on your side——
#JULIAN.
No more, no more!
#HELENA.
He can bear no agitation. What is there, then, to recoil from? I mean nothing bloody. Fie, how can you think so? The terror will be enough; it will fold him in its embrace and gently end his sufferings.
#JULIAN.
Do you forget the invisible bodyguard around the Lord’s anointed?
#HELENA.
Christ is good. Oh, be pious, Julian, and He will forgive much. I will help. Prayers shall go up for you. Praised be the saints! Praised be the martyrs! Trust me, we will atone for everything later. Give me the Alemanni to convert; I will send out priests among them; they shall bow under the mercy of the cross.
#JULIAN.
The Alemanni will not bow.
#HELENA.
Then they shall die! Like sweet incense shall their blood rise up to Him, the blessed One. We will magnify His glory; His praise shall be made manifest in us. I myself will do my part. The women of the Alemanni shall be my care. If they will not bow, they shall be sacrificed! And then, my Julian—when next you see me——; young, young once more! Give me the women of the Alemanni, my beloved! Blood—’twould be no murder, and the remedy is a sovereign one—a bath of young virgins’ blood——
#JULIAN.
Helena, the thought is crime!
#HELENA.
Is it crime to commit crime for your sake?
#JULIAN.
You beautiful, you peerless one!
#HELENA.
My lord before God and men!—Draw not back this time, Julian! My hero, my Emperor! I see heaven open. Priests shall sing praises to Christ; my women shall assemble in prayer. Oh, thou blessed One! Oh, thou God of Hosts,—thou, in whose hand lie grace and victory——
#JULIAN.
Helena!
#HELENA.
Ah!
#THE CHAMBERLAIN EUTHERIUS.
My lord, the Emperor’s emissary——
#JULIAN.
Is he come?
#EUTHERIUS.
Yes, my lord!
#JULIAN.
His name? Who is he?
#EUTHERIUS.
The tribune Decentius.
#JULIAN.
Indeed? The pious Decentius!
#JULIAN.
Has he talked with any one?
#EUTHERIUS.
With no one, my lord; he has this moment arrived.
#JULIAN.
I will see him at once. And listen; one thing more. Summon the captains and officers to me here.
#EUTHERIUS.
It is well, most gracious lord.
#JULIAN.
Now, my Helena, now we shall see——
#HELENA.
Whatever happens, forget not that you can trust in the soldiers.
#JULIAN.
Ah, trust, trust——; I am not sure that I can trust in any one.
#HELENA.
Welcome, noble Decentius! A Roman face,—and, above all, this face,—oh! it sheds genial sunlight over our inclement Gaul.
#DECENTIUS.
The Emperor meets your longing and your hope half - way, noble Princess! We may hope that Gaul will not much longer hold you in its chains.
#HELENA.
Say you so, messenger of gladness? So the Emperor still thinks lovingly of me? How is it with his health?
#JULIAN.
Go, go, my beloved Helena!
#DECENTIUS.
The Emperor’s health is certainly no worse.
#HELENA.
No, surely not? I thought as much. All those alarming rumours——; God be praised that they were but rumours! Thank him most lovingly, good Decentius! And let me thank you too. What splendid gifts have heralded your coming! Imperial——no, let me say brotherly gifts indeed! Two shining black Nubians,—you should see them, my Julian!—and pearls! See, I am wearing them already. And fruits,—sweet, luscious fruits! Ah, peaches from Damascus, peaches in chalices of gold! How they will refresh me;—fruit, fruit; I am pining away here in Gaul. feast shall end the day; but business first. Go, my precious wife!
#HELENA.
I go to the church,—to pray for my brother and for all good hopes.
#JULIAN.
A message, or letters?
#DECENTIUS.
Letters.
#JULIAN.
More!
#DECENTIUS.
Noble Caesar, that is well - nigh all.
#JULIAN.
Truly? Has the Emperor sent his friend all this long way only to——? Had Knodomar, the King of the Alemanni, arrived in Rome ere you left?
#DECENTIUS.
Yes, noble Caesar!
#JULIAN.
And how fares he in the strange land, ignorant as he is of our tongue! For he knows nought of it, Decentius! He was positively a laughing - stock to my soldiers. Only think, he mixed up two such common words as Emperor and Caesar.
#DECENTIUS.
A barbarian. What can one expect?
#JULIAN.
No, what can one expect? But the Emperor has received him graciously?
#DECENTIUS.
Knodomar is dead, my lord!
#JULIAN.
Knodomar dead!
#DECENTIUS.
Dead, in the foreigners’ quarters, on the Coelian hill.
#JULIAN.
Dead? Indeed!—Ah, the Roman air is unwholesome.
#DECENTIUS.
The King of the Alemanni died of home - sickness, my lord! The longing for kindred and freedom——
#JULIAN.
——wastes a man away, Decentius; yes, yes, I know that.—I should not have sent him living to Rome. I should have had him killed here.
#DECENTIUS.
Caesar’s heart is merciful.
#JULIAN.
H’m——! Home - sickness? Indeed! Are you there, old faun? Tempt me no more. Since the battle at Argentoratum, he is for ever talking to me of the triumphal chariot and the white horses. ’Twould be like Phaeton’s career with the Lybian sun - horses. How did that end? Have you forgotten—have you forgotten your heathendom, I had almost said?—Pardon me, Decentius, for wounding your pious ear.
#DECENTIUS.
Caesar delights his servant’s ear; he cannot wound it.
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes; bear with Caesar’s jesting. In truth I know not how else to take the matter.—Here they are.
#JULIAN.
Greeting to you, brothers in arms and friends. Blame me not overmuch for summoning you hither, straight from the dust and toil of the march; truly, I should not have grudged you some hours’ rest; but——
#FLORENTIUS.
Has aught of moment happened, my lord?
#JULIAN.
Aye, truly. Can you tell me—what was lacking to complete Caesar’s happiness?
#FLORENTIUS.
What should be lacking to complete Caesar’s happiness?
#JULIAN.
Now, nothing. The army has demanded that I should enter the city in triumph. They would have had me pass through the gates of Lutetia at the head of the legions. Captive barbarian princes, with pinioned hands, were to march beside my chariot - wheels; women and slaves from twenty conquered peoples were to follow, crowded closely together, head against head—— Rejoice, my valiant fellow soldiers; here you see the Tribune Decentius, the Emperor’s trusted friend and councillor. He has arrived this morning with gifts and greetings from Rome.
#FLORENTIUS.
Ah, then indeed naught can be lacking to complete Caesar’s happiness.
#SEVERUS.
Incomprehensible! Then he is in the Emperor’s grace again!
#FLORENTIUS.
Oh, this unstable Emperor!
#JULIAN.
You seem all to be struck dumb with astonishment.—They think the Emperor has done too much, good Decentius!
#FLORENTIUS.
How can Caesar think such a thought?
#SEVERUS.
Too much, noble Caesar? By no means. Who doubts that the Emperor knows how to set due bounds to his favour?
#FLORENTIUS.
This is in truth a rare and remarkable distinction——
#SEVERUS.
I should even call it beyond measure rare and remarkable——
#FLORENTIUS.
And especially does it afford a striking proof that our august Emperor’s mind is free from all jealousy——
#SEVERUS.
An unexampled proof, I venture to call it.
#FLORENTIUS.
But then, what has not Caesar achieved in these few years in Gaul? year - long dream, dear friends! I have achieved nothing. Nothing, nothing!
#FLORENTIUS.
All this your modesty counts as nothing? What was the army when you took command? A disorderly rabble——
#SEVERUS.
——without coherence, without discipline, without direction——
#JULIAN.
You exaggerate, Severus!
#FLORENTIUS.
And was it not with this undisciplined rabble that you took the field against the Alemanni? Did you not win battle after battle with these levies, till your victories transformed them into an invincible host? Did you not retake Colonia Agrippina——?
#JULIAN.
Come come, you see with the eye of friendship, my Florentius!—Or is it really so? Is it a fact, that I drove the barbarians out of the islands of the Rhine! That I placed the ruined Tres Tabernae in a posture of defence, making it a bulwark of the empire? Is it really so?
#FLORENTIUS.
What, my lord! Can you be in doubt as to so great deeds?
#JULIAN.
No, I cannot but think—— And the battle of Argentoratum? Was I not there? I cannot but fancy that I defeated Knodomar. And after the victory——; Florentius, have I dreamt it, or did I rebuild Trajan’s fortress, when we marched into German territory?
#FLORENTIUS.
Noble Caesar, is there any man so mad as to deny you the honour of these exploits?
#SEVERUS.
I praise the destiny that has vouchsafed to my old age so victorious a leader.
#FLORENTIUS.
I dare scarcely think what turn this inroad of the Alemanni might have taken, but for Caesar’s courage and conduct.
#MANY COURTIERS.
Yes, yes; Caesar is great!
#OTHERS.
Caesar is peerless!
#JULIAN.
So blind is friendship, Decentius! So blind, so blind! Here I read far other tidings! listen and drink in the refreshing dew of knowledge. This is the Emperor’s despatch to all the proconsuls of the empire;—our excellent Decentius has brought me a copy of it. Here we learn that I have accomplished nothing in Gaul. It was, as I told you, a dream. Here we have the Emperor’s own words: it was under the Emperor’s happy auspices that the imminent danger to the empire was averted.
#FLORENTIUS.
All the affairs of the empire flourish under the Emperor’s auspices.
#JULIAN.
More, more. It is here set forth that it was the Emperor who fought and conquered on the Rhine; it was the Emperor who raised up the King of the Alemanni, as he lay grovelling before him. My name is not fortunate enough to find any place in this document,—nor yours, Florentius, nor yours, Severus! And here, in the description of the battle of Argentoratum—where was it? Yes, here it stands!—it was the Emperor who determined the order of battle; it was the Emperor himself who, at peril of his life, fought till his sword was blunted, in the forefront of the battle: it was the Emperor who, by the terror of his presence, put the barbarians to headlong flight——; read, read, I tell you!
#SEVERUS.
Noble Caesar, your word suffices.
#JULIAN.
What mean you, then, by your deluding speeches, my friends? Would you, in your too great love for me, make me a parasite, to be fed with the leavings you have pilfered from my kinsman’s table?—What think you, Decentius? What say you to this? You see, in my own camp, I have to keep an eye on adherents who, in their blind zeal, are sometimes in danger of straying over the border - line of revolt.
#FLORENTIUS.
I assure you, my words have been sadly misconstrued if——
#SEVERUS.
It could never enter my mind to——
#JULIAN.
That is right, my brothers in arms; let us all agree to swallow our vainglory. I asked what was lacking to complete Caesar’s happiness. Now you know it. ’Twas the recognition of the truth that was lacking in Caesar’s happiness. Your silver helmet will never be dimmed with the dust of the triumph, Florentius! The Emperor has already triumphed for us, in Rome. He therefore declares all festivities here to be superfluous. Go, Sintula, and see that the intended procession is countermanded. The Emperor wishes to give his soldiers a much - needed rest. ’Tis his will that they remain in the camp outside the walls.
#JULIAN.
Was I not once a philosopher? They said so, at least, both in Athens and Ephesus. So weak is human nature in the hours of success; I had almost been false to philosophy. The Emperor has brought me to my senses. Thank him most humbly, Decentius. Have you more to say?
#DECENTIUS.
One thing more. From all the Emperor has learnt, and especially from the letter you wrote him from Argentoratum, it appears that the great work of pacification in Gaul is happily accomplished.
#JULIAN.
Most certainly; the Emperor, partly by his valour, partly by his magnanimous clemency——
#DECENTIUS.
The Rhine frontier of the empire has been placed in security.
#JULIAN.
By the Emperor, by the Emperor.
#DECENTIUS.
In the Danubian provinces, on the contrary, affairs are going ill; and still worse in Asia—King Sapor makes constant progress.
#JULIAN.
What audacity! Rumour has it that not even in this summer’s campaign has the Emperor been pleased to let his generals crush him.
#DECENTIUS.
The Emperor intends to do so himself in the spring. Here he makes known his will, noble Caesar.
#JULIAN.
Let us see, let us see! Ah!
#DECENTIUS.
It must be done, this very day.
#JULIAN.
This very day; of course. Come hither, Sintula! Where is he?—Ah, I remember!—Call Sintula back!
#FLORENTIUS.
I implore you not to misinterpret what I said. When I gave Caesar the credit, of course I did not mean to——
#SEVERUS.
It could never occur to me to doubt that it was the Emperor’s supreme and wise direction that——
#A COURTIER.
I beg you, noble sir,—put in a word for me at court, and release me from this painful position in the household of a Caesar who——; well, he is the Emperor’s exalted kinsman, but——
#ANOTHER COURTIER.
I could tell you, alas! of things that indicate not only boundless vanity, but overweening ambition——
#JULIAN.
This very day! Let me say one word, Decentius! It has long been my dearest wish to lay down this burden of responsibility.
#DECENTIUS.
It shall be conveyed to the Emperor.
#JULIAN.
I call heaven to witness that I never——; Ah, here is Sintula; now we can—— You are going?
#DECENTIUS.
I have affairs to transact with the generals, noble Caesar!
#JULIAN.
Without my intervention?
#DECENTIUS.
The Emperor commands me to spare his beloved kinsman.
#JULIAN.
Sintula!
#SINTULA.
Yes, noble master!
#JULIAN.
Come nearer—Yes, by my faith, you look honest. Pardon me; I never thought you could be so attached to me.
#SINTULA.
How know you that I am attached to you, my lord?
#JULIAN.
I can read it here, in this; it is written that you are to desert me.
#SINTULA.
I, my lord?
#JULIAN.
The Emperor disbands the army of Gaul, Sintula!
#SINTULA.
Disbands——?
#JULIAN.
Yes, what is it but a disbanding? The Emperor needs reinforcements, both on the Danube, and against the Persians. Our Batavian and Herulian auxiliaries are to depart with all speed, in order to reach Asia in the spring.
#SINTULA.
But the thing is impossible, my lord. You have solemnly sworn to these very allies that they shall in no case be called upon to serve beyond the Alps.
#JULIAN.
Just so, Sintula! The Emperor writes that I gave that promise over hastily, and without his consent. This is quite a new light to me; but here it stands. I am to be forced to break my word, dishonour myself in the eyes of the army, turn against me the unbridled rage of the barbarians, perhaps their murderous weapons.
#SINTULA.
They cannot hurt you, my lord! The Roman legions will make their breasts your shield.
#JULIAN.
The Roman legions. H’m;—my simple - minded friend! From every Roman legion three hundred men are to be drafted off, and are likewise to join the Emperor by the shortest route.
#SINTULA.
Ah! This is——?
#JULIAN.
Well planned, is it not? Every branch of the army is to be set against me, that I may the more easily be disarmed.
#SINTULA.
And I tell you, my lord, that not one of your generals will lend himself to such a design.
#JULIAN.
My generals are not to be led into temptation. You are the man.
#SINTULA.
I, my Caesar!
#JULIAN.
Here it is written. The Emperor commissions you to take all necessary measures, and then to lead the chosen detachments to Rome.
#SINTULA.
This task assigned to me? With men here like Florentius and old Severus——
#JULIAN.
You have no victories to your discredit, Sintula!
#SINTULA.
No, that is true. I have never been allowed an opportunity of showing——
#JULIAN.
I have been unjust to you. Thanks for your fidelity.
#SINTULA.
So great an imperial honour! My lord, may I see——
#JULIAN.
What would you see? You surely would not lend yourself to such a design.
#SINTULA.
God forbid that I should disobey the Emperor!
#JULIAN.
Sintula,—would you disarm your Caesar?
#SINTULA.
Caesar has ever undervalued me. Caesar has never forgiven me the fact of his having to endure about his person a Master of the Horse chosen by the Emperor.
#JULIAN.
The Emperor is great and wise; he chooses well.
#SINTULA.
My lord,—I long to set about my duty; may I beg to see the Emperor’s commission?
#JULIAN.
Here is the Emperor’s commission. Go, and do your duty.
#MYRRHA.
Oh merciful Redeemer!
#JULIAN.
Myrrha! What is the matter?
#MYRRHA.
Oh kind heaven, my mistress——
#JULIAN.
Your mistress,—what of her?
#MYRRHA.
Sickness or frenzy——; help, help!
#JULIAN.
Helena sick! The physician! Oribases must come, Sintula! Summon him!
#HELENA.
Loosen the comb! Loosen the comb, I say! It is red hot. My hair is on fire; I burn, I burn!
#JULIAN.
Helena! For God’s pity’s sake——!
#HELENA.
Will no one help me? They are killing me with needle - pricks!
#JULIAN.
My Helena! What has befallen you?
#HELENA.
Myrrha, Myrrha! Save me from the women, Myrrha!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
What horror do I hear——? Is it true? Ah!
#JULIAN.
Helena! My love, light of my life——!
#HELENA.
Away from me! Oh sweet Jesus, help!
#JULIAN.
She is raving. What can it be, Oribases?—See—see her eyes, how large——!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
What has the Princess taken? What has she been eating or drinking?
#JULIAN.
Ah, you think——?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Answer, women; what have you given the Princess?
#MYRRHA.
We? Oh nothing, I swear; she herself——
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Well? Well?
#MYRRHA.
Some fruits; they were peaches, I think;—oh, I know not——
#JULIAN.
Fruits! Peaches? Some of those which——?
#MYRRHA.
Yes—no—yes; I do not know, my lord; it was two Nubians——
#JULIAN.
Help, help, Oribases!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Alas, I fear——
#JULIAN.
No, no, no!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Hush, gracious lord; she is coming to herself.
#HELENA.
Why did the sun go down? Oh holy mysterious darkness!
#JULIAN.
Helena! Listen; collect your thoughts——
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
My noble Princess——
#JULIAN.
It is the physician, Helena! No, here, where I stand.
#HELENA.
Faugh! there he was again!
#JULIAN.
She does not see me. Here, here, Helena!
#HELENA.
The loathsome creature;—he is always about me.
#JULIAN.
What does she mean?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Stand apart, gracious lord——!
#HELENA.
Sweet stillness! He does not dream——; oh my Gallus!
#JULIAN.
Gallus!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Go, noble Caesar; it is not meet——!
#HELENA.
How boldly your close - curling hair curves over your neck! Oh that short, thick neck——
#JULIAN.
Abyss of all abysses——!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
The delirium is increasing——
#JULIAN.
I see, I see. We must take note, Oribases!
#HELENA.
Now he would be taking notes again.—Ink on his fingers; book - dust in his hair—unwashed; faugh, faugh, how he stinks.
#MYRRHA.
My lord, shall I not——?
#JULIAN.
Away with you, woman!
#HELENA.
How could you let yourself be conquered by him, you great - limbed, bronzed barbarian? He cannot conquer women. How I loathe this impotent virtue.
#JULIAN.
Stand apart, all of you! Not so near, Oribases! I myself will watch the Princess.
#HELENA.
Art thou wroth with me, thou glorious one? Gallus is dead. Beheaded. What a blow that must have been! Be not jealous, oh my first and last? Burn Gallus in hell fire;—it was none but thou, thou, thou——!
#JULIAN.
No nearer, Oribases!
#HELENA.
Kill the priest, too! I will not see him after this. Thou knowest our sweet secret. Oh thou, my days’ desire, my nights’ delight! It was thou thyself—in the form of thy servant—in the oratory; yes, yes, thou wast there; it was thou—in the darkness, in the heavy air, in the shrouding incense - clouds, that night, when the Caesar growing beneath my heart——
#JULIAN.
Ah!
#HELENA.
My lover and my lord! Mine, mine——!
#JULIAN.
Galilean!
#SALLUST.
The Princess in a swoon! Oh, then it is true!
#JULIAN.
Tell me the truth. Did you know before to - day that——; you understand me; have you known aught of——the Princess’s condition?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
I, like every one else, my lord.
#JULIAN.
And you said naught to me, Oribases!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Of what, my Caesar?
#JULIAN.
How dared you conceal it from me?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
My lord, there was one thing we none of us knew.
#JULIAN.
And that was?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
That Caesar knew nothing.
#JULIAN.
Where are you going?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
To try the remedies my art prescribes——
#JULIAN.
I believe your art will prove powerless.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
My lord, it is yet possible that——
#JULIAN.
Powerless, I tell you!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Noble Caesar, it is my duty to disobey you in this.
#JULIAN.
What think you I mean? Go, go; try what your art——; save the Emperor’s sister; the Emperor will be inconsolable if his thoughtful affection should bring any disaster in its train. Of course you know that those fruits were a gift from the Emperor?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Ah!
#JULIAN.
Go, go, man,—try what your art——
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
I believe my art will prove powerless, my lord!
#JULIAN.
Ah, is it you, Sallust? What think you? The waves of fate are once more beginning to sweep over my race.
#SALLUST.
Oh, but rescue is at hand. Oribases will——
#JULIAN.
The Princess will die.
#SALLUST.
Oh, if I dared speak! If I dared trace out the secret threads in this web of destruction!
#JULIAN.
Be of good cheer, friend; all the threads shall be brought to light, and then——
#DECENTIUS.
How shall I look Caesar in the face! How inscrutable are the ways of God! Crushed to earth——; oh that you could but read my heart! That I should be the harbinger of sorrow and disaster——!
#JULIAN.
Yes, that you may say twice over, noble Decentius! And how shall I find soft and specious enough terms to bring this in any endurable guise to the ears of her imperial brother!
#DECENTIUS.
Alas that such a thing should happen so close upon the coming of my mission! And just at this moment! Oh, what a thunderbolt from a cloudless sky of hope!
#JULIAN.
Oh, this towering and devouring tempest, just as the ship seemed running into the long - desired haven! Oh, this—this——! Sorrow makes us eloquent, Decentius,—you as well as me. But first to business. The two Nubians must be seized and examined.
#DECENTIUS.
The Nubians, my lord? Could you dream that my indignant zeal would for another instant suffer the two negligent servants to——?
#JULIAN.
What! Surely you have not already——?
#DECENTIUS.
Call me hasty, if you will, noble Caesar. But my love to the Emperor and to his sorrow - stricken house would in truth be less than it is if, in such an hour, I were capable of calm reflection.
#JULIAN.
Have you killed both the slaves?
#DECENTIUS.
Had not their negligence deserved a sevenfold death? They were two heathen savages, my lord! Their testimony would have been worthless; it was impossible to wring anything out of them, save that they had left their precious charge standing for some time unwatched in the antechamber, accessible to every one——
#JULIAN.
Aha! Had they indeed, Decentius?
#DECENTIUS.
I accuse no one. But oh, beloved Caesar, I bid you beware; for you are surrounded by faithless servants. Your court—by an unhappy misunderstanding!—fancies that some sort of disfavour—or what should I call it?—is implied in the measures which the Emperor has found it necessary to adopt; in short——
#SINTULA.
My lord, you have imposed on me a charge I can in no way fulfil.
#JULIAN.
The Emperor imposed it, good Sintula!
#SINTULA.
Relieve me of it, my lord; it is utterly beyond me.
#DECENTIUS.
What has happened?
#SINTULA.
The camp is in wild revolt. The legions and the allies are banding together——
#DECENTIUS.
Rebelling against the Emperor’s will!
#SINTULA.
The soldiers are shouting that they appeal to Caesar’s promises.
#JULIAN.
Hark! hark! that roar outside——!
#SINTULA.
The rioters are rushing hither——
#DECENTIUS.
Let no one enter!
#SALLUST.
Too late; the whole courtyard is filled with angry soldiers.
#DECENTIUS.
Caesar’s precious life is in danger! Where is Florentius?
#SINTULA.
Fled.
#DECENTIUS.
The blustering coward! And Severus?
#SINTULA.
Severus feigns sickness; he has driven out to his farm.
#JULIAN.
I myself will speak to the madmen.
#DECENTIUS.
Not a step, noble Caesar!
#JULIAN.
What now?
#DECENTIUS.
’Tis my duty, gracious lord; the Emperor’s command—; his beloved kinsman’s life—; Caesar is my prisoner.
#SALLUST.
Ah!
#JULIAN.
So it has come at last!
#DECENTIUS.
The household guard, Sintula! You must conduct Caesar in safety to Rome.
#JULIAN.
To Rome!
#SINTULA.
What say you, my lord?
#DECENTIUS.
To Rome, I say!
#JULIAN.
Like Gallus! Help, help!
#SALLUST.
Fly, my Caesar! Fly, fly!
#CRIES AMONG THE SOLDIERS.
Caesar, Caesar!
#OTHER VOICES.
Caesar, why have you betrayed us?
#AGAIN OTHERS.
Down with the faithless Caesar!
#JULIAN.
Fellow - soldiers, brothers in arms,—save me from my enemies!
#DECENTIUS.
Ah, what is this——?
#WILD CRIES.
Down with Caesar! Strike him down!
#JULIAN.
Close round me in a circle; draw your swords!
#MAURUS.
They are drawn already!
#WOMEN.
Strike him, cut him down!
#JULIAN.
I thank you for coming! Maurus! Honest Maurus! Yes, yes; you I can trust.
#A BATAVIAN SOLDIER.
How dare you send us to the ends of the earth? Was that what you swore to us?
#OTHER ALLIES.
Not over the Alps! We are not bound to go!
#JULIAN.
Not to Rome! I will not go; they would murder me, as they murdered my brother Gallus!
#MAURUS.
What say you, my lord?
#DECENTIUS.
Do not believe him!
#JULIAN.
Lay no finger on the noble Decentius; the fault is not his.
#LAIPSO.
That is true; the fault is Caesar’s.
#JULIAN.
Ah, is that you, Laipso! My gallant friend, is that you? You fought well at Argentoratum.
#LAIPSO.
Caesar has not forgotten that?
#VARRO.
But he forgets his promises!
#JULIAN.
Was not that the voice of the undaunted Varro? Ah, there he is! Your wound is healed, I see. Oh, well - deserving soldier,—why would they not let me make you captain?
#VARRO.
Was it indeed your wish?
#JULIAN.
Blame not the Emperor for refusing my request. The Emperor knows none of you as I know you.
#DECENTIUS.
Soldiers, hear me——!
#MANY VOICES.
We have nothing to do with the Emperor!
#OTHERS.
It is Caesar we call to account!
#JULIAN.
What power has your hapless Caesar, my friends? They would take me to Rome. They deny even the control of my private affairs. They seize upon my share of the spoils of war. I thought to give every soldier five gold pieces and a pound of silver, but——
#THE SOLDIERS.
What does he say?
#JULIAN.
’Tis not the Emperor who forbids it, but bad and envious councillors. The Emperor is good, my dear friends! But oh, the Emperor is sick; he can do nothing——
#MANY SOLDIERS.
Five gold pieces and a pound of silver!
#OTHER SOLDIERS.
And that they deny us!
#OTHERS AGAIN.
Who dares deny Caesar anything?
#MAURUS.
Is it thus they treat Caesar, the soldiers’ father?
#LAIPSO.
Caesar, who has been rather our friend than our master? Is it not true?
#MANY VOICES.
Yes, yes, it is!
#VARRO.
Should not Caesar, the victorious general, be suffered to choose his captains as he pleases?
#MAURUS.
Should he not have free control over the spoils that fall to his share?
#LOUD SHOUTS.
Yes, yes, yes!
#JULIAN.
Alas, what would it profit you? What need you care for worldly goods, you, who are to be led forth to the most distant lands, to meet a doubtful fate——?
#SOLDIERS.
We will not go!
#JULIAN.
Look not at me; I am ashamed; I can scarce help weeping when I think that, within a few months, you will be a prey to pestilence, famine, and the weapons of a bloodthirsty foe.
#MANY SOLDIERS.
Caesar! Kind Caesar!
#JULIAN.
And your defenceless wives and children, whom you must leave behind in your scattered homes! Who shall protect them in their pitiable plight, soon to be widowed and fatherless, and exposed to the vengeful onslaughts of the Alemanni?
#THE WOMEN.
Caesar, Caesar, protect us!
#JULIAN.
What is Caesar? What can the fallen Caesar do?
#LAIPSO.
Write to the Emperor, and let him know——
#JULIAN.
Ah, what is the Emperor? The Emperor is sick in mind and body; he is broken down by his care for the empire’s weal. Is it not so, Decentius?
#DECENTIUS.
Yes, doubtless; but——
#JULIAN.
How it cut me to the heart when I heard—— Pray for his soul, you who worship the good Christ! Offer sacrifices for his recovery, you who have remained faithful to the gods of your fathers!——Know you that the Emperor has held a triumphal entry into Rome?
#MAURUS.
The Emperor!
#VARRO.
What? As he returned, beaten, from the Danube?
#JULIAN.
As he returned from the Danube, he held a triumph for our victories——
#DECENTIUS.
Noble Caesar, reflect——!
#JULIAN.
Yes, the Tribune says well; reflect how our Emperor’s mind must be clouded, when he can do such things! Oh, my sorely afflicted kinsman! When he rode into Rome through the mighty arch of Constantine, he fancied himself so tall that he bent his back and bowed his head down to his saddle - bow.
#MAURUS.
Like a cock in a doorway.
#SOME VOICES.
Is that an Emperor?
#VARRO.
Shall we obey him?
#LAIPSO.
Away with him!
#MAURUS.
Caesar, do you take the helm!
#DECENTIUS.
Rebellion——!
#MANY VOICES.
Seize the throne; seize the throne, Caesar!
#JULIAN.
Madmen! Is this language for Romans? Would you imitate the barbarous Alemanni? What was it Knodomar cried at Argentoratum? Answer me, good Maurus,—what did he cry out?
#MAURUS.
He cried, “Long live the Emperor Julian!”
#JULIAN.
Ah, hush, hush! What are you saying?
#MAURUS.
Long live the Emperor Julian!
#THOSE BEHIND.
What is afoot?
#VARRO.
They are proclaiming Julian Emperor!
#LOUD CRIES.
Long live the Emperor! Long live the Emperor Julian!
#JULIAN.
Oh, I entreat you——! Soldiers, friends, brothers in arms,—see, I stretch out my trembling arms to you——! Be not alarmed, my Decentius!—Oh that I should live to see this! I do not blame you, my faithful friends; it is despair that has driven you to this. You will have it? Good; I submit to the will of the army.—Sintula, call the generals together.—You, Tribune, can bear witness to Constantius that ’twas only on compulsion that I—— Go, captain, and make known throughout the camp this unlooked - for turn of events. I will write without delay to Rome——
#SALLUST.
My lord, the soldiers clamour to see you. circlet of gold on your head, Emperor!
#JULIAN.
I have never possessed such a gaud. Maurus. This will serve.
#SHOUTS OUTSIDE.
The Emperor, the Emperor! We will see the Emperor!
#SOLDIERS.
On the shield with him! Up, up!
#JULIAN.
The will of the army be done! I bow before the inevitable, and renew all my promises——
#LEGIONARIES.
Five gold pieces and a pound of silver!
#BATAVIANS.
Not over the Alps!
#JULIAN.
We will occupy Vienna. ’Tis the strongest city in Gaul, and well supplied with provisions of every sort. There I intend to wait until we see whether my afflicted kinsman sanctions what we have here determined, for the empire’s weal——
#SALLUST.
That he will never do, my lord!
#JULIAN.
Divine wisdom enlighten his darkened soul, and guide him for the best! Be thou with me, Fortune, who hast never yet deserted me!
#MYRRHA AND THE WOMEN.
Dead, dead, dead!
#JULIAN.
Still no sign?
#A VOICE.
None.
#JULIAN.
Neither yes nor no? Neither for nor against?
#VALSIN.
Both.
#JULIAN.
That is the same as nothing.
#VALSIN.
Wait, wait.
#JULIAN.
I have waited five days; you asked for only three. I tell you——I have no mind to—— Do not speak!
#SALLUST.
My lord, my lord!
#JULIAN.
Is it you, Sallust? What would you down here?
#SALLUST.
This thick darkness——; ah! now I see you.
#JULIAN.
What do you want?
#SALLUST.
To serve you, if I can,—to lead you out to the living again.
#JULIAN.
What news from the world above?
#SALLUST.
The soldiers are restless; there are signs on all hands that their patience will soon be exhausted.
#JULIAN.
Is the sun shining up there?
#SALLUST.
Yes, my lord.
#JULIAN.
The vault of heaven is like a sea of glittering light. Perhaps it is high noon. It is warm; the air quivers along the walls of the houses; the river, half - shrunken in its bed, ripples over the white flints.—Beautiful life! Beautiful earth!
#SALLUST.
Oh come, my lord, come! This stay in the catacombs is construed to your hurt.
#JULIAN.
How is it construed?
#SALLUST.
Dare I tell you?
#JULIAN.
You dare, and you must. How is it construed?
#SALLUST.
Many believe that it is remorse rather than sorrow that has driven you underground in this strange fashion.
#JULIAN.
They think I killed her?
#SALLUST.
The mystery of the case may excuse them, if——
#JULIAN.
No one killed her, Sallust! She was too pure for this sinful world; therefore an angel from heaven descended every night into her secret chamber, and called upon her. You doubt it? Know you not that this is how the priests in Lutetia accounted for her death? And the priests ought to know. Has not the transport of her body hither been like a triumphal progress through the land? Did not all the women of Vienna stream forth beyond the gates to meet her coffin, hailing her with green boughs in their hands, spreading draperies on the road, and singing songs of praise to the bride of heaven, who was being brought home to the bridegroom’s house?—Why do you laugh?
#SALLUST.
I, my lord?
#JULIAN.
Ever since, I have heard bridal songs night and day. Listen, listen; they are wafting her up to glory. Ay, she was indeed a true Christian woman. She observed the commandment strictly;—she gave to Caesar what was Caesar’s, and to the other she gave——; but ’twas not of that you came to speak; you are not initiated in the secrets of the faith, Sallust!—What news, I ask?
#SALLUST.
The weightiest news is that on learning of the events at Lutetia, the Emperor fled hastily to Antioch.
#JULIAN.
That news I know. No doubt Constantius already saw us in imagination before the gates of Rome.
#SALLUST.
The friends who boldly cast in their lot with you in this dangerous business, saw in imagination the same thing.
#JULIAN.
The time is not auspicious, Sallust! Know you not that in the martial games, before we left Lutetia, my shield broke in pieces, so that only the handle remained in my grasp? And know you not that, when I was mounting my horse, the groom stumbled as I swung myself up from his folded hands?
#SALLUST.
Yet you gained the saddle, my lord!
#JULIAN.
But the man fell.
#SALLUST.
Better men will fall if Caesar loiters.
#JULIAN.
The Emperor is at death’s door.
#SALLUST.
The Emperor still lives. The letters you wrote him as to your election——
#JULIAN.
My enforced election. They constrained me, I had no choice.
#SALLUST.
The Emperor does not hold that explanation valid. He designs, as soon as he has mustered an army in the eastern provinces, to march into Gaul.
#JULIAN.
How know you that——?
#SALLUST.
By an accident, my lord! Believe me, I entreat you——!
#JULIAN.
Good, good; when that happens, I will go to meet Constantius—not sword in hand——
#SALLUST.
Not? How, then, do you think to meet him?
#JULIAN.
I will render to the Emperor what is the Emperor’s.
#SALLUST.
Mean you that you will abdicate?
#JULIAN.
The Emperor is at death’s door.
#SALLUST.
Oh that vain hope! Then take my life, my lord!
#JULIAN.
What now?
#SALLUST.
Caesar, take my life; I would rather die by your will than by the Emperor’s.
#JULIAN.
Rise, friend!
#SALLUST.
No, let me lie at my Caesar’s feet, and confess all. Oh, beloved master,—to have to tell you this!—When I sought you out in the camp on the Rhine,—when I recalled to you the old friendship of our Athenian days,—when I begged to share with you the dangers of war,—then, oh Caesar, I came as a secret spy, in the Emperor’s pay——
#JULIAN.
You——!
#SALLUST.
My mind had for some time been inflamed against you. You remember that little variance in Milan—yet no little one for me, who had hoped that Caesar would help to restore my waning fortunes. Of all this they took advantage in Rome; they regarded me as the very man to spy out your doings.
#JULIAN.
And you could sell yourself so basely? To so black a treachery!
#SALLUST.
I was ruined, my lord; and I thought Caesar had forsaken me. Yes, my Caesar, I betrayed you——, during the first few months; but not afterwards. Your friendliness, your magnanimity, all the favour you showed me——; I became, what I had professed to be, your faithful adherent; and in my secret letters to Rome I put my employers on false scents.
#JULIAN.
Those letters were from you?—Oh, Sallust!
#SALLUST.
They contained nothing to injure you, my lord! What others may have written, I know not; I only know that I often enough groaned in anguish under my enforced and hated silence. I ventured as far as I by any means dared. That letter written to an unnamed man in your camp, which contained an account of the Emperor’s triumphal entry in Rome, and which you found one morning on the march to Lutetia pushed under your tent - flap——; you did find it, my lord?
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes——?
#SALLUST.
That was directed to me, and chance favoured me in bringing it into your hands. I dared not speak. I longed to, but I could not; I put off from day to day the confession of my shame. Oh, punish me, my lord; see, here I lie!
#JULIAN.
Stand up; you are dearer to me thus,—conquered without my will and against your own. Stand up, friend of my soul; no one shall touch a hair of your head.
#SALLUST.
Rather take the life which you will not long have power to shield. You say the Emperor is at death’s door. My Caesar, what I have sworn to conceal, I now reveal to you. There is no hope for you in the Emperor’s decay. The Emperor is taking a new wife.
#JULIAN.
Ah, what madness! How can you think——?
#SALLUST.
The Emperor is taking a new wife, my lord! Read, read, noble Caesar; these letters will leave you no room for doubt.
#JULIAN.
Yes, by the light and might of Helios——!
#SALLUST.
Oh that I had dared to speak sooner!
#JULIAN.
He take a woman to wife! Constantius,—that dwindling shadow of a man——! Faustina,—what is this?—young, scarcely nineteen,—a daughter of——ah! a daughter of that insolent tribe. Therefore, of course, a zealous Christian woman. You are right, Sallust; his decay gives no room for hope. What though he be decrepit, dying,—what of that? Is not Faustina pious. An annunciating angel will appear; or even——; ha - ha!—in short,—by some means or other,—a young Caesar will be forthcoming, and thus——
#SALLUST.
Delay means ruin.
#JULIAN.
This move has long been planned in all secrecy, Sallust! Ah, now all the riddles are solved. Helena——, ’twas not, as I conceived, her heedless tongue that destroyed her——
#SALLUST.
No, my lord!
#JULIAN.
——they thought,—they believed that——! oh inscrutable, even - handed retribution! that was why she had to die.
#SALLUST.
Yes, that was the reason, I was the man they first pitched upon in Rome. Oh, my lord, you cannot doubt that I refused to do it? I pleaded the impossibility of finding an occasion; they assured me that the abominable design was abandoned, and then——!
#JULIAN.
They will not stop at—at the double corpse in the sarcophagus up yonder. Constantius takes another wife. That is why I was to be disarmed in Lutetia.
#SALLUST.
One thing alone can save you, my Caesar: you must act before the Emperor has recruited his forces.
#JULIAN.
What if, of my own free will, I withdrew into solitude, devoting myself to that wisdom which I have here been forced to neglect? Would the new men in power leave me undisturbed? Would not the very fact of my existence be like a sword hanging over their heads?
#SALLUST.
The kinsmen of the Empress that is to be are the men who surrounded Gallus Caesar in his last hours.
#JULIAN.
The tribune Scudilo. Trust me, friend,—I have not forgotten that. And am I to yield and fall before this bloodthirsty Emperor! Am I to spare him who for long years has stumbled about among the corpses of my nearest kin!
#SALLUST.
If you spare him, in less than three months he will be stumbling among the corpses of your adherents.
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes; there you are right. It is almost my imperative duty to stand up against him. If I do, ’twill not be for my own sake. Do not the weal and woe of thousands hang in the balance? Are not thousands of lives at stake? Or could I have averted this extremity? You are more to blame than I, Sallust! Why did you not speak before?
#SALLUST.
In Rome they made me swear a solemn oath of secrecy.
#JULIAN.
An oath? Indeed! By the gods of your forefathers?
#SALLUST.
Yes, my lord—by Zeus and by Apollo.
#JULIAN.
And yet you break your oath?
#SALLUST.
I wish to live.
#JULIAN.
But the gods?
#SALLUST.
The gods—they are far away.
#JULIAN.
Yes, your gods are far away; they hamper no one; they are a burden to no one; they leave a man elbow - room for action. Oh, that Greek happiness, that sense of freedom——! You said that the Emperor, vengeful as he is, will pour out the blood of my friends. Yes, who can doubt that? Was Knodomar spared? Did not that harmless captive pay with his life for an error of language? For—I know it, Sallust—they killed him; that tale about the barbarian’s home - sickness was a lie. Then what may not we expect? In what a hateful light must not Decentius have represented matters in Rome?
#SALLUST.
That you may best understand from the hasty flight of the court to Antioch.
#JULIAN.
And am I not my army’s father, Sallust?
#SALLUST.
The soldiers’ father; their wives’ and children’s buckler and defence.
#JULIAN.
And what will be the fate of the empire should I waver now? A decrepit Emperor, and after him a helpless child, upon the throne; faction and revolt; every man’s hand against his neighbour, in the struggle for power.—Not many nights ago I saw a vision. A figure appeared before me, with a halo round its head; it looked wrathfully upon me, and said: “Choose!” With that it vanished away, like morning mist. Hitherto I had interpreted it as referring to something far different; but now that I know of the Emperor’s approaching marriage—— Yes, indeed, it is time to choose, ere misfortune overwhelms the empire. I am not thinking of my own interest; but dare I shirk the choice, Sallust? Is it not my duty to the Emperor to defend my life? Have I a right to stand with folded arms and await the murderers whom he, in his mad panic, is bribing to hew me down? Have I a right to give this unhappy Constantius an opportunity of heaping fresh blood - guiltiness upon his sinful head? Were it not better for him—as the Scriptures say—that he should suffer wrong rather than do wrong? If, therefore, this that I do to my kinsman can be called a wrong, I hold that the wrong is wiped out by the fact that it hinders my kinsman from inflicting a wrong on me. I think that both Plato and Marcus Aurelius, that crowned bridegroom of wisdom, would support me in that. At any rate, it would be no unworthy problem for the philosophers, my dear Sallust!—Oh that I had Libanius here!
#SALLUST.
My lord, you are yourself so far advanced in philosophy, that——
#JULIAN.
True, true; yet I would fain hear the views of certain others. Not that I am vacillating. Do not think that! Nor do I see any reason to doubt a favourable issue. For those omens should by no means discourage us. The fact that I retained the handle, when my shield broke during the games, may with ample reason, I think, be taken to mean that I shall succeed in holding what my hand has grasped. And if, in vaulting upon my horse, I overthrew the man who helped me to mount, may not this portend a sudden fall to Constantius, to whom I owe my rise? Be this as it may, my Sallust, I look forward to composing a treatise which shall most clearly justify——
#SALLUST.
Very good, my gracious lord; but the soldiers are impatient; they would fain see you, and learn their fate from your own lips.
#JULIAN.
Go, go and pacify them;—tell them that Caesar will presently show himself.
#SALLUST.
My lord, ’tis not Caesar, it is the Emperor himself they want to see.
#JULIAN.
The Emperor is coming.
#SALLUST.
Then he comes—though empty - handed—yet with the lives of thousands in his hands! barter, Sallust; the lives of thousands against the death of thousands.
#SALLUST.
Have your enemies the right to live?
#JULIAN.
Happy you, whose gods are afar off. Oh, to possess this hardihood of will——!
#A VOICE.
Julian, Julian!
#SALLUST.
Ah! What is that?
#JULIAN.
Leave me, dear friend; go quickly!
#VALSIN.
Silence the psalm - singing, Julian!
#SALLUST.
It calls again. Oh, then it is true!
#JULIAN.
What is true?
#SALLUST.
That you abide down here with a mysterious stranger, a soothsayer or a magician, who came to you by night.
#JULIAN.
Ha - ha; do they say that? Go, go!
#SALLUST.
I conjure you, my lord,—have done with these noxious dreams. Come with me; come up to the light of day!
#VALSIN.
All my labour is vain.
#JULIAN.
No sign, my brother?
#VALSIN.
Desolation and emptiness.
#JULIAN.
Oh, Maximus!
#SALLUST.
Maximus!
#JULIAN.
Go, I tell you! If I leave this house of corruption, it will be as Emperor.
#SALLUST.
I implore you——; what seek you here in the darkness?
#JULIAN.
Light. Go, go!
#SALLUST.
If Caesar loiters, I fear he will find the way barred against him.
#JULIAN.
Speak, my Maximus!
#MAXIMUS.
All my labour is vain, I tell you. Why could you not silence the psalm - singing? It strangled all the omens; they would have spoken, but could utter nothing.
#JULIAN.
Silence, darkness;—and I can wait no longer! What do you counsel me to do?
#MAXIMUS.
Go forward blindly, Emperor Julian. The light will seek you out.
#JULIAN.
Yes, yes, yes; that I, too, believe. I need not, after all, have sent for you all this long way. Know you what I have just heard——?
#MAXIMUS.
I will not know what you have heard. Take your fate into your own hands.
#JULIAN.
After all, what is he, this Constantius—this Fury - haunted sinner, this mouldering ruin of what was once a man?
#MAXIMUS.
Be that his epitaph, Emperor Julian!
#JULIAN.
In his whole treatment of me, has he not been like a rudderless wreck,—now drifting to the left on the current of suspicion, now hurled to the right by the storm - gust of remorse? Did he not stagger, terror - stricken, up to the imperial throne, his purple mantle dripping with my father’s blood? perhaps with my mother’s too?—Had not all my kin to perish that he might sit secure? No, not all; Gallus was spared, and I;—a couple of lives must be left wherewith to buy himself a little pardon. Then he drifted into the current of suspicion again. Remorse wrung from him the title of Caesar for Gallus; then suspicion wrung from him Caesar’s death - warrant. And I? Do I owe him thanks for the life he has hitherto vouchsafed me? One after the other; first Gallus, and then——; every night I have sweated with terror lest the next day should be my last.
#MAXIMUS.
Were Constantius and death your worst terrors? Think.
#JULIAN.
No, you are right. The priests——! My whole youth has been one long dread of the Emperor and of Christ. Oh, he is terrible, that mysterious—that merciless god - man! At every turn, wheresoever I wished to go, he met me, stark and stern, with his unconditional, inexorable commands.
#MAXIMUS.
And those commands—were they within you?
#JULIAN.
Always without. Always “Thou shalt.” If my soul gathered itself up in one gnawing and consuming hate towards the murderer of my kin, what said the commandment: “Love thine enemy!” If my mind, athirst for beauty, longed for scenes and rites from the bygone world of Greece, Christianity swooped down on me with its “Seek the one thing needful!” If I felt the sweet lusts of the flesh towards this or that, the Prince of Renunciation terrified me with his: “Kill the body that the soul may live!”—All that is human has become unlawful since the day when the seer of Galilee became ruler of the world. Through him, life has become death. Love and hatred, both are sins. Has he, then, transformed man’s flesh and blood? Has not earth - bound man remained what he ever was? Our inmost, healthy soul rebels against it all;—and yet we are to will in the very teeth of our own will! Thou shalt, shalt, shalt!
#MAXIMUS.
And you have advanced no further than that! Shame on you!
#MAXIMUS.
Yes, you, the man of Athens and of Ephesus.
#JULIAN.
Ah, those times, Maximus! ’Twas easy to choose then. What were we really working at? A philosophic system; neither more nor less.
#MAXIMUS.
Is it not written somewhere in your Scriptures! “Either with us or against us”?
#JULIAN.
Did not Libanius remain the man he was, whether he took the affirmative in a disputation, or the negative? This lies deeper. Here it is action that must be faced. “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s.” In Athens I once made a game of that;—but it is no game. You cannot grasp it, you, who have never been under the power of the god - man. It is more than a doctrine he has spread over the world; it is an enchantment, that binds the soul in chains. He who has once been under it,—I believe he can never quite shake it off.
#MAXIMUS.
Because you do not wholly will.
#JULIAN.
How can I will the impossible?
#MAXIMUS.
Is it worth while to will what is possible?
#JULIAN.
Word - froth from the lecture - halls! You can no longer cram my mind with that. And yet——oh no, no, Maximus! But you cannot understand how it is with us. We are like vines transplanted into a new, strange soil; transplant us back again, and we die; yet in the new soil we cannot thrive.
#MAXIMUS.
We? Whom do you call we?
#JULIAN.
All who are under the terror of the revelation. terror of shadows!
#JULIAN.
Be that as it may. But do you not see that this paralysing terror has curdled and coiled itself up into a wall around the Emperor? Ah, I see very well why the great Constantine promoted such a will - binding doctrine to power and authority in the empire. No bodyguard with spears and shields could form such a bulwark round the throne as this benumbing creed, for ever pointing beyond our earthly life. Have you looked closely at these Christians? Hollow - eyed, pale - cheeked, flat - breasted, all; they are like the linen - weavers of Byssus; they brood their lives away unspurred by ambition; the sun shines for them, and they do not see it; the earth offers them its fulness, and they desire it not;—all their desire is to renounce and suffer, that they may come to die.
#MAXIMUS.
Then use them as they are; but you yourself must stand without. Emperor or Galilean;—that is the alternative. Be a thrall under the terror, or monarch in the land of sunshine and gladness! You cannot will contradictions; and yet that is what you would fain do. You try to unite what cannot be united,—to reconcile two irreconcilables; therefore it is that you lie here rotting in the darkness.
#JULIAN.
Show me light if you can!
#MAXIMUS.
Are you that Achilles, whom your mother dreamed that she should give to the world? A tender heel alone makes no man an Achilles. Arise, my lord! Confident of victory, like a knight on his fiery steed, you must trample on the Galilean, if you would reach the imperial throne——
#JULIAN.
Maximus!
#MAXIMUS.
My beloved Julian, look at the world around you! Those death - desiring Christians you speak of are fewest of the few. And how is it with all the others? Are not their minds falling away from the Master, one by one? Answer me,—what has become of this strange gospel of love? Does not sect rage against sect? And the bishops, those gold - bedecked magnates, who call themselves the chief shepherds of the church! Do they yield even to the great men of the court in greed and ambition and sycophancy——?
#JULIAN.
They are not all like that; think of the great Athanasius of Alexandria——
#MAXIMUS.
Athanasius stood alone. And where is Athanasius now? Did they not drive him out, because he would not sell himself to serve the Emperor’s will? Was he not forced to take refuge in the Libyan desert, where he was devoured by lions? And can you name me one other like Athanasius? Think of Maris, the bishop of Chalcedon, who has now changed sides three times in the Arian controversy. Think of old Bishop Marcus, of Arethusa; him you know from your boyhood. Has he not lately, in the teeth of both law and justice, taken all municipal property from the citizens, and transferred it to the church? And remember the feeble, vacillating Bishop of Nazianzus, who is the laughing - stock of his own community, because he answers yes and no in the same cause, in the hope to please both parties.
#JULIAN.
True, true, true!
#MAXIMUS.
These are your brothers in arms, my Julian; you will find none better among them. Or perhaps you count upon those two great Galilean lights that were to be, in Cappadocia? Ha - ha; Gregory, the bishop’s son, pleads causes in his native town, and Basil, on his estate in the far east, is buried in the writings of secular philosophers.
#JULIAN.
Yes, I know it well. On all sides they fall away! Hekebolius, my former teacher, has grown rich through his zeal for the faith, and his expositions of it; and since then——! Maximus—it has come to this, that I stand almost alone in earnestness.
#MAXIMUS.
You stand quite alone. Your whole army is either in headlong flight, or lying slain around you. Sound the battle - call,—and none will hear you; advance,—and none will follow you! Dream not that you can do anything for a cause which has despaired of itself. You will be beaten, I tell you! And where will you turn then? Disowned by Constantius, you will be disowned by all other powers on earth,—and over the earth. Or will you flee to the Galilean’s bosom? How stands the account between you and him? Did you not own, a moment ago, that you are under the terror? Have you his commands within you? Do you love your enemy, Constantius, even if you do not smite him? Do you hate the lusts of the flesh or the alluring joys of this world, even if you do not, like a heated swimmer, plunge into their depths? Do you renounce the world, because you have not courage to make it your own? And are you so very sure that—if you die here—you shall live yonder?
#JULIAN.
What has he done for me, he who exacts so much? If he hold the reins of the world - chariot in his hands, it must have been within his power to—— Listen, listen! They call that serving him. And he accepts it as a sweet - smelling sacrifice. Praise of himself,—and praise of her in the coffin! If he be omniscient, how then can he——?
#THE CHAMBERLAIN EUTHERIUS.
My Caesar! My lord, my lord; where are you?
#JULIAN.
Here, Eutherius? What would you with me?
#EUTHERIUS.
You must come up, my lord;—you must see it with your own eyes;—the Princess’s body is working miracles.
#JULIAN.
You lie!
#EUTHERIUS.
I do not lie, my lord! I am no believer in this foreign doctrine; but what I have seen I cannot doubt.
#JULIAN.
What have you seen?
#EUTHERIUS.
The whole town is in a frenzy. They are bearing the sick and crippled to the Princess’s bier; the priests let them touch it, and they go away healed.
#JULIAN.
And this you yourself have seen?
#EUTHERIUS.
Yes, my lord; I saw an epileptic woman go forth from the church healed, praising the Galileans’ God.
#JULIAN.
Ah, Maximus, Maximus!
#EUTHERIUS.
Hark, how the Christians exult;—some fresh miracle must have happened.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Eutherius,—have you found him? Eutherius, Eutherius, where is Caesar?
#JULIAN.
Here, here;—is it true, Oribases?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Incredible, inexplicable,—and yet true; they touch the bier, the priests read and pray over them, and they are healed; from time to time a voice proclaims: “Holy, holy, is the pure woman!” voice proclaims——?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
The voice of one invisible, my Caesar; a voice high up under the vaultings of the church——; no man knows whence it comes.
#JULIAN.
Life or the lie!
#MAXIMUS.
Choose!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Come, come, my lord; the awe - stricken soldiers threaten you——
#JULIAN.
Let them threaten.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
They accuse you and me of the Princess’s death——
#JULIAN.
I will come; I will satisfy them——
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
There is only one way: you must turn their thoughts in another direction, my lord;—they are wild with despair over the fate awaiting them if you delay any longer.
#MAXIMUS.
Now go to heaven, thou fool; now die for thy Lord and Master!
#JULIAN.
The Emperor’s empire for me!
#MAXIMUS.
Achilles!
#JULIAN.
What looses the covenant?
#MAXIMUS.
This.
#JULIAN.
What washes the water away?
#MAXIMUS.
The blood of the sacrifice.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
What is your purpose, my lord?
#JULIAN.
Ask not.
#EUTHERIUS.
Hark to the clamour! Up, up, my Caesar!
#JULIAN.
First down,—then up. The sanctuary, my beloved brother——?
#MAXIMUS.
Straight below, in the second vault.
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
Caesar, Caesar,—whither are you going?
#MAXIMUS.
To freedom.
#JULIAN.
Through darkness to light. Ah——!
#MAXIMUS.
So it has come at last!
#EUTHERIUS.
Speak, speak; what mean these hidden arts?
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
And now, when every instant is precious——
#MAXIMUS.
These gliding, clammy shadows! Faugh! The slimy things crawling underfoot——!
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
The turmoil waxes, Eutherius! It is the soldiers; listen, listen!
#EUTHERIUS.
It is the song in the church——
#THE PHYSICIAN ORIBASES.
No, ’tis the soldiers!—here they come!
#SALLUST.
Be reasonable, I entreat you——!
#THE SOLDIERS.
Caesar has betrayed us! Caesar shall die!
#SALLUST.
And what then, madmen!
#MAURUS.
What then? With Caesar’s head we will buy forgiveness——
#THE SOLDIERS.
Come forth, come forth, Caesar!
#SALLUST.
Caesar,—my Caesar, where are you?
#JULIAN.
Helios! Helios!
#MAXIMUS.
Free!
#THE CHOIR IN THE CHURCH ABOVE.
Our Father which art in heaven!
#SALLUST.
Where is he? Eutherius, Oribases,—what is here afoot?
#THE CHOIR.
Hallowed be Thy name! Julian. It is finished!
#THE SOLDIERS.
Caesar!
#SALLUST.
Blood - stained——! What have you done?
#JULIAN.
Cloven the mists of terror.
#MAXIMUS.
Creation lies in your hand.
#THE CHOIR.
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven!
#JULIAN.
Now Constantius has no longer a bodyguard.
#MAURUS.
What say you, my lord?
#JULIAN.
Ah! My faithful ones! Up into the daylight to Rome, and to Greece!
#THE SOLDIERS.
Long live the Emperor Julian!
#JULIAN.
We will not look back; all ways lie open before us. Up into the daylight! Through the church! The liars shall be silenced——! The army mine, the treasure mine, the throne mine!
#THE CHOIR.
Lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil!
#JULIAN.
Free, free! Mine is the kingdom!
#SALLUST.
And the power and the glory!
#THE CHOIR.
Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory——
#JULIAN.
Ah!
#MAXIMUS.
Victory!
#THE CHOIR.
——For ever and ever, amen! - -
