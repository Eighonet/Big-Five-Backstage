#VON BREMER.
Where am I?… Oh, yes … I actually went home with the woman, it seems… Oh, there she is… Queer, what sort of things can happen, even at my age. I haven’t the faintest notion, did they carry me up here? No… I remember—coming into the room… I was still awake then, or waked up … or … or maybe it’s only the room that reminds of something?… ’Pon my soul, yes, of course … it was yesterday I saw it… What! yesterday, a couple of hours ago!—But, I knew, that something had to happen… I felt it in my bones … when I began to drink yesterday, I felt that … and what has happened?… Nothing… Or did there…? ’Pon my soul … for … for ten years it hasn’t happened to me that I don’t know… Well, let’s be honest at any rate, I was drunk… If I only knew since when… I remember perfectly when Bobby and I went into the all - night café, and … no, no… We left together … and then on the way… Yes, that’s it, Bobby and I rode in my carriage… But, why do I worry my brains about it? It doesn’t really matter. Let’s see that we get out of here. Oh! Well, she sleeps the sleep of the just. I don’t remember anything—but I’ll put the money on the table … and then, good - by… If I didn’t know what she is! I’ve known many who didn’t look as virtuous even in their sleep. ’Pon my soul… Bobby would say again, I’m philosophizing, but the truth is, sleep makes all equal, so it seems to me—like its brother, death… Hm, I should like to know, whether… No, I’d remember that… No, no, I dropped like a log on the sofa right away … and nothing happened… It is unbelievable how much alike all women sometimes look… Well, let’s go Oh, of course.
#MARY.
Well … who’s there so early in the morning—? Good morning, sonny!
#VON BREMER.
Good morning. Have a good sleep?
#MARY.
Oh, come here. Give me a little kiss.
#VON BREMER.
I was just going…
#MARY.
Going?
#VON BREMER.
It’s really about time.
#MARY.
You want to go away?
#VON BREMER.
Well…
#MARY.
Well, good - by, you’ll come some other time.
#VON BREMER.
Yes, good - by. But, won’t you give me your hand?
#VON BREMER.
Just as with a princess. Besides, if one only…
#MARY.
Why do you look at me that way?
#VON BREMER.
If one only sees the head, as now … anyway, each and every one looks innocent when she first awakes … ’pon my soul, one might imagine almost anything, if the kerosene didn’t smell so…
#MARY.
Yes, the lamps are always a nuisance.
#VON BREMER.
How old are you really?
#MARY.
Well, what would you guess?
#VON BREMER.
Twenty - four.
#MARY.
Oh, of course!
#VON BREMER.
Older?
#MARY.
I’m not yet twenty.
#VON BREMER.
And how long have you been… year.
#VON BREMER.
You began early.
#MARY.
Better too early, than too late.
#VON BREMER.
Tell me, are you really happy?
#MARY.
Am I, what?
#VON BREMER.
I mean, are things going well with you?
#MARY.
Oh, things always go well with me.
#VON BREMER.
Yes… Well, did it never occur to you that you might become something else?
#MARY.
What might I become?
#VON BREMER.
Well… You are a very pretty girl. You might take a lover, for example.
#MARY.
Do you imagine I haven’t any?
#VON BREMER.
Yes, I know that—But I mean just one single one, who would take care of you, so that you wouldn’t have to go with everybody.
#MARY.
I don’t go with everybody. Thank heaven, I don’t have to. I pick those I want.
#MARY.
We move downtown next month, to the Spiegelgasse.
#VON BREMER.
We? Who?
#MARY.
Well, the Madam, and the couple of other girls who live here.
#VON BREMER.
There are others—
#MARY.
Next door … don’t you hear?… that is Milly. She was in the café too.
#VON BREMER.
I hear some one snoring.
#MARY.
That’s Milly. She will snore the whole day long until ten o’clock to - night. Then she gets up, and goes to the café.
#VON BREMER.
What an awful life!
#MARY.
Of course it is. It annoys the Madam a lot. I’m always on the streets by noon.
#VON BREMER.
What do you do on the streets at noon?
#MARY.
What do you suppose I do? I’m going on my beat then.
#VON BREMER.
Oh, yes … of course… Good - by!
#MARY.
Going already… Good - by… Call again soon.
#VON BREMER.
Tell me, is everything a matter of indifference to you already?
#MARY.
What?
#VON BREMER.
I mean, don’t you get pleasure out of anything any more?
#MARY.
I want to sleep.
#VON BREMER.
It’s all the same to you whether he is young or old or whether he…
#MARY.
Why do you ask?
#VON BREMER.
… Well ’pon my soul, now I know of whom you remind me, it’s…
#MARY.
Do I look like some one?
#VON BREMER.
Unbelievable, unbelievable. Now please, don’t talk, at least not for a minute… The very same features. , the very image.
#MARY.
Well…
#VON BREMER.
’Pon my soul, it’s too bad that you … aren’t something different… You could make your fortune!
#MARY.
You talk just like Frank.
#VON BREMER.
Who is Frank?
#MARY.
The waiter in our café.
#VON BREMER.
In what way am I just like Frank?
#MARY.
He is also always telling me I might make my fortune, and wanting me to marry him.
#VON BREMER.
Why don’t you?
#MARY.
No thank you… I don’t want to marry, no, not for any price… Later on, perhaps.
#VON BREMER.
The eyes … the very same eyes… Bobby would surely call me a fool.—But I must kiss your eyes once more … so … and now God bless you, now I must go.
#MARY.
Good - by…
#VON BREMER.
Tell me … aren’t you a bit surprised?…
#MARY.
At what?
#VON BREMER.
That I don’t want anything of you.
#MARY.
There are many men who aren’t in the mood in the morning.
#VON BREMER.
Of course… Absurd, that I expect to be surprised… Well, good - by… But really, I’m disappointed. I ought to know that women like her care only about money … what am I saying … it is beautiful, that at least she doesn’t pretend; should make one glad… Do you know, I shall come to see you again soon?
#MARY.
All right.
#VON BREMER.
When are you at home?
#MARY.
I’m always at home. You only have to ask for Leocadia.
#VON BREMER.
Leocadia… All right—Well, God bless you. The wine is still in my head. But after all it is sublime… I am with a woman like her and haven’t done anything but kiss her eyes, because she reminded me of some one… Tell me, Leocadia, does it often happen that any one leaves you in this way?
#MARY.
What way?
#VON BREMER.
As I do.
#MARY.
In the morning?
#VON BREMER.
No … have you ever had any one with you,—who didn’t want anything of you?
#MARY.
No, that has never happened to me.
#VON BREMER.
Well, what do you think then? Do you think I didn’t like you?
#MARY.
Why shouldn’t you like me? You liked me well enough by night.
#VON BREMER.
I like you now, too.
#MARY.
But you liked me better last night.
#VON BREMER.
What makes you think that?
#MARY.
Why ask such foolish questions?
#VON BREMER.
Last night … well, tell me, didn’t I drop right down on the sofa?
#MARY.
Certainly … with me.
#VON BREMER.
With you?
#MARY.
Yes, don’t you remember?
#VON BREMER.
I did … both of us…
#MARY.
But you fell asleep right away.
#VON BREMER.
Right away… So … that’s what happened?…
#MARY.
Yes, sonny. But you must have been terribly drunk, that you don’t remember.
#VON BREMER.
So… And yet … there is a faint resemblance… Good - by… … What is the matter?
#MARY.
The servant is up. Give her a tip as you go out. The outside door is open, so you won’t have to give anything to the janitor.
#VON BREMER.
Well… It would have been beautiful, if I had kissed her only on the eyes. It would have been almost an adventure… But it wasn’t my destiny. Ah—here… Good - night.—
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Good morning!
#VON BREMER.
Of course … good morning … good morning.
