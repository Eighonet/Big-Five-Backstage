#FLORA.
Another cup?
#CEDRIC.
I've been
#FLORA.
Then why didn't you, my poor boy?
#CEDRIC.
Vestry be dashed! And here's another thing I've been
#FLORA.
My ear!
#CEDRIC.
Precisely, your ear! Strange!... And I can tell you
#FLORA.
What particular kind of homicide?
#CEDRIC.
Oh! a kind of a fierce crushing.
#FLORA.
I don't mind so long as I know my risks.
#CEDRIC.
We shall
#FLORA.
Yes, I think we're doing rather well so far, considering
#CEDRIC.
Considering what?
#FLORA.
Considering how nervous we both are, naturally
#CEDRIC.
Yes, and we shall keep
#CEDRIC.
How many have I had?
#FLORA.
I don't know, dear.
#CEDRIC.
I've had enough, then.
#FLORA.
Well, about our programme. Suppose we settle it a bit.
#CEDRIC.
Yes, let's.
#FLORA.
I do think it was a lovely idea to start off without any
#CEDRIC.
Well, subject to your approval, I don't mind informing
#FLORA.
Tired of this place - already?
#CEDRIC.
On the contrary! But it's too small to hold a couple that
#FLORA.
Extraordinary how even three hours of married life will
#CEDRIC.
Now look here, Fluff! This honeymoon programme is
#FLORA.
Let's talk as man to man.
#CEDRIC.
The fact is I've always had a very distinct theory
#FLORA.
I didn't expect this from you, dear.
#CEDRIC.
Simply a theory! I've had no
#FLORA.
You aren't wrong! You're quite fearfully right!
#CEDRIC.
We shall
#FLORA.
I never suspected - no, really, I never did suspect - that
#CEDRIC.
Cheek, you mean. But then, of course, I am supposed to
#FLORA.
The point is, where?
#CEDRIC.
Where would you like?
#FLORA.
Anywhere.
#CEDRIC.
What about Paris?
#FLORA.
Oh, not Paris.
#CEDRIC.
Why not?
#FLORA.
We should be simply mobbed. My dearest boy, have you ever
#CEDRIC.
I seem to have read about it somewhere, perhaps in the
#FLORA.
Well, you won't understand it, because you've got
#CEDRIC.
And here all these years I've been taking myself for rather
#FLORA.
Do you know how many times I've counted your portrait in the
#CEDRIC.
In my simple mind I'd always thought that the surest way
#FLORA.
And then there's your likeness to your mother! A hundred and
#CEDRIC.
I'm not suggesting that we should camp out in Piccadilly
#FLORA.
All London will be in Paris.
#CEDRIC.
What - next week?
#FLORA.
Every week. Excuse me asking a pointed question, dearest,
#CEDRIC.
Yes. My knowledge of the unwieldy goods department of the
#FLORA.
Well, if you'd stepped outside the stations you'd know that
#CEDRIC.
Will you believe me - I'd no notion of
#FLORA.
I tell you what - I wouldn't mind going to Paris under an
#CEDRIC.
Oh, no!
#FLORA.
Why not? It would be amusing.
#CEDRIC.
I don't see myself travelling under a false name. I suppose
#FLORA.
Well, I don't see myself in a Paris hotel as the bride of
#CEDRIC.
You must have noticed that I'm not what
#FLORA.
Will she be there?
#CEDRIC.
No, no! Only, if we should happen to go there, she wanted
#FLORA.
But surely that isn't a reason why we should go to Paris!
#CEDRIC.
I was only -
#FLORA.
Husband, I must tell you something about your mother. I've
#CEDRIC.
I thought our angel - tongues persuaded her out of it.
#FLORA.
Not at all. A threat did it. I dropped in on her one day for
#CEDRIC.
The deuce you did! What did she say?
#FLORA.
She merely said: "Of course your wish is our law, Mrs.
#CEDRIC.
The mater folded up like that?
#FLORA.
There! Listen to your own tone, dearest.
#CEDRIC.
Well, I had a bit of a stir with her when I decided to give
#FLORA.
So do I. It's because I get on so well with her that we had
#CEDRIC.
Struck me as a queer lot.
#FLORA.
Of course they're all queer. I liked him because when he
#CEDRIC.
I say, Fluff, why after hiding this secret for several
#FLORA.
Oh - sheer caprice, my dearest! It just popped into my head.
#CEDRIC.
So your notion is that
#FLORA.
Cedric!
#CEDRIC.
Common - sense, of course.
#FLORA.
Oh! Good! I was afraid you might say a well - cooked potato.
#CEDRIC.
You ought to know me better than that.
#FLORA.
But, Cedric, it's only now that we're beginning to make each
#CEDRIC.
That's true! But how did you know that common - sense is
#FLORA.
Because I've got so very little of it myself. But even a
#CEDRIC.
Well, you haven't exactly told me, but you've allowed me to
#FLORA.
Most marriages, and especially most honeymoons, are
#CEDRIC.
Any! Always
#FLORA.
Always provided?
#CEDRIC.
My dear, in this outpouring of wisdom I, too, must have my
#FLORA.
Cedric! How
#CEDRIC.
Oh, no! Oh, no! Of course she won't be upset!
#FLORA.
That's settled, then. Do you know I've had the tiniest
#CEDRIC.
My dearest, your life shall be saved regardless of cost.
#FLORA.
I do want an expensive honeymoon. Not because I'm symbol. symbol. And it ought to be done - well, adequately.
#CEDRIC.
Nineteen thousand pounds odd of mine is now on deposit
#FLORA.
Cedric! There is to be no flying during our honeymoon?
#CEDRIC.
Certainly not!
#FLORA.
And it is to last a full month, naturally. full calendar month - with no address for letters.
#FLORA.
Two or three days, you
#CEDRIC.
Yes, don't you think it's enough?
#FLORA.
Oh! quite. We shall be gone before anybody's had time to
#CEDRIC.
Fine. No one could suspect that we hadn't been born
#GASTON.
Shall I clear the table?
#FLORA.
Yes.
#FLORA.
Really!
#CEDRIC.
Why?
#GASTON.
Oh! honeymoon. Dull place. Fresh married English people
#CEDRIC.
By the way, I don't think we shall stay long.
#CEDRIC.
So you come from Switzerland?
#GASTON.
Oh, yes. I am not English Geneva. My father is
#CEDRIC.
Manufacturer.
#GASTON.
Yes, manufacturer of door - mats. My father makes door - mats
#CEDRIC.
You mustn't be too hard on yourself, my friend. And so
#GASTON.
My father says, Go to England. Study the English
#CEDRIC.
When was that? Last week?
#GASTON.
No. It is a year, nearly. But I had at once a situation,
#CEDRIC.
Rather awkward, wasn't it, not knowing English?
#GASTON.
Yes. That fatigues one - to hear a strange language all the
#CEDRIC.
I meant for the customers.
#GASTON.
They are now well habituated. Many
#CEDRIC.
Remarkable! But surely a man of your enormous ability
#GASTON.
Dull! It is for my
#CEDRIC.
You like Germany.
#GASTON.
Ah! What a country! What organisation! What science! Never
#CEDRIC.
My business?
#GASTON.
Yes. Aeroplanes.
#CEDRIC.
So you know that?
#GASTON.
I know everything.... Look at anileen!
#CEDRIC.
Anileen?
#GASTON.
Yes. Anileen - colours.
#CEDRIC.
Ah! You mean aniline dyes.
#GASTON.
Yes, I said so.
#CEDRIC.
What about them?
#GASTON.
What about them? England invented them. Germany has taken
#CEDRIC.
Oh!
#GASTON.
And soon.
#CEDRIC.
I say, if it isn't a rude question, how did you guess
#GASTON.
Ah, now - again! I read, I study. I alone in this sleepy
#CEDRIC.
Do you mean there's something about my marriage in the
#GASTON.
Yes. Do you want to read it?
#CEDRIC.
Well, I should rather like to see it, if I'm not
#GASTON.
There!
#CEDRIC.
Thanks!
#GASTON.
Thanks!... And you will see about
#CEDRIC.
What about Klopstock?
#GASTON.
He comes to England soon as he has flyed at Breslau. Ah!
#CEDRIC.
Oh!
#CEDRIC.
Oh, indeed!
#FLORA.
Has the reader of
#FLORA.
Oh, Cedric! What a blow! We're the honeymoon couple now of
#CEDRIC.
Fluff, read this
#FLORA.
"We are informed that Mr. Cedric Haslam, the
#CEDRIC.
I should doubt it. More probably some accidental leakage.
#FLORA.
Oh! I know. But I've always noticed she's somewhat unlucky
#CEDRIC.
That's nothing. That's not what I
#FLORA.
"Dissensions in the Cabinet. Extraordinary rumours."
#CEDRIC.
No, no. "The German
#FLORA.
Why should it?
#CEDRIC.
What! The Kaiser's Black Eagle flying over the highest
#FLORA.
It strikes me that it would have been much simpler and less
#CEDRIC.
My adorable child, don't talk like a member of the public.
#FLORA.
Well, I don't think
#CEDRIC.
He might. I don't think he would; not with his present
#FLORA.
Well, most probably he won't. And then you can try in July
#CEDRIC.
It isn't the money.
#FLORA.
Surely it isn't the mountain?
#CEDRIC.
We've got to come out on top
#FLORA.
You must be at the works next week?
#CEDRIC.
It's me or nobody! No use trying to disguise that fact,
#FLORA.
Perhaps in the heat of the moment you've forgotten that you
#CEDRIC.
I wish we hadn't happened to get married this morning.
#FLORA.
But the flat won't be anything like ready by next week.
#CEDRIC.
Never mind, we'll sleep at the Grand Babylon, or in
#FLORA.
I say, Cedric.
#CEDRIC.
Well?
#FLORA.
I thought we were agreed about a full calendar month.
#CEDRIC.
Do you mean you
#FLORA.
Yes, of course. Don't you?
#CEDRIC.
You aren't serious?
#FLORA.
My dearest boy, is there any reason why I
#CEDRIC.
No, of course not. But in a case like this - if there
#FLORA.
But what does it matter? Is it because the other man's
#CEDRIC.
Yes, partly.
#FLORA.
Oh! So that if this canvas - backed duck flies first over a
#CEDRIC.
But don't I tell you Snowdon is the highest mountain in
#FLORA.
No, it isn't.
#CEDRIC.
Pardon me. Three thousand five hundred and seventy feet.
#FLORA.
Well, you go and tell Lloyd George that Snowdon is the
#CEDRIC.
Wales, then. It's all the same.
#FLORA.
If you're thinking of the ten thousand
#CEDRIC.
The money
#FLORA.
You're pulling away at that cigar of yours, but I suppose
#CEDRIC.
Isn't it? No! This Snowdon
#FLORA.
Oh! Force is unnecessary, I understand
#CEDRIC.
She's tragic!
#FLORA.
Oh, no!
#CEDRIC.
Now just listen to me, Fluff. I'm really thinking at least
#FLORA.
And what about its influence on mine?
#CEDRIC.
Same thing. I suppose our interests are identical.
#FLORA.
My poor simple boy, do you really believe that?
#CEDRIC.
Well, dash it, aren't you my wife?
#FLORA.
So far as I'm concerned, it would be more correct to say
#CEDRIC.
Certainly. And you as my wife.
#FLORA.
One second, dearest. You're unique as an aviator, aren't you?
#CEDRIC.
Oh - well -
#FLORA.
Now. Man to man. Give your modesty a rest. Really, don't you
#CEDRIC.
I suppose I'm just about as
#FLORA.
Now that's very nice of you.
#CEDRIC.
Not at all.
#FLORA.
Yes, it is, because it's exactly what I wanted you to say.
#CEDRIC.
So you are unique - I'll say it as often as you like.
#FLORA.
I warn you, you're giving yourself away.
#CEDRIC.
Delighted!
#FLORA.
I wouldn't care to repeat all the lovely adjectives you've
#CEDRIC.
What of?
#FLORA.
Us!... Now look here, Cedric, don't you think it would be
#CEDRIC.
What do you call her line? Let's be clear.
#FLORA.
To charm. Merely
#CEDRIC.
By God! She can do that. But
#FLORA.
I think you do, dearest; but you're so nice, you don't like
#CEDRIC.
You're a witty girl -
#FLORA.
We're both rather witty, aren't we, at times?
#CEDRIC.
But the fact is I wasn't going to make any comparison at
#FLORA.
Now, Cedric, your good nature's getting the better of your
#CEDRIC.
But surely, Fluff, this flight can proceed, as I say,
#FLORA.
You think so? And what about my grandstand?
#CEDRIC.
I shall always be your grandstand.
#FLORA.
Shall you? I can only do my best when I've got the undivided
#CEDRIC.
Naturally, if you don't see the importance of this Snowdon
#FLORA.
But I do see it
#CEDRIC.
You're putting very fundamental questions.
#FLORA.
Is marriage a relaxation from flying, or do you fly in order
#CEDRIC.
Say no more, Snowdon is chucked. Of
#FLORA.
Insist? Insist that you neglect
#CEDRIC.
Do you know that you're scarcely logical?
#FLORA.
Not logical? In not insisting?
#CEDRIC.
I mean generally. For instance,
#FLORA.
One can't think of everything at once. You mustn't forget
#CEDRIC.
Me?
#FLORA.
Yes. When I ask you for a straight answer you protest that
#CEDRIC.
Now look here, Fluffiest -
#FLORA.
Cedric, I wish you wouldn't call me that. You've
#CEDRIC.
I beg your pardon.
#FLORA.
It's I who beg yours. For
#CEDRIC.
My dear child, everything's all right. The honeymoon shall
#FLORA.
It isn't. You're only giving way to
#CEDRIC.
Well, really -
#FLORA.
Cedric. Honestly. Yes or no. Do you think I ought to yield
#CEDRIC.
I think you oughtn't to ask
#FLORA.
No. Such questions ought to be asked earlier.
#CEDRIC.
What?
#FLORA.
Do you think I ought to yield to the aeroplane?
#CEDRIC.
My dear girl, if you ask me
#FLORA.
Common - sense doesn't seem to be such a
#CEDRIC.
Flora, what can I say?
#FLORA.
There's nothing else to be said - by
#CHARLES.
It's all right. We've
#CEDRIC.
Hello!
#CHARLES.
Hello!... Flora, what's the matter?
#FLORA.
Oh, nothing! nothing!
#CEDRIC.
Hello.
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
My dear Flora!
#CEDRIC.
Any more?
#FLORA.
Well, this is a pleasure. Unusual perhaps -
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
My dear son, my dear Flora -
#GASTON.
Please?
#CEDRIC.
What the hell's up?
#CHARLES.
Well, Rick -
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Charles, what did I tell you before you came in?
#FLORA.
Suppose we all sit down, shall we? Well, what did you tell
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Believe me, Flora, I never felt so
#CEDRIC.
Look here, dad, do you mind telling me in one word what
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Yes, your father will tell you. The circumstances
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Yes, dear. You know we
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
You
#CHARLES.
Thank my masterly and audacious driving!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
If we had failed!
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
As soon as we had
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Never mind all that. Do it as gently as you can,
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
The telephone?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
The telephone.
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
We were rung up on
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Sense of duty.
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
I quite understood "beauty." It's true the Bishop
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Sense of duty.
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
No doubt you are right. I seemed to gather that it
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Oh, no!
#FLORA.
That had what?
#CEDRIC.
A sham curate!
#FLORA.
But surely such things don't happen?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
That's what many people said when I made a
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Vividly.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I assure you it happens quite frequently that from
#FLORA.
But do you mean to say we aren't married?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Well, of course, I want to put it as gently as
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
It would be an exaggeration to say that you are
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
If my idea had been accepted of having the Bishop
#CEDRIC.
But what are we to do?
#CHARLES.
Well, you must make the best of it.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Certainly not, Charles, you are
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
For the moment a policy of masterly
#THE BISHOP OF CHELMSFORD.
Celibate. The typical Bishop who, while bland young man, with perfect manners and
#CUTHBERT.
Just a plain modern butler. I particularly do not want
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Ah! Bishop. How good of you!
#BISHOP.
My dear Mrs.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Then it really is true?
#BISHOP.
But I told you on the telephone.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I know, I know! I was only hoping against hope that
#BISHOP.
No. His late father was undoubtedly
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Well, after all, it is perhaps better so.
#BISHOP.
Better, dear lady?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I mean that you have not brought good news at the
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Excessively delicate. They would naturally have to
#BISHOP.
Quite so. I cannot tell you how relieved I was to get your
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Evidently.
#BISHOP.
I gather that you have brought them both here, poor things!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
It seemed the wisest course. I consulted my
#BISHOP.
Admirable! It's a case of -
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
As you were.
#BISHOP.
Just so! Really a terrible blow to them - must have been!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Well - Father, how
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Grimly. That is - on the grim side.
#BISHOP.
Ah!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Of course, my Lord, we are taking it for granted
#BISHOP.
My dear lady. Without fail! At any hour! any hour ... up
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Will you excuse my husband while he deals with the
#BISHOP.
I beg -
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I ought to apologise for receiving you in my study,
#BISHOP.
But for this unfortunate contretemps, what a charming
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
So you find time in your busy life, Bishop, to keep
#BISHOP.
Even novels! My dear lady, there is no greater force for
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Or for evil - alas!
#BISHOP.
Quite so! I have often thought - I have indeed said so from
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Indeed! Father, do you recall that press - cutting?
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
No.
#BISHOP.
It was reported in our Diocesan Magazine.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
And yet, my dear Bishop, I have more than once felt
#BISHOP.
I know, I know. We bow the head, we kiss the rod.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
In my new novel I am back in politics again. Have
#BISHOP.
No, not yet. But I have already ordered it from Boot's.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Boot's?
#BISHOP.
Yes, the cash chemists. I find their circulating library
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Ah, yes. Here is a copy.
#BISHOP.
Pretty cover.
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Twenty - one columns.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Really!
#BISHOP.
Twenty - one columns?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
We are treating you without ceremony, my dear
#BISHOP.
How true!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Anything special?
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
No. "Surpassed herself," seven or eight times.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Very?
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Yes.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Better tell me.
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
"The book is of
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
If I'd known about that when I saw their lady
#BISHOP.
Enthralling narrative!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Please sit down. As you are
#BISHOP.
Yes, yes. Psychology. Just so.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I never lose an opportunity of gathering material.
#BISHOP.
Touching!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Now I noticed nothing remarkable about that curate.
#BISHOP.
No. And yet, you know - curious thing - he's a
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Curates Society.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
But why should he choose to personate a curate?
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Glory.
#BISHOP.
The case is highly peculiar. He is certainly not without
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Yet he looked quite sane.
#BISHOP.
Oh, quite! Astonishing story! His brother, through the
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Ago.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
But how dangerous.
#BISHOP.
So I pointed out to him. His reply was that it was just
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
All of them.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
But why should the man be struck with remorse just
#BISHOP.
Well, his explanation is that he was so moved by the
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Duty.
#BISHOP.
Beauty.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Had he performed any other marriages?
#BISHOP.
Happily none; but he had celebrated ten funerals and four
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Conscience.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Of course you sent for the police.
#BISHOP.
I trust and believe that he is now in prison. But I did
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
But do you really suppose he has surrendered?
#BISHOP.
I am sure of it. I cannot pretend to your skill in reading
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Sight.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Of course, if one put such a story into a novel, it
#BISHOP.
And yet this distressing affair reminded me strongly of the
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Ah! You remember my early book?
#BISHOP.
My dear lady! You have no more earnest
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
How many copies, father?
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
One hundred
#BISHOP.
Wonderful memory!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Is it not? He knows more about my books than I do
#BISHOP.
Touching. I must go - reluctantly. Now what
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
But do we understand that you mean to conduct the
#BISHOP.
I do. I wish particularly to show by my presence at the
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I think we had better consult Flora herself.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Is Mrs. Lloyd in the drawing - room?
#CUTHBERT.
Yes, ma'am.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
With Mr. Cedric?
#CUTHBERT.
No, ma'am. She is alone.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Will you tell her that I should be very much
#CUTHBERT.
Yes, ma'am.... A representative of the "Piccadilly
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
"The Piccadilly"! The
#CUTHBERT.
No, ma'am. He's waiting.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Father, would you mind going out to him?
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Cuthbert is not himself. Cuthbert
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Well, without actually mentioning their review,
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
These journalists are so obtuse, but still -
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I think perhaps if you said that we cannot
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Quite.
#BISHOP.
Enthralling!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Flora, darling, this is the Bishop of
#FLORA.
My lord.
#BISHOP.
My dear young lady, I have already tried to express to Mrs.
#FLORA.
I am sure that is sufficient.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
The Bishop has come to town specially to see us,
#FLORA.
It's really very good of you.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Is it not?
#BISHOP.
At what hour? I am entirely at your disposal.
#FLORA.
Oh, any time!
#BISHOP.
Noon? If you come down by the nine - fifteen train -
#FLORA.
That will do perfectly.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Where is Cedric, dear?
#FLORA.
I have no idea. Shall I see?
#BISHOP.
The dear child has evidently been much upset.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
We all have.
#BISHOP.
Ravishing creature! Who was Mr. Lloyd?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
He seems to have been on the Stock Exchange. He was
#BISHOP.
Indeed! I never met him. Did he leave a large fortune?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Oh, no! The house - not much else, I believe.
#BISHOP.
Probably an admiration for your work was the original basis
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Oh, no! I was first introduced to Mrs. Lloyd by
#BISHOP.
But heaven decided otherwise?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Cedric decided otherwise.
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Flora tells me that it is arranged for to - morrow.
#BISHOP.
Yes. I have just been hearing from Mrs. Haslam how this
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Very catching. Ran through the family.
#BISHOP.
Ha, ha! Ravishing creature!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Has Charlie come yet?
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
No.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
If he isn't here soon I fear he'll be late for the
#BISHOP.
How trying! I'm afraid we little think when we open our
#CHARLES.
Hullo! Mater. No trace of any dinner for me in the
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Charles, the Bishop of Chelmsford.
#BISHOP.
We have met once before, I think. Now,
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
You return to Chelmsford to - night?
#BISHOP.
Essential! I have a midnight procession of drunkards. You
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Exceedingly good of you to have
#BISHOP.
Not at all. The obligation is mine for your forbearance.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I have already drawn two.
#BISHOP.
Really?
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Suffragans, my dear.
#BISHOP.
Ah! Suffragans! I thought I could not have forgotten two
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Father,
#CHARLES.
Why the Bishop?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
He came up specially to arrange for to - morrow.
#CHARLES.
To - morrow?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
The wedding.
#CHARLES.
Oh yes, of course, I was forgetting.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Really, Charlie, you get more and more
#CHARLES.
With all that luggage again! It would have been simpler
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Well, you are always enthusiastic about Flora's
#CHARLES.
I should say that what the Bishop saw was a chance of
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
That also is possible.
#CHARLES.
"Need I say more?" What a cuckoo!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Charles!
#CEDRIC.
Has that dashed Bishop actually departed? I began to think
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Cedric! I am ready to make great allowances, but I
#CEDRIC.
Sorry, mother. Hello! You back?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Flora's told you it's all arranged for noon
#CEDRIC.
No. Haven't seen her.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Well, it is. And now, my boys, you can't stay any
#CHARLES.
By the way, Rick. About that Klopstock business. Of course
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Oh, yes. I quite intended to mention that, Cedric;
#CHARLES.
I met one of our johnnies at Liverpool Street, and he was
#CEDRIC.
Oh!
#CHARLES.
He told me they'd received a later wire at the office,
#CEDRIC.
Has he, indeed?
#CHARLES.
And he'll be over here in a week or ten days, it seems.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
It is annoying for you, dear, and for Flora, too!
#CEDRIC.
I shan't do any such thing.
#CHARLES.
You surely won't let him -
#CEDRIC.
I shan't do anything for a full month.
#CHARLES.
Do you mean to say you'll let Klopstock get in first.
#CEDRIC.
If Klopstock chooses to try during my honeymoon, I can't
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Cedric!
#CHARLES.
You're the only aviator in England that can get in front
#CEDRIC.
I can't help that.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
But, Cedric - surely your duty -
#CEDRIC.
Oh! d -
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Flora.
#FLORA.
So you are back, Charlie. What
#CHARLES.
Oh! That's all right I see you had at
#FLORA.
No, we really settled nothing. Cedric alone settles that, of
#CEDRIC.
I tell you I shall
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
But you don't really think there is any special
#FLORA.
Of course not. If I wasn't convinced that Cedric in his
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Then, seeing how serious it is for the country,
#FLORA.
My dear, you must ask Cedric. I don't interfere with Mr. Frampington, to see the Bishop, ma'am. I told him
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Mr. Frampington? Where is your master?
#CUTHBERT.
I believe he's in the kitchen at the moment, ma'am.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Frampington?
#CHARLES.
Wasn't that the name of our young hopeful this morning?
#FLORA.
The imitation curate? Of course it
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
But surely -
#CUTHBERT.
He bears no resemblance to a curate, ma'am.
#FLORA.
Then it is he! Oh! if it is, do let's see him! In private
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Flora - really I don't know what's come over you all!
#FLORA.
It seems to me that the curate has come over us all.
#FRAMPINGTON.
We meet again.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
The Bishop left a few minutes ago.
#FLORA.
Won't you sit down?
#FRAMPINGTON.
I suppose the Bishop
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
So far as everything is capable of explanation, yes.
#FRAMPINGTON.
I'm glad of that. It makes the situation so much
#FLORA.
Did he?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
No. He only spoke for himself.
#FRAMPINGTON.
That was not nice of him.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
He told us you were a gentleman -
#FRAMPINGTON.
Generous!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
And that you had promised to go to the
#FRAMPINGTON.
Quite correct. And as soon as I'd got something to eat
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Refused to take you in!
#FRAMPINGTON.
Wouldn't even take my name.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
But did you tell them clearly what you'd done - your
#FRAMPINGTON.
I was most explicit.
#FLORA.
I suppose it is a crime.
#FRAMPINGTON.
Oh, yes! It's a crime all right. As far as the Bishop
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I may be dull, Mr. -
#FRAMPINGTON.
Frampington.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
But I don't yet understand why you've come here.
#FLORA.
Mr. Frampington was going to explain how it was the
#FRAMPINGTON.
The Inspector wouldn't believe my story. He thought I
#FLORA.
And don't you think you are?
#FRAMPINGTON.
Depends how one looks at it. I feel
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I'm afraid you didn't insist.
#FRAMPINGTON.
Yes. I did. I insisted so much that at last the
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
And wasn't that enough for you, my man?
#FRAMPINGTON.
It was too
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
And did you?
#FRAMPINGTON.
Certainly not. Beyond half - a - pint of Bordeaux at the
#FLORA.
The Ritz?
#FRAMPINGTON.
Why not, madam?
#FLORA.
As you say, why not!
#FRAMPINGTON.
It was handy for Vine Street, and this being my last
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
The only thing I understand is that you seem to
#FRAMPINGTON.
I beg your pardon. I came here
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Charlie, you'd better go on your way to the office.
#CHARLES.
That's all very well, but -
#FRAMPINGTON.
It would be very good of you. But I really think
#FLORA.
Why don't you go to Liverpool Street?
#FRAMPINGTON.
But Liverpool Street is not a police - station.
#FLORA.
No. But it's a railway station. Chelmsford isn't the
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Really, Flora! Christianity can
#FRAMPINGTON.
I should be caught. And, honestly, I
#FLORA.
But this is serious. You mayn't get a long sentence, but
#FRAMPINGTON.
Oh, no, I shan't. In two years time I come into twenty
#FLORA.
I see.
#FRAMPINGTON.
May I count on your help?
#FLORA.
Neither did I. Well, good luck!
#CHARLES.
Just wait in the hall a moment, will
#FRAMPINGTON.
Certainly.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Well, it's not often that I'm
#CHARLES.
Look here, mater. You send me off with this lunatic, but
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Why did you shake
#FLORA.
I felt almost effusive.
#CHARLES.
But don't you think he's off his nut?
#FLORA.
Whatever he is, he's saved me from something that's rather
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
He's what?
#FLORA.
I may as well tell you now - Cedric and I aren't going to get
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Not going to - But you've just
#FLORA.
I know. But that was simply my cowardice. The truth is
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
We! But - but what's wrong with to - morrow, Flora?
#FLORA.
Nothing. It's no worse than any other day. Only we aren't
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
But you are married - practically. I mean -
#FLORA.
Not even theoretically.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Flora, I'm
#FLORA.
I'm really very sorry. Very sorry. If I'm witty, I honestly
#CHARLES.
Not really!
#FLORA.
Yes.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
And this is all you can find
#FLORA.
Oh! please do.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
When did you and Cedric settle this?
#FLORA.
We haven't settled it. Have we had a moment alone together
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Do you mean to say that Cedric doesn't know what
#FLORA.
Not unless he's listening behind the door. I inform you
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Of course father and I both noticed that you were
#FLORA.
To the Frampington accident? Oh, no! A Frampington accident
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Terrible fear?
#FLORA.
Terrible fear lest neither of us would have the audacity to
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Audacity! Your audacity astounds me.
#FLORA.
Yes, it rather startles even me. Now, will you mind telling
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I!
#FLORA.
Are you also struck dumb?
#CHARLES.
I suppose the kick - up was about - Snowdon versus honeymoon.
#FLORA.
Charlie, how penetrating you are, really! And you put it in
#CHARLES.
Well, when we burst into that hotel this morning I could
#FLORA.
Oh! Didn't it? And what's your opinion? Do
#CHARLES.
Well, it's fiendishly important.
#FLORA.
I know. But don't you think a honeymoon's somehow more
#CHARLES.
Some honeymoons might be.
#FLORA.
What should you have done in Cedric's place?
#CHARLES.
But look here, Flo, he has given way, you know.
#FLORA.
Yes, but against his judgment.
#CHARLES.
Well, he couldn't help that.
#FLORA.
You're wrong, Charlie.
#CHARLES.
Am I?
#FLORA.
Couldn't help it? If Cedric can't control his judgment
#CHARLES.
Perhaps so.
#FLORA.
Charlie, there are some things that you understand better
#CHARLES.
That's what I always say, but no one believes me.
#FLORA.
It's true. Do you know I'm simply shaking?
#CHARLES.
Fright? I can believe you are, but
#FLORA.
You'd better go. Don't forget the imitation curate's waiting
#CHARLES.
Frizzle the imitation curate.
#FLORA.
You'll be in the way here - don't you see?
#CHARLES.
But you're sending me off just at the interesting part.
#FLORA.
Yes, but I hope we shall all still be alive to - morrow.
#CHARLES.
But - is it really serious? Then we shan't
#FLORA.
Yes?
#CHARLES.
Would you mind telling father or mother to see that my
#FLORA.
I will.
#FLORA.
I see your mother's told you. Well, what can I say to you?
#CEDRIC.
You might congratulate me on the way I'm
#FLORA.
But why do you come in like this and look at me like this?
#CEDRIC.
Idle curiosity! Having received the news from the mater, I
#FLORA.
Cedric, I did it the best way I could. I thought I would
#CEDRIC.
I quite see the argument.
#FLORA.
You've told
#CEDRIC.
She'd half guessed it. I made it seem as plausible as I
#FLORA.
I suppose I ought to depart hence. Where is your mother now?
#CEDRIC.
She's briefly stating the facts to the head of the family.
#FLORA.
Cedric, don't you feel as if I'd lifted an enormous weight
#CEDRIC.
No; but I feel as if we'd been sitting all day in a stuffy
#FLORA.
My dear Cedric, if you were seriously injured you couldn't
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Has Charlie gone?
#FLORA.
Yes. By the way, he wants his supper set in the garden - he
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Thank you.
#FLORA.
Something solid, he said.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Cedric, I wish your father to
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
So far as I've gathered, there seems to be some
#FLORA.
That's it.
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Nothing could be simpler.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Flora, how can you sit there and trifle with our
#FLORA.
I hope we aren't going to converse as if
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Personally, I am not aware of being unreal. But
#FLORA.
As I told Cedric in the first act -
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
In the first act!
#FLORA.
My dear. I'm only trying to fall in with your wish to turn
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Cedric, why don't you speak?
#CEDRIC.
Nothing to say.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Your silence is excessive.
#FLORA.
We solemnly arrange our honeymoon.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Something to do with England, with Cedric's career,
#FLORA.
Supposing Cedric one day
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
I probably shouldn't open my mouth. funeral is different -
#FLORA.
It is. But I can't help thinking that if circumstances
#CEDRIC.
I hope you won't lose sight of the fact that I gave way to
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
That's the trouble.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Father!
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Yes, that's the trouble, because his giving way to
#FLORA.
I won't argue any further.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
But why not? Surely that is unreasonable.
#FLORA.
Because in an argument I always begin rather well, but in
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
One day, perhaps when it's too late, you'll realise
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Nineteen thousand four hundred pounds.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I don't boast, but you see what comes of trying to
#FLORA.
Some women can do nothing but earn money.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
What should you spend it
#FLORA.
I should erect a statue to Mr. Frampington. It would be a
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Upon my word, Flora , one would say,
#FLORA.
Well, my dear, in one way I could cry my eyes out, but
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Saved you from!
#CEDRIC.
Look here, mater -
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Cedric!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I speak kindly, but I speak plainly, and I'm not
#CEDRIC.
Mater, I'm off!
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
You'll kindly stay where
#FLORA.
Please don't expose me. Comfort yourself with
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Where are you going, father?
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
I thought I'd just make sure about Charlie's supper,
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
You are
#FLORA.
That, at any rate, isn't my fault. By - the - way, how
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
When you begin to
#FLORA.
I hope I never shall figure prominently in the life of my
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
The newspapers -
#CEDRIC.
Excuse me, mater, but isn't this right off the point?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
And I was looking forward to a
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Well, where have you got to?
#FLORA.
I think we're gradually working back again to the importance
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
That's better! That's better!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Flora, you'll pardon me offering my opinion,
#FLORA.
Oh! It is.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Your attitude might be more defensible if you
#CEDRIC.
Oh, look here, mater -
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Cedric, may I venture to converse in my own study?
#FLORA.
Don't you understand that this is not your
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I mean, if you brought more
#FLORA.
Money? I'm not rich, but you see I'm rich enough to despise
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Flora! Please don't mention such a great novelist?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
No, no. I was thinking more of
#FLORA.
So they say.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
But beauty is a mere gift - from heaven.
#FLORA.
My dear, what's the difference between a talent, and a gift
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Pardon me. "Like" is too strong a word. My wife
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
But seriously -
#FLORA.
Seriously? My dear, did
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Say anything! About what?
#FLORA.
About me.
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
He remarked that you were a ravishing creature.
#FLORA.
Jokingly?
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
No. He was quite serious.
#FLORA.
That's just it. If it was only frivolous, empty - headed boys
#CEDRIC.
I beg your pardon -
#FLORA.
Yes, you do! Yes, you do! When there came
#CEDRIC.
Aeroplane! Aeroplane! You keep on saying aeroplane, but -
#FLORA.
Listen. I know you've given way. I know you've
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Not too honestly.
#CEDRIC.
Yes, I do think part of the honeymoon ought
#FLORA.
Then you are relieved? You're grateful.
#CEDRIC.
I ought to be. Of course you're
#FLORA.
What do you mean?
#CEDRIC.
Some things a man can't do.
#FLORA.
Do you sit there and say that if I hadn't cut the knot,
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Flora, you'll regret you've thrown Cedric over.
#FLORA.
Shall I! Good - night, Mrs.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
But where are you going?
#FLORA.
I don't know. How can I stay here? My official connection
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I'm sure
#CEDRIC.
I'm off into the garden.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Nincompoop!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Dear, before I go on with that article, I should
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Where's the boy?
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
In the garden. Of all places!
#CEDRIC.
Hello?
#CHARLES.
So you're here, are you?
#CEDRIC.
I am.
#CHARLES.
Well, what's happened?
#CEDRIC.
What do you mean?
#CHARLES.
What do I mean? You and Flora, of course!
#CEDRIC.
Nothing more.
#CHARLES.
Then is it off?
#CEDRIC.
Right bang off!
#CHARLES.
You look as if you'd been up all night.
#CEDRIC.
What time is it? My watch has stopped.
#CHARLES.
About four. I'm a trifle late.
#CEDRIC.
Was it for you?
#CHARLES.
I must say this really is a bit too thick!
#CEDRIC.
How should I know it was for you?
#CHARLES.
Of course you knew!
#CEDRIC.
It was all laid here. The fact is, I went off to sleep. I
#CHARLES.
Never thought be damned!
#CEDRIC.
Awfully sorry. Here's some bread. What's this news?
#CHARLES.
What's the good of being sorry? It was
#CEDRIC.
What's this news?
#CHARLES.
If I hadn't had some sultana at the office I
#CEDRIC.
See here, boy. You just go to bed out
#CHARLES.
I hear. But why?
#CEDRIC.
Never mind why.
#CHARLES.
But the newsagent will deliver the mater's copy here at
#CEDRIC.
I'm going to do something long before eight o'clock.
#CHARLES.
What are you going to do?
#CEDRIC.
I'm going to see Flora, and tell her I've altered my view
#CHARLES.
I see. But haven't you altered your view because of that?
#CEDRIC.
What's that got to do with you? The point is
#CHARLES.
And do you reckon all this'll be on the straight?
#CEDRIC.
I don't care whether it's on the straight or not.
#CHARLES.
Where is she?
#CEDRIC.
She's in the spare room next to the mater's.
#CHARLES.
And how do you intend to get at her?
#CEDRIC.
I'm going to call her, and ask her to dress and come down
#CHARLES.
Yes. I say - it's not right, you know!
#CEDRIC.
Shut up. Did Fisher clean the car last night?
#CHARLES.
How do I know? He ought to have done. I say -
#CEDRIC.
Well?
#CHARLES.
I suppose you don't want any advice from me?
#CEDRIC.
No. What?
#CHARLES.
I was only going to say that you'd better change those
#CEDRIC.
Well, of course! I expect I can dress quicker than she can,
#FLORA.
Good morning!
#CEDRIC.
Good morning!
#CHARLES.
Hello, Flo! What's the meaning of this?
#FLORA.
Couldn't sleep.
#CEDRIC.
I shall be down in two jiffs.
#FLORA.
I guessed you'd be having your supper just about now. That's
#CHARLES.
That's fine. Only I'm not having my supper.
#FLORA.
My poor boy! But here's a couple of bananas. Have you ever
#CHARLES.
No. Are they any good?
#FLORA.
Are they any good! Never had a banana sandwich! Shall I make
#CHARLES.
I wish you would.
#FLORA.
Well, how long shall I have to wait?
#CHARLES.
Wait?
#FLORA.
To hear what happened to Mr. Frampington, of course. Did
#CHARLES.
Oh, yes.
#FLORA.
Do you know - I'm rather sorry. Somehow I should have liked
#CHARLES.
What occurred last night?
#FLORA.
Oh! terrific scenes! terrific scenes! and I really can't
#CHARLES.
All serene! Thanks! I say - I rather
#FLORA.
Why?
#CHARLES.
I don't know. It's due to him - somehow - I feel like you
#FLORA.
Really?
#CHARLES.
I'm nobody. I'm pitched about everywhere.
#FLORA.
You don't mean - my trunks?
#CHARLES.
Not a bit. Of course I don't. I mean the way they treat
#FLORA.
That all?
#CHARLES.
I go out and work all night. Then I come home and discover
#FLORA.
Yes.
#CHARLES.
Of course, I'm sorry about what's happened - as far as
#FLORA.
That's quite true.
#CHARLES.
Yes.
#FLORA.
What else have you got on your mind?
#CHARLES.
Well, I don't know if I ought to tell you.
#FLORA.
Certainly you ought to tell me.
#CHARLES.
You think so?
#FLORA.
Unless, of course, you agree with all the things your dear
#CHARLES.
It's about Klopstock.
#FLORA.
About Klopstock?
#CHARLES.
He's had an accident.
#FLORA.
What?
#CHARLES.
Broken his leg.
#FLORA.
How? Came down too quickly?
#CHARLES.
No. Driving to his hotel last night his motor ran into a
#FLORA.
Motor cars are really too dangerous. I wonder any aviator
#CHARLES.
Now it's very funny. I often want to say
#FLORA.
Charlie, you're a dear. I suppose he'll be laid up for five
#CHARLES.
Who? Klopstock? You bet. You see what it means?
#FLORA.
Quite. What I don't see is why you should have hesitated to
#CHARLES.
Yes. I brought an early copy of the paper with it in.
#FLORA.
Where is it?
#CHARLES.
Cedric's cleared off with it.
#FLORA.
Well, if Cedric knows, why shouldn't I?
#CHARLES.
Ask me another! Look here, I'm giving the show away, but
#FLORA.
Well?
#CHARLES.
Cedric told me I wasn't to say a word. He said I wasn't to
#FLORA.
And did you promise?
#CHARLES.
I should think I didn't. Not me!
#FLORA.
Had Cedric been out here all night?
#CHARLES.
Yes. Told me he slept like a top in that chair, then woke
#FLORA.
But why should he want you not to say anything about
#CHARLES.
You've forgotten your hair, my boy.
#CEDRIC.
Hook it!
#FLORA.
I'm just going. I meant to leave before any of
#CEDRIC.
What's he been entertaining you with?
#FLORA.
Oh! his grievances. They're rather real, you know.
#CEDRIC.
Do you know, when I went in just now I was meaning to knock
#FLORA.
Why this desire to begin the day so early?
#CEDRIC.
Look here, Flora, let's go, now! Fisher won't be up, but
#FLORA.
Where?
#CEDRIC.
Chelmsford. I can wake the Bishop and tell him we want
#FLORA.
Any other details?
#CEDRIC.
Come on!
#FLORA.
Then you've decided that we are to get
#CEDRIC.
Well, a marriage can't be broken off like - like this! It's
#FLORA.
And I'm to be carried by storm?.... Great saving of argument!
#CEDRIC.
Now listen -
#FLORA.
Well?
#CEDRIC.
Will you talk man to man? Straight?
#FLORA.
As one honest Injun to another!
#CEDRIC.
If you make one more
#FLORA.
Now if I agree to listen quietly and talk
#CEDRIC.
All right, all right!
#FLORA.
Because I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. The thing that's - that's
#CEDRIC.
Well, I have changed my opinion. So let's go.
#FLORA.
You've changed your opinion? How have you changed your
#CEDRIC.
I've sat there all this blessed night thinking it over.
#FLORA.
Really?
#CEDRIC.
Yes. Do you suppose I could sleep any more than you could?
#FLORA.
But how has your judgment altered? Why?
#CEDRIC.
I don't know. How do people's judgments alter? I
#FLORA.
Cedric, what happened in your
#CEDRIC.
Nothing whatever. I cleared out instantly afterwards.
#FLORA.
Nothing.
#CEDRIC.
But why do you say "Nothing" like that?
#FLORA.
Cedric, I was just wondering how this conversation of yours
#CEDRIC.
How - "something" - in business?
#FLORA.
Something - I don't know - something that would leave you
#CEDRIC.
But how could anything have happened?
#FLORA.
I don't know, but with that telephone so handy in your
#CEDRIC.
What notions
#FLORA.
Honour bright?
#CEDRIC.
Certainly!... Then you really imagined I was
#FLORA.
It isn't you I couldn't trust. It's the human nature in
#CEDRIC.
Fluff!
#FLORA.
I'm only being man to man.
#CEDRIC.
Look here, Flora, it's barely twelve hours since that
#FLORA.
Yes.
#CEDRIC.
Very much? I say very much?
#FLORA.
Yes.
#CEDRIC.
Well, if you know as much about human nature as you make
#FLORA.
But your mother -
#FLORA.
Cedric!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Really -
#FLORA.
So we've all got up with the sparrows!
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
No. These two particular sparrows have just come out
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Work is work, young lady, and insists on being
#FLORA.
Ah! The birthrate article - has the poor thing been declining
#CEDRIC.
Mother, you ought to
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Is it surprising? I was just saying to your father
#FLORA.
But do you want some tea?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I never want what I can't have. I shall doubtless
#CEDRIC.
Couldn't the dad make you some?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Impossible, child! At four o'clock in the morning!
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
The cook always locks up the kitchen to keep
#CEDRIC.
Seems odd that in a house like this you can't have a cup of
#FLORA.
May I give you some tea?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
It's very good of you to offer me tea in my own
#FLORA.
Not at all. I
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
I'm afraid you didn't sleep very well,
#FLORA.
Why?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
You're down so exceedingly early.
#FLORA.
The fact is, I could not get off to sleep.
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
I put a complete set of my
#FLORA.
Another cup?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
No, thanks. Excellent.
#FLORA.
I'm so glad I was here. You know, it's quite easy to have
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
My other work!... No doubt when
#FLORA.
Settled down with Cedric!
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
My dear, I had intended to make no comment on the
#CEDRIC.
Mater, why don't you go to bed?
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
You may remember that last night I hinted that
#FLORA.
Anything to say?
#CEDRIC.
You're quite wrong, mother. The fact is I've now come to
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
About what?
#CEDRIC.
In arguing that nothing ought to stand in the way of the
#FLORA.
But he forgot to tell me that there is nothing now to
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
What do you mean?
#FLORA.
Klopstock has broken his leg and can't move for at least six
#CEDRIC.
Yes ... of course, Charlie gave
#FLORA.
Charlie merely told me, as he told you.
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Everything is all right, then.
#FLORA.
Do you think so? Cedric and I were supposed to be talking
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Honest Injuns?
#FLORA.
Well, as man to man, then. Anyway, straight! And yet he
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Father! We had better go.
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Hannah!
#FLORA.
We seem to be left alone together.
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Yes, but I must go.
#FLORA.
However do you manage to be always so calm and cheerful?
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
You have.... You see I've my own private life to
#FLORA.
Have you? Where? I never -
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Here!
#FLORA.
I see.
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
And my collection - that always keeps me amused.
#FLORA.
Your collection?
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
My collection of private opinions
#MRS. REACH HASLAM.
Father!
#MR. REACH HASLAM.
Yes, my dear.
#FLORA.
Cedric, when you've done swearing up
#CEDRIC.
Apologise?
#FLORA.
My human nature ran away with me. My human nature couldn't
#CEDRIC.
Go where?
#FLORA.
To Chelmsford, of course. Isn't there a
#CEDRIC.
I'm dashed if I know where
#FLORA.
I'm dashed if you are quite wide awake, my poor boy. Can't
#CEDRIC.
What?
#FLORA.
After all, your dear mother's prophecy was quite correct. I
#CEDRIC.
What? man - and his chin.
#CEDRIC.
Let's go
#FLORA.
Oh yes, she will. We all shall. But
#CEDRIC.
