#RACHEL.
Ma dear! dear, old Ma dear!
#MRS. LOVING.
Look out for the needle, Rachel! The waist! Oh, Rachel!
#RACHEL.
You old, old fraud! You know you adore being hugged. I’ve a good mind....
#MRS. LOVING.
Now, Rachel, please! Besides, I know your tricks. You think you can make me forget you are late. What time is it?
#RACHEL.
Jiminy Xmas! Why, it’s five o’clock!
#MRS. LOVING.
Well!
#RACHEL.
Now, Ma dear, you’re going to be horrid and cross.
#MRS. LOVING.
Really, Rachel, that expression is not particularly affecting, when your hat is over your ear, and you look, with your hair over your eyes, exactly like some one’s pet poodle. I wonder if you are ever going to grow up and be ladylike.
#RACHEL.
Oh! Ma dear, I hope not, not for the longest time, two long, long years at least. I just want to be silly and irresponsible, and have you to love and torment, and, of course, Tom, too.
#MRS. LOVING.
You’ll not make me forget, young lady. Why are you late, Rachel?
#RACHEL.
Well, Ma dear, I’m your pet poodle, and my hat is over my ear, and I’m late, for the loveliest reason.
#MRS. LOVING.
Don’t be silly, Rachel.
#RACHEL.
That may sound silly, but it isn’t. And please don’t “Rachel” me so much. It was honestly one whole hour ago when I opened the front door down stairs. I know it was, because I heard the postman telling some one it was four o’clock. Well, I climbed the first flight, and was just starting up the second, when a little shrill voice said, “’Lo!” I raised my eyes, and there, half - way up the stairs, sitting in the middle of a step, was just the clearest, cutest, darlingest little brown baby boy you ever saw. “’Lo! yourself,” I said. “What are you doing, and who are you anyway?” “I’m Jimmy; and I’m widing to New York on the choo - choo tars.” As he looked entirely too young to be going such a distance by himself, I asked him if I might go too. For a minute or two he considered the question and me very seriously, and then he said, “’Es,” and made room for me on the step beside him. We’ve been everywhere. New York, Chicago, Boston, London, Paris and Oshkosh. I wish you could have heard him say that last place. I suggested going there just to hear him. Now, Ma dear, is it any wonder I am late? See all the places we have been in just one “teeny, weeny” hour? We would have been traveling yet, but his horrid, little mother came out and called him in. They’re in the flat below, the new people. But before he went, Ma dear, he said the “cunningest” thing. He said, “Will you tum out an’ p’ay wif me aden in two minutes?” I nearly hugged him to death, and it’s a wonder my hat is on my head at all. Hats are such unimportant nuisances anyway!
#MRS. LOVING.
Unimportant nuisances! What ridiculous language you do use, Rachel! Well, I’m no prophet, but I see very distinctly what is going to happen. This little brown baby will be living here night and day. You’re not happy unless some child is trailing along in your rear.
#RACHEL.
Now, Ma dear, whose a hypocrite? What? I suppose you don’t like children! I can tell you one thing, though, it won’t be my fault if he isn’t here night and day. Oh, I wish he were all mine, every bit of him! Ma dear, do you suppose that “she woman” he calls mother would let him come up here until it is time for him to go to bed? I’m going down there this minute.
#MRS. LOVING.
Rachel, for Heaven’s sake! No! I am entirely too busy and tired today without being bothered with a child romping around in here.
#RACHEL.
Very well, then. Ma dear!
#MRS. LOVING.
Well.
#RACHEL.
Is there anything wrong today?
#MRS. LOVING.
I’m just tired, chickabiddy, that’s all.
#RACHEL.
Yes! - Yes! - No, I’m not Mrs. Loving. She’s here, yes! - What? Oh! come right up! Ma dear, it’s some man, who is coming for Mrs. Strong’s waist.
#MRS. LOVING.
It is probably her son. She said she would send for it this afternoon.
#STRONG.
Mrs. Loving? My name is Strong. My mother asked me to come by and get her waist this afternoon. She hoped it would be finished.
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes, Mr. Strong, it is all ready. If you’ll sit down a minute, I’ll wrap it up for you.
#RACHEL.
Do sit down, Mr. Strong.
#RACHEL.
It’s a very pleasant day, isn’t it, Mr. Strong?
#STRONG.
Yes, very.
#RACHEL.
It’s quite a climb up to our flat, don’t you think?
#STRONG.
Why, no! It didn’t strike me so. I’m not old enough yet to mind stairs.
#RACHEL.
Oh! I didn’t mean that you are old! Anyone can see you are quite young, that is, of course, not too young, but, - There! I don’t blame you for laughing. I’m always clumsy just like that.
#MRS. LOVING.
Rachel, bring me a needle and the sixty cotton, please.
#RACHEL.
All right, Ma dear! You see! I can’t even get a spool of cotton without spilling things all over the floor. Excuse me!
#RACHEL.
We were talking about the climb to our flat, weren’t we? You see, when you’re poor, you have to live in a top flat. There is always a compensation, though; we have bully - I mean nice air, better light, a lovely view, and nobody “thud - thudding” up and down over our heads night and day. The people below have our “thud - thudding,” and it must be something awful, especially when Tom and I play “Ivanhoe” and have a tournament up here. We’re entirely too old, but we still play. Ma dear rather dreads the climb up three flights, so Tom and I do all the errands. We don’t mind climbing the stairs, particularly when we go up two or three at a time, - that is - Tom still does. I can’t, Ma dear stopped me. I’ve got to grow up it seems.
#STRONG.
It is rather hard being a girl, isn’t it?
#RACHEL.
Oh, no! It’s not hard at all. That’s the trouble; they won’t let me be a girl. I’d love to be.
#MRS. LOVING.
My Chatterbox, I see, is entertaining you, Mr. Strong. I’m sorry to have kept you waiting, but I forgot, I found, to sew the ruching in the neck. I hope everything is satisfactory. If it isn’t, I’ll be glad to make any changes.
#STRONG.
Thank you, Mrs. Loving, I’m sure everything is all right.
#RACHEL.
He was rather nice, wasn’t he, Ma dear? - for a man? I guess my reason’s a vain one, - he let me do all the talking. Strong? Strong? Ma dear, is his mother the little woman with the sad, black eyes?
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes. I was rather curious, I confess, to see this son of hers. The whole time I’m fitting her she talks of nothing else. She worships him. It’s rather a sad case, I believe. She is a widow. Her husband was a doctor and left her a little money. She came up from the South to educate this boy. Both of them worked hard and the boy got through college. Three months he hunted for work that a college man might expect to get. You see he had the tremendous handicap of being colored. As the two of them had to live, one day, without her knowing it, he hired himself out as a waiter. He has been one now for two years. He is evidently goodness itself to his mother.
#RACHEL.
Just because he is colored! We sing a song at school, I believe, about “The land of the free and the home of the brave.” What an amusing nation it is.
#MRS. LOVING.
Come, Rachel, you haven’t time for “amusing nations.” Remember, you haven’t practised any this afternoon. And put your books away; don’t leave them on the table. You didn’t practise any this morning either, did you?
#RACHEL.
No, Ma dear, - didn’t wake up in time. Ma dear, just listen to this lullaby. It’s the sweetest thing. I was so “daffy” over it, one of the girls at school lent it to me. - Listen, Ma dear, right here. Isn’t it lovely? Ma dear, it’s so beautiful - it - it hurts.
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes, dear, it is pretty.
#RACHEL.
Ma dear!
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes, Rachel.
#RACHEL.
What’s the matter?
#MRS. LOVING.
Matter! What do you mean?
#RACHEL.
I don’t know. I just feel something is not quite right with you.
#MRS. LOVING.
I’m only tired - that’s all.
#RACHEL.
Perhaps. But - Ma dear, wouldn’t it be nice if we could keep all the babies in the world - always little babies? Then they’d be always little, and cunning, and lovable; and they could never grow up, then, and - and - be bad. I’m so sorry for mothers, whose little babies - grow up - and - and - are bad.
#MRS. LOVING.
Come, Rachel, what experience have you had with mothers whose babies have grown up to be bad? You - you talk like an old, old woman.
#RACHEL.
I know I’m not old; but, just the same I know that is true. And I’m so sorry for the mothers.
#MRS. LOVING.
Well, Miss Methuselah, how do you happen to know all this? Mothers whose babies grow up to be bad don’t, as a rule, parade their faults before the world.
#RACHEL.
That’s just it - that’s how you know. They don’t talk at all.
#MRS. LOVING.
Oh! - I think the loveliest thing of all the lovely things in this world is just being a mother!
#MRS. LOVING.
Well, of all the startling children, Rachel! I am getting to feel, when you’re around as though I’m shut up with dynamite. What next? Why so serious, chickabiddy?
#RACHEL.
It is not kind to laugh at sacred things. When you laughed, it was as though you laughed - at God!
#MRS. LOVING.
Rachel!
#RACHEL.
It’s true. It was the best in me that said that - it was God! And, Ma dear, if I believed that I should grow up and not be a mother, I’d pray to die now. I’ve thought about it a lot, Ma dear, and once I dreamed, and a voice said to me - oh! it was so real - “Rachel, you are to be a mother to little children.” Wasn’t that beautiful? Ever since I have known how Mary felt at the “Annunciation.” God spoke to me through some one, and I believe. And it has explained so much to me. I know now why I just can’t resist any child. I have to love it - it calls me - it - draws me. I want to take care of it, wash it, dress it, live for it. I want the feel of its little warm body against me, its breath on my neck, its hands against my face. Ma dear, here’s something I don’t understand. I love the little black and brown babies best of all. There is something about them that - that - clutches at my heart. Why - why - should they be - oh! - pathetic? I don’t understand. It’s dim. More than the other babies, I feel that I must protect them. They’re in danger, but from what? I don’t know. I’ve tried so hard to understand, but I can’t. Ma dear, I think their white teeth and the clear whites of their big black eyes and their dimples everywhere - are - are And, Ma dear, because I love them best, I pray God every night to give me, when I grow up, little black and brown babies - to protect and guard. Now, Ma dear, don’t you see why you must never laugh at me again? Dear, dear, Ma dear?
#MRS. LOVING.
And I suppose my experience is every mother’s. Sooner or later - of a sudden she finds her own child a stranger to her. Poor little girl! Poor little chickabiddy!
#RACHEL.
Why do you say, “Poor little girl,” like that? I don’t understand. Why, Ma dear, I never saw tears in your eyes before. Is it - is it - because you know the things I do not understand? Oh! it is that.
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes, Rachel, and I cannot save you.
#RACHEL.
Ma dear, you frighten me. Save me from what?
#MRS. LOVING.
Just life, my little chickabiddy!
#RACHEL.
Is life so terrible? I had found it mostly beautiful. How can life be terrible, when the world is full of little children?
#MRS. LOVING.
Oh, Rachel! Rachel!
#RACHEL.
Ma dear, what have I said?
#MRS. LOVING.
Why, the truth, of course, Rachel. Life is not terrible when there are little children - and you - and Tom - and a roof over our heads - and work - and food - and clothes - and sleep at night. Rachel, I am not myself today. I’m tired. Forget what I’ve said. Come, chickabiddy, wipe your eyes and smile. That’s only an imitation smile, but it’s better than none. Jump up now, and light the lamp for me, will you? Tom’s late, isn’t he? I shall want you to go, too, for the rolls and pie for supper.
#RACHEL.
Where is the money, Ma dear? I’m ready.
#MRS. LOVING.
Before you go, Rachel, just give a look at the meat and see if it is cooking all right, will you, dearie?
#RACHEL.
It’s all right, Ma dear.
#MRS. LOVING.
A dozen brown rolls, Rachel. Be sure they’re brown! And, I guess, - an apple pie. As you and Tom never seem to get enough apple pie, get the largest she has. And here is a quarter. Get some candy - any kind you like, Chickabiddy. Let’s have a party tonight, I feel extravagant. Why, Rachel! why are you crying?
#RACHEL.
Nothing, dear Ma dear. I’ll be all right when I get in the air. Goodbye!
#TOM.
’Lo, Ma! Where’s Sis, - out? The door’s off the latch.
#MRS. LOVING.
Rachel just went after the rolls and pie. She’ll be back in a few minutes. You’re late, Tommy.
#TOM.
No, Ma - you forget - it’s pay day. Here, Ma!
#MRS. LOVING.
But, Tommy, this is every bit of it. You’ll need some.
#TOM.
Not yet! I only wish - Say, Ma, I hate to see you work so hard. Some day - some day - .
#MRS. LOVING.
Son, I’m as proud as though you had given me a million dollars.
#TOM.
I may some day, - you see. Gee! Ma, I’m hungry. What’s for dinner? Smell’s good.
#MRS. LOVING.
Lamb and dumplings and rice.
#TOM.
Gee! I’m glad I’m living - and a pie too?
#MRS. LOVING.
Apple pie, Tommy.
#TOM.
Say, Ma, don’t wake me up. And shall “muzzer’s” own little boy set the table?
#MRS. LOVING.
Thank you, Son.
#TOM.
Ma!
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes, Son.
#TOM.
I made “squad” today, - I’m quarterback. Five other fellows tried to make it. We’ll all have to buy new hats, now.
#MRS. LOVING.
Buy new hats! Why?
#TOM.
Honest, Ma, I had to carry my hat in my hand tonight, - couldn’t even get it to perch aloft.
#MRS. LOVING.
Well, I for one, Son, am not going to say anything to make you more conceited.
#TOM.
You don’t have to say anything. Why, Ma, ever since I told you, you can almost look down your own back your head is so high. What?
#RACHEL.
My! that was a “drefful” climb, wasn’t it? Ma, I’ve got something here for you. Hello, Tommy! Here, take these things for me. This is Jimmy. Isn’t he a dear? Come, Jimmy. Ma dear, this is my brown baby. I’m going to take him right down stairs again. His mother is as sweet as can be, and let me bring him up just to see you. Jimmy, this is Ma dear.
#RACHEL.
Ma dear! What is the matter? Tom! Quick!
#MRS. LOVING.
Nothing, dears, nothing. I must be - I am - nervous tonight. How do - you - do, Jimmy? Now, Rachel - perhaps - don’t you think - you had better take him back to his mother? Good - night, Jimmy! Tom, open that window, please! There! That’s better! What a fool I am!
#TOM.
You’re all pegged out, that’s the trouble - working entirely too hard. Can’t you stop for the night and go to bed right after supper?
#MRS. LOVING.
I’ll see, Tommy dear. Now, I must look after the supper. Tom. Huh! Well, I guess not. How old do you think Rachel and I are anyway? I see; you think we’ll break some of this be - au - tiful Hav - i - land china, we bought at the “Five and Ten Cent Store.” Say, Rachel, do you think you’re old enough?
#RACHEL.
Old enough for what, Tommy?
#TOM.
To dish up the supper for Ma.
#RACHEL.
Ma dear thinks nothing can go on in this little flat unless she does it. Let’s show her a thing or two.
#MRS. LOVING.
I’ll be back in a minute, children.
#RACHEL.
Why do you suppose she acted so strangely about Jimmy?
#TOM.
Don’t know - nervous, I guess, - worn out. I wish -
#RACHEL.
It may be that; but she hasn’t been herself this afternoon. I wonder - Look out! Here she comes!
#TOM.
Liven her up.
#TOM.
Ma’s “some” cook, isn’t she?
#RACHEL.
Is she! Delmonico’s isn’t in it.
#TOM.
Say, Rachel, do you remember that Reynolds boy in the fourth year?
#RACHEL.
Yes. You mean the one who is flat - nosed, freckled, and who squints and sneers?
#TOM.
The same.
#RACHEL.
I hate him!
#MRS. LOVING.
Rachel, you do use such violent language. Why hate him?
#RACHEL.
I do - that’s all.
#TOM.
Ma, if you saw him just once, you’d understand. No one likes him. But, then, what can you expect? His father’s in “quod” doing time for something, I don’t know just what. One of the fellows says he has a real decent mother, though. She never mentions him in any way, shape or form, he says. Hard on her, isn’t it? Bet I’d keep my head shut too; - you’d never get a yap out of me.
#TOM.
Well, anyway, he called me “Nigger” today. If his face isn’t black, his eye is.
#RACHEL.
Good! Oh! Why did you let the other one go?
#TOM.
I knew he said things behind my back; but today he was hopping mad, because I made quarter - back. He didn’t!
#RACHEL.
Oh, Tommy! How lovely! Ma dear, did you hear that? Our Tommy’s on the team! Our Tommy’s on the team!
#TOM.
Ma dear, what did I say about er - er “capital” enlargements?
#MRS. LOVING.
You’re right, Son.
#TOM.
I hope you got that “capital,” Rachel. How’s that for Latin knowledge? Eh?
#RACHEL.
I don’t think much of your knowledge, Tommy dear; but Our Tommy’s on the team! Our Tommy’s on the team! Our - I’ve a good mind to kiss you.
#TOM.
Don’t you dare.
#RACHEL.
I will! I will! I will!
#TOM.
No, you don’t, young lady.
#MRS. LOVING.
For Heaven’s sake! children, do stop playing and eat your supper.
#RACHEL.
I will!
#TOM.
You won’t!
#MRS. LOVING.
Children!
#RACHEL.
Ma dear, have you noticed Mary Shaw doesn’t come here much these days?
#MRS. LOVING.
Why, that’s so, she doesn’t. Have you two quarreled?
#RACHEL.
No, Ma dear. I - think I know the reason - but I don’t like to say, unless I’m certain.
#TOM.
Well, I know. I’ve seen her lately with those two girls who have just come from the South. Twice she bowed stiffly, and the last time made believe she didn’t see me.
#RACHEL.
Then you think - ? Oh! I was afraid it was that.
#TOM.
Yes - we’re “niggers” - that’s why.
#MRS. LOVING.
Rachel, that’s one of the things I can’t save you from. I worried considerably about Mary, at first - you do take your friendships so seriously. I knew exactly how it would end. And then I saw that if Mary Shaw didn’t teach you the lesson - some one else would. They don’t want you, dearies, when you and they grow up. You may have everything in your favor - but they don’t dare to like you.
#RACHEL.
I know all that is generally true - but I had hoped that Mary -
#TOM.
Well, I guess we can still go on living even if people don’t speak to us. I’ll never bow to her again - that’s certain.
#MRS. LOVING.
But, Son, that wouldn’t be polite, if she bowed to you first.
#TOM.
Can’t help it. I guess I can be blind, too.
#MRS. LOVING.
Well - perhaps you are right - I don’t know. It’s the way I feel about it too - but - but I wish my son always to be a gentleman.
#TOM.
If being a gentleman means not being a man - I don’t wish to be one.
#RACHEL.
Oh! well, perhaps we’re wrong about Mary - I hope we are. Anyway, let’s forget it. Tommy guess what I’ve got. Ma dear treated. Guess!
#TOM.
Ma, you’re a thoroughbred. Well, let’s see - it’s - a dozen dill pickles?
#RACHEL.
Oh! stop fooling.
#TOM.
I’m not. Tripe?
#RACHEL.
Silly!
#TOM.
Hog’s jowl?
#RACHEL.
Ugh! Give it up - quarter - back.
#TOM.
Pig’s feet?
#RACHEL.
Oh! Ma dear - send him from the table. It’s CANDY!
#TOM.
Candy? Funny, I never thought of that! And I was just about to say some nice, delicious chitlings. Candy! Well! Well!
#TOM.
You see, Ma, how she treats me. I have a good mind, young lady to punish you, er - er corporeally speaking. Tut! Tut! I have a mind to master thee - I mean - you. Methinks that if I should advance upon you, apply, perchance, two or three digits to your glossy locks and extract - aha! - say a strand - you would no more defy me.
#MRS. LOVING.
Rachel! give Tom the candy and stop playing. Just a moment, Rachel. Tom and Rachel! I have been trying to make up my mind for some time whether a certain thing is my duty or not. Today - I have decided it is. You are old enough, now, - and I see you ought to be told. Do you know what day this is? It’s the sixteenth of October. Does that mean anything to either of you? and RACHEL. No.
#MRS. LOVING.
No - I don’t know why it should. Ten years ago - today - your father and your half - brother died.
#TOM.
I do remember, now, that you told us it was in October.
#RACHEL.
That explains - today.
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes, Rachel. Do you know - how they - died? and RACHEL. Why, no.
#MRS. LOVING.
Did it ever strike you as strange - that they - died - the same day?
#TOM.
Well, yes.
#RACHEL.
We often wondered, Tom and I; but - but somehow we never quite dared to ask you. You - you - always refused to talk about them, you know, Ma dear.
#MRS. LOVING.
Did you think - that - perhaps - the reason - I - I - wouldn’t talk about them - was - because, because - I was ashamed - of them?
#RACHEL.
Well, Ma dear - we - we - did - wonder.
#MRS. LOVING.
And you thought?
#RACHEL.
W - e - l - l -
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes?
#TOM.
Oh! come, now, Rachel, you know we haven’t bothered about it at all. Why should we? We’ve been happy.
#MRS. LOVING.
But when you have thought - you’ve been ashamed? Have you?
#TOM.
Now, Ma, aren’t you making a lot out of nothing?
#MRS. LOVING.
No. You evade - both - of you. You have been ashamed. And I never dreamed until today you could take it this way. How blind - how almost criminally blind, I have been.
#RACHEL.
Oh! Ma dear, don’t!
#MRS. LOVING.
Tom - and Rachel!
#TOM.
Ma!
#RACHEL.
Ma dear!
#MRS. LOVING.
They - they - were lynched!! and RACHEL. Lynched!
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes - by Christian people - in a Christian land. We found out afterwards they were all church members in good standing - the best people. Your father was a man among men. He was a fanatic. He was a Saint!
#TOM.
Ma - can you - will you - tell us - about it?
#MRS. LOVING.
I believe it to be my duty. When I married your father I was a widow. My little George was seven years old. From the very beginning he worshiped your father. He followed him around - just like a little dog. All children were like that with him. I myself have never seen anybody like him. “Big” seems to fit him better than any other word. He was big - bodied - big - souled. His loves were big and his hates. You can imagine, then, how the wrongs of the Negro - ate into his soul. He was utterly fearless. He edited and owned, for several years, a small negro paper. In it he said a great many daring things. I used to plead with him to be more careful. I was always afraid for him. For a long time, nothing happened - he was too important to the community. And then - one night - ten years ago - a mob made up of the respectable people in the town lynched an innocent black man - and what was worse - they knew him to be innocent. A white man was guilty. I never saw your father so wrought up over anything. he couldn’t eat; he couldn’t sleep; he brooded night and day over it. And then - realizing fully the great risk he was running, although I begged him not to - and all his friends also - he deliberately and calmly went to work and published a most terrific denunciation of that mob. The old prophets in the Bible were not more terrible than he. A day or two later, he received an anonymous letter, very evidently from an educated man, calling upon him to retract his words in the next issue. If he refused his life was threatened. The next week’s issue contained an arraignment as frightful, if not more so, than the previous one. Each word was white - hot, searing. That night, some dozen masked men came to our house.
#RACHEL.
Oh, Ma dear! Ma dear!
#MRS. LOVING.
We were not asleep - your father and I. They broke down the front door and made their way to our bedroom. Your father kissed me - and took up his revolver. It was always loaded. They broke down the door. I tried to shut my eyes - I could not. Four masked men fell - they did not move any more - after a little. Your father was finally overpowered and dragged out. In the hall - my little seventeen - year - old George tried to rescue him. Your father begged him not to interfere. He paid no attention. It ended in their dragging them both out. My little George - was - a man! He never made an outcry. His last words to me were. “Ma, I am glad to go with Father.” I could only nod to him. While they were dragging them down the steps, I crept into the room where you were. You were both asleep. Rachel, I remember, was smiling. I knelt down by you - and covered my ears with my hands - and waited. I could not pray - I couldn’t for a long time - afterwards. It was very still when I finally uncovered my ears. The only sounds were the faint rustle of leaves and the “tap - tapping of the twig of a tree” against the window. I hear it still - sometimes in my dreams. It was the tree - where they were. While I had knelt there waiting - I had made up my mind what to do. I dressed myself and then I woke you both up and dressed you. We set forth. It was a black, still night. Alternately dragging you along and carrying you - I walked five miles to the house of some friends. They took us in, and we remained there until I had seen my dead laid comfortably at rest. They lent me money to come North - I couldn’t bring you up - in the South. Always remember this. There never lived anywhere - or at any time - any two whiter or more beautiful souls. God gave me one for a husband and one for a son and I am proud. You - must - be - proud - too.
#MRS. LOVING.
Tom, it’s time, now, for you to go to work. Rachel and I will finish up here.
#TOM.
I want you to know, Ma, before I go - how - how proud I am. Why, I didn’t believe two people could be like that - and live. And then to find out that one - was your own father - and one - your own brother. - It’s wonderful! I’m - not much yet, Ma, but - I’ve - I’ve just got to be something now. . When I think - when I think - of those devils with white skins - living somewhere today - living and happy - I - see - red! I - I - good - bye!
#MRS. LOVING.
I was afraid - of just that. I wonder - if I did the wise thing - after all.
#RACHEL.
Yes, Ma dear, you did. And, hereafter, Tom and I share and share alike with you. To think, Ma dear, of ten years of this - all alone. It’s wicked!
#MRS. LOVING.
And, Rachel, about that dear, little boy, Jimmy.
#RACHEL.
Now, Ma dear, tell me tomorrow. You’ve stood enough for one day.
#MRS. LOVING.
No, it’s better over and done with - all at once. If I had seen that dear child suddenly any other day than this - I might have borne it better. When he lifted his little face to me - and smiled - for a moment - I thought it was the end - of all things. Rachel, he is the image of my boy - my George!
#RACHEL.
Ma dear!
#MRS. LOVING.
And, Rachel - it will hurt - to see him again.
#RACHEL.
I understand, Ma dear. Ma dear, I am beginning to see - to understand - so much. Ten years ago, all things being equal, Jimmy might have been - George? Isn’t that so?
#MRS. LOVING.
Why - yes, if I understand you.
#RACHEL.
I guess that doesn’t sound very clear. It’s only getting clear to me, little by little. Do you mind my thinking out loud to you?
#MRS. LOVING.
No, chickabiddy.
#RACHEL.
If Jimmy went South now - and grew up - he might be - a George?
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes.
#RACHEL.
Then, the South is full of tens, hundreds, thousands of little boys, who, one day may be - and some of them with certainty - Georges?
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes, Rachel.
#RACHEL.
And the little babies, the dear, little, helpless babies, being born today - now - and those who will be, tomorrow, and all the tomorrows to come - have that sooner or later to look forward to? They will laugh and play and sing and be happy and grow up, perhaps, and be ambitious - just for that?
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes, Rachel.
#RACHEL.
Then, everywhere, everywhere, throughout the South, there are hundreds of dark mothers who live in fear, terrible, suffocating fear, whose rest by night is broken, and whose joy by day in their babies on their hearts is three parts - pain. Oh, I know this is true - for this is the way I should feel, if I were little Jimmy’s mother. How horrible! Why - it would be more merciful - to strangle the little things at birth. And so this nation - this white Christian nation - has deliberately set its curse upon the most beautiful - the most holy thing in life - motherhood! Why - it - makes - you doubt - God!
#MRS. LOVING.
Oh, hush! little girl. Hush!
#RACHEL.
Why, Ma dear, you know. You were a mother, George’s mother. So, this is what it means. Oh, Ma dear! Ma dear!
#JIMMY.
Ma Rachel!
#RACHEL.
What is it, Jimmy boy?
#JIMMY.
Three guesses! Three guesses! Ma Rachel!
#RACHEL.
Well, let’s see - maybe there is a circus in town.
#JIMMY.
No siree! You’re not right! You’re not right!
#RACHEL.
Well, maybe Ma Loving’s going to take you somewhere.
#JIMMY.
No! It’s -
#RACHEL.
You said I could have three guesses, honey. I’ve only had two.
#JIMMY.
I thought you had three. How many are three?
#RACHEL.
One! Two! Three! I’ve only had one! two! - See? Perhaps Uncle Tom is going to give you some candy.
#JIMMY.
No! No! No! I leaned over the bath - tub, way over, and got hold of the chain with the button on the end, and dropped it into the little round place in the bottom. And then I runned lots and lots of water in the tub and climbed over and fell in splash! just like a big stone; and took a bath all by myself alone.
#RACHEL.
All by yourself, honey? You ran the water, too, boy, not “runned” it. What I want to know is, where was Ma Loving all this time?
#JIMMY.
I stole in “creepy - creep” and looked at Ma Loving and she was awful fast asleep. Ma Rachel, I’m a “nawful,” big boy now, aren’t I? I are almost a man, aren’t I?
#RACHEL.
Oh! Boy, I’m getting tired of correcting you - “I am almost a man, am I not?” Jimmy, boy, what will Ma Rachel do, if you grow up? Why, I won’t have a little boy any more! Honey, you mustn’t grow up, do you hear? You mustn’t.
#JIMMY.
Oh, yes, I must; and you’ll have me just the same, Ma Rachel. I’m going to be a policeman and make lots of money for you and Ma Loving and Uncle Tom, and I’m going to buy you some trains and fire - engines, and little, cunning ponies, and some rabbits, and some great ’normous banks full of money - lots of it. And then, we are going to live in a great, big castle and eat lots of ice cream, all the time, and drink lots and lots of nice pink lemonade.
#RACHEL.
What a generous Jimmy boy! Before I give you “morning kiss,” I must see how clean my boy is. Jimmy, you’re sweet and clean enough to eat. Now the hands. Oh! Jimmy, look at those nails! Oh! Jimmy! Honey, get my file off of my bureau and go to Ma Loving; she must be awake by this time. Why, honey, what’s the matter with your feet?
#JIMMY.
I don’t know. I thought they looked kind of queer, myself. What’s the matter with them?
#RACHEL.
You have your shoes on the wrong feet.
#JIMMY.
Isn’t that most ’normously funny? I’m a case, aren’t I - I mean - am I not, Ma Rachel?
#RACHEL.
Yes, honey, a great big case of molasses. Come, you must hurry now, and get dressed. You don’t want to be late for school, you know.
#JIMMY.
Ma Rachel! I - I have been making something for you all the morning - ever since I waked up. It’s awful nice. It’s - stoop down, Ma Rachel, please - a great, big
#MRS. LOVING.
Good morning, dearie. How’s my little girl, this morning? Why, where’s Tom? I was certain I heard him running the water in the tub, sometime ago.
#RACHEL.
Tom isn’t up yet. Have you seen Jimmy?
#MRS. LOVING.
Jimmy? No. I didn’t know he was awake, even.
#RACHEL.
Well! What do you think of that! I sent the young gentleman to you, a few minutes ago, for help with his nails. He is very much grown up this morning, so I suppose that explains why he didn’t come to you. Yesterday, all day, you know, he was a puppy. No one knows what he will be by tomorrow. All of this, Ma dear, is preliminary to telling you that Jimmy boy has stolen a march on you, this morning.
#MRS. LOVING.
Stolen a march! How?
#RACHEL.
It appears that he took his bath all by himself and, as a result, he is so conceited, peacocks aren’t in it with him.
#MRS. LOVING.
I heard the water running and thought, of course, it was Tom. Why, the little rascal! I must go and see how he has left things. I was just about to wake him up.
#RACHEL.
Rheumatism’s not much better this morning, Ma dear. Tell me the truth, now, did you or did you not try that liniment I bought you yesterday?
#MRS. LOVING.
Well, Rachel, you see - it was this way, I was - I was so tired, last night, - I - I really forgot it.
#RACHEL.
I thought as much. Shame on you!
#MRS. LOVING.
As soon as I walk around a bit it will be all right. It always is. It’s bad, when I first get up - that’s all. I’ll be spry enough in a few minutes. Rachel, I don’t know why the thought should strike me, but how very strangely things turn out. If any one had told me four years ago that Jimmy would be living with us, I should have laughed at him. Then it hurt to see him; now it would hurt not to. Rachel, sometimes - I wonder - if, perhaps, God - hasn’t relented a little - and given me back my boy, - my George.
#RACHEL.
The whole thing was strange, wasn’t it?
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes, God’s ways are strange and often very beautiful; perhaps all would be beautiful - if we only understood.
#RACHEL.
God’s ways are certainly very mysterious. Why, of all the people in this apartment - house, should Jimmy’s father and mother be the only two to take the smallpox, and the only two to die. It’s queer!
#MRS. LOVING.
It doesn’t seem like two years ago, does it?
#RACHEL.
Two years, Ma dear! Why it’s three the third of January.
#MRS. LOVING.
Are you sure, Rachel?
#RACHEL.
I don’t believe I could ever forget that, Ma dear.
#MRS. LOVING.
No, I suppose not. That is one of the differences between youth and old age - youth attaches tremendous importance to dates, - old age does not.
#RACHEL.
Ma dear, don’t talk like that. You’re not old.
#MRS. LOVING.
Oh! yes, I am, dearie. It’s sixty long years since I was born; and I am much older than that, much older.
#RACHEL.
Please, Ma dear, please!
#MRS. LOVING.
Very well, dearie, I won’t say it any more. By the way, - how - does Tom strike you, these days?
#RACHEL.
The same old, bantering, cheerful Tom. Why?
#MRS. LOVING.
I know he’s all that, dearie, but it isn’t possible for him to be really cheerful. When you are little, we mothers can kiss away all the trouble, but when you grow up - and go out - into the world - and get hurt - we are helpless. There is nothing we can do.
#RACHEL.
Don’t worry about Tom, Ma dear, he’s game. He doesn’t show the white feather.
#MRS. LOVING.
Did you see him, when he came in, last night?
#RACHEL.
Yes.
#MRS. LOVING.
Had he had - any luck?
#RACHEL.
No. Ma dear, we may as well face it - it’s hopeless, I’m afraid.
#MRS. LOVING.
I’m afraid - you are right. Well, I’ll go and see how Jimmy has left things and wake up Tom, if he isn’t awake yet. It’s the waking up in the mornings that’s hard.
#TOM.
Good - morning, “Merry Sunshine”! Have you, perhaps, been taking a - er - prolonged draught of that very delightful beverage - vinegar? I take it all back, I’m sure. May I request, humbly, that before I press my chaste, morning salute upon your forbidding lips, that you - that you - that you - er - in some way rid yourself of that - er - knife? I thank you. What’s the matter with my little Sis?
#RACHEL.
Tommy dear, don’t mind me. I’m getting wicked, I guess. At present I feel just like - like curdled milk. Once upon a time, I used to have quite a nice disposition, didn’t I, Tommy?
#TOM.
Did you, indeed! I’m not going to flatter you. Well, brace yourself, old lady. Ready, One! Two! Three! Go! You’re a pretty, decent little sister, Sis, that’s what T. Loving thinks about it; and he knows a thing or two. Has the paper come yet?
#RACHEL.
I haven’t looked, it must have, though, by this time.
#TOM.
May T. Loving be of any service to you?
#RACHEL.
Service! How?
#TOM.
May he run, say, any errands, set the table, cook the breakfast? Anything?
#RACHEL.
You look like working.
#TOM.
It’s at least - polite - to offer.
#RACHEL.
You can’t do anything; I don’t trust you to do it right. You may just sit there, and read your paper - and try to behave yourself.
#TOM.
Thank you, ma’am. ’Lo! Big Fellow, what’s this?
#JIMMY.
How can I hear? I’m miles and miles away yet. Good - morning!
#TOM.
Bless my stars! Who’s this? Well, if it isn’t Mr. Mason! How - do - you - do, Mr. Mason? That’s a beautiful horse you have there. He limps a trifle in his left, hind, front foot, though.
#JIMMY.
He doesn’t!
#TOM.
He does!
#JIMMY.
He doesn’t!
#TOM.
I say he does!
#MRS. LOVING.
For Heaven’s sake! What is this? Good - morning, Tommy.
#TOM.
Good - morning, Ma. Ma! Jimmy says his horse doesn’t limp in his hind, front right leg, and I say he does.
#JIMMY.
I think Uncle Tom is funnier than any clown in the “Kickus.”
#TOM.
In the what, Jimmy?
#JIMMY.
In the “kickus,” of course.
#TOM.
“Kickus”! “Kickus”! Oh, Lordy! Boy, you’ll be the death of me yet. Circus, son! Circus!
#JIMMY.
Well, I thinks “Kickus” and circus are very much alike. Please put me down.
#RACHEL.
We laugh, honey, because we love you so much.
#JIMMY.
Is that so, Uncle Tom?
#TOM.
Surest thing in the world! Come, get down, young man. Don’t you know you’ll wear my arms out? Besides, there is something in my lower vest pocket, that’s just dying to come to you. Get down, I say.
#JIMMY.
How can I get down?
#TOM.
How should I know? Just get down, of course.
#JIMMY.
Please sit down, Uncle Tom?
#TOM.
Sit down! What for?
#JIMMY.
Why, you said there was something for me in your pocket.
#TOM.
So I did. How forgetful I am!
#JIMMY.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
#TOM.
Why, Jimmy! You embarrass me. My! My!
#JIMMY.
What is ’barrass?
#TOM.
You make me blush.
#JIMMY.
What’s that?
#MRS. LOVING.
Come, come, children! Rachel has the breakfast on the table.
#TOM.
What’s the matter, now?
#JIMMY.
You’re in my place.
#TOM.
Well, can’t you sit in mine?
#JIMMY.
I wants to sit by my Ma Rachel.
#TOM.
Well, so do I.
#RACHEL.
Tom, stop teasing Jimmy. Honey, don’t you let him bother you; ask him please prettily.
#JIMMY.
Please prettily, Uncle Tom.
#TOM.
Oh! well then.
#JIMMY.
Oh, goody! goody! goody! We’ve got sau - sa - ges.
#MRS. LOVING.
Sh!
#JIMMY.
Uncle Tom!
#TOM.
Sir?
#JIMMY.
I took a bath this morning, all by myself alone, in the bath - tub, and I ranned, no I runned, I think - the water all in it, and got in it all by myself; and Ma Loving thought it was you; but it was me.
#TOM.
See here, young man, this won’t do. Don’t you know I’m the only one who is allowed to do that here? It’s a perfect waste of water - that’s what it is.
#JIMMY.
Oh! no, you’re not the only one, ’cause Ma Loving and Ma Rachel and me - alls takes baths every single morning. So, there!
#TOM.
You ’barrass me. Young gentleman, your mouth is open. Close it, sir; close it.
#MRS. LOVING.
Tom, you’re as big a child exactly as Jimmy.
#TOM.
You compliment me. I thank you, I am sure.
#JIMMY.
I’m through, Ma Rachel.
#MRS. LOVING.
Jimmy, you’re a big boy, now, aren’t you? I wonder if you’re big enough to wash your own hands, this morning?
#JIMMY.
Yes, ma’am.
#MRS. LOVING.
Well, if they’re beautifully clean, I’ll give you another penny.
#JIMMY.
Please untie my napkin, Ma Rachel! “Excoose” me, please.
#MRS. LOVING AND RACHEL.
Certainly.
#MRS. LOVING.
Rachel, do you know what day this is?
#RACHEL.
Yes, Ma dear.
#MRS. LOVING.
Tom.
#TOM.
Yes, Ma.
#MRS. LOVING.
We must never - as long - as we live - forget this day.
#RACHEL.
No, Ma dear.
#TOM.
No, Ma.
#TOM.
I hear people talk about God’s justice - and I wonder. There, are you, Ma. There isn’t a sacrifice - that you haven’t made. You’re still working your fingers to the bone - sewing - just so all of us may keep on living. Rachel is a graduate in Domestic Science; she was high in her class; most of the girls below her in rank have positions in the schools. I’m an electrical engineer - and I’ve tried steadily for several months - to practice my profession. It seems our educations aren’t of much use to us. we aren’t allowed to make good - because our skins are dark. And, in the South today, there are white men - They have everything; they’re well - dressed, well - fed, well - housed; they’re prosperous in business; they’re important politically; they’re pillars in the church. I know all this is true - I’ve inquired. Their children are growing up around them; and they are having a square deal handed out to them - college, position, wealth, and best of all, freedom, without galling restrictions, to work out their own salvations. With ability, they may become - anything; and all this will be true of their children’s children after them. Look at us - and look at them. We are destined to failure - they, to success. Their children shall grow up in hope; ours, in despair. Our hands are clean; - theirs are red with blood - red with the blood of a noble man - and a boy. They’re nothing but low, cowardly, bestial murderers. The scum of the earth shall succeed. - God’s justice, I suppose.
#MRS. LOVING.
Tom, promise me - one thing.
#TOM.
What is it, Ma?
#MRS. LOVING.
That - you’ll try - not to lose faith - in God. I’ve been where you are now - and it’s black. Tom, we don’t understand God’s ways. My son, I know, now - He is beautiful. Tom, won’t you try to believe, again?
#TOM.
I’ll try, Ma.
#MRS. LOVING.
Each one, I suppose, has to work out his own salvation. Rachel, if you’ll get Jimmy ready, I’ll take him to school. I’ve got to go down town shopping for a customer, this morning.
#MRS. LOVING.
A yard, you say, Rachel? You’re sure that will be enough. Oh! you’ve measured it. Anything else? - What? - Oh! all right. I’ll be back by one o’clock, anyway. Good - bye.
#TOM.
Hello! Big Fellow, where are you taking my mother, I’d like to know? This is a pretty kettle of fish.
#JIMMY.
Aren’t you funny, Uncle Tom! Why, I’m not taking her anywhere. She’s taking me. I’m going to school.
#TOM.
Big Fellow, come here. Now, where’s that penny I gave you? No, I don’t want to see it. All right. Did Ma Loving give you another? I wish you to promise me solemnly - Now, listen! Here, don’t wriggle so! not to buy - Listen! too many pints of ice - cream with my penny. Understand?
#JIMMY.
Yes, Uncle Tom, cross my “tummy”! I promise.
#TOM.
Well, then, you may go. I guess that will be all for the present. Well?
#JIMMY.
Haven’t you - aren’t you - isn’t you - forgetting something?
#TOM.
Bless my stars! what now?
#JIMMY.
If you could kind of lean over this way. No, not that way. No, this way, this way! This way!
#TOM.
Well, why didn’t you say so, at first?
#JIMMY.
Good - bye, dear old Uncle Tom. I likes to be hugged like that - I can taste - sau - sa - ges.
#TOM.
You ’barrass me, son. Here, Ma, take your boy. Now remember all I told you, Jimmy.
#JIMMY.
I ’members.
#MRS. LOVING.
God bless you, Tom. Good luck.
#JIMMY.
God bless you, Uncle Tom. Good luck!
#TOM.
Thank you - Good - bye. and TOM. John!
#TOM.
I wonder what’s up - It’s rather early for him. - I’ll go.
#RACHEL.
Well, stranger, how does it happen you’re out so early in the morning?
#STRONG.
I hadn’t seen any of you for a week, and I thought I’d come by, on my way to work, and find out how things are going. There is no need of asking how you are, Rachel. And the mother and the boy?
#RACHEL.
Ma dear’s rheumatism still holds on. - Jimmy’s fine.
#STRONG.
I’m sorry to hear that your mother is not well. There isn’t a remedy going that my mother doesn’t know about. I’ll get her advice and let you know. Well, Tom, how goes it?
#TOM.
There’s plenty of “go,” but no “git there.”
#STRONG.
I was hoping for better news.
#TOM.
If I remember rightly, not so many years ago, you tried - and failed. Then, a colored man had hardly a ghost of a show; - now he hasn’t even the ghost of a ghost.
#STRONG.
That’s true enough. What are you going to do?
#TOM.
I’ll do this little “going act” of mine the rest of the week; and then, I’ll do anything I can get to do. If necessary, I suppose, I can be a “White - wing.”
#STRONG.
Tom, I came - Six years ago, I found I was up against a stone wall - your experience, you see, to the letter. I couldn’t let my mother starve, so I became a waiter. I studied waiting; I made a science of it, an art. In a comparatively short time, I’m a head - waiter and I’m up against another stonewall. I’ve reached my limit. I’m thirty - two now, and I’ll die a head - waiter. College friends, so - called, and acquaintances used to come into the restaurant. One or two at first - attempted to commiserate with me. They didn’t do it again. I waited upon them - I did my best. Many of them tipped me. I can remember my first tip, still. They come in yet; many of them are already powers, not only in this city, but in the country. Some of them make a personal request that I wait upon them. I am an artist, now, in my proper sphere. They tip me well, extremely well - the larger the tip, the more pleased they are with me. Because of me, in their own eyes, they’re philanthropists. Amusing, isn’t it? I can stand their attitude now. My philosophy - learned hard, is to make the best of everything you can, and go on. At best, life isn’t so very long. You’re wondering why I’m telling you all this. I wish you to see things exactly as they are. There are many disadvantages and some advantages in being a waiter. My mother can live comfortably; I am able, even, to see that she gets some of the luxuries. Tom, it’s this way - I can always get you a job as a waiter; I’ll teach you the art. If you care to begin the end of the week - all right. And remember this, as long as I keep my job - this offer holds good.
#TOM.
I - I - Thank you. I guess it’s safe enough to say, you’ll see me at the end of the week. John you’re - Hear the racket! My kiddies gently begging for admittance. It’s about twenty minutes of nine, isn’t it? I thought so.
#LITTLE MARY.
It’s my turn to get “Morning kiss” first, this morning, Miss Rachel. You kissed Louise first yesterday. You said you’d kiss us “alphebettically.” You promised!
#LITTLE NANCY.
Now, me.
#RACHEL.
You children will pull me limb from limb; and then I’ll be all dead; and you’ll be sorry - see, if you aren’t. Edith! come here this minute, and let me tie your hair - ribbon again. Nancy, I’m ashamed of you, I saw you trying to pull it off. Louise, you look as sweet as sweet, this morning; and Jenny, where did you get the pretty, pretty dress?
#LITTLE JENNY.
My mother made it. My mother says I have a very bad cold.
#LITTLE MARTHA.
I - have - a - pitty - ’ittle flower.
#RACHEL.
Honey, it’s beautiful. Don’t you want “Morning kiss” too?
#LITTLE MARTHA.
Yes, I do.
#RACHEL.
Come, honey. Are you going to give the pretty flower to Jenny’s teacher? Is it for - mother? Is it for - let’s see - Daddy? I give up. To whom are you going to give the pretty flower, honey?
#LITTLE MARTHA.
“Oo.”
#RACHEL.
You, darling!
#LITTLE MARTHA.
Muzzer and I picked it - for “oo.” Here ’tis.
#RACHEL.
Well, I’m going to pay you with three big kisses. One! Two! Three!
#LITTLE MARTHA.
I can count, One! Two! Free! Tan’t I? I am going to school soon; and I wants to put the flower in your hair.
#RACHEL.
All right, baby.
#LITTLE MARTHA.
Miss Rachel, the ’ittle flower loves you. It told me so. It said it wanted to lie in your hair. It is going to tell you a pitty ’ittle secret. You listen awful hard - and you’ll hear. I wish I were a fairy and had a little wand, I’d turn everything into flowers. Wouldn’t that be nice, Miss Rachel?
#RACHEL.
Lovely, honey!
#LITTLE JENNY.
If I were a fairy and had a wand, I’d turn you, Miss Rachel, into a queen - and then I’d always be near you and see that you were happy.
#RACHEL.
Honey, how beautiful!
#LITTLE LOUISE.
I’d make my mother happy - if I were a fairy. She cries all the time. My father can’t get anything to do.
#LITTLE NANCY.
If I were a fairy, I’d turn a boy in my school into a spider. I hate him.
#RACHEL.
Honey, why?
#LITTLE NANCY.
I’ll tell you sometime - I hate him.
#LITTLE EDITH.
Where’s Jimmy, Miss Rachel?
#RACHEL.
He went long ago; and chickies, you’ll have to clear out, all of you, now, or you’ll be late. Shoo! Shoo!
#TOM.
Does it ever strike you - how pathetic and tragic a thing - a little colored child is?
#STRONG.
Yes.
#TOM.
Today, we colored men and women, everywhere - are up against it. Every year, we are having a harder time of it. In the South, they make it as impossible as they can for us to get an education. We’re hemmed in on all sides. Our one safeguard - the ballot - in most states, is taken away already, or is being taken away. Economically, in a few lines, we have a slight show - but at what a cost! In the North, they make a pretence of liberality. they give us the ballot and a good education, and then - snuff us out. Each year, the problem just to live, gets more difficult to solve. How about these children - if we’re fools enough to have any?
#STRONG.
That part - is damnable!
#TOM.
It’s later than I thought. I’ll have to be pulling out of here now, if you don’t mind. Rachel! I’ve got to go now, Sis. I leave John in your hands.
#STRONG.
I’ve got to go, myself, in a few minutes.
#TOM.
Nonsense, man! Sit still. I’ll begin to think, in a minute, you’re afraid of the ladies.
#STRONG.
I am.
#TOM.
What! And not ashamed to acknowledge it?
#STRONG.
No.
#TOM.
You’re lots wiser than I dreamed. So long! “Morituri Salutamus”.
#RACHEL.
John!
#STRONG.
Well? listened.
#STRONG.
Listened! To what?
#RACHEL.
To you and Tom.
#STRONG.
Well, - what of it?
#RACHEL.
I didn’t think it was quite fair not to tell you. It - it seemed, well, like eavesdropping.
#STRONG.
Don’t worry about it. Nonsense!
#RACHEL.
I’m glad - I want to thank you for what you did for Tom. He needs you, and will need you. You’ll help him?
#STRONG.
Rachel, each one - has his own little battles. I’ll do what I can. After all, an outsider doesn’t help much.
#RACHEL.
But friendship - just friendship - helps.
#STRONG.
Yes. Rachel, do you hear anything encouraging from the schools? Any hope for you yet?
#RACHEL.
No, nor ever will be. I know that now. There’s no more chance for me than there is for Tom, - or than there was for you - or for any of us with dark skins. It’s lucky for me that I love to keep house, and cook, and sew. I’ll never get anything else. Ma dear’s sewing, the little work Tom has been able to get, and the little sewing I sometimes get to do - keep us from the poorhouse. We live. According to your philosophy, I suppose, make the best of it - it might be worse.
#STRONG.
You don’t want to get morbid over these things, you know.
#RACHEL.
That’s it. If you see things as they are, you’re either pessimistic or morbid.
#STRONG.
In the long run, do you believe, that attitude of mind - will be - beneficial to you? I’m ten years older than you. I tried your way. I know. Mine is the only sane one.
#RACHEL.
Why, John, don’t!
#STRONG.
Perhaps - if you had - a little more fun in your life, your point of view would be - more normal. I’ll arrange it so I can take you to some theatre, one night, this week.
#RACHEL.
You talk as though I were a - a jellyfish. You’ll take me, how do you know I’ll go?
#STRONG.
You will.
#RACHEL.
Indeed! I wonder if you know how - how - maddening you are. Why, you talk as though my will counts for nothing. It’s as if you’re trying to master me. I think a domineering man is detestable.
#STRONG.
If he’s, perhaps, the man?
#RACHEL.
Besides, some of these theatres put you off by yourself as though you had leprosy. I’m not going.
#STRONG.
You know I wouldn’t ask you to go, under those circumstances. Well, I must be going now. Rachel, I am coming back to see you, this evening.
#RACHEL.
I’m sure we’ll all be very glad to see you.
#STRONG.
I said - you. Good - bye - little Rachel. Until tonight.
#MRS. LANE.
May I sit down? I’m tired.
#RACHEL.
Why, certainly.
#MRS. LANE.
No, you don’t know me - never even heard of me - nor I of you. I was looking at the vacant flat on this floor - and saw your name - on your door, - “Loving!” It’s a strange name to come across - in this world. - I thought, perhaps, you might give me some information.
#RACHEL.
I’ll be glad to tell you anything, I am able Mrs. -
#MRS. LANE.
Lane. What I want to know is, how do they treat the colored children in the school I noticed around the corner?
#RACHEL.
Very well - I’m sure.
#MRS. LANE.
What reason have you for being sure?
#RACHEL.
Why, the little boy I’ve adopted goes there; and he’s very happy. All the children in this apartment - house go there too; and I know they’re happy.
#MRS. LANE.
Do you know how many colored children there are in the school?
#RACHEL.
Why, I should guess around thirty.
#MRS. LANE.
I see. What color is this little adopted boy of yours?
#RACHEL.
Why - he’s brown.
#MRS. LANE.
Any black children there?
#RACHEL.
Why - yes.
#MRS. LANE.
Do you mind if I send Ethel over by the piano to sit?
#RACHEL.
N - no, certainly not.
#MRS. LANE.
She won’t go to you - she’s afraid of everybody now but her father and me. Come Ethel. Sit down, Ethel. I’m not going to leave you, Ethel. I’ll be right over here. You can see me. Do you mind if we sit over here by the sewing - machine? Thank you.
#RACHEL.
Does Ethel like apples, Mrs. Lane?
#MRS. LANE.
Yes.
#RACHEL.
Do you mind if I give her one?
#MRS. LANE.
No. Thank you, very much.
#RACHEL.
Here, dear, little girl, is a beautiful apple for you.
#MRS. LANE.
I’m sorry, but I’m afraid she won’t take it from you. Ethel, the kind lady has given you an apple. Thank her nicely. Here! I’ll spread the napkin for you, and put the plate in your lap. Thank the lady like a good little girl.
#ETHEL.
Thank you.
#MRS. LANE.
I’ve got to move - it’s Ethel.
#RACHEL.
What is the matter with that child? It’s - it’s heartbreaking to see her.
#MRS. LANE.
I understand how you feel, - I don’t feel anything, myself, any more. My husband and I are poor, and we’re ugly and we’re black. Ethel looks like her father more than she does like me. We live in 55th Street - near the railroad. It’s a poor neighborhood, but the rent’s cheap. My husband is a porter in a store; and, to help out, I’m a caretaker. I don’t know why I’m telling you all this. We had a nice little home - and the three of us were happy. Now we’ve got to move.
#RACHEL.
Move! Why?
#MRS. LANE.
It’s Ethel. I put her in school this September. She stayed two weeks. That’s the result.
#RACHEL.
You mean - that just two weeks - in school - did that?
#MRS. LANE.
Yes. Ethel never had a sick day in her life - before. I took her to the doctor at the end of the two weeks. He says she’s a nervous wreck.
#RACHEL.
But what could they have done to her?
#MRS. LANE.
I’ll tell you what they did the first day. Ethel is naturally sensitive and backward. She’s not assertive. The teacher saw that, and, after I had left, told her to sit in a seat in the rear of the class. She was alone there - in a corner. The children, immediately feeling there was something wrong with Ethel because of the teacher’s attitude, turned and stared at her. When the teacher’s back was turned they whispered about her, pointed their fingers at her and tittered. The teacher divided the class into two parts, divisions, I believe, they are called. She forgot all about Ethel, of course, until the last minute, and then, looking back, said sharply. “That little girl there may join this division,” meaning the group of pupils standing around her. Ethel naturally moved slowly. The teacher called her sulky and told her to lose a part of her recess. When Ethel came up - the children drew away from her in every direction. She was left standing alone. The teacher then proceeded to give a lesson about kindness to animals. Funny, isn’t it, kindness to animals? The children forgot Ethel in the excitement of talking about their pets. Presently, the teacher turned to Ethel and said disagreeably. “Have you a pet?” Ethel said, “Yes,” very low. “Come, speak up, you sulky child, what is it?” Ethel said. “A blind puppy.” They all laughed, the teacher and all. Strange, isn’t it, but Ethel loves that puppy. She spoke up. “It’s mean to laugh at a little blind puppy. I’m glad he’s blind.” This remark brought forth more laughter. “Why are you glad,” the teacher asked curiously. Ethel refused to say. When I asked her why, do you know what she told me? “If he saw me, he might not love me any more.” Did I tell you that Ethel is only seven years old?
#RACHEL.
Oh! I didn’t believe any one could be as cruel as that - to a little child.
#MRS. LANE.
It isn’t very pleasant, is it? When the teacher found out that Ethel wouldn’t answer, she said severely. “Take your seat!” At recess, all the children went out. Ethel could hear them playing and laughing and shrieking. Even the teacher went too. She was made to sit there all alone - in that big room - because God made her ugly - and black. When the recess was half over the teacher came back. “You may go now,” she said coldly. Ethel didn’t stir. “Did you hear me?” “Yes’m.” “Why don’t you obey?” “I don’t want to go out, please.” “You don’t, don’t you, you stubborn child! Go immediately!” Ethel went. She stood by the school steps. No one spoke to her. The children near her moved away in every direction. They stopped playing, many of them, and watched her. They stared as only children can stare. Some began whispering about her. Presently one child came up and ran her hand roughly over Ethel’s face. She looked at her hand and Ethel’s face and ran screaming back to the others, “It won’t come off! See!” Other children followed the first child’s example. Then one boy spoke up loudly. “I know what she is, she’s a nigger!” Many took up the cry. God or the devil interfered - the bell rang. The children filed in. One boy boldly called her “Nigger!” before the teacher. She said, “That isn’t nice,” - but she smiled at the boy. Things went on about the same for the rest of the day. At the end of school, Ethel put on her hat and coat - the teacher made her hang them at a distance from the other pupils’ wraps; and started for home. Quite a crowd escorted her. They called her “Nigger!” all the way. I made Ethel go the next day. I complained to the authorities. They treated me lightly. I was determined not to let them force my child out of school. At the end of two weeks - I had to take her out.
#RACHEL.
Why, - I never - in all my life - heard anything - so - pitiful.
#MRS. LANE.
Did you ever go to school here?
#RACHEL.
Yes. I was made to feel my color - but I never had an experience like that.
#MRS. LANE.
How many years ago were you in the graded schools?
#RACHEL.
Oh! - around ten.
#MRS. LANE.
Ten years! Every year things are getting worse. Last year wasn’t as bad as this. So they treat the children all right in this school?
#RACHEL.
Yes! Yes! I know that.
#MRS. LANE.
I can’t afford to take this flat here, but I’ll take it. I’m going to have Ethel educated. Although, when you think of it, - it’s all rather useless - this education! What are our children going to do with it, when they get it? We strive and save and sacrifice to educate them - and the whole time - down underneath, we know - they’ll have no chance.
#RACHEL.
Yes, that’s true, all right. - God seems to have forgotten us.
#MRS. LANE.
God! It’s all a lie about God. I know. - This fall I sent Ethel to a white Sunday - school near us. She received the same treatment there she did in the day school. Her being there, nearly broke up the school. At the end, the superintendent called her to him and asked her if she didn’t know of some nice colored Sunday - school. He told her she must feel out of place, and uncomfortable there. That’s your Church of God!
#RACHEL.
Oh! how unspeakably brutal. Have you any other children?
#MRS. LANE.
Hardly! If I had another - I’d kill it. It’s kinder. Well, I must go, now. Thank you, for your information - and for listening. You aren’t married, are you?
#RACHEL.
No.
#MRS. LANE.
Don’t marry - that’s my advice. Come, Ethel. Say good - bye to the lady.
#ETHEL.
Good - bye. Dear little girl, won’t you let me kiss you good - bye? I love little girls. Oh! - no child - ever did - that to me - before!
#MRS. LANE.
Perhaps, when we move in here, the first of the month, things may be better. Thank you, again. Good - morning! You don’t belie your name.
#RACHEL.
Yes! - All right! Bring it up! Oh! John! John! - What are we to do? - I’m - I’m - afraid! Everywhere - it is the same thing. My mother! My little brother! Little, black, crushed Ethel! Oh! God! You who I have been taught to believe are so good, so beautiful how could - You permit - these - things? Dear little rosebuds - you - make me think - of sleeping, curled up, happy babies. Dear beautiful, little rosebuds! When - I look - at you - I believe - God is beautiful. He who can make a little exquisite thing like this, and this can’t be cruel. Oh! He can’t mean me - to give up - love - and the hope of little children. My Jimmy! It must be twelve o’clock. I didn’t dream it was so late. Oh! the world can’t be so bad. I don’t believe it. I won’t. I must forget that little girl. My little Jimmy is happy - and today John - sent me beautiful rosebuds. Oh, there are lovely things, yet.
#RACHEL.
Well, honey, how was school today?
#JIMMY.
All right, Ma Rachel. Oh! look at the pretty flowers. Why, Ma Rachel, you forgot to put them in water. They’ll die.
#RACHEL.
Well, so they will. Hop down this minute, and I’ll put them in right away. There, honey, that’s better, isn’t it? Aren’t they lovely?
#JIMMY.
Yes, that’s lots better. Now they won’t die, will they? Rosebuds are just like little “chilyun,” aren’t they, Ma Rachel? If you are good to them, they’ll grow up into lovely roses, won’t they? And if you hurt them, they’ll die. Ma Rachel do you think all peoples are kind to little rosebuds?
#RACHEL.
Why, of course. Who could hurt little children? Who would have the heart to do such a thing?
#JIMMY.
If you hurt them, it would be lots kinder, wouldn’t it, to kill them all at once, and not a little bit and a little bit?
#RACHEL.
Why, honey boy, why are you talking like this?
#JIMMY.
Ma Rachel, what is a “Nigger”?
#RACHEL.
Honey boy, why - why do you ask that?
#JIMMY.
Some big boys called me that when I came out of school just now. They said. “Look at the little nigger!” And they laughed. One of them runned, no ranned, after me and threw stones; and they all kept calling “Nigger! Nigger! Nigger!” One stone struck me hard in the back, and it hurt awful bad; but I didn’t cry, Ma Rachel. I wouldn’t let them make me cry. The stone hurts me there, Ma Rachel; but what they called me hurts and hurts here. What is a “Nigger,” Ma Rachel?
#RACHEL.
Why, honey boy, those boys didn’t mean anything. Silly, little, honey boy! They’re rough, that’s all. How could they mean anything?
#JIMMY.
You’re only saying that, Ma Rachel, so I won’t be hurt. I know. It wouldn’t ache here like it does - if they didn’t mean something.
#RACHEL.
Where’s Mary, honey?
#JIMMY.
She’s in her flat. She came in just after I did.
#RACHEL.
Well, honey, I’m going to give you two big cookies and two to take to Mary; and you may stay in there and play with her, till I get your lunch ready. Won’t that be jolly?
#JIMMY.
Why, you never give me but one at a time. You’ll give me two? - One? Two? Shoo! now, little honey boy. See how many laughs you can make for me, before I come after you. Hear? Have a good time, now.
#RACHEL.
Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here quickly, little chicken. First, it’s little, black Ethel - and then’s it’s Jimmy. Tomorrow, it will be some other little child. The blight - sooner or later - strikes all. My little Jimmy, only seven years old poisoned! And once I said, centuries ago, it must have been. “How can life be so terrible, when there are little children in the world?” Terrible! Terrible! That’s the reason it is so terrible. And, suddenly, some day, from out of the black, the blight shall descend, and shall still forever - the laughter on those little lips, and in those little hearts. And the loveliest thing - almost, that ever happened to me, that beautiful voice, in my dream, those beautiful words. “Rachel, you are to be the mother to little children.” Why, God, you were making a mock of me; you were laughing at me. I didn’t believe God could laugh at our sufferings, but He can. We are accursed, accursed! We have nothing, absolutely nothing. No, little rosebuds, I may not touch you. Dear, little, baby rosebuds, - I am accursed. You God! - You terrible, laughing God! Listen! I swear - and may my soul be damned to all eternity, if I do break this oath - I swear - that no child of mine shall ever lie upon my breast, for I will not have it rise up, in the terrible days that are to be - and call me cursed. Never to know the loveliest thing in all the world - the feel of a little head, the touch of little hands, the beautiful utter dependence - of a little child? You can laugh, Oh God! Well, so can I. But I can be kinder than You. If I kill, You Mighty God, I kill at once - I do not torture.
#TOM.
Well, who’s the giddy one in this family now?
#MRS. LOVING.
I don’t like it. It worries me. Rachel -
#TOM.
Have you found out, yet -
#MRS. LOVING.
Sh!
#MRS. LOVING.
Really, Rachel, Jimmy will be so excited he won’t be able to sleep. It’s after his bedtime, now. Don’t you think you had better stop?
#RACHEL.
All right, Ma dear. Come on, Jimmy; let’s play “Old Folks” and sit by the fire.
#TOM.
Thanks, Big Fellow, you are “sure some” strong. I’ll remember you when these people around here come for me to move pianos and such things around. Shake!
#JIMMY.
I am awful strong, am I not?
#TOM.
You “sure” are a Hercules. And see here! don’t ask me tonight who that was. I’ll tell you the first thing tomorrow morning. Hear?
#RACHEL.
Come on, honey boy, and sit in my lap.
#JIMMY.
I thought we were going to play “Old Folks.”
#RACHEL.
We are.
#JIMMY.
Do old folks sit in each other’s laps?
#RACHEL.
Old folks do anything. Come on.
#JIMMY.
Ma Rachel, don’t please! I like your hair like that. You’re - you’re pretty. I like to feel of it; and it smells like - like - oh! - like a barn.
#RACHEL.
My! how complimentary! I like that. Like a barn, indeed!
#JIMMY.
What’s “complimentry”?
#RACHEL.
Oh! saying nice things about me. That my hair is like a barn, for instance.
#JIMMY.
Well, that is “complimentary.” It smells like hay - like the hay in the barn you took me to, one day, last summer. ’Member?
#RACHEL.
Yes honey.
#JIMMY.
Ma Rachel!
#RACHEL.
Well?
#JIMMY.
Tell me a story, please. It’s “story - time,” now, isn’t it?
#RACHEL.
Well, let’s see. Once upon a time, there were two, dear, little boys, and they were all alone in the world. They lived with a cruel, old man and woman, who made them work hard, very hard - all day, and beat them when they did not move fast enough, and always, every night, before they went to bed. They slept in an attic on a rickety, narrow bed, that went screech! screech! whenever they moved. And, in summer, they nearly died with the heat up there, and in winter, with the cold. One wintry night, when they were both weeping very bitterly after a particularly hard beating, they suddenly heard a pleasant voice saying. “Why are you crying, little boys?” They looked up, and there, in the moonlight, by their bed, was the dearest, little old lady. She was dressed all in gray, from the peak of her little pointed hat to her little, buckled shoes. She held a black cane much taller than her little self. Her hair fell about her ears in tiny, grey corkscrew curls, and they bobbed about as she moved. Her eyes were black and bright - as bright as - well, as that lovely, white light there. No, there! And her cheeks were as red as the apple I gave you yesterday. Do you remember?
#JIMMY.
Yes.
#RACHEL.
“Why are you crying, little boys?” she asked again, in a lovely, low, little voice. “Because we are tired and sore and hungry and cold; and we are all alone in the world; and we don’t know how to laugh any more. We should so like to laugh again.” “Why, that’s easy,” she said, “it’s just like this.” And she laughed a little, joyous, musical laugh. “Try!” she commanded. They tried, but their laughing boxes were very rusty, and they made horrid sounds. “Well,” she said, “I advise you to pack up, and go away, as soon as you can, to the Land of Laughter. You’ll soon learn there, I can tell you.” “Is there such a land?” they asked doubtfully. “To be sure there is,” she answered the least bit sharply. “We never heard of it,” they said. “Well, I’m sure there must be plenty of things you never heard about,” she said just the “leastest” bit more sharply. “In a moment you’ll be telling me flowers don’t talk together, and the birds.” “We never heard of such a thing,” they said in surprise, their eyes like saucers. “There!” she said, bobbing her little curls. “What did I tell you? You have much to learn.” “How do you get to the Land of Laughter?” they asked. “You go out of the eastern gate of the town, just as the sun is rising; and you take the highway there, and follow it; and if you go with it long enough, it will bring you to the very gates of the Land of Laughter. It’s a long, long way from here; and it will take you many days.” The words had scarcely left her mouth, when, lo! the little lady disappeared, and where she had stood was the white square of moonlight - nothing else. And without more ado these two little boys put their arms around each other and fell fast asleep. And in the grey, just before daybreak, they awoke and dressed; and, putting on their ragged caps and mittens, for it was a wintry day, they stole out of the house and made for the eastern gate. And just as they reached it, and passed through, the whole east leapt into fire. All day they walked, and many days thereafter, and kindly people, by the way, took them in and gave them food and drink and sometimes a bed at night. Often they slept by the roadside, but they didn’t mind that for the climate was delightful - not too hot, and not too cold. They soon threw away their ragged little mittens. They walked for many days, and there was no Land of Laughter. Once they met an old man, richly dressed, with shining jewels on his fingers, and he stopped them and asked. “Where are you going so fast, little boys?” “We are going to the Land of Laughter,” they said together gravely. “That,” said the old man, “is a very foolish thing to do. Come with me, and I will take you to the Land of Riches. I will cover you with garments of beauty, and give you jewels and a castle to live in and servants and horses and many things besides.” And they said to him. “No, we wish to learn how to laugh again; we have forgotten how, and we are going to the Land of Laughter.” “You will regret not going with me. See, if you don’t,” he said; and he left them in quite a huff. And they walked again, many days, and again they met an old man. He was tall and imposing - looking and very dignified. And he said. “Where are you going so fast, little boys?” “We are going to the Land of Laughter,” they said together very seriously. “What!” he said, “that is an extremely foolish thing to do. Come with me, and I will give you power. I will make you great men. generals, kings, emperors, Whatever you desire to accomplish will be permitted you.” And they smiled politely. “Thank you very much, but we have forgotten how to laugh, and we are going there to learn how.” He looked upon them haughtily, without speaking, and disappeared. And they walked and walked more days; and they met another old man. And he was clad in rags, and his face was thin, and his eyes were unhappy. And he whispered to them. “Where are you going so fast, little boys?” “We are going to the Land of Laughter,” they answered, without a smile. “Laughter! Laughter! that is useless. Come with me and I will show you the beauty of life through sacrifice, suffering for others. That is the only life. I come from the Land of Sacrifice.” And they thanked him kindly, but said. “We have suffered long enough. We have forgotten how to laugh. We would learn again.” And they went on; and he looked after them very wistfully. They walked more days, and at last they came to the Land of Laughter. And how do you suppose they knew this? Because they could hear, over the wall, the sound of joyous laughter, - the laughter of men, women, and children. And one sat guarding the gate, and they went to her. “We have come a long, long distance; and we would enter the Land of Laughter.” “Let me see you smile, first,” she said gently. “I sit at the gate; and no one who does not know how to smile may enter the Land of Laughter.” And they tried to smile, but could not. “Go away and practice,” she said kindly, “and come back tomorrow.” And they went away, and practiced all night how to smile; and in the morning they returned, and the gentle lady at the gate said. “Dear little boys, have you learned how to smile?” And they said. “We have tried. How is this?” “Better,” she said, “much better. Practice some more, and come back tomorrow.” And they went away obediently and practiced, And they came the third day. And she said. “Now try again.” And tears of delight came into her lovely eyes. “Those were very beautiful smiles,” she said. “Now, you may enter.” And she unlocked the gate, and kissed them both, and they entered the Land - the beautiful Land of Laughter. Never had they seen such blue skies, such green trees and grass; never had they heard such birds songs. And people, men, women and children, laughing softly, came to meet them, and took them in, and made them as home; and soon, very soon, they learned to sleep. And they grew up here, and married, and had laughing, happy children. And sometimes they thought of the Land of Riches, and said. “Ah! well!” and sometimes of the Land of Power, and sighed a little; and sometimes of the Land of Sacrifice - and their eyes were wistful. But they soon forgot, and laughed again. And they grew old, laughing. And then when they died - a laugh was on their lips. Thus are things in the beautiful Land of Laughter.
#JIMMY.
I like that story, Ma Rachel. It’s nice to laugh, isn’t is? Is there such a land?
#RACHEL.
What do you think, honey?
#JIMMY.
I thinks it would be awful nice if there was. Don’t you?
#RACHEL.
If there only were! If there only were!
#JIMMY.
Ma Rachel.
#RACHEL.
Well?
#JIMMY.
It makes you think - kind of - doesn’t it - of sunshine medicine?
#RACHEL.
Yes, honey, - but it isn’t medicine there. It’s always there - just like - well - like our air here. It’s always sunshine there.
#JIMMY.
Always sunshine? Never any dark?
#RACHEL.
No, honey.
#JIMMY.
You’d - never - be - afraid there, then, would you? Never afraid of nothing?
#RACHEL.
No, honey.
#JIMMY.
Oh! - Oh! I wisht it was here - not there. Why, Ma Rachel dear, you’re crying. Your face is all wet. Why! Don’t cry! Don’t cry!
#RACHEL.
Do you remember that I told you the lady at the gate had tears of joy in her eyes, when the two, dear, little boys smiled that beautiful smile?
#JIMMY.
Yes.
#RACHEL.
Well, these are tears of joy, honey, that’s all - tears of joy.
#JIMMY.
It must be awful queer to have tears of joy, ’cause you’re happy. I never did. But, if you say they are, dear Ma Rachel, they must be. You knows everything, don’t you?
#RACHEL.
Some things, honey, some things.
#JIMMY.
This is the beautiful - est night I ever knew. If you would do just one more thing, it would be lots more beautiful. Will you, Ma Rachel?
#RACHEL.
Well, what, honey?
#JIMMY.
Will you sing - at the piano, I mean, it’s lots prettier that way - the little song you used to rock me to sleep by? You know, the one about the “Slumber Boat”?
#RACHEL.
Oh! honey, not tonight. You’re too tired. It’s bedtime now.
#JIMMY.
Please! Ma Rachel, please! pretty please!
#RACHEL.
Well, honey boy, this once, then. Tonight, you shall have the little song - I used to sing you to sleep by perhaps, for the last time.
#JIMMY.
Why, Ma Rachel, why the last time?
#RACHEL.
The last time. .
#RACHEL.
Well, honey, how did you like it?
#JIMMY.
It was lovely, Ma Rachel. Now, Ma Rachel, I’m just beautifully sleepy. I think that p’r’aps I’ll go to the Land of Laughter tonight in my dreams. I’ll go in the “Slumber Boat” and come back in the morning and tell you all about it. Shall
#RACHEL.
Yes, honey.
#TOM.
Rachel! I nearly forgot. John is coming here tonight to see how you are. He told me to tell you so.
#RACHEL.
Very well. Thank you. Jimmy! honey! don’t go tonight. Don’t go without Ma Rachel. Wait for me, honey. I do so wish to go, too, to the Land of Laughter. Think of it, Jimmy; nothing but birds always singing, and flowers always blooming, and skies always blue - and people, all of them, always laughing, laughing. You’ll wait for Ma Rachel, won’t you, honey?
#JIMMY.
Is there really and truly, Ma Rachel, a Land of Laughter?
#RACHEL.
Oh! Jimmy, let’s hope so; let’s pray so.
#JIMMY.
I’ve been thinking - You have to smile at the gate, don’t you, to get in?
#RACHEL.
Yes, honey.
#JIMMY.
Well, I guess I couldn’t smile if my Ma Rachel wasn’t somewhere close to me. So I couldn’t get in after all, could I? Tonight, I’ll go somewhere else, and tell you all about it. And then, some day, we’ll go together, won’t we?
#RACHEL.
Yes, honey, some day - some day. Well, this isn’t going to “sleepy - sleep,” is it? Go, now, and say good - night to Ma Loving and Uncle Tom.
#JIMMY.
Sweet dreams! God keep you all the night!
#MRS. LOVING.
The sweetest of sweet dreams to you, dear little boy! Good - night!
#JIMMY.
Uncle Tom! My! how you frightened me. You’ll put my gizzard out of commission, if you do that often. Well, sir, what can I do for you?
#JIMMY.
I came to say good - night.
#TOM.
Good - night, dear little Big Fellow! Good - night!
#JIMMY.
Sweet dreams! God keep you all the night! I’m ready, Ma Rachel. I’m so nice and sleepy.
#RACHEL.
Why, Tom, what a pretty tie! Is it new?
#TOM.
Well, no, not exactly. I’ve had it about a month. It is rather a beauty, isn’t it?
#RACHEL.
Why, I never remember seeing it.
#TOM.
I guess not. I saw to that.
#RACHEL.
Stingy!
#TOM.
Well, I am - where my ties are concerned. I’ve had experience.
#RACHEL.
Tom!
#TOM.
Well?
#RACHEL.
Are you - will you - I mean, won’t you be home this evening?
#TOM.
You’ve got a long memory, Sis. I’ve that engagement, you know. Why?
#RACHEL.
I forgot; so you have.
#TOM.
Why?
#RACHEL.
Oh! nothing - nothing. Come on, Jimmy boy, you can hardly keep those little peepers open, can you? Come on, honey.
#MRS. LOVING.
I try to make out what could have happened; but it’s no use - I can’t. Those four days, she lay in bed hardly moving, scarcely speaking. Only her eyes seemed alive. I never saw such a wide, tragic look in my life. It was as though her soul had been mortally wounded. But how? how? What could have happened?
#TOM.
I don’t know. She generally tells me everything; but she avoids me now. If we are alone in a room - she gets out. I don’t know what it means.
#MRS. LOVING.
She will hardly let Jimmy out of her sight. While he’s at school, she’s nervous and excited. She seems always to be listening, but for what? When he returns, she nearly devours him. And she always asks him in a frightened sort of way, her face as pale and tense as can be. “Well, honey boy, how was school today?” And he always answers, “Fine, Ma Rachel, fine! I learned - ”; and then he goes on to tell her everything that has happened. And when he has finished, she says in an uneasy sort of way. “Is - is that all?” And when he says “Yes,” she relaxes and becomes limp. After a little while she becomes feverishly happy. She plays with Jimmy and the children more than ever she did - and she played a good deal, as you know. They’re here, or she’s with them. Yesterday, I said in remonstrance, when she came in, her face pale and haggard and black hollows under her eyes. “Rachel, remember you’re just out of a sick - bed. You’re not well enough to go on like this.” “I know,” was all she would say, “but I’ve got to. I can’t help myself. This part of their little lives must be happy - it just must be.” The last couple of nights, Jimmy has awakened and cried most pitifully. She wouldn’t let me go to him; said I had enough trouble, and she could quiet him. She never will let me know why he cries; but she stays with him, and soothes him until, at last, he falls asleep again. Every time she has come out like a rag; and her face is like a dead woman’s. Strange isn’t it, this is the first time we have ever been able to talk it over? Tom, what could have happened?
#TOM.
I don’t know, Ma, but I feel, as you do; something terrible and sudden has hurt her soul; and, poor little thing, she’s trying bravely to readjust herself to life again. Well, Ma, I’m going now. Don’t worry too much. Youth, you know, gets over things finally. It takes them hard, that’s all - At least, that’s what the older heads tell us. Ma, you know, I begin with John tomorrow. I don’t believe we’ll ever forget John. Good - night!
#RACHEL.
He’s sleeping like a top. Aren’t little children, Ma dear, the sweetest things, when they’re all helpless and asleep? One little hand is under his cheek; and he’s smiling. Where’s Tom?
#MRS. LOVING.
He went out a few minutes ago.
#RACHEL.
Ma, - you - you - aren’t going anywhere tonight, are you?
#MRS. LOVING.
I’ve got to go out for a short time about half - past eight. Mrs. Jordan, you know. I’ll not be gone very long, though. Why?
#RACHEL.
Oh! nothing particular. I just thought it would be cosy if we could sit here together the rest of the evening. Can’t you - can’t you go tomorrow?
#MRS. LOVING.
Why, I don’t see how I can. I’ve made the engagement. It’s about a new reception gown; and she’s exceedingly exacting, as you know. I can’t afford to lose her.
#RACHEL.
No, I suppose not. All right, Ma dear. Look! Ma dear! How is that for fashion, anyway? Isn’t it the “limit”? Oh!
#MRS. LOVING.
Rachel, your nerves are right on edge; and your hand feels like fire. I’ll have to see a doctor about you; and that’s all there is to it.
#RACHEL.
Nonsense, Ma dear! Just because I let out a whoop now and then, and have nice warm hands? Yes! Oh! bring it right up! Ma dear, did you buy anything at Goddard’s today?
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes; and I’ve been wondering why they were so late in delivering it. I bought it early this morning.
#MRS. LOVING.
Put it on my bed, Rachel, please.
#RACHEL.
My kiddies! They’re late, this evening. Why so late, kiddies? It’s long past “sleepy - time.”
#LITTLE NANCY.
We’ve been playing “Hide and Seek,” and having the mostest fun. We promised, all of us, that if we could play until half - past seven tonight we wouldn’t make any fuss about going to bed at seven o’clock the rest of the week. It’s awful hard to go. I hate to go to bed! MARY, LOUISE and EDITH. So do I! So do I! So do I!
#LITTLE MARTHA.
I don’t. I love bed. My bed, after my muzzer tucks me all in, is like a nice warm bag. I just stick my nose out. When I lifts my head up I can see the light from the dining - room come in the door. I can hear my muzzer and fazzer talking nice and low; and then, before I know it, I’m fast asleep, and I dream pretty things, and in about a minute it’s morning again. I love my little bed, and I love to dream.
#LITTLE MARY.
Well, I guess I love to dream too. I wish I could dream, though, without going to bed.
#LITTLE NANCY.
When I grow up, I’m never going to bed at night! You see.
#LITTLE LOUISE.
“Grown - ups” just love to poke their heads out of windows and cry, “Child’run, it’s time for bed now; and you’d better hurry, too, I can tell you.” They “sure” are queer, for sometimes when I wake up, it must be about twelve o’clock, I can hear my big sister giggling and talking to some silly man. If it’s good for me to go to bed early - I should think -
#RACHEL.
Why, where is my little Jenny? Excuse me, Louise dear.
#LITTLE MARTHA.
Her cold is awful bad. She coughs like this and snuffles all the time. She can’t talk out loud, and she can’t go to sleep. Muzzer says she’s fev’rish - I thinks that’s what she says. Jenny says she knows she could go to sleep, if you would come and sit with her a little while.
#RACHEL.
I certainly will. I’ll go when you do, honey.
#LITTLE MARTHA.
You’re the very nicest “grown - up”, except my muzzer, of course, I ever knew. You knows all about little chil’run and you can be one, although you’re all grown up. I think you would make a lovely muzzer. Don’t you?
#ALL.
Yes, I do.
#RACHEL.
Come, kiddies, you must go now, or your mothers will blame me for keeping you. Ma dear, I’m going down to sit a little while with Jenny. I’ll be back before you go, though. Come, kiddies, say good - night to my mother.
#ALL.
Good - night! Sweet dreams! God keep you all the night.
#MRS. LOVING.
Good - night dears! Sweet dreams, all! Mrs. Loving continues to sew. The bell presently rings three distinct times. In a few moments, Mrs. Loving gets up and goes out into the vestibule. A door opens and closes. Mrs. Loving and John Strong come in. He is a trifle pale but his imperturbable self. Mrs. Loving, somewhat nervous, takes her seat and resumes her sewing. She motions Strong to a chair. He returns to the vestibule, leaves his hat, returns, and sits down).
#STRONG.
Well, how is everything?
#MRS. LOVING.
Oh! about the same, I guess. Tom’s out. John, we’ll never forget you - and your kindness.
#STRONG.
That was nothing. And Rachel?
#MRS. LOVING.
She’ll be back presently. She went to sit with a sick child for a little while.
#STRONG.
And how is she?
#MRS. LOVING.
She’s not herself yet, but I think she is better.
#STRONG.
Well, what did happen - exactly?
#MRS. LOVING.
That’s just what I don’t know.
#STRONG.
When you came home - you couldn’t get in - was that it?
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes. It was just a week ago today. I was down town all the morning. It was about one o’clock when I got back. I had forgotten my key. I rapped on the door and then called. There was no answer. A window was open, and I could feel the air under the door, and I could hear it as the draught sucked it through. There was no other sound. Presently I made such a noise the people began to come out into the hall. Jimmy was in one of the flats playing with a little girl named Mary. He told me he had left Rachel here a short time before. She had given him four cookies, two for him and two for Mary, and had told him he could play with her until she came to tell him his lunch was ready. I saw he was getting frightened, so I got the little girl and her mother to keep him in their flat. Then, as no man was at home, I sent out for help. Three men broke the door down. We found Rachel unconscious, lying on her face. For a few minutes I thought she was dead. A vase had fallen over on the table and the water had dripped through the cloth and onto the floor. There had been flowers in it. When I left, there were no flowers here. What she could have done to them, I can’t say. The long stems were lying everywhere, and the flowers had been ground into the floor. I could tell that they must have been roses from the stems. After we had put her to bed and called the doctor, and she had finally regained consciousness, I very naturally asked her what had happened. All she would say was, “Ma dear, I’m too - tired - please.” For four days she lay in bed scarcely moving, speaking only when spoken to. That first day, when Jimmy came in to see her, she shrank away from him. We had to take him out, and comfort him as best we could. We kept him away, almost by force, until she got up. And, then, she was utterly miserable when he was out of her sight. What happened, I don’t know. She avoids Tom, and she won’t tell me. Tom and I both believe her soul has been hurt. The trouble isn’t with her body. You’ll find her highly nervous. Sometimes she is very much depressed; again she is feverishly gay - almost reckless. What do you think about it, John?
#STRONG.
Had anybody been here, do you know?
#MRS. LOVING.
No, I don’t. I don’t like to ask Rachel; and I can’t ask the neighbors.
#STRONG.
No, of course not. You say there were some flowers?
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes.
#STRONG.
And the flowers were ground into the carpet?
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes.
#STRONG.
Did you happen to notice the box? They must have come in a box, don’t you think?
#MRS. LOVING.
Yes, there was a box in the kitchenette. It was from “Marcy’s.” I saw no card.
#STRONG.
It is rather strange.
#RACHEL.
Hello! John. I thought that was your hat in the hall. It’s brand new, I know - but it looks - “Johnlike.” How are you? Ma! Jenny went to sleep like a little lamb. I don’t like her breathing, though. Who’s dead?
#MRS. LOVING.
Dead, Rachel?
#RACHEL.
Yes. The atmosphere here is so funereal, - it’s positively “crapey.”
#STRONG.
I don’t know why it should be - I was just asking how you are.
#RACHEL.
Heavens! Does the mere inquiry into my health precipitate such an atmosphere? Your two faces were as long, as long - Kind sir, let me assure you, I am in the very best of health. And how are you, John?
#STRONG.
Oh! I’m always well.
#MRS. LOVING.
Rachel, I’ll have to get ready to go now. John, don’t hurry. I’ll be back shortly, probably in three - quarters of an hour - maybe less.
#RACHEL.
And maybe more, if I remember Mrs. Jordan. However, Ma dear, I’ll do the best I can - while you are away. I’ll try to be a credit to your training. Now, let’s see - in the books of etiquette, I believe, the properly reared young lady, always asks the young gentleman caller - you’re young enough, aren’t you, to be classed still as a “young gentleman caller?” Well, anyway, she always asks the young gentleman caller sweetly something about the weather. This has been an exceedingly beautiful day, hasn’t it, Mr. Strong? Well, really, every properly brought up young gentleman, I’m sure, ought to know, that it’s exceedingly rude not to answer a civil question.
#STRONG.
Tell me what to answer, Rachel.
#RACHEL.
Say, “Yes, Very”; and look interested and pleased when you say it.
#STRONG.
Yes, very.
#RACHEL.
Well, I certainly wouldn’t characterize that as a particularly animated remark. Besides, when you look at me through half - closed lids like that - and kind of smile - what are you thinking? John Strong, are you deaf or - just plain stupid?
#STRONG.
Plain stupid, I guess.
#RACHEL.
What were you thinking, John?
#STRONG.
I was thinking -
#RACHEL.
Well?
#STRONG.
I’ve changed my mind.
#RACHEL.
You’re not going to tell me?
#STRONG.
No.
#MRS. LOVING.
Goodbye, children. Rachel, don’t quarrel so much with John. Let me see - if I have my key. Yes, I have it. I’ll be back shortly. Good - bye.
#RACHEL.
Good - bye, Ma dear. Hurry back as soon as you can, won’t you?
#STRONG.
Do you mind, if I smoke?
#RACHEL.
You know I don’t.
#STRONG.
I am trying to behave like - Reginald - “the properly reared young gentleman caller.” Thank you. Now this is what I call cosy.
#RACHEL.
Cosy! Why? nice warm room - shut in - curtains drawn - a cheerful fire crackling at my back - a lamp, not an electric or gas one, but one of your plain, old - fashioned kerosene ones -
#RACHEL.
Ma dear would like to catch you, I am sure, talking about her lamp like that. “Old - fashioned! plain!” - You have nerve.
#STRONG.
A comfortable chair - a good cigar - and not very far away, a little lady, who is looking charming, so near, that if I reached over, I could touch her. You there - and I here. - It’s living.
#RACHEL.
Well! of all things! A compliment - and from you! How did it slip out, pray? I suppose that you realize that a conversation between two persons is absolutely impossible, if one has to do her share all alone. Soon my ingenuity for introducing interesting subjects will be exhausted; and then will follow what, I believe, the story books call, “an uncomfortable silence.”
#STRONG.
Silence - between friends - isn’t such a bad thing.
#RACHEL.
Thanks awfully.
#STRONG.
Rachel! You must remember I’m here. I don’t like looking into your soul - when you forget you’re not alone.
#RACHEL.
I hadn’t forgotten.
#STRONG.
Wouldn’t it be easier for you, little girl, if you could tell - some one?
#RACHEL.
No.
#STRONG.
Rachel, - you’re fond of flowers, - aren’t you?
#RACHEL.
Yes.
#STRONG.
Rosebuds - red rosebuds - particularly?
#RACHEL.
Yes.
#STRONG.
Did you - dislike - the giver?
#RACHEL.
No, of course not.
#STRONG.
Rachel, - why - why - did you - kill the roses - then?
#RACHEL.
Oh, John! I’m so sorry, Ma dear told you that. She didn’t know, you sent them.
#STRONG.
So I gathered. Rachel, little girl, why - did you kill them?
#RACHEL.
Don’t you believe - it - a - a - kindness - sometimes - to kill?
#STRONG.
You - considered - it - a - kindness - to kill them?
#RACHEL.
Yes.
#STRONG.
Do you mean - just - the roses?
#RACHEL.
John! - Oh! must I say?
#STRONG.
Yes, little Rachel.
#RACHEL.
No.
#STRONG.
Little girl, little girl, can’t you tell me why?
#RACHEL.
I can’t. - It hurts - too much - to talk about it yet, - please.
#STRONG.
You - don’t - care, then? Rachel! - Look at me, little girl! Do you?
#RACHEL.
John! John! don’t ask me. You are drawing my very soul out of my body with your eyes. You must not talk this way. You mustn’t look - John, don’t!
#STRONG.
If - you - do - care, and I know now - that you do - nothing else, nothing should count.
#RACHEL.
No! No! No! - You must stop. I’m not behaving very well as a hostess, am I? Let’s see. What shall I do? I’ll play you something, John. How will that do? Or I’ll sing to you. You used to like to hear me sing; you said my voice, I remember, was sympathetic, didn’t you? I’ll sing you a pretty little song. I think it’s beautiful. You’ve never heard it, I know. I’ve never sung it to you before. It’s Nevin’s “At Twilight.” Sometimes - in the coming years - I want - you to remember - I sang you this little song. - Will you? - I think it will make it easier for me - when I - when I - .
#STRONG.
Little girl, little girl, don’t you know that suggestions - suggestions - like those you are sending yourself constantly - are wicked things? You, who are so gentle, so loving, so warm - Little girl - don’t laugh - like that.
#RACHEL.
I have to. - God is laughing. - We’re his puppets. - He pulls the wires, - and we’re so funny to Him. - I’m laughing too - because I can hear - my little children - weeping. They come to me generally while I’m asleep, - but I can hear them now. - They’ve begged me - do you understand? - begged me - not to bring them here; - and I’ve promised them - not to. - I’ve promised. I can’t stand the sound of their crying. - I have to laugh - Oh! John! laugh! - laugh too! - I can’t drown their weeping.
#STRONG.
Now, stop that!
#RACHEL.
W - h - a - t?
#STRONG.
Stop that! - You’ve lost your self - control. - find yourself again!
#STRONG.
Rachel! - There is a little flat on 43rd Street. It faces south and overlooks a little park. Do you remember it? - it’s on the top floor? - Once I remember your saying - you liked it. That was over a year ago. That same day - I rented it. I’ve never lived there. No one knows about it - not even my mother. It’s completely furnished now - and waiting - do you know for whom? Every single thing in it, I’ve bought myself - even to the pins on the little bird’s - eye maple dresser. It has been the happiest year I have ever known. I furnished it - one room at a time. It’s the prettiest, the most homelike little flat I’ve ever seen. Everything there - breathes love. Do you know for whom it is waiting? On the sitting - room floor is a beautiful, Turkish rug - red, and blue and gold. It’s soft - and rich - and do you know for whose little feet it is waiting? There are delicate curtains at the windows and a bookcase full of friendly, eager, little books. - Do you know for whom they are waiting? There are comfortable leather chairs, just the right size, and a beautiful piano - that I leave open - sometimes, and lovely pictures of Madonnas. Do you know for whom they are waiting? There is an open fireplace with logs of wood, all carefully piled on gleaming andirons - and waiting. There is a bellows and a pair of shining tongs - waiting. And in the kitchenette painted blue and white, and smelling sweet with paint is everything. bright pots and pans and kettles, and blue and white enamel - ware, and all kinds of knives and forks and spoons - and on the door - a roller - towel. Little girl, do you know for whom they are all waiting? And somewhere - there’s a big, strong man - with broad shoulders. And he’s willing and anxious to do anything - everything, and he’s waiting very patiently. Little girl, is it to be - yes or no?
#RACHEL.
Oh! you’re too good to me and mine, John. I - didn’t dream any one - could be - so good. Strong Is it - yes - or no, little girl?
#RACHEL.
Oh, yes! yes! yes! and take me quickly, John. Take me before I can think any more. You mustn’t let me think, John. And you’ll be good to me, won’t you? Every second of every minute, of every hour, of every day, you’ll have me in your thoughts, won’t you? And you’ll be with me every minute that you can? And, John, John! - you’ll keep away the weeping of my little children. You won’t let me hear it, will you? You’ll make me forget everything - everything - won’t you? - Life is so short, John. And eternity so - long. And, John, after I am dead - promise me, promise me you’ll love me more. I’ll need love then. Oh! I’ll need it. Oh! John! - Listen! - It’s my boy, again. - I - John - I’ll be back in a little while.
#RACHEL.
Do you wish to know why Jimmy is crying?
#STRONG.
Yes.
#RACHEL.
I am twenty - two - and I’m old; you’re thirty - two - and you’re old; Tom’s twenty - three - and he is old. Ma dear’s sixty - and she said once she is much older than that. She is. We are all blighted; we are all accursed - all of us - , everywhere, we whose skins are dark - our lives blasted by the white man’s prejudice. And my little Jimmy - seven years old, that’s all - is blighted too. In a year or two, at best, he will be made old by suffering. One week ago, today, some white boys, older and larger than my little Jimmy, as he was leaving the school - called him “Nigger”! They chased him through the streets calling him, “Nigger! Nigger! Nigger!” One boy threw stones at him. There is still a bruise on his little back where one struck him. That will get well; but they bruised his soul - and that - will never - get well. He asked me what “Nigger” meant. I made light of the whole thing, laughed it off. He went to his little playmates, and very naturally asked them. The oldest of them is nine! - and they knew, poor little things - and they told him. For the last couple of nights he has been dreaming - about these boys. And he always awakes - in the dark - afraid - afraid - of the now - and the future - I have seen that look of deadly fear - in the eyes - of other little children. I know what it is myself. - I was twelve - when some big boys chased me and called me names. - I never left the house afterwards - without being afraid. I was afraid, in the streets - in the school - in the church, everywhere, always, afraid of being hurt. And I - was not - afraid in vain. He’s only a baby - and he’s blighted. Honey, I’m right here. I’m coming in just a minute. Don’t cry. If it nearly kills me to hear my Jimmy’s crying, do you think I could stand it, when my own child, flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood - learned the same reason for weeping? Do you? Ever since I fell here - a week ago - I am afraid - to go - to sleep, for every time I do - my children come - and beg me - weeping - not to - bring them here - to suffer. Tonight, they came - when I was awake. I have promised them again, now - by Jimmy’s bed. I have damned - my soul to all eternity - if I do. Honey, don’t! I’m coming. And John, - dear John - you see - it can never be - all the beautiful, beautiful things - you have - told me about. No - they - can never be - now. No, - John dear, - you - must not - touch me - any more. Dear, this - is - “Good - bye.”
#STRONG.
It’s not fair - to you, Rachel, to take you - at your word - tonight. You’re sick; you’ve brooded so long, so continuously, - you’ve lost - your perspective. Don’t answer, yet. Think it over for another week and I’ll come back.
#RACHEL.
No, - I can’t think - any more.
#STRONG.
You realize - fully - you’re sending me - for always?
#RACHEL.
Yes.
#STRONG.
And you care?
#RACHEL.
Yes.
#STRONG.
It’s settled, then for all time - “Good - bye!”
#RACHEL.
Yes.
#STRONG.
Good - bye, dear, little Rachel - God bless you.
#RACHEL.
Good - bye, John! John! John! No! No! John. Not for us. Oh! John, - if it only - if it only - No - No sunshine - no laughter - always, always - darkness. That is it. Even our little flat - John’s and mine - the little flat - that calls, calls us - through darkness. It shall wait - and wait - in vain - in darkness. Oh, John! And my little children! my little children! I shall never - see - you - now. Your little, brown, beautiful bodies - I shall never see. - Your dimples - everywhere - your laughter - your tears - the beautiful, lovely feel of you here. Never - never - to be. But you are somewhere - and wherever you are you are mine! You are mine! All of you! Every bit of you! Even God can’t take you away. Little children! - My little children! - No more need you come to me - weeping - weeping. You may be happy now - you are safe. Little weeping, voices, hush! hush! Jimmy! My little Jimmy! Honey! I’m coming. - Ma Rachel loves you so.
