#POET.
Oh…
#ACTRESS.
What’s the matter?
#POET.
The candle.—But we don’t need any. Look, how light it is. Wonderful!
#POET.
What’s the matter with you?
#POET.
What are you doing?
#ACTRESS.
Can’t you see that I am praying?—
#POET.
Do you believe in God?
#ACTRESS.
Of course I do; I am not a fool.
#POET.
Oh, I see!
#ACTRESS.
Come, kneel down beside me. It will do you good to pray just once. None of the gems will drop out of your crown.
#ACTRESS.
Libertine!—. And do you know to whom I prayed?
#POET.
To God, I suppose.
#ACTRESS.
Oh, of course! It was to you to whom I prayed.
#POET.
Then why did you look out of the window?
#ACTRESS.
Tell me rather where you have lured me.
#POET.
But, child, it was your idea. You wanted to go to the country—and picked out this very place.
#ACTRESS.
Well, wasn’t I right?
#POET.
Certainly. It’s charming here. When you consider that we are just two hours from Vienna—complete solitude. And delightful scenery!
#ACTRESS.
Isn’t it? If you had any real talent, this place might inspire you to write.
#POET.
Have you been here before?
#ACTRESS.
Have I been here before? Indeed I have! I have lived here for years.
#POET.
With whom?
#ACTRESS.
With Dick, of course.
#POET.
Oh, really!
#ACTRESS.
How I adored that man!—
#POET.
You’ve told me all about that already.
#ACTRESS.
I am sorry—I can go away again, if I bore you!
#POET.
You bore me?… You can’t imagine what you mean to me… You are a whole world in itself… You are divine, you are a genius… You are the simplicity which is holy… Yes, you… But you oughtn’t to talk about Dick now.
#ACTRESS.
That was merely a slip! Well!—
#POET.
I am glad that you feel that way.
#ACTRESS.
Come, give me a kiss!
#ACTRESS.
But now we had better say good night. Good night, darling!
#POET.
What do you mean by that?
#ACTRESS.
I mean, I am going to lie down and go to sleep.
#POET.
Yes,—that’s very well, but when it comes to saying “good night” … where do I sleep?
#ACTRESS.
There are surely a lot of other rooms in this house.
#POET.
But they don’t appeal to me. Don’t you think I had better light a candle now?
#ACTRESS.
Yes.
#POET.
What a charming room … and what pious people they must be. Pictures of saints everywhere… It would be interesting to spend some time among people like this … quite another world. How little we know of the lives of others!
#ACTRESS.
Don’t talk nonsense, but just give me the bag from the table.
#POET.
Here, beloved!
#POET.
What’s that?
#ACTRESS.
That’s the Virgin.
#POET.
Do you always carry her around with you?
#ACTRESS.
She is my talisman. And now go, Robert!
#POET.
You are joking? Can’t I help you?
#ACTRESS.
No, you must go now.
#POET.
And when may I return?
#ACTRESS.
In ten minutes.
#POET.
Au revoir!
#ACTRESS.
Where will you go?
#POET.
I shall walk up and down under your window. I love to wander about outdoors at night time. My finest inspirations come to me that way. And especially near you, under the breath of your longing, I might call it … entwined in your art.
#ACTRESS.
You talk like an idiot…
#POET.
There are women who might say … like a poet.
#ACTRESS.
Oh, well, but do go now. But don’t start to flirt with the waitress.—
#ACTRESS.
Come!
#ACTRESS.
So, now you may sit down beside me, and tell me a story.
#POET.
Hadn’t I better close the window? Isn’t it too cold for you?
#ACTRESS.
Oh, no!
#POET.
Now, what shall I tell you?
#ACTRESS.
Tell me to whom you are unfaithful at this moment?
#POET.
I’m sorry, I’m not unfaithful yet.
#ACTRESS.
Well, if it’s any satisfaction to you, I am unfaithful to some one too.
#POET.
So I can imagine.
#ACTRESS.
And who do you suppose it is?
#POET.
But, child, how do you expect me to know?
#ACTRESS.
Guess, then.
#POET.
Wait … your manager.
#ACTRESS.
My dear man, I’m not a chorus - girl.
#POET.
Well, I am only guessing.
#ACTRESS.
Guess again.
#POET.
Then it’s your leading - man … Benno—
#ACTRESS.
Nonsense! He doesn’t care for women at all … didn’t you know that? He carries on with his postman!
#POET.
No, really!—
#ACTRESS.
Now come, kiss me.
#ACTRESS.
But what are you doing?
#POET.
Why do you torment me so?
#ACTRESS.
Listen, Robert, I have a suggestion to make to you. Come lie down in bed with me.
#POET.
I accept.
#ACTRESS.
Come quickly, come quickly!
#POET.
Yes … if I had had my way, I would have been there long ago… Listen…
#ACTRESS.
What?
#POET.
The crickets are chirping outside.
#ACTRESS.
You are crazy, child, there are no crickets here.
#POET.
But surely you hear them.
#ACTRESS.
Hurry up.
#POET.
Here I am.
#ACTRESS.
Now lie quite still… Sh … don’t move…
#POET.
Yes, but why?
#ACTRESS.
You would rather like to have an affair with me?
#POET.
I should think that’s obvious by now.
#ACTRESS.
There are many who would like that…
#POET.
But it would seem that at the moment the odds are on my side…
#ACTRESS.
Then, come, my cricket! I shall call you “cricket” from now on.
#POET.
All right…
#ACTRESS.
Now, tell me, whom am I deceiving?
#POET.
Whom?… Perhaps me…
#ACTRESS.
Child, you have softening of the brain.
#POET.
Or some one … some one whom you have never seen … some one, whom you don’t even know, some one—who is predestined for you and whom you will never find…
#ACTRESS.
Please don’t talk such magnificent nonsense.
#POET.
… Isn’t it strange … you too—and yet one could think.—But no, it would destroy the best in you, if one should … come, come—come.—
#ACTRESS.
That’s better than acting in idiotic plays… Don’t you think so?
#POET.
Well, it seems to me, that it is a good thing you sometimes have to act in an intelligent one.
#ACTRESS.
You conceited puppy. I suppose you are thinking of one of your own plays again.
#POET.
Yes, I am.
#ACTRESS.
It is really a splendid play!
#POET.
Well, then!
#ACTRESS.
You are a great genius, Robert!
#POET.
And you might also tell me now why you didn’t turn up the day before yesterday. There was absolutely nothing the matter with you.
#ACTRESS.
Well, I wanted to annoy you.
#POET.
But why? What have I done to you?—
#ACTRESS.
You were over - bearing.
#POET.
In what way?
#ACTRESS.
Everybody at the theater thinks you are.
#POET.
Really.
#ACTRESS.
But I told them, he has a perfect right to be over - bearing.
#POET.
And what did they say?
#ACTRESS.
What could they say? I am not on speaking - terms with any of them.
#POET.
Oh, I see.
#ACTRESS.
They would like nothing better than to poison me, every one of them. But they won’t succeed.
#POET.
Don’t think now of others. Let’s be happy that we are here together, and tell me that you love me.
#ACTRESS.
What further proof can you want?
#POET.
It’s a thing that can’t be proven anyway.
#ACTRESS.
I like that! What else do you want?
#POET.
How many are there that you have tried to convince in this way … did you love all of them?
#ACTRESS.
No, I have loved only one.
#POET.
My…
#ACTRESS.
Dick.
#POET.
My name is Robert. What can I mean to you, if you are thinking of Dick, now?
#ACTRESS.
You are a mood of mine.
#POET.
I am pleased to know it.
#ACTRESS.
Well, tell me, aren’t you proud?
#POET.
Why should I be proud?
#ACTRESS.
It seems to me that you have good reason to be.
#POET.
Oh, because of that.
#ACTRESS.
Yes, because of that, my little cricket!—What about the chirping? Are they still chirping?
#POET.
All the time. Don’t you hear them?
#ACTRESS.
Of course, I hear them. But, child, those are frogs.
#POET.
You are wrong. Frogs croak.
#ACTRESS.
Of course, they croak.
#POET.
But this is not croaking, child, this is chirping.
#ACTRESS.
You are about the most stubborn person I have ever met. Kiss me, froggie.
#POET.
Please don’t call me that. It gets on my nerves.
#ACTRESS.
Well, what shall I call you?
#POET.
My name is Robert.
#ACTRESS.
Oh, but that’s stupid.
#POET.
But won’t you please call me simply by my own name?
#ACTRESS.
Well, then, Robert, give me a kiss… Ah! Now, are you satisfied, froggie?
#POET.
May I light a cigarette?
#ACTRESS.
Give me one too. By the way, you haven’t said a word about my performance yesterday.
#POET.
What performance?
#ACTRESS.
Well.
#POET.
Oh, yes. I wasn’t at the theater.
#ACTRESS.
You are joking.
#POET.
Not in the least. When you didn’t turn up the day before, I assumed you hadn’t fully recovered yesterday, and so I decided not to go.
#ACTRESS.
You missed something wonderful.
#POET.
Yes.
#ACTRESS.
It was a sensation. The people actually grew pale.
#POET.
You saw that?
#ACTRESS.
Benno said: Child, you acted divinely.
#POET.
Hm!… And so ill the day before.
#ACTRESS.
Indeed I was. And do you know why? Because I felt such a longing for you. little while ago you said that you stayed away just to annoy me.
#ACTRESS.
But what do you know about my love for you? Everything leaves you cold. And I have been delirious for nights. In a high fever—hundred and four degrees.
#POET.
Rather high for a mood.
#ACTRESS.
You call that a mood? I am dying for love of you, and you call it a mood—?
#POET.
And Dick…?
#ACTRESS.
Dick?… Don’t talk to me about that galley - slave!—
