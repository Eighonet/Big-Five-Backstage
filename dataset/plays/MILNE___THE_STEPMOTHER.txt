#PERKINS.
I'll tell Sir John you're here, but I don't say he'll see you, mind.
#EVERYCHILD.
Don't you worry about that. He'll see me right enough.
#PERKINS.
He's busy just now. Well -
#EVERYCHILD.
I suppose you think I've got no business in a gentleman's house. Is that it?
#PERKINS.
Well, I didn't say so, did I? Maybe you're a constituent? Being in the 'Ouse of Commons, we get some pretty queer ones at times. All sorts, as you might say. . P'raps you're a deputation?
#EVERYCHILD.
What the hell's it got to do with you who I am. You go and tell your master I'm here - that's all you've got to do. See?
#PERKINS.
Easy, now, easy. You 'aven't even told me your name yet. Is it the Shah of Persia or Mr. Bottomley?
#EVERYCHILD.
The less said about names the better. You say, "Somebody from Lambeth" - he'll know what I mean.
#PERKINS.
Ah, I beg your pardon - the Archbishop of Canterbury. I didn't recognise your Grace.
#EVERYCHILD.
It's people like you who make one sick of the world. Parasites - servile flunkeys, bolstering up an effete aristocracy. Why don't you get some proper work to do?
#PERKINS.
Now, look here, young man, this isn't the time for that sort of talk. If you've got anything you want to get off your chest about flunkeys or monkeys, or whatever it may be, keep it till Sunday afternoon - when I'm off duty. Four o'clock Sunday afternoon - just round the corner - in the Bolton Mews. See? Nobody there to interrupt us. See? All quite gentlemanly and secluded, and a friend of mine to hold the watch. See?
#EVERYCHILD.
No offence meant, mate. We're in the same boat - you and me; we don't want to get fighting. My quarrel isn't with you. You go and tell Sir John that there's a gentleman come to see him - wants a few minutes of his valuable time - from Lambeth way. He'll know. That's all right.
#PERKINS.
Then I shan't be seeing you Sunday afternoon?
#EVERYCHILD.
There, that's all right. No offence meant. Somebody from Lambeth - that's what you've got to say. And tell 'im I'm in a hurry. He'll know what I mean.
#PERKINS.
Well, it's a queer game, but being in the 'Ouse of Commons, one can't never be surprised. All sorts, as you might say, all sorts.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Oh! How do you do? Are you waiting to see my husband?
#EVERYCHILD.
Yes.
#LADY PEMBURY.
I think he's engaged just now. But he won't be long. Perkins will tell him as soon as he is free.
#EVERYCHILD.
His name is Perkins, is it?
#LADY PEMBURY.
The butler? Yes.
#EVERYCHILD.
Mister Perkins, the Butler.
#LADY PEMBURY.
You don't mind our having a butler?
#EVERYCHILD.
One more parasite.
#LADY PEMBURY.
I always thought parasites were much smaller than Perkins. Do sit down, won't you? You mustn't mind my being here. This is really my work - room. I expect my husband will take you into his own room when he's ready.
#EVERYCHILD.
Your work - room?
#LADY PEMBURY.
You don't seem to like our domestic arrangements.
#EVERYCHILD.
You call that work?
#LADY PEMBURY.
Other people's work always seems so contemptible, doesn't it? Now I expect if you tried to do this, you would find it very difficult indeed, and if I tried to do yours - what is your work, Mr. - er - Dear me, I don't even know your name.
#EVERYCHILD.
Never mind my name. Take it that I haven't got a name.
#LADY PEMBURY.
But your friends must call you something.
#EVERYCHILD.
Take it that I haven't got any friends.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Oh, don't say that! How can you?
#EVERYCHILD.
What's it matter to you whether anybody cares about me?
#LADY PEMBURY.
Oh, never mind whether anybody cares about you; don't you care about anybody?
#EVERYCHILD.
Nobody.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Poor, poor man! If you can't tell me your name, I wish you would tell me what work you do. You don't mind my asking, do you?
#EVERYCHILD.
I can tell you what work I'm going to do after to - day.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Oh, do!
#EVERYCHILD.
None!
#LADY PEMBURY.
None?
#EVERYCHILD.
No more work after to - day.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Won't that be rather dull?
#EVERYCHILD.
Well, you ought to know. I'm going to be one of the idle rich - like you and Sir John - and let other people work for me.
#LADY PEMBURY.
I shouldn't have said my husband was idle. But there it is. No two people ever agree as to what is work and what isn't.
#EVERYCHILD.
What do you know about work - you aristocrats?
#LADY PEMBURY.
My husband is only a K.B.E., you know. Quite a recent creation.
#EVERYCHILD.
You, who've been brought up in the lap of luxury - never known a day's discomfort in your life -
#LADY PEMBURY.
My dear young man, you really mustn't tell a woman who has had five children that she has never known a day's discomfort in her life. . Ask any woman.
#EVERYCHILD.
What's that? . I didn't come here to argue with you. You began it. Why can't you let me alone?
#LADY PEMBURY.
Five children - all girls - and now I'm a grandmother. There! That's my eldest daughter with her eldest son and my eldest grandchild. Isn't he a duck? He's supposed to be like me. . I never had a son of my own. Oh, let me take it away from you. Other's people's relations are so uninteresting, aren't they? So you've made a lot of money? How exciting for you!
#EVERYCHILD.
I haven't got it yet, but it's coming.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Soon?
#EVERYCHILD.
To - day.
#LADY PEMBURY.
You're not married, are you?
#EVERYCHILD.
You want to know a lot, don't you? Well, I'm not married.
#LADY PEMBURY.
I was thinking how much nicer it is when you can share that sort of news with somebody else, somebody you love. It makes good news so much better, and bad news so much more bearable.
#EVERYCHILD.
That's what you and your husband do, is it?
#LADY PEMBURY.
Always. For eight - and - twenty years.
#EVERYCHILD.
He tells you everything, eh?
#LADY PEMBURY.
Well, not his official secrets, of course. Everything else.
#EVERYCHILD.
Ha! I wonder.
#LADY PEMBURY.
But you have nobody, you say. Well, you must share your good news with me. Will you?
#EVERYCHILD.
Oh yes, you shall hear about it all right.
#LADY PEMBURY.
That's nice of you. Well then, first question. How much money is it going to be?
#EVERYCHILD.
Well, I don't quite know yet. What do you say to a thousand a year?
#LADY PEMBURY.
Oh, but what a lot!
#EVERYCHILD.
You think a thousand a year would be all right. Enough to live on?
#LADY PEMBURY.
For a bachelor, ample.
#EVERYCHILD.
For a bachelor.
#LADY PEMBURY.
There's no one dependent on you?
#EVERYCHILD.
Not a soul. Only got one relation living.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Oh?
#EVERYCHILD.
A father. But I shall not be supporting him. Oh no. Far from it.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Then I think you will be very rich with a thousand a year.
#EVERYCHILD.
Yes, that's what I thought. I should think it would stand a thousand.
#LADY PEMBURY.
What is it? An invention of some sort?
#EVERYCHILD.
Oh no, not an invention. . A discovery.
#LADY PEMBURY.
How proud she would have been!
#EVERYCHILD.
Who?
#LADY PEMBURY.
Your wife if you had had one; your mother if she had been alive.
#EVERYCHILD.
Look here, you leave my mother out of it. My business is with Sir John - Sir John Pembury, K.B.E. If I want to talk about my mother, he and I will have a nice little talk together about her. Yes, and about my father, too.
#LADY PEMBURY.
What do you mean? thousand a year. You said so yourself. Yes, I think it's worth a thousand a year.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Who is your father? What's your name?
#EVERYCHILD.
Didn't I tell you I hadn't got a name? And if you want to know why, ask Sir John Pembury, K.B.E.
#LADY PEMBURY.
He's your father.
#EVERYCHILD.
Yes. And I'm his loving son - come to see him at last, after all these years.
#LADY PEMBURY.
How - how old are you?
#EVERYCHILD.
Thirty.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Oh, thank God! Thank God!
#EVERYCHILD.
Look here, I didn't want all this. I ask you - did I begin it? It was you who kept asking questions. I just came for a quiet talk with Sir John - Father and Son talking together quietly - talking about Son's allowance. A thousand a year. What did you want to come into it for?
#LADY PEMBURY.
So you are the son that I never had.
#EVERYCHILD.
What d'you mean?
#LADY PEMBURY.
The son whom I wanted so. Five girls - never a boy. Let me look at you.
#EVERYCHILD.
Here, none of that.
#LADY PEMBURY.
No - and yet - Poor boy! What an unhappy life you must have had!
#EVERYCHILD.
I didn't come here to be pitied. I came to get my rightful allowance - same as any other son.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Poor boy! You don't mind my asking you questions now, do you?
#EVERYCHILD.
Go on. There's no mistake about it. I can promise you that.
#LADY PEMBURY.
How did you find out? Did your Mother tell you?
#EVERYCHILD.
Never a word. "Don't ask questions, sonny - " "Father's dead" - all that sort of thing.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Does Sir John know? Did he ever know?
#EVERYCHILD.
He knew right enough. Look here - here you are. This was how I found out. There - read that one.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Yes - that's John's writing.
#EVERYCHILD.
Aren't you going to read it?
#LADY PEMBURY.
He didn't write it to me.
#EVERYCHILD.
He didn't write it to me, if it comes to that.
#LADY PEMBURY.
You're her son - you have a right. I'm - nobody.
#EVERYCHILD.
Oh well, please yourself.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Did Sir John provide for your mother?
#EVERYCHILD.
Well, why shouldn't he? He was a rich man.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Not in those days. . But indeed - why shouldn't he? What else could he do? I'm glad he did.
#EVERYCHILD.
And now he's going to provide for his loving son. He's rich enough for that in these days.
#LADY PEMBURY.
He's never seen you?
#EVERYCHILD.
Never. The historic meeting of Father and Son will take place this afternoon. Afraid the Governor will be in the deuce of a rage. Been exceedin' my allowance - what? Make it a thousand, dear old Gov.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Don't they call that blackmail?
#EVERYCHILD.
Now look here, I'd better tell you straight that there's no blackmail about this at all. He's my father, isn't he? Well, can't a son come to his father if he's hard up? Where are your threatening letters? Where's the blackmail? Anyway, what's he going to do about it? Put his son in prison?
#LADY PEMBURY.
You're thirty. Thank God for that. We hadn't met then. . Ah, but he ought to have told me. He ought to have told me.
#EVERYCHILD.
P'raps he thought you wouldn't marry him, if he did.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Do you think that was it? You know men - young men. I never had a son; I never had any brothers. Do they tell? They ought to, oughtn't they?
#EVERYCHILD.
Well - well, if you ask me - I say, look here, this isn't the sort of thing one discusses with a lady.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Isn't it? But one can talk to a friend.
#EVERYCHILD.
You and me look like friends, don't we?
#LADY PEMBURY.
Well, we do, rather.
#EVERYCHILD.
I know what your game is. Don't think I don't see it.
#LADY PEMBURY.
What is it?
#EVERYCHILD.
Falling on your knees, and saying with tears in your eyes: "Oh, kind friend, spare me poor husband!" I know the sort of thing. And trying to work me up friendly before you begin.
#LADY PEMBURY.
No, if I went on my knees to you, I shouldn't say that. How can you hurt my husband now?
#EVERYCHILD.
Well, I don't suppose the scandal will do him much good. Not an important Member of Parliament like him.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Ah, but it isn't the outside things that really hurt you, the things which are done to you, but the things which you do to yourself. And so if I went on my knees to you, it would not be for my husband's sake. For I should go on my knees, and I should say: "Oh, my son that might have been, think before you give up everything that a man should have. Ambition, hope, pride, self - respect - are not these worth keeping? Is your life to end now? Have you done all that you came into the world to do, so that now you can look back and say, 'It is finished; I have given all that I had to give; henceforward I will spend'?" Oh, my son that might have been!
#EVERYCHILD.
Here, I say, that isn't fair.
#LADY PEMBURY.
When did your mother die?
#EVERYCHILD.
Look here, I wish you wouldn't keep on about mothers.
#LADY PEMBURY.
When did she die, proud mother?
#EVERYCHILD.
Well, why shouldn't she be proud? Two years ago, if you want to know.
#LADY PEMBURY.
It was then that you found out who your father was?
#EVERYCHILD.
That's right. I found these old letters. She'd kept them locked up all those years. Bit of luck for me.
#LADY PEMBURY.
And that was two years ago. And for two years you had your hopes, your ambitions, for two years you were proud and independent. . Why did you not come to us then?
#EVERYCHILD.
Well, I was getting on all right, you know - and -
#LADY PEMBURY.
And then suddenly, after two years, you lost hope.
#EVERYCHILD.
I lost my job.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Poor boy! And couldn't get another.
#EVERYCHILD.
It's a beast of a world if you're down. He's in the gutter - kick him down - trample on him. Nobody wants him. That's the way to treat them when they're down. Trample on 'em.
#LADY PEMBURY.
And so you came to your father to help you up again. To help you out of the gutter.
#EVERYCHILD.
That's right.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Ah, but give him a chance!
#EVERYCHILD.
Now, look here, I've told you already that I'm not going to have any of that game.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Foolish boy! You don't understand. Give him a chance to help you out of the gutter.
#EVERYCHILD.
Well, I'm - ! Isn't that what I am doing?
#LADY PEMBURY.
No, no. You're asking him to trample you right down into it, deeper and deeper into the mud and slime. I want you to let him help you back to where you were two years ago - when you were proud and hopeful.
#EVERYCHILD.
I can't make out what your game is. It's no good pretending you don't hate the sight of me - it stands to reason you must.
#LADY PEMBURY.
But then women are unreasonable, aren't they? And I think it is only in fairy - stories that stepmothers are always so unkind.
#EVERYCHILD.
Stepmother!
#LADY PEMBURY.
Well, that's practically what I am, isn't it? I've never been a stepmother before. Couldn't you let me be proud of my stepson?
#EVERYCHILD.
Well, you are a one! . Do you mean to say that you and your husband aren't going to have a row about this?
#LADY PEMBURY.
It's rather late to begin a row, isn't it, thirty years after it's happened? . Besides, perhaps you aren't going to tell him anything about it.
#EVERYCHILD.
But what else have I come for except to tell him?
#LADY PEMBURY.
To tell me. . I asked you to give him a chance of helping you out of your troubles, but I'd rather you gave me the chance. . You see, John would be very unhappy if he knew that I knew this; and he would have to tell me, because when a man has been happily married to anybody for twenty - eight years, he can't really keep a secret from the other one. He pretends to himself that he can, but he knows all the time what a miserable pretence it is. And so John would tell me, and say he was sorry, and I would say: "It's all right, darling, I knew," but it would make him ashamed, and he would be afraid that perhaps I wasn't thinking him such a wonderful man as I did before. And it's very bad for a public man like John when he begins to lose faith in what his wife is thinking about him. . So let me be your friend, will you? H'sh! It's John.
#PEMBURY.
Hallo, darling! Did I leave a cheque - book in here? I was writing a cheque for you this morning. Ah, here we are. I beg your pardon, Kate. I didn't see - But, perhaps you are waiting to see me? Perkins said something -
#EVERYCHILD.
Yes, I came to see you, Sir John.
#PEMBURY.
Important?
#EVERYCHILD.
I came to ask your help.
#PEMBURY.
A good many people do that. Have you any special claim on me?
#EVERYCHILD.
No.
#LADY PEMBURY.
All right, dear.
#PEMBURY.
I'll be back in a moment.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Oh, brave, brave! Ah, but I am a proud stepmother to - day. Thank you, son.
#EVERYCHILD.
I'd better go.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Mayn't I help you?
#EVERYCHILD.
I'd better go.
#LADY PEMBURY.
You can't go like this. I don't even know your name, nor where you live.
#EVERYCHILD.
Don't be afraid - you shan't hear from me again.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Not even when you've got back to where you were two years ago? Mayn't I then?
#EVERYCHILD.
Yes, you shall then.
#LADY PEMBURY.
Thank you. I shall wait. I shall hope. I shall pray. Good - bye!
#EVERYCHILD.
Wait till you hear from me. Wish you'd do one thing for me?
#LADY PEMBURY.
Yes?
#EVERYCHILD.
That fellow - what did you say his name was - Perkins?
#LADY PEMBURY.
The butler? Perkins - yes?
#EVERYCHILD.
Would you give him a message from me?
#LADY PEMBURY.
Of course.
#EVERYCHILD.
Just to say - I'll be there - at the Mews - on Sunday afternoon. He'll know. Tell him I'll be there.
#PEMBURY.
Hallo! Has he gone?
#LADY PEMBURY.
Yes.
#PEMBURY.
What did he want? Five pounds - or a place in the Cabinet?
#LADY PEMBURY.
He came for - a subscription.
#PEMBURY.
And got it, if I know my Kate. What did he take from you?
#LADY PEMBURY.
Yes; he took something from me. Not very much, I think. But just - something. And now tell me all that you've been doing this morning.
