#HUSBAND.
Is it good?
#MISS.
Oh!
#HUSBAND.
Do you want another?
#MISS.
No. I’ve eaten too much already.
#HUSBAND.
Your wine is all gone.
#MISS.
No … stop. I’ll leave it anyway.
#HUSBAND.
Why are you so shy?
#MISS.
Am I?—Well, it takes time to get acquainted.
#HUSBAND.
Come and sit here with me.
#MISS.
Right away… I’m not ready yet.
#MISS.
What’s the matter?
#HUSBAND.
I want a kiss.
#MISS.
You are … excuse me, you have a lot of nerve.
#HUSBAND.
You’re just finding that out?
#MISS.
Oh, no, I knew that long ago … from the first, in the street.—You must—
#HUSBAND.
What?
#MISS.
You must have a nice opinion of me.
#HUSBAND.
Why?
#MISS.
Because I went right away with you to a private dining room.
#HUSBAND.
Well, you can hardly say “right away.”
#MISS.
But you asked in such a nice way.
#HUSBAND.
Do you think so?
#MISS.
And, after all, what is the harm?
#HUSBAND.
Of course.
#MISS.
Whether we go walking or—
#HUSBAND.
Besides, it’s much too cold for walking.
#MISS.
Yes, it was too cold.
#HUSBAND.
But here it’s nice and warm, isn’t it?
#MISS.
Don’t.
#HUSBAND.
Tell me… You noticed me before, didn’t you?
#MISS.
Certainly. Several blocks before you spoke to me.
#HUSBAND.
I don’t mean to - day. I mean yesterday and the day before, when I was following you. lot of people follow me.
#HUSBAND.
I don’t doubt that. But did you notice me?
#MISS.
Guess … do you know what happened to me the other day? My cousin’s husband followed me in the dark, and didn’t recognize me.
#HUSBAND.
Did he speak to you?
#MISS.
What do you suppose? Do you imagine every one is as bold as you?
#HUSBAND.
But they sometimes do, don’t they?
#MISS.
Of course, they do.
#HUSBAND.
Well, and what do you do?
#MISS.
Why nothing—I just don’t answer.
#HUSBAND.
Hm - m … but you answered me.
#MISS.
Are you sorry?
#HUSBAND.
Your lips taste like cream - cakes.
#MISS.
Oh, they are sweet by nature.
#HUSBAND.
I suppose many have told you that?
#MISS.
Many! What are you dreaming of?
#HUSBAND.
Now, be honest. How many have kissed this mouth before?
#MISS.
Why do you ask? You wouldn’t believe me anyhow, if I told you.
#HUSBAND.
Why not?
#MISS.
Guess, then.
#HUSBAND.
All right, I’ll guess—but you mustn’t get angry!
#MISS.
Why should I get angry?
#HUSBAND.
Well, then, I’ll guess … twenty.
#MISS.
So—why not make it a hundred?
#HUSBAND.
Oh, I was just guessing.
#MISS.
You guessed badly.
#HUSBAND.
Say—ten.
#MISS.
Oh, of course. A girl who lets a man talk to her on the street, and goes right away with him to a private dining - room!
#HUSBAND.
Don’t be childish. Whether we walk about in the streets or sit in a room… We are in a restaurant. The waiter may come in at any moment—it doesn’t signify anything at all…
#MISS.
That’s just what I thought.
#HUSBAND.
Have you ever been in a private dining - room before?
#MISS.
If I must tell the truth—yes.
#HUSBAND.
I am glad that you are honest with me at least.
#MISS.
But it wasn’t—no it wasn’t the way you imagine. I was in a private dining - room with a friend and her fiancé, once during the carnival.
#HUSBAND.
It wouldn’t have been anything tragic, if you had ever gone—with your sweetheart—
#MISS.
Of course, it wouldn’t have been anything serious. But I haven’t any sweetheart.
#HUSBAND.
Oh, come now.
#MISS.
I swear, I haven’t.
#HUSBAND.
But you don’t expect to make me believe that I…
#MISS.
Make you believe what?… I haven’t any—at least, haven’t had for six months.
#HUSBAND.
I see… But before then? Who was he?
#MISS.
Why are you so curious?
#HUSBAND.
I am curious because I love you.
#MISS.
Really?
#HUSBAND.
Of course! You should have noticed that. Tell me about him.
#MISS.
What do you want me to tell?
#HUSBAND.
Don’t keep me in suspense so long. Who was he, that’s what I want to know.
#MISS.
Just a man.
#HUSBAND.
Well—well—who?
#MISS.
He looked something like you.
#HUSBAND.
No!
#MISS.
If you hadn’t looked so much like him—
#HUSBAND.
Well, what then?
#MISS.
Now, don’t ask, don’t you see that…
#HUSBAND.
That’s why you let me speak to you.
#MISS.
Yes, that’s it.
#HUSBAND.
I really don’t know whether I ought to be pleased or angry.
#MISS.
If I were you, I’d be pleased.
#HUSBAND.
All right.
#MISS.
You also remind me of him the way you speak … and the way you look at one…
#HUSBAND.
What was he?
#MISS.
And then, the eyes—
#HUSBAND.
What was his name?
#MISS.
Please don’t look at me that way; please don’t.
#HUSBAND.
Why do you want to leave me?
#MISS.
It’s time to go home.
#HUSBAND.
Later.
#MISS.
No, I really have to get home. What do you think mother will say.
#HUSBAND.
You live with your mother?
#MISS.
Of course, I live with my mother. What did you imagine?
#HUSBAND.
So—with your mother. Do you live alone with her?
#MISS.
Oh, yes, alone! There are five of us! Two boys and two more girls.
#HUSBAND.
Don’t sit so far away from me. Are you the oldest?
#MISS.
No, I’m the second. First comes Kitty. She’s working in a flower store. Then come I.
#HUSBAND.
Where do you work?
#MISS.
I stay at home.
#HUSBAND.
Always?
#MISS.
One of us has to stay home.
#HUSBAND.
Of course,—and what do you tell your mother, when you—come home so late?
#MISS.
That happens so seldom.
#HUSBAND.
Well, to - day, for example. Your mother will ask you, won’t she?
#MISS.
Of course, she’ll ask. It doesn’t matter how careful I am when I come home, she always wakes up.
#HUSBAND.
And what do you tell her?
#MISS.
Oh—that I’ve been to the theater.
#HUSBAND.
Does she believe that?
#MISS.
Why shouldn’t she believe it? I often go to the theater. I saw an opera on Sunday with my friend and her fiancé, and my oldest brother.
#HUSBAND.
Where did you get the tickets?
#MISS.
My brother is a hairdresser.
#HUSBAND.
Oh, yes, a hairdresser … at the theater, I suppose?
#MISS.
Why are you asking so many questions?
#HUSBAND.
Because I am interested. What does your other brother do?
#MISS.
He’s still going to school. He wants to become a teacher. Just imagine!
#HUSBAND.
And you also have a little sister?
#MISS.
Yes, she is a mere child, but you have to keep an eye on her all the time already. You have no idea how girls are spoiled at school. Just imagine! The other day I caught her keeping a date.
#HUSBAND.
Really?
#MISS.
Yes! She was out walking one evening at half - past seven with a boy from the school across the way. A mere child like her!
#HUSBAND.
And what did you do?
#MISS.
I gave her a spanking.
#HUSBAND.
Are you as strict as all that?
#MISS.
Well, who would be if I wasn’t? My older sister is working and mother does nothing but grumble—everything always depends on me.
#HUSBAND.
You are a dear, sweet girl! You also remind me of some one.
#MISS.
So—of whom?
#HUSBAND.
Of no one in particular … of bygone days … of my youth. Come, drink, child!
#MISS.
How old are you?… You … why … I don’t even know your name.
#HUSBAND.
Karl.
#MISS.
Is it possible? Your name is Karl?
#HUSBAND.
Was his name also Karl?
#MISS.
No, but that’s the queer thing … that is … the eyes … the way you look at me…
#HUSBAND.
And who was he?—You haven’t told me yet.
#MISS.
Oh, he was a bad man—that’s sure, otherwise he wouldn’t have gone away.
#HUSBAND.
Did you love him very much?
#MISS.
Of course, I loved him.
#HUSBAND.
I know what he was—a lieutenant.
#MISS.
No, he wasn’t in the army. He couldn’t pass the examinations. His father owns a house in … but why do you have to know?
#HUSBAND.
You have gray eyes. I thought, at first, they were black.
#MISS.
Well aren’t they pretty enough?
#MISS.
Don’t please—I can’t bear it… O, please don’t … let me get up … only for a moment—please.
#HUSBAND.
No, indeed.
#MISS.
But, please, Karl…
#HUSBAND.
How old are you?—eighteen—isn’t it?
#MISS.
Just past nineteen.
#HUSBAND.
Nineteen … and I—
#MISS.
You are thirty…
#HUSBAND.
And a little more—Don’t let’s talk about it.
#MISS.
He was thirty - two, when I first met him.
#HUSBAND.
How long ago was that?
#MISS.
I don’t remember… Listen, there must have been something in the wine.
#HUSBAND.
What makes you think so?
#MISS.
I am quite … see—everything is turning round about me.
#HUSBAND.
Then hold tight to me. So… I’ll tell you something, dear, we might go now.
#MISS.
Yes … home.
#HUSBAND.
Well, not exactly home…
#MISS.
What do you mean?… O, no—no… I won’t go anywhere else. What do you think I am?
#HUSBAND.
But listen to me, child—the next time we meet, you know, we will arrange it so that … This is so comfy, oh, so comfy!
#MISS.
What are you doing? Something must have been in that wine—I’m so sleepy … what would happen, if I couldn’t get up again? But, but—look, but Karl … if some one should come in … please … the waiter.
#HUSBAND.
No … waiter … will ever come in … here…
#HUSBAND.
Who knows what sort of a person she really is—Confound it … so quickly … that wasn’t very cautious of me … hm - m…
#MISS.
There must have been something in the wine.
#HUSBAND.
Why?
#MISS.
Otherwise…
#HUSBAND.
Why do you blame everything on the wine?…
#MISS.
Where are you? Why do you stay so far away? Come to me.
#MISS.
Now tell me if you really love me.
#HUSBAND.
But you know that… Of course.
#MISS.
Listen… There must have … come, tell me the truth, what was in the wine.
#HUSBAND.
Well, do you think I … I would drug your wine?
#MISS.
Well, see, I can’t understand it. I’m really not that kind… We’ve known each other only since… Dear, I’m not that kind … honestly, I’m not—if you think that of me—
#HUSBAND.
Well—why worry about that? I don’t think anything bad of you. I only think that you love me.
#MISS.
Yes…
#HUSBAND.
After all, when two young people are alone in a room, and have dinner, and drink wine … there doesn’t need to be anything in the wine.
#MISS.
I merely said it to say something.
#HUSBAND.
But, why?
#MISS.
Because I was ashamed.
#HUSBAND.
How absurd! There is no reason to be. Especially, since I made you think of your first sweetheart.
#MISS.
Yes.
#HUSBAND.
Your first sweetheart.
#MISS.
Yes, yes…
#HUSBAND.
Now I should like to know who the others were.
#MISS.
There weren’t any.
#HUSBAND.
That is not true, it can’t be true.
#MISS.
Oh, please, don’t tease me.
#HUSBAND.
Would you like a cigarette?
#MISS.
No, thanks.
#HUSBAND.
Do you know how late it is?
#MISS.
Well?
#HUSBAND.
Half - past eleven.
#MISS.
Really?
#HUSBAND.
Well … and your mother? She’s used to this, is she?
#MISS.
Do you really want to send me home?
#HUSBAND.
But earlier in the evening you yourself wanted—
#MISS.
You are quite changed. What have I done to you?
#HUSBAND.
But, child, what is the matter with you, what do you imagine?
#MISS.
And it was only your looks, believe me, or you would have had to wait … many men have asked me to go with them to a private dining - room.
#HUSBAND.
Well, would you like … to come here again with me soon … or rather somewhere else?
#MISS.
I don’t know.
#HUSBAND.
What do you mean by, “I don’t know”?
#MISS.
Well, why don’t you make a date?
#HUSBAND.
When? First of all, I must explain that I do not live in Vienna. I am only here for a few days’ visit now and then.
#MISS.
Oh, you’re not a Viennese?
#HUSBAND.
Yes, I am a Viennese. But I am living out of town now…
#MISS.
Where?
#HUSBAND.
Oh, well, that doesn’t matter.
#MISS.
Oh, don’t be frightened, I won’t come to see you.
#HUSBAND.
If it would give you any pleasure you may come. I live in Graz.
#MISS.
Honestly?
#HUSBAND.
Yes, why does that surprise you?
#MISS.
You are married, aren’t you?
#HUSBAND.
What makes you think that?
#MISS.
I just got the impression.
#HUSBAND.
And you wouldn’t mind that at all?
#MISS.
Well, I would rather that you were single.—So you are married!—
#HUSBAND.
But, tell me first what made you think of that?
#MISS.
If a man says he doesn’t live in Vienna, and he doesn’t always have time—
#HUSBAND.
But that’s not so improbable.
#MISS.
I don’t believe it.
#HUSBAND.
And wouldn’t it hurt your conscience to have caused a married man to become unfaithful?
#MISS.
Oh, my, no doubt your wife acts just like you.
#HUSBAND.
That will do. No more of such remarks.
#MISS.
I thought you didn’t have a wife.
#HUSBAND.
Whether I have one or not—such remarks are uncalled for.
#MISS.
But Karl, Karl, what is the matter? Are you angry? I really didn’t know that you were married. I was just talking. Come, don’t be angry.
#HUSBAND.
You are strange creatures, you … women.
#MISS.
Stop … don’t … it’s too late now.
#HUSBAND.
Well, listen to me a minute. Let’s talk seriously. I would like to see you again, to see you often.
#MISS.
Would you?
#HUSBAND.
But one thing is necessary … that I can depend upon you. I can’t look out for you.
#MISS.
Oh, I can look out for myself.
#HUSBAND.
You are … well, I can’t just say inexperienced—but, you are young—and—men in general are pretty unscrupulous.
#MISS.
Oh, my!
#HUSBAND.
I don’t mean on the moral side only.—Well, you know what I mean—
#MISS.
Tell me, what do you think I am?
#HUSBAND.
Look here—if you want me—me only—we can easily arrange it—even if I do generally live in Graz. In a place like this where some one may come in at any moment, it isn’t very comfortable.
#HUSBAND.
Next time … we shall go somewhere else, won’t we?
#MISS.
Yes.
#HUSBAND.
Where we may be entirely alone.
#MISS.
Yes.
#HUSBAND.
We’ll discuss the rest on the way home. Waiter … the bill!
