#LITTLE ANN.
James, are you really James?
#JAMES.
No, my proper name's John.
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh! And is Charles's an improper name too?
#JAMES.
His proper name's Mark.
#LITTLE ANN.
Then is Thomas Matthew?
#JAMES.
Miss Anne, stand clear o' that bin. You'll put your foot through one o' those 'ock bottles.
#LITTLE ANN.
No, but James - Henry might be Luke, really?
#JAMES.
Now shut it, Miss Anne!
#LITTLE ANN.
Who gave you those names? Not your godfathers and godmothers?
#JAMES.
Poulder. Butlers think they're the Almighty. But his name's Bartholomew.
#LITTLE ANN.
Bartholomew Poulder? It's rather jolly.
#JAMES.
It's hidjeous.
#LITTLE ANN.
Which do you like to be called - John or James?
#JAMES.
I don't give a darn.
#LITTLE ANN.
What is a darn?
#JAMES.
'Tain't in the dictionary.
#LITTLE ANN.
Do you like my name? Anne Dromondy? It's old, you know. But it's funny, isn't it?
#JAMES.
It'll pass.
#LITTLE ANN.
How many bottles have you got to pick out?
#JAMES.
Thirty - four.
#LITTLE ANN.
Are they all for the dinner, or for the people who come in to the Anti - Sweating Meeting afterwards?
#JAMES.
All for the dinner. They give the Sweated - tea.
#LITTLE ANN.
All for the dinner? They'll drink too much, won't they?
#JAMES.
We've got to be on the safe side.
#LITTLE ANN.
Will it be safer if they drink too much? Isn't the smell delicious here - like the taste of cherries when they've gone bad - and mushrooms; and boot blacking.
#JAMES.
That's the escape of gas.
#LITTLE ANN.
Has the plumber's man been?
#JAMES.
Yes.
#LITTLE ANN.
Which one?
#JAMES.
Little blighter I've never seen before.
#LITTLE ANN.
What is a little blighter? Can I see?
#JAMES.
He's just gone.
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh! . James, are these really the foundations?
#JAMES.
You might 'arf say so. There's a lot under a woppin' big house like this; you can't hardly get to the bottom of it.
#LITTLE ANN.
Everything's built on something, isn't it? And what's THAT built on?
#JAMES.
Ask another.
#LITTLE ANN.
If you wanted to blow it up, though, you'd have to begin from here, wouldn't you?
#JAMES.
Who'd want to blow it up?
#LITTLE ANN.
It would make a mess in Park Lane.
#JAMES.
I've seen a lot bigger messes than this'd make, out in the war.
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh! but that's years ago! Was it like this in the trenches, James?
#JAMES.
Ah! 'Cept that you couldn't lay your 'and on a bottle o' port when you wanted one.
#LITTLE ANN.
Do you, when you want it, here?
#JAMES.
I only suggest it's possible.
#LITTLE ANN.
Perhaps Poulder does.
#JAMES.
I say nothin' about that.
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh! Do say something!
#JAMES.
I'm ashamed of you, Miss Anne, pumpin' me!
#LITTLE ANN.
I'm not pumpin'! I only want to make Poulder jump when I ask him.
#JAMES.
Try it on your own responsibility, then; don't bring me in!
#LITTLE ANN.
James, do you think there's going to be a bloody revolution?
#JAMES.
I shouldn't use that word, at your age.
#LITTLE ANN.
Why not? Daddy used it this morning to Mother. "The country's in an awful state, darling; there's going to be a bloody revolution, and we shall all be blown sky - high." Do you like Daddy?
#JAMES.
Like Lord William? What do you think? We chaps would ha' done anything for him out there in the war.
#LITTLE ANN.
He never says that he always says he'd have done anything for you!
#JAMES.
Well - that's the same thing.
#LITTLE ANN.
It isn't - it's the opposite. What is class hatred, James?
#JAMES.
Ah! A lot o' people thought when the war was over there'd be no more o' that. Used to amuse me to read in the papers about the wonderful unity that was comin'. I could ha' told 'em different.
#LITTLE ANN.
Why should people hate? I like everybody.
#JAMES.
You know such a lot o' people, don't you?
#LITTLE ANN.
Well, Daddy likes everybody, and Mother likes everybody, except the people who don't like Daddy. I bar Miss Stokes, of course; but then, who wouldn't?
#JAMES.
That's right - we all bars them that tries to get something out of us.
#LITTLE ANN.
Who do you bar, James?
#JAMES.
Well - Speaking generally, I bar everybody that looks down their noses at me. Out there in the trenches, there'd come a shell, and orf'd go some orficer's head, an' I'd think: That might ha' been me - we're all equal in the sight o' the stars. But when I got home again among the torfs, I says to meself: Out there, ye know, you filled a hole as well as me; but here you've put it on again, with mufti.
#LITTLE ANN.
James, are your breeches made of mufti?
#JAMES.
Ah! Footmen were to ha' been off; but Lord William was scared we wouldn't get jobs in the rush. We're on his conscience, and it's on my conscience that I've been on his long enough - so, now I've saved a bit, I'm goin' to take meself orf it.
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh! Are you going? Where?
#JAMES.
Out o' Blighty!
#LITTLE ANN.
Is a little blighter a little Englishman?
#JAMES.
Well - 'e can be.
#LITTLE ANN.
James - we're quite safe down here, aren't we, in a revolution? Only, we wouldn't have fun. Which would you rather - be safe, or have fun?
#JAMES.
Well, I had my bit o' fun in the war.
#LITTLE ANN.
I like fun that happens when you're not looking.
#JAMES.
Do you? You'd ha' been just suited.
#LITTLE ANN.
James, is there a future life? Miss Stokes says so.
#JAMES.
It's a belief, in the middle classes.
#LITTLE ANN.
What are the middle classes?
#JAMES.
Anything from two 'undred a year to supertax.
#LITTLE ANN.
Mother says they're terrible. Is Miss Stokes middle class?
#JAMES.
Yes.
#LITTLE ANN.
Then I expect they are terrible. She's awfully virtuous, though, isn't she?
#JAMES.
'Tisn't so much the bein' virtuous, as the lookin' it, that's awful.
#LITTLE ANN.
Are all the middle classes virtuous? Is Poulder?
#JAMES.
Well. Ask him!
#LITTLE ANN.
Yes, I will. Look!
#JAMES.
Careless!
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh! And look! It's a bomb! She is about to pick it up when JAMES takes her by the waist and puts her aside.
#JAMES.
You stand back, there! I don't like the look o' that!
#LITTLE ANN.
Is it really a bomb? What fun!
#JAMES.
Go and fetch Poulder while I keep an eye on it.
#LITTLE ANN.
If only I can make him jump! Oh, James! we needn't put the light out, need we?
#JAMES.
No. Clear off and get him, and don't you come back.
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh! but I must! I found it!
#JAMES.
Cut along.
#LITTLE ANN.
Shall we bring a bucket?
#JAMES.
Yes. Near go! Thought I'd seen enough o'them to last my time. That little gas blighter! He looked a rum 'un, too - one o' these 'ere Bolshies.
#LITTLE ANN.
Hurrah! Not gone off yet! It can't - can it - while James is sitting on it?
#POULDER.
No noise, Miss. - James.
#JAMES.
Hallo!
#POULDER.
What's all this?
#JAMES.
Bomb!
#POULDER.
Miss Anne, off you go, and don't you -
#LITTLE ANN.
Come back again! I know!
#JAMES.
See!
#POULDER.
You've been at it again! Look here, you're not in the trenches now. Get up! What are your breeches goin' to be like? You might break a bottle any moment!
#JAMES.
Look here, you starched antiquity, you and I and that bomb are here in the sight of the stars. If you don't look out I'll stamp on it and blow us all to glory! Drop your civilian swank!
#POULDER.
Ho! Because you had the privilege of fightin' for your country you still think you can put it on, do you? Take up your wine! 'Pon my word, you fellers have got no nerve left!
#JAMES.
Put up your hands!
#POULDER.
I defy you to make me ridiculous.
#JAMES.
Up with 'em!
#JAMES.
Very good.
#POULDER.
I never lifted 'em.
#JAMES.
You'd have made a first - class Boche, Poulder. Take the bomb yourself; you're in charge of this section.
#POULDER.
It's no part of my duty to carry menial objects; if you're afraid of it I'll send 'Enry.
#JAMES.
Afraid! You 'Op o' me thumb!
#LITTLE ANN.
I've brought the bucket, and the Press.
#THE PRESS.
Ah, major domo, I was just taking the names of the Anti - Sweating dinner. By George! What A.1. irony! "Highest class dining to relieve distress of lowest class - bombed by same!" Tipping!
#POULDER.
Sir? This is present!
#LITTLE ANN.
I found the bomb.
#THE PRESS.
By Jove! This is a piece of luck!
#POULDER.
This won't do - it won't do at all!
#THE PRESS.
"Beginning of the British Revolution!"
#POULDER.
Put it in the cooler. 'Enry, 'old up the cooler. Gently! Miss Anne, get be'ind the Press.
#JAMES.
It won't be the Press that'll stop Miss Anne's goin' to 'Eaven if one o' this sort goes off. Look out! I'm goin' to drop it.
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh! Let me see! I missed all the war, you know!
#POULDER.
If you mention this before the police lay their hands on it, it'll be contempt o' Court.
#THE PRESS.
I say, major domo, don't call in the police! That's the last resort. Let me do the Sherlocking for you. Who's been down here?
#LITTLE ANN.
The plumber's man about the gas - a little blighter we'd never seen before.
#JAMES.
Lives close by, in Royal Court Mews - No. 3. I had a word with him before he came down. Lemmy his name is.
#THE PRESS.
"Lemmy!" Right - o!
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh! Do let me come with you!
#POULDER.
I've got to lay it all before Lord William.
#THE PRESS.
Ah! What's he like?
#POULDER.
A gentleman, sir.
#THE PRESS.
Then he won't want the police in.
#POULDER.
Nor the Press, if I may go so far, as to say so.
#THE PRESS.
One to you! But I defy you to keep this from the Press, major domo: This is the most significant thing that has happened in our time. Guy Fawkes is nothing to it. The foundations of Society reeling! By George, it's a second Bethlehem!
#POULDER.
Take up your wine and follow me. 'Enry, bring the cooler. Miss Anne, precede us. You defy me? Very well; I'm goin' to lock you up here.
#THE PRESS.
I say this is medieval.
#POULDER.
Not so! James, put him up in that empty 'ock bin. We can't have dinner disturbed in any way.
#JAMES.
Look here - go quiet! I've had a grudge against you yellow newspaper boys ever since the war - frothin' up your daily hate, an' makin' the Huns desperate. You nearly took my life five hundred times out there. If you squeal, I'm gain' to take yours once - and that'll be enough.
#THE PRESS.
That's awfully unjust. Im not yellow!
#JAMES.
Well, you look it. Hup.
#THE PRESS.
Little Lady - Anne, haven't you any authority with these fellows?
#LITTLE ANN.
I won't go! I simply must see James put him up!
#THE PRESS.
Now, I warn you all plainly - there'll be a leader on this.
#JAMES.
Ho!
#THE PRESS.
My paper has the biggest influence
#JAMES.
That's the one! Git up in that 'ock bin, and mind your feet among the claret.
#THE PRESS.
This is an outrage on the Press.
#JAMES.
Then it'll wipe out one by the Press on the Public - an' leave just a million over! Hup!
#POULDER.
'Enry, give 'im an 'and.
#LITTLE ANN.
It's lovely!
#POULDER.
Mind the '87! Mind!
#JAMES.
Mind your feet in Mr. Poulder's favourite wine!
#LITTLE ANN.
Miss Stokes - I must hide!
#MISS STOKES.
Poulder, where is Miss Anne?
#POULDER.
I am not in a position to inform you, Miss.
#MISS STOKES.
They told me she was down here. And what is all this about a bomb?
#POULDER.
The crisis is past; we have it in ice, Miss. 'Enry, show Miss Stokes!
#MISS STOKES.
Good gracious! Does Lord William know?
#POULDER.
Not at present, Miss.
#MISS STOKES.
But he ought to, at once.
#POULDER.
We 'ave 'ad complications.
#MISS STOKES.
Dear me! What are those?
#JAMES.
The complications.
#THE PRESS.
Miss Stokes, would you kindly tell Lord William I'm here from the Press, and would like to speak to him?
#MISS STOKES.
But - er - why are you up there?
#JAMES.
'E got up out o' remorse, Miss.
#MISS STOKES.
What do you mean, James?
#THE PRESS.
Miss Stokes, I appeal to you. Is it fair to attribute responsibility to an unsigned journalist - for what he has to say?
#JAMES.
Yes, when you've got 'im in a nice dark place.
#MISS STOKES.
James, be more respectful! We owe the Press a very great debt.
#JAMES.
I'm goin' to pay it, Miss.
#MISS STOKES.
Poulder, this is really most -
#POULDER.
I'm bound to keep the Press out of temptation, miss, till I've laid it all before Lord William. 'Enry, take up the cooler. James, watch 'im till we get clear, then bring on the rest of the wine and lock up. Now, Miss.
#MISS STOKES.
But where is Anne?
#THE PRESS.
Miss Stokes, as a lady - !
#MISS STOKES.
I shall go and fetch Lord William!
#POULDER.
We will all go, Miss.
#LITTLE ANN.
No - me!
#POULDER.
'Enry, leave the cooler, and take up the wine; tell Thomas to lay it out; get the champagne into ice, and 'ave Charles 'andy in the 'all in case some literary bounder comes punctual.
#THE PRESS.
I say, let me down. This is a bit undignified, you know. My paper's a great organ.
#POULDER.
Well - take 'im down, James; he'll do some mischief among the bottles.
#JAMES.
'Op off your base, and trust to me.
#POULDER.
The incident's closed; no ill - feeling, I hope?
#THE PRESS.
No - o.
#POULDER.
That's right. While we're waitin' for Lord William - if you're interested in wine - you can read the history of the times in this cellar. Take 'ock: Not a bottle gone. German product, of course. Now, that 'ock is 'sa 'avin' the time of its life - maturin' grandly; got a wonderful chance. About the time we're bringin' ourselves to drink it, we shall be havin' the next great war. With luck that 'ock may lie there another quarter of a century, and a sweet pretty wine it'll be. I only hope I may be here to drink it. Ah! - but look at claret! Times are hard on claret. We're givin' it an awful doin'. Now, there's a Ponty Canny - if we weren't so 'opelessly allied with France, that wine would have a reasonable future. As it is - none! We drink it up and up; not more than sixty dozen left. And where's its equal to come from for a dinner wine - ah! I ask you? On the other hand, port is steady; made in a little country, all but the cobwebs and the old boot flavour; guaranteed by the British Nary; we may 'ope for the best with port. Do you drink it?
#THE PRESS.
When I get the chance.
#POULDER.
Ah! I've often wanted to ask: What do they pay you - if it's not indelicate? Can you do it at the money? Still - it's an easy life! I've regretted sometimes that I didn't have a shot at it myself; influencin' other people without disclosin' your identity - something very attractive about that. Between man and man, now - what do you think of the situation of the country - these processions of the unemployed - the Red Flag an' the Marsillaisy in the streets - all this talk about an upheaval?
#THE PRESS.
Well, speaking as a Socialist -
#POULDER.
Why; I thought your paper was Tory!
#THE PRESS.
So it is. That's nothing!
#POULDER.
Dear me! Do you really think there's something in this?
#JAMES.
'Igh explosive.
#THE PRESS.
Too much, anyway, to let it drop.
#POULDER.
Me Lord!
#LORD WILLIAM.
I say, Poulder, what have you and James been doing to the Press? Liberty of the Press - it isn't what it was, but there is a limit. Where is he?
#JAMES.
Be'ind the parapet, me Lord.
#THE PRESS.
Very glad to meet you, Lord William. My presence down here is quite involuntary.
#LORD WILLIAM.
I know. The Press has to put its - er - to go to the bottom of everything. Where's this bomb, Poulder? Ah!
#THE PRESS.
Could I have a word with you on the crisis, before dinner, Lord William?
#LORD WILLIAM.
It's time you and James were up, Poulder. Look after this; tell Lady William I'll be there in a minute.
#POULDER.
Very good, me Lord.
#LORD WILLIAM.
I must apologise, sir. Can I brush you?
#THE PRESS.
Thanks; it's only behind. Now, Lord William, if you'd kindly outline your views on the national situation; after such a narrow escape from death, I feel they might have a moral effect. My paper, as you know, is concerned with - the deeper aspect of things. By the way, what do you value your house and collection at?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Really: I can't! Really!
#THE PRESS.
Might I say a quarter of a million - lifted in two seconds and a half - hundred thousand to the second. It brings it home, you know.
#LORD WILLIAM.
No, no; dash it! No!
#THE PRESS.
I see - not draw attention to your property in the present excited state of public feeling? Well, suppose we approach it from the viewpoint of the Anti - Sweating dinner. I have the list of guests - very weighty!
#LORD WILLIAM.
Taken some lifting - wouldn't they?
#THE PRESS.
May I say that you designed the dinner to soften the tension, at this crisis? You saw that case, I suppose, this morning, of the woman dying of starvation in Bethnal Green?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Yes - yes! I've been horribly affected. I always knew this slump would come after the war, sooner or later.
#THE PRESS.
". . had predicted slump."
#LORD WILLIAM.
You see, I've been an Anti - Sweating man for years, and I thought if only we could come together now . .
#THE PRESS.
I see - I see! Get Society interested in the Sweated, through the dinner. I have the menu here.
#LORD WILLIAM.
Good God, man - more than that! I want to show the people that we stand side by side with them, as we did in the trenches. The whole thing's too jolly awful. I lie awake over it.
#THE PRESS.
One moment, please. I'll just get that down - "Too jolly awful - lies awake over it. Was wearing a white waistcoat with pearl buttons." I want the human touch, Lord William - it's everything in my paper. What do you say about this attempt to bomb you?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Well, in a way I think it's d - d natural
#THE PRESS.
"Lord William thought it d - d natural."
#LORD WILLIAM.
No, no; don't put that down. What I mean is, I should like to get hold of those fellows that are singing the Marseillaise about the streets - fellows that have been in the war - real sports they are, you know - thorough good chaps at bottom - and say to them: "Have a feeling heart, boys; put yourself in my position." I don't believe a bit they'd want to bomb me then.
#THE PRESS.
"The idea, of brotherhood - " D'you mind my saying that? Word brotherhood - always effective - always -
#LORD WILLIAM.
"Brotherhood!" Well, it's pure accident that I'm here and they're there. All the same, I can't pretend to be starving. Can't go out into Hyde Park and stand on a tub, can I? But if I could only show them what I feel - they're such good chaps - poor devils.
#THE PRESS.
I quite appreciate! "Camel and needle's eye." You were at Eton and Oxford? Your constituency I know. Clubs? But I can get all that. Is it your view that Christianity is on the up - grade, Lord William?
#LORD WILLIAM.
What d'you mean by Christianity - loving - kindness and that? Of course I think that dogma's got the knock.
#THE PRESS.
"Lord William thought dogma had got the knock." I should like you just to develop your definition of Christianity. "Loving - kindness" strikes rather a new note.
#LORD WILLIAM.
New? What about the Sermon on the Mount?
#THE PRESS.
"Refers to Sermon on Mount." I take it you don't belong to any Church, Lord William?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Well, really - I've been baptised and that sort of thing. But look here -
#THE PRESS.
Oh! you can trust me - I shan't say anything that you'll regret. Now, do you consider that a religious revival would help to quiet the country?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Well, I think it would be a deuced, good thing if everybody were a bit more kind.
#THE PRESS.
Ah! I feel that your views are strikingly original, Lord William. If you could just open out on them a little more? How far would you apply kindness in practice?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Can you apply it in theory?
#THE PRESS.
I believe it is done. But would you allow yourself to be blown up with impunity?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Well, that's a bit extreme. But I quite sympathise with this chap. Imagine yourself in his shoes. He sees a huge house, all these bottles; us swilling them down; perhaps he's got a starving wife, or consumptive kids.
#THE PRESS.
Um - m! "Kids."
#LORD WILLIAM.
He thinks: "But for the grace of God, there swill I. Why should that blighter have everything and I nothing?" and all that.
#THE PRESS.
"And all that." Yes?
#LORD WILLIAM.
And gradually - you see - this contrast - becomes an obsession with him. "There's got to be an example made," he thinks; and - er - he makes it, don't you know?
#THE PRESS.
Ye - es? And - when you're the example?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Well, you feel a bit blue, of course. But my point is that you quite see it.
#THE PRESS.
From the other world. Do you believe in a future life, Lord William? The public took a lot of interest in the question, if you remember, at the time of the war. It might revive at any moment, if there's to be a revolution.
#LORD WILLIAM.
The wish is always father to the thought, isn't it?
#THE PRESS.
Yes! But - er - doesn't the question of a future life rather bear on your point about kindness? If there isn't one - why be kind?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Well, I should say one oughtn't to be kind for any motive - that's self - interest; but just because one feels it, don't you know.
#THE PRESS.
That's very new - very new!
#LORD WILLIAM.
You chaps are wonderful.
#THE PRESS.
You mean we're - we're -
#LORD WILLIAM.
No, really. You have such a d - d hard time. It must be perfectly beastly to interview fellows like me.
#THE PRESS.
Oh! Not at all, Lord William. Not at all. I assure you compared with a literary man, it's - it's almost heavenly.
#LORD WILLIAM.
You must have a wonderful knowledge of things.
#THE PRESS.
Well - I shouldn't say that.
#LORD WILLIAM.
I don't see how you can avoid it. You turn your hands to everything.
#THE PRESS.
Well - yes, Yes.
#LORD WILLIAM.
I say: Is there really going to be a revolution, or are you making it up, you Press?
#THE PRESS.
We don't know. We never know whether we come before the event, or it comes before us.
#LORD WILLIAM.
That's - very deep - very dip. D'you mind lending me your note - book a moment. I'd like to stick that down. All right, I'll use the other end.
#LORD WILLIAM.
Thanks awfully. Now what's your real opinion of the situation?
#THE PRESS.
As a man or a Press man?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Is there any difference?
#THE PRESS.
Is there any connection?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Well, as a man.
#THE PRESS.
As a man, I think it's rotten.
#LORD WILLIAM.
"Rotten." And as a pressman?
#THE PRESS.
Prime.
#LORD WILLIAM.
What! Like a Stilton cheese. Ha, ha!
#THE PRESS.
My stunt, Lord William. You said that.
#LORD WILLIAM.
But look here! Would you say that a strong press movement would help to quiet the country?
#THE PRESS.
Well, as you ask me, Lord William, I'll tell you. No newspapers for a month would do the trick.
#LORD WILLIAM.
By Jove! That's brilliant.
#THE PRESS.
Yes, but I should starve. Lord William, you could do me a real kindness. Authorise me to go and interview the fellow who left the bomb here; I've got his address. I promise you to do it most discreetly. Fact is - well - I'm in low water. Since the war we simply can't get sensation enough for the new taste. Now, if I could have an article headed: "Bombed and Bomber" - sort of double interview, you know, it'd very likely set me on my legs again. Look!
#LORD WILLIAM.
My dear chap, certainly. Go and interview this blighter, and then bring him round here. You can do that for one. I'd very much like to see him, as a matter of fact.
#THE PRESS.
Thanks awfully; I shall never forget it. Oh! might I have my note - book?
#LORD WILLIAM.
And look here, if there's anything - when a fellow's fortunate and another's not -
#THE PRESS.
Oh, thank you! But you see, I shall have to write you up a bit, Lord William. The old aristocracy - you know what the public still expects; if you were to lend me money, you might feel -
#LORD WILLIAM.
By Jove! Never should have dreamt -
#THE PRESS.
No! But it wouldn't do. Have you a photograph of yourself.
#LORD WILLIAM.
Not on me.
#THE PRESS.
Pity! By the way, has it occurred to you that there may be another bomb on the premises?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Phew! I'll have a look.
#THE PRESS.
Ah! That'll do. "Lord William examines the foundations of his house." - Oh! Have you a photograph of him?
#LADY WILLIAM.
Not on me.
#THE PRESS.
Er - no - I suppose not - no. Excuse me!
#LADY WILLIAM.
Bill!
#LORD WILLIAM.
Hallo, Nell! I was just making sure there wasn't another bomb.
#LADY WILLIAM.
Yes; that's why I came dawn: Who was that person?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Press.
#LADY WILLIAM.
He looked awfully yellow. I hope you haven't been giving yourself away.
#LORD WILLIAM.
Well, I don't know. They're like corkscrews.
#LADY WILLIAM.
What did he ask you?
#LORD WILLIAM.
What didn't he?
#LADY WILLIAM.
Well, what did you tell him?
#LORD WILLIAM.
That I'd been baptised - but he promised not to put it down.
#LADY WILLIAM.
Bill, you are absurd.
#LORD WILLIAM.
I don't remember anything else, except that it was quite natural we should be bombed, don't you know.
#LADY WILLIAM.
Why, what harm have we done?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Been born, my dear. I say, Nell, how am I to tell what this fellow felt when he left that bomb here?
#LADY WILLIAM.
Why do you want to?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Out there one used to know what one's men felt.
#LADY WILLIAM.
My dear boy, I really don't think you ought to see the Press; it always upsets you.
#LORD WILLIAM.
Well! Why should you and I be going to eat ourselves silly to improve the condition of the sweated, when -
#LADY WILLIAM.
When they're going to "improve" ours, if we don't look out. We've got to get in first, Bill.
#LORD WILLIAM.
I know. It's all fear. That's it! Here we are, and here we shall stay - as if there'd never been a war.
#LADY WILLIAM.
Well, thank heaven there's no "front" to a revolution. You and I can go to glory together this time. Compact! Anything that's on, I'm to abate in.
#LORD WILLIAM.
Well, in reason.
#LADY WILLIAM.
No, in rhyme, too.
#LORD WILLIAM.
I say, your dress!
#LADY WILLIAM.
Yes, Poulder tried to stop me, but I wasn't going to have you blown up without me.
#LORD WILLIAM.
You duck. You do look stunning. Give us a kiss!
#LADY WILLIAM.
Oh, Bill! Don't touch me - your hands!
#LORD WILLIAM.
Never mind, my mouth's clean. They stand about a yard apart, and banding their faces towards each other, kiss on the lips.
#LITTLE ANN.

#MRS. LEMMY.
Well; go yu, then, and get a breath o' fresh air in yore chakes. I'll sune 'a feneshed.

#MRS. LEMMY.
Ah! 'Er've a - got all 'er troubles before 'er! "Little lamb, a made'ee?" 'Tes a funny world, tu!
#MRS. LEMMY.
Well, Bob, I 'aven't a - seen yu this tu weeks.
#LEMMY.
Well, old lydy o' leisure! Wot would y' 'ave for supper, if yer could choose - salmon wivaht the tin, an' tipsy cyke?
#MRS. LEMMY.
That's showy. Toad in the 'ole I'd 'ave - and a glass o' port wine.
#LEMMY.
Providential. Wot dyer think I've got yer?
#MRS. LEMMY.
I 'ope yu've a - got yureself a job, my son!
#LEMMY.
Yus, or I couldn't 'ave afforded yer this. Not 'arf! This'll put the blood into yer. Pork wine - once in the cellars of the gryte. We'll drink the ryyal family in this.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Ah! She was a praaper gude queen. I see 'er once, when 'er was bein' burried.
#LEMMY.
Ryalties - I got nothin' to sy agynst 'em in this country. But the STYTE 'as got to 'ave its pipes seen to. The 'ole show's goin' up pop. Yer'll wyke up one o' these dyes, old lydy, and find yerself on the roof, wiv nuffin' between yer an' the grahnd.
#MRS. LEMMY.
I can't tell what yu'm talkin' about.
#LEMMY.
We're goin' to 'ave a triumpherat in this country Liberty, Equality, Fraternity; an' if yer arsk me, they won't be in power six months before they've cut each other's throats. But I don't care - I want to see the blood flow! I don' care 'oose blood it is. I want to see it flow!
#MRS. LEMMY.
Yu'm a funny boy, that's sartin.
#LEMMY.
This 'ere cork is like Sasiety - rotten; it's old - old an' moulderin'. Crumblin' under the wax, it is. In goes the screw an' out comes the cork. - an' the blood flows. Well, old dear, wot shall we 'ave it aht of - the gold loving - cup, or - what? 'Ave yer supper fust, though, or it'll go to yer 'ead! Cold pap! 'Ow can yer? 'Yn't yer got a kipper in the 'ouse?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Port wine! 'Tis a brave treat! I'll 'ave it out of the "Present from Margitt," Bob. I tuk 'ee therr by excursion when yu was six months. Yu 'ad a shrimp an' it choked yu praaperly. Yu was always a squeamy little feller. I can't never think 'ow yu managed in the war - time, makin' they shells.
#LEMMY.
Ah! Nothin' worried me, 'cept the want o' soap.
#MRS. LEMMY.
So it du still, then! Luke at yore face. Yu never was a clean boy, like Jim.
#LEMMY.
All right! Y'see, I come stryte 'ere, to get rid o' this.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Tes a pity yu'm not got a wife to see't yu wash yureself.
#LEMMY.
Wife! Not me - I daon't want ter myke no food for pahder. Wot oh! - they said, time o' the war - ye're fightin' for yer children's 'eritage. Well; wot's the 'eritage like, now we've got it? Empty as a shell before yer put the 'igh explosive in. Wot's it like? Like a prophecy in the pypers - not a bit more substantial.
#MRS. LEMMY.
How 'e du talk! The gas goes to yore 'ead, I think!
#LEMMY.
I did the gas to - dy in the cellars of an 'ouse where the wine was mountains 'igh. A regiment couldn't 'a drunk it. Marble pillars in the 'all, butler broad as an observytion balloon, an' four conscientious khaki footmen. When the guns was roarin' the talk was all for no more o' them glorious weeds - style an' luxury was orf. See wot it is naow. You've got a bare crust in the cupboard 'ere, I works from 'and to mouth in a glutted market - an' there they stand abaht agyne in their britches in the 'oases o' the gryte. I was reg'lar overcome by it. I left a thing in that cellar - I left a thing . . It'll be a bit ork'ard for me to - mower.
#MRS. LEMMY.
What thing?
#LEMMY.
Wot thing? Old lydy, ye're like a winkle afore yer opens 'er - I never see anything so peaceful. 'Ow dyer manage it?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Settin' 'ere and thenkin'.
#LEMMY.
Wot abaht?
#MRS. LEMMY.
We - el - Money, an' the works o' God.
#LEMMY.
Ah! So yer give me a thought sometimes.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Yu ought never to ha' spent yore money on this, Bob!
#LEMMY.
I thought that meself.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Last time I 'ad a glass o' port wine was the day yore brother Jim went to Ameriky. For a teetotal drink, it du warm 'ee!
#LEMMY.
Well, 'ere's to the British revolution! 'Ere's to the conflygrytion in the sky!
#MRS. LEMMY.
So as to kape up therr, 'twon't du no 'arm.
#LEMMY.
Wot'd I tell yer, old lydy? There it is - there it is!
#MRS. LEMMY.
What is?
#LEMMY.
The revolution. They've got it on a barrer. Cheerio!
#HANK.
Cheerio!
#LEMMY.
I sy - you 'yn't tykin' the body, are yer?
#HANK.
Nao.
#LEMMY.
Did she die o' starvytion O.K.?
#HANK.
She bloomin' well did; I know 'er brother.
#LEMMY.
Ah! That'll do us a bit o' good!
#HANK.
Cheerio!
#LEMMY.
So long!
#HANK.
So long!
#LEMMY.
'Allo, little Aida!
#LITTLE AIDA.
'Allo, I been follerin' the corfin. It's better than an 'orse dahn!
#MRS. LEMMY.

#LITTLE AIDA.
Aoh yus! "When the fields" -
#MRS. LEMMY.
Deary me! I 'aven't a - got the strength!
#LEMMY.
Leave 'em alone, old dear! No one'll be goin' aht wivaht trahsers to - night 'cos yer leaves that one undone. Little Aida, fold 'em up!
#LEMMY.
Little Aida, one o' vese dyes yer'll myke an actress. I can see it in yer fyce!
#MRS. LEMMY.
Don't 'ee putt things into 'er 'ead, Bob!
#LEMMY.
'Tyn't 'er 'ead, old lydy - it's lower. She wants feedin' - feed 'er an' she'll rise. Look at 'er naow. I tell yer there's a fortune in 'er.
#MRS. LEMMY.
I'd saner there was a gude 'eart in 'er than any fortune.
#LITTLE AIDA.
It's thirteen pence three farthin's I've got to bring yer, an' a penny aht for me, mykes twelve three farthin's: I'm goin' to ride back on a bus, I am.

#LITTLE AIDA.

#MRS. LEMMY.

#LEMMY.
Well, 'ave one o' my gum - drops. Give me a kiss, an' I'll give yer a penny. Movver, she daon't know the valyer of money.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Never mind 'im, me dear.
#LITTLE AIDA.
There's a taxi - cab at the corner.
#LEMMY.
Wat - oh!
#THE PRESS.
Mr. Lemmy?
#LEMMY.
The syme.
#THE PRESS.
I'm from the Press.
#LEMMY.
Blimy.
#THE PRESS.
They told me at your place you wens very likely here.
#LEMMY.
Yus I left Downin' Street a bit early to - dy!
#THE PRESS.
"Fiddles while Rome is burning!" Mr. Lemmy, it's my business at this very critical time to find out what the nation's thinking. Now, as a representative working man -
#LEMMY.
That's me.
#THE PRESS.
You can help me. What are your views?
#LEMMY.
Voos? Sit dahn! The Press - my Muvver. Seventy - seven. She's a wonder; 'yn't yer, old dear?
#THE PRESS.
Very happy to make your acquaintance, Ma'am. "Mrs. Lemmy, one of the veterans of industry - " By the way, I've jest passed a lot of people following a coffin.
#LEMMY.
Centre o' the cyclone - cyse o' starvytion; you 'ad 'er in the pyper this mornin'.
#THE PRESS.
Ah! yes! Tragic occurrence. Hub of the Sweated Industries just here. I especially want to get at the heart -
#MRS. LEMMY.
'Twasn't the 'eart, 'twas the stomach.
#THE PRESS.
"Mrs. Lemmy goes straight to the point."
#LEMMY.
Mister, is it my voos or Muvver's yer want?
#THE PRESS.
Both.
#LEMMY.
'Cos if yer get Muvver's, yer won't 'ave time for mine. I tell yer stryte she's get a glawss a' port wine in 'er. Naow, mind yer, I'm not anxious to be intervooed. On the other 'and, anyfink I might 'eve to sy of valyer - There is a clawss o' politician that 'as nuffn to sy - Aoh! an' daon't 'e sy it just! I dunno wot pyper yer represent.
#THE PRESS.
Well, Mr. Lemmy, it has the biggest influ -
#LEMMY.
They all 'as that; dylies, weeklies, evenin's, Sundyes; but it's of no consequence - my voos are open and aboveboard. Naow, wot shall we begin abaht?
#THE PRESS.
Yourself, if you please. And I'd like you to know at once that my paper wants the human note, the real heart - beat of things.
#LEMMY.
I see; sensytion! Well; 'ere am I - a fustclawss plumber's. assistant - in a job to - dy an' out tomorrer. There's a 'eart - beat in that, I tell yer. 'Oo knows wot the mower 'as for me!
#THE PRESS.
"The great human issue - Mr. Lemmy touches it at once."
#LEMMY.
I sy keep my nyme aht o' this; I don' go in fer self - advertisement.
#THE PRESS.
"True working - man - modest as usual."
#LEMMY.
I daon't want to embarrass the Gover'ment. They're so ticklish ever since they got the 'abit, war - time, o' mindin' wot people said.
#THE PRESS.
Right - o!
#LEMMY.
For instance, suppose there's goin' to be a revolution - 'Ow does it touch me? Like this: I my go up - I cawn't come dahn; no more can Muvver.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Us all goes down into the grave.
#THE PRESS.
"Mrs. Lemmy interjects the deeper note."
#LEMMY.
Naow, the gryte - they can come dahn, but they cawn't go up! See! Put two an' two together, an' that's 'ow it touches me. 'Ave yer got that?
#THE PRESS.
Not go up? What about bombs, Mr. Lemmy?
#LEMMY.
Wot abaht 'em? I s'pose ye're on the comic pypers? 'Ave yer noticed wot a weakness they 'ave for the 'orrible?
#THE PRESS.
"A grim humour peeped out here and there through the earnestness of his talk."
#LEMMY.
We 'ad an explosion in my factory time o' the war, that would just ha' done for you comics. Lord! They was after it too, - they an' the Sundyes; but the Censor did 'em. Strike me, I could tell yer things!
#THE PRESS.
That's what I want, Mr. Lemmy; tell me things!
#LEMMY.
It's a funny world, 'yn't it? 'Ow we did blow each other up! I sy, I shall be syfe there. That won't betry me anonymiety. Why! I looks like the Prime Minister!
#THE PRESS.
You were going to tell me things.
#LEMMY.
Yus, an' they'll be the troof, too.
#THE PRESS.
I hope so; we don't -
#LEMMY.
Wot oh!
#THE PRESS.
We always try to verify -
#LEMMY.
Yer leave it at tryin', daon't yer? Never, mind, ye're a gryte institootion. Blimy, yer do have jokes, wiv it, spinnin' rahnd on yer own tyles, denyin' to - dy wot ye're goin' to print to - morrer. Ah, well! Ye're like all of us below the line o' comfort - live dyngerously - ever' dy yer last. That's wy I'm interested in the future.
#THE PRESS.
Well now - the future. "He prophesies."
#LEMMY.
It's syfer, 'yn't it? No one never looks back on prophecies. I remembers an editor spring o' 1916 stykin' his reputytion the war'd be over in the follerin' October. Increased 'is circulytion abaht 'arf a million by it. 1917 an' war still on - 'ad 'is readers gone back on 'im? Nao! They was increasin' like rabbits. Prophesy wot people want to believe, an' ye're syfe. Naow, I'll styke my reputation on somethin', you tyke it dahn word for word. This country's goin' to the dawgs - Naow, 'ere's the sensytion - unless we gets a new religion.
#THE PRESS.
Ah! Now for it - yes?
#LEMMY.
In one word: "Kindness." Daon't mistyke me, nao sickly sentiment and nao patronizin'. Me as kind to the millionaire as 'im to me.
#THE PRESS.
That's queer! Kindness! "Extremes meet. Bombed and bomber breathing the same music."
#LEMMY.
But 'ere's the interestin' pynt. Can it be done wivaht blood?
#THE PRESS.
"He doubts."
#LEMMY.
No dabt wotever. It cawn't! Blood - and - kindness! Spill the blood o' them that aren't kind - an' there ye are!
#THE PRESS.
But pardon me, how are you to tell?
#LEMMY.
Blimy, they leaps to the heye!
#THE PRESS.
I say, let me talk to you as man to man for a moment.
#LEMMY.
Orl right. Give it a rest!
#THE PRESS.
Your sentiments are familiar to me. I've got a friend on the Press who's very keen on Christ and kindness; and wants to strangle the last king with the - hamstrings of the last priest.
#LEMMY.
Not 'arf! Does 'e?
#THE PRESS.
Yes. But have you thought it out? Because he hasn't.
#LEMMY.
The difficulty is - where to stop.
#THE PRESS.
Where to begin.
#LEMMY.
Lawd! I could begin almost anywhere. Why, every month abaht, there's a cove turns me aht of a job 'cos I daon't do just wot 'e likes. They'd 'ave to go. I tell yer stryte - the Temple wants cleanin' up.
#THE PRESS.
Ye - es. If I wrote what I thought, I should get the sack as quick as you. D'you say that justifies me in shedding the blood of my boss?
#LEMMY.
The yaller Press 'as got no blood - 'as it? You shed their ile an' vinegar - that's wot you've got to do. Stryte - do yer believe in the noble mission o' the Press?
#THE PRESS.
Mr. Lemmy, I'm a Pressman.
#LEMMY.
I see. Not much! Wyke up, old lydy! Blood an' kindness - that's what's wanted - 'specially blood! The 'istory o' me an' my family'll show yer that. Tyke my bruver Fred - crushed by burycrats. Tyke Muvver 'erself. Talk o' the wrongs o' the people! I tell yer the foundytions is rotten. Daon't mind the mud at the bottom, old lydy - it's all strengthenin'! You tell the Press, Muvver. She can talk abaht the pawst.
#THE PRESS.
Yes, Mrs. Lemmy? "Age and Youth - Past and Present - "
#MRS. LEMMY.
Were yu talkin' about Fred? My son Fred was always a gude boy - never did nothin' before 'e married. I can see Fred acomin' in wi' a pheasant 'e'd found - terrible 'e was at findin' pheasants. When father died, an' yu was cumin', Bob, Fred 'e said to me: "Don't yu never cry, Mother, I'll look after 'ee." An' so 'e did, till 'e married that day six months an' take to the drink in sower. 'E wasn't never 'the same boy again - not Fred. An' now 'e's in That. I can see poor Fred -
#THE PRESS.
In - That?
#LEMMY.
Come orf it! Prison! 'S wot she calls it.
#MRS. LEMMY.
They say life's a vale o' sorrows. Well, so 'tes, but don' du to let yureself thenk so.
#THE PRESS.
And so you came to London, Mrs. Lemmy?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Same year as father died. With the four o' them - that's my son Fred, an' my son Jim, an' my son Tom, an' Alice. Bob there, 'e was born in London - an' a praaper time I 'ad of et.
#THE PRESS.
"Her heroic struggles with poverty - "
#MRS. LEMMY.
Worked in a laundry, I ded, at fifteen shellin's a week, an' brought 'em all up on et till Alice 'ad the gallopin' consumption. I can see poor Alice wi' the little red spots is 'er cheeks - an' I not knowin' wot to du wi' 'her - but I always kept up their buryin' money. Funerals is very dear; Mr. Lemmy was six pound, ten.
#THE PRESS.
"High price of Mr. Lemmy."
#MRS. LEMMY.
I've a - got the money for when my time come; never touch et, no matter 'ow things are. Better a little goin' short here below, an' enter the kingdom of 'eaven independent:
#THE PRESS.
"Death before dishonour - heroine of the slums. Dickens - Betty Higden."
#MRS. LEMMY.
No, sir. Mary Lemmy. I've seen a - many die, I 'ave; an' not one grievin'. I often says to meself: "Me dear, when yu go, yu go 'appy. Don' yu never fret about that," I says. An' so I will; I'll go 'appy. "Yore old fengers'll 'ave a rest. Think o' that!" I says. "'Twill be a brave change." I can see myself lyin' there an' duin' nothin'.
#LEMMY.
Tell abaht Jim; old lydy.
#MRS. LEMMY.
My son Jim 'ad a family o' seven in six years. "I don' know 'ow 'tes, Mother," 'e used to say to me; "they just sim to come!" That was Jim - never knu from day to day what was cumin'. "Therr's another of 'em dead," 'e used to say, "'tes funny, tu" "Well," I used to say to 'im; "no wonder, poor little things, livin' in they model dwellin's. Therr's no air for 'em," I used to say. "Well," 'e used to say, "what can I du, Mother? Can't afford to live in Park Lane:" An' 'e take an' went to Ameriky. An' never came back. Fine feller. So that's my four sons - One's dead, an' one's in - That, an' one's in Ameriky, an' Bob 'ere, poor boy, 'e always was a talker.
#THE PRESS.
And now a few words about your work, Mrs. Lemmy?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Well, I sews.
#THE PRESS.
"Sews." Yes?
#MRS. LEMMY.
I putt in the button'oles, I stretches the flies, I lines the crutch, I putt on this bindin', I sews on the buttons, I press the seams - Tuppence three farthin's the pair.
#THE PRESS.
Twopence three farthings a pair! Worse than a penny a line!
#MRS. LEMMY.
In a gude day I gets thru four pairs, but they'm gettin' plaguey 'ard for my old fengers.
#THE PRESS.
"A monumental figure, on whose labour is built the mighty edifice of our industrialism."
#LEMMY.
I sy - that's good. Yer'll keep that, won't yet?
#MRS. LEMMY.
I finds me own cotton, tuppence three farthin's, and other expension is a penny three farthin's.
#THE PRESS.
And are you an exception, Mrs. Lemmy?
#MRS. LEMMY.
What's that?
#LEMMY.
Wot price the uvvers, old lydy? Is there a lot of yer sewin' yer fingers orf at tuppence 'ypenny the pair?
#MRS. LEMMY.
I can't tell yu that. I never sees nothin' in 'ere. I pays a penny to that little gell to bring me a dozen pair an' fetch 'em back. Poor little thing, she'm 'ardly strong enough to carry 'em. Feel! They'm very 'eavy!
#THE PRESS.
On the conscience of Society!
#LEMMY.
I sy put that dahn, won't yer?
#THE PRESS.
Have things changed much since the war, Mrs. Lemmy?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Cotton's a lot dearer.
#THE PRESS.
All round, I mean.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Aw! Yu don' never get no change, not in my profession. I've a - been in trousers fifteen year; ever since I got to old for laundry.
#THE PRESS.
"For fifteen years sewn trousers." What would a good week be, Mrs. Lemmy?
#MRS. LEMMY.
'Tes a very gude week, five shellin's.
#LEMMY.
Bloomin' millionairess, Muvver. She's lookin' forward to 'eaven, where vey don't wear no trahsers.
#MRS. LEMMY.
'Tidn for me to zay whether they du. An' 'tes on'y when I'm a bit low - sperrity - like as I wants to go therr. What I am a - lukin' forward to, though, 'tes a day in the country. I've not a - had one since before the war. A kind lady brought me in that bit of 'eather; 'tes wonderful sweet stuff when the 'oney's in et. When I was a little gell I used to zet in the 'eather gatherin' the whorts, an' me little mouth all black wi' eatin' them. 'Twas in the 'eather I used to zet, Sundays, courtin'. All flesh is grass - an' 'tesn't no bad thing - grass.
#THE PRESS.
"The old paganism of the country." What is your view of life, Mrs. Lemmy?
#LEMMY.
Wot is 'er voo of life? Shall I tell yer mine? Life's a disease - a blinkin' oak - apple! Daon't myke no mistyke. An' 'umen life's a yumourous disease; that's all the difference. Why - wot else can it be? See the bloomin' promise an' the blighted performance - different as a 'eadline to the noos inside. But yer couldn't myke Muvver see vat - not if yer talked to 'er for a wok. Muvver still believes in fings. She's a country gell; at a 'undred and fifty she'll be a country gell, won't yer, old lydy?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Well, 'tesn't never been 'ome to me in London. I lived in the country forty year - I did my lovin' there; I burried father therr. Therr bain't nothin' in life, yu know, but a bit o' lovin' - all said an' done; bit o' lovin', with the wind, an' the stars out.
#LEMMY.
She 'yn't often like this. I told yer she'd got a glawss o' port in 'er.
#MRS. LEMMY.
'Tes a brave pleasure, is lovin'. I likes to zee et in young folk. I likes to zee 'em kissin'; shows the 'eart in 'em. 'Tes the 'eart makes the world go round; 'tesn't nothin' else, in my opinion.
#THE PRESS.

No, I never yeard a swan sing - never! But I tell 'ee what I 'eve 'eard; the Bells singin' in th' orchard 'angin' up the clothes to dry, an' the cuckoos callin' back to 'em. There's a - many songs in the country - the 'eart is freelike in th' country!
#LEMMY.
Gi' me the Strand at ar' past nine.
#THE PRESS.
"Town and country - "
#MRS. LEMMY.
'Tidn't like that in London; one day's jest like another. Not but what therr's a 'eap o' kind'eartedness 'ere.
#LEMMY.
Kind - 'eartedness! I daon't fink "Boys an' Gells come out to play."
#MRS. LEMMY.
"Boys an' Gells come out to play. The mune is shinin' bright as day." I used to sing like a lark when I was a gell.
#LITTLE AIDA.
There's 'undreds follerin' the corfin. 'Yn't you goin', Mr. Lemmy - it's dahn your wy!
#LEMMY.
Well yus - I s'pose they'll miss me.
#LITTLE AIDA.
Aoh! Tyke me!
#THE PRESS.
What's this?
#LEMMY.
The revolution in 'Yde Pawk.
#THE PRESS.
In Hyde Park? The very thing. I'll take you down. My taxi's waiting.
#LITTLE AIDA.
Yus; it's breathin' 'ard, at the corner.
#THE PRESS.
Ah! and Mrs. Lemmy. There's an Anti - Sweating Meeting going on at a house in Park Lane. We can get there in twenty minutes if we shove along. I want you to tell them about the trouser - making. You'll be a sensation!
#LEMMY.
Sensytion! 'E cawn't keep orf it!
#MRS. LEMMY.
Anti - Sweat. Poor fellers! I 'ad one come to see we before the war, an' they'm still goin' on? Wonderful, an't it?
#THE PRESS.
Come, Mrs. Lemmy; drive in a taxi, beautiful moonlit night; and they'll give you a splendid cup of tea.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Ah! I cudn't never du without my tea. There's not an avenin' but I thinks to meself: Now, me dear, yu've a - got one more to fennish, an' then yu'll 'eve yore cup o' tea. Thank you for callin', all the same.
#LEMMY.
Better siccumb to the temptytion, old lydy; joyride wiv the Press; marble floors, pillars o' gold; conscientious footmen; lovely lydies; scuppers runnin' tea! An' the revolution goin' on across the wy. 'Eaven's nuffink to Pawk Lyne.
#THE PRESS.

#MRS. LEMMY.
Thank yu, - I'm a - feelin' very comfortable. 'Tes wonderful what a drop o' wine'll du for the stomach. taxi - ride!
#MRS. LEMMY.
Ah! I know'em. They'm very busy things.
#LEMMY.

#MRS. LEMMY.
I like a bit o' music. It du that move 'ee.
#THE PRESS.
Bravo, Mrs. Lemmy. Come on!
#LEMMY.
Come on, old dear! We'll be in time for the revolution yet.
#MRS. LEMMY.
'Tes 'earin' the Old 'Undred again!
#LEMMY.
She 'yn't been aht these two years. Nao, never mind yer 'at. She 'yn't got none! No West - End lydy wears anyfink at all in the evenin'!
#MRS. LEMMY.
'Ow'm I lukin', Bob?
#LEMMY.
First - clawss; yer've got a colour fit to toast by. We'll show 'em yer've got a kick in yer. Little Aida, ketch 'old o' the sensytions.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Quite like a gell! And, smiling between her son and THE PRESS, she passes out; LITTLE AIDA, with a fling of her heels and a wave of the trousers, follows.
#POULDER.
His Grace the Duke of Exeter, my lady.
#LADY WILLIAM.
Oh! Father, you ARE late.
#HIS GRACE.
Awful crowd in the streets, Nell. They've got a coffin - couldn't get by.
#LADY WILLIAM.
Coin? Whose?
#HIS GRACE.
The Government's I should think - no flowers, by request. I say, have I got to speak?
#LADY WILLIAM.
Oh! no, dear.
#HIS GRACE.
H'm! That's unlucky. I've got it here. Found something I said in 1914 - just have done.
#LADY WILLIAM.
Oh! If you've got it - James, ask Lord William to come to me for a moment. Go in, Grand - dad; they'll be so awfully pleased to see you. I'll tell Bill.
#HIS GRACE.
Where's Anne?
#LADY WILLIAM.
In bed, of course.
#HIS GRACE.
I got her this - rather nice?
#LADY WILLIAM.
Oh! no, but how sweet! She'll simply love it.
#POULDER.
If I might suggest to Your Grace to take it in and operate it. It's sweated, Your Grace. They - er - make them in those places.
#HIS GRACE.
By Jove! D'you know the price, Poulder?
#POULDER.
A penny, is it? Something paltry, Your Grace!
#HIS GRACE.
Where's that woman who knows everything; Miss Munday?
#LADY WILLIAM.
Oh! She'll be in there, somewhere.
#POULDER.
would you care to see the bomb, my lady?
#LADY WILLIAM.
Of course - first quiet moment.
#POULDER.
I'll bring it up, and have a watch put on it here, my lady.
#LORD WILLIAM.
Can't you come, Nell?
#LADY WILLIAM.
Oh! Bill, your Dad wants to speak.
#LORD WILLIAM.
The deuce he does - that's bad.
#LADY WILLIAM.
Yes, of course, but you must let him; he's found something he said in 1914.
#LORD WILLIAM.
I knew it. That's what they'll say. Standing stock still, while hell's on the jump around us.
#LADY WILLIAM.
Never mind that; it'll please him; and he's got a lovely little sweated toy that turns head over heels at one penny.
#LORD WILLIAM.
H'm! Well, come on.
#LADY WILLIAM.
No, I must wait for stragglers. There's sure to be an editor in a hurry.
#POULDER.
Mis - ter Gold - rum!
#LADY WILLIAM.
And there he is! How good of you!
#MR. GROVENOR.
Thanks awfully. I just er - and then I'm afraid I must - er - Things look very - Thanks - Thanks so much.
#POULDER.
Miss Mun - day.
#LORD WILLIAM.
There! I thought she was in - She really is the most unexpected woman! How do you do? How awfully sweet of you!
#MISS MUNDAY.
How do you do? There's a spiffing crowd. I believe things are really going Bolshy. How do you do, Lord William? Have you got any of our people to show? I told one or two, in case - they do so simply love an outing.
#JAMES.
There are three old chips in the lobby, my Lord.
#LORD WILLIAM.
What? Oh! I say! Bring them in at once. Why - they're the hub of the whole thing.
#JAMES.
Very good, my Lord.
#LADY WILLIAM.
I am sorry. I'd no notion; and they're such dears always.
#MISS MUNDAY.
I must tell you what one of them said to me. I'd told him not to use such bad language to his wife. "Don't you worry, Ma!" he said, "I expert you can do a bit of that yourself!"
#LADY WILLIAM.
How awfully nice! It's SO like them.
#MISS MUNDAY.
Yes. They're wonderful.
#LORD WILLIAM.
I say, why do we always call them they?
#LADY WILLIAM.
Well, why not?
#LORD WILLIAM.
THEY!
#MISS MUNDAY.
Quite right, Lord William! Quite right! Another species. They! I must remember that. THEY!
#LADY WILLIAM.
Well, I don't see; aren't they?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Never mind, old girl; follow on. They'll come in with me.
#POULDER.
Some sweated workers, my Lord.
#LORD WILLIAM.
How d'you do! Delighted to see you all. It's awfully good of you to have come.
#LAME MAN.
Mr. and Mrs. Tomson. We 'ad some trouble to find it. You see, I've never been in these parts. We 'ad to come in the oven; and the bus - bloke put us dahn wrong. Are you the proprietor?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Yes, I - er -
#LAME MAN.
You've got a nice plyce. I says to the missis, I says: "'E's got a nice plyce 'ere," I says; "there's room to turn rahnd."
#LORD WILLIAM.
Yes - shall we - ?
#LAME MAN.
An' Mrs. Annaway she says: "Shouldn't mind livin 'ere meself," she says; "but it must cost'im a tidy penny," she says.
#LORD WILLIAM.
It does - it does; much too tidy. Shall we - ?
#MRS. ANN.
I'm very pleased to 'ave come. I've often said to 'em: "Any time you want me," I've said, "I'd be pleased to come."
#LORD WILLIAM.
Not so pleased as we are to see you.
#MRS. ANN.
I'm sure you're very kind.
#JAMES.
Wanted for your speech, my Lord.
#LORD WILLIAM.
Oh! God! Poulder, bring these ladies and gentleman in, and put them where everybody can - where they can see everybody, don't you know.
#LAME MAN.
Is 'e a lord?
#POULDER.
He is. Follow me.
#MRS. ANN.
You 'yn't one, I suppose?
#POULDER.
Now please. Pass in.
#VOICE OF LORD WILLIAM.
We propose to move for a further advance in the chain - making and - er - er - match - box industries. I would conclude with some general remarks. Ladies and gentlemen, the great natural, but - er - artificial expansion which trade experienced the first years after the war has - er - collapsed. These are hard times. We who are fortunate feel more than ever - er - responsible - er - responsible - er -
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh, Daddy!
#LORD WILLIAM.
In fact - er - you know how - er - responsible we feel.
#LITTLE ANN.
Hooray!
#LORD WILLIAM.
There is a feeling in the air - that I for one should say deliberately was - er - a feeling in the air - er - a feeling in the air -
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh, Daddy! Stop!
#LITTLE ANN.
No - o - o!
#JAMES.
Well, I'm goin' to.
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh, James, be a friend to me! I've seen nothing yet.
#JAMES.
No; but you've eaten a good bit, on the stairs. What price that Peach Melba?
#LITTLE ANN.
I can't go to bed till I've digested it can I? There's such a lovely crowd in the street!
#JAMES.
Lovely? Ho!
#LITTLE ANN.
James, you couldn't tell Miss Stokes! It isn't in you, is it?
#JAMES.
That's right.
#LITTLE ANN.
So - I'll just get under here. Do I show?
#JAMES.
Not 'arf!
#POULDER.
What are you doin' there?
#JAMES.
Thinkin'.
#POULDER.
My orders are to fetch the bomb up here for Lady William to inspect. Take care no more writers stray in.
#JAMES.
How shall I know 'em?
#POULDER.
Well - either very bald or very hairy.
#JAMES.
Right - o!
#POULDER.
The - ah - situation is seerious. It is up to us of the - ah - leisured classes - to - ah - keep the people down. The olla polloi are clamourin' - Miss S. Poulder!
#POULDER.
Miss?
#MISS STOKES.
Where is Anne?
#POULDER.
Excuse me, Miss - to keep track of Miss Anne is fortunately no part of my dooties.
#POULDER.
She is. If she was mine, I'd spank her.
#MISS STOKES.
Not a nice word.
#POULDER.
No; but a pleasant haction. Miss Anne's the limit. In fact, Lord and Lady William are much too kind 'earted all round. Take these sweated workers; that class o' people are quite 'opeless. Treatin' them as your equals, shakin 'ands with 'em, givin 'em tea - it only puffs 'em out. Leave it to the Church, I say.
#MISS STOKES.
The Church is too busy, Poulder.
#POULDER.
Ah! That "Purity an' Future o' the Race Campaign." I'll tell you what I thinks the danger o' that, Miss. So much purity that there won't be a future race. Purity of 'eart's an excellent thing, no doubt, but there's a want of nature about it. Same with this Anti - Sweating. Unless you're anxious to come down, you must not put the lower classes up.
#MISS STOKES.
I don't agree with you at all, Poulder.
#POULDER.
Ah! You want it both ways, Miss. I should imagine you're a Liberal.
#MISS STOKES.
Oh, no! I certainly am not.
#POULDER.
Well, I judged from your takin' cocoa. Funny thing that, about cocoa - how it still runs through the Liberal Party! It's virtuous, I suppose. Wine, beer, tea, coffee - all of 'em vices. But cocoa you might drink a gallon a day and annoy no one but yourself! There's a lot o' deep things in life, Miss! Miss S. Quite so. But I must find Anne.
#POULDER.
Well, I wish you every success; and I hope you'll spank her. This modern education - there's no fruitiness in it.
#LITTLE ANN.
Poulder, are you virtuous?
#POULDER.
Good Ged!
#LITTLE ANN.
D'you mind my asking? I promised James I would.
#POULDER.
Miss Anne, come out!
#JAMES.
Form fours - by your right - quick march! Right incline - Mark time! Left turn! 'Alt! 'Enry, set the bomb! Stand easy!
#POULDER.
Ah! You will 'ave your game! Thomas, take the door there! James, the 'all! Admit titles an' bishops. No literary or Labour people. Charles and 'Enry, 'op it and 'ang about! And this house an 'orspital in the war! I ask you - what was the good of all our sacrifices for the country? No town 'ouse for four seasons - rustygettin' in the shires, not a soul but two boys under me. Lord William at the front, Lady William at the back. And all for this! It comes of meddlin' on the Continent. I had my prognostications at the time. You remember my sayin' to you just before you joined up: "Mark my words - we shall see eight per cent. for our money before this is over!"
#JAMES.
I see the eight per cent., but not the money.
#POULDER.
Hark at that! I'd read the Riot Act. They'll be lootin' this house next!
#JAMES.
We'll put up a fight over your body: "Bartholomew Poulder, faithful unto death!" Have you insured your life?
#POULDER.
Against a revolution?
#JAMES.
Act o' God! Why not?
#POULDER.
It's not an act o' God.
#JAMES.
It is; and I sympathise with it.
#POULDER.
You - what?
#JAMES.
I do - only - hands off the gov'nor.
#POULDER.
Oh! Really! Well, that's something. I'm glad to see you stand behind him, at all events.
#JAMES.
I stand in front of 'im when the scrap begins!
#POULDER.
Do you insinuate that my heart's not in the right place?
#JAMES.
Well, look at it! It's been creepin' down ever since I knew you. Talk of your sacrifices in the war - they put you on your honour, and you got stout on it. Rations - not 'arf.
#POULDER.
For independence, I've never seen your equal, James. You might be an Australian.
#JAMES.
Keep a civil tongue, or I'll throw you to the crowd! Shall I tell you why I favour the gov'nor? Because, with all his pomp, he's a gentleman, as much as I am. Never asks you to do what he wouldn't do himself. What's more, he never comes it over you. If you get drunk, or - well, you understand me, Poulder - he'll just say: "Yes, yes; I know, James!" till he makes you feel he's done it himself. I've had experience with him, in the war and out. Why he didn't even hate the Huns, not as he ought. I tell you he's no Christian.
#POULDER.
Well, for irreverence - !
#JAMES.
And he'll never be. He's got too soft a heart.
#LITTLE ANN.
Hurrah!
#POULDER.
Come out, Miss Anne!
#JAMES.
Let 'er alone!
#POULDER.
In there, under the bomb?
#JAMES.
Silly ass! You should take 'em lying down!
#POULDER.
Look here, James! I can't go on in this revolutionary spirit; either you or I resign.
#JAMES.
Crisis in the Cabinet!
#POULDER.
I give you your marchin' orders.
#JAMES.
What's that you give me?
#POULDER.
Thomas, remove James!
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh! Do remove James, Thomas!
#POULDER.
Go on, Thomas.
#JAMES.
If I lose control of meself.
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh! James! Do lose control! Then I shall see it go off!
#JAMES.
Well, I'll merely empty the pail over you!
#POULDER.
This is not becomin'!
#JAMES.
Another strategic victory! What a Boche he'd have made. As you were, Tommy! That's a bishop.
#LITTLE ANN.
Why?
#JAMES.
By the way he's drawin'. It's the fine fightin' spirit in 'em. They were the backbone o' the war. I see there's a bit o' the old stuff left in you, Tommy.
#LITTLE ANN.
Where? Is it in his mouth?
#JAMES.
You've still got a sense of your superiors. Didn't you notice how you moved to Poulder's orders, me boy; an' when he was gone, to mine?
#LITTLE ANN.
March! He doesn't, James!
#JAMES.
Look here, Miss Anne - your lights ought to be out before ten. Close in, Tommy!
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh, no! Oh, no! Look!
#JAMES.
Good Lord! What's this?
#LITTLE ANN.
My name's Anne; what's yours?
#LITTLE AIDA.
Aida.
#LITTLE ANN.
Are you lost?
#LITTLE AIDA.
Nao.
#LITTLE ANN.
Are those trousers?
#LITTLE AIDA.
Yus.
#LUND.
Arms. Whose?
#LITTLE AIDA.
Mrs. Lemmy's.
#LITTLE ANN.
Does she wear them?
#LITTLE AIDA.
Nao. She sews 'em.
#LITTLE ANN.
They are hard. James's are much softer; aren't they, James? What shall we do? Would you like to see my bedroom?
#LITTLE AIDA.
Aoh, yus!
#JAMES.
No.
#LITTLE ANN.
Why not?
#JAMES.
Have some sense of what's fittin'.
#LITTLE ANN.
Why isn't it fittin'? Do you like me?
#LITTLE AIDA.
Yus - s.
#LITTLE ANN.
So do I. Come on!
#JAMES.
Tommy, ketch 'em!
#LITTLE ANN.
All right, then! Have you ever seen a bomb?
#LITTLE AIDA.
Nao.
#LITTLE ANN.
Look!
#LITTLE AIDA.
What's it for?
#LITTLE ANN.
To blow up this house.
#LITTLE AIDA.
I daon't fink!
#LITTLE ANN.
Why not?
#LITTLE AIDA.
It's a beautiful big 'Ouse.
#LITTLE ANN.
That's why. Isn't it, James?
#LITTLE AIDA.
You give the fing to me; I'll blow up our 'ouse - it's an ugly little 'ouse. Let's all blow up our own; then we can start fair. Daddy would like that.
#LITTLE AIDA.
Yus. I've 'ad a ride in a taxi, an' we're goin' 'ome in it agyne!
#LITTLE ANN.
Were you sick?
#LITTLE AIDA.
Nao. I was; when I first went in one, but I was quite young then. James, could you get her a Peche Melba? There was one.
#JAMES.
No.
#LITTLE ANN.
Have you seen the revolution?
#LITTLE AIDA.
Wot's that?
#LITTLE ANN.
It's made of people.
#LITTLE AIDA.
I've seen the corfin, it's myde o' wood.
#LITTLE ANN.
Do you hate the rich?
#LITTLE AIDA.
Nao. I hates the poor.
#LITTLE ANN.
Why?
#LITTLE AIDA.
'Cos they 'yn't got nuffin'.
#LITTLE ANN.
I love the poor. They're such dears.
#LITTLE AIDA.
Nao.
#LITTLE ANN.
Why not?
#LITTLE AIDA.
I'd tyke and lose the lot, I would.
#LITTLE ANN.
Where?
#LITTLE AIDA.
In the water.
#LITTLE ANN.
Like puppies?
#LITTLE AIDA.
Yus.
#LITTLE ANN.
Why?
#LITTLE AIDA.
Then I'd be shut of 'em.
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh!
#JAMES.
That's you. Come 'ere!
#THE PRESS.
Oh! Here she is, major domo. I'm going to take this old lady to the meeting; they want her on the platform. Look after our friend, Mr. Lemmy here; Lord William wants to see him presently.
#LITTLE ANN.
James, it's the little blighter!
#LEMMY.
'Ere! 'Arf a mo'! Yer said yer'd drop me at my plyce. Well, I tell yer candid - this 'yn't my plyce.
#THE PRESS.
That's all right, Mr. Lemmy. They'll make you wonderfully comfortable, won't you, major domo?
#POULDER.
James, watch it; I'll report.
#LEMMY.
I think I knows the gas 'ere. This is where I came to - dy, 'yn't it? Excuse my hesitytion - these little 'ouses IS so much the syme.
#JAMES.
They are!
#LEMMY.
Ah! I 'ad a word wiv you, 'adn't I? You're the four conscientious ones wot's wyin' on your gov'nor's chest. 'Twas you I spoke to, wasn't it? Ye're so monotonous. Well, ye're busy now, I see. I won't wyste yer time. I never see such pytient men? Compared wiv yer, mountains is restless. Why! There's a dawg under there. Glad it amooses yer. Yer want it, daon't yer, wiv a fyce like that? Is this a ply wivaht words? 'Ave I got into the movies by mistyke? Turn aht, an' let's 'ave six penn'orth o' darkness.
#LITTLE ANN.
No, no! Not dark!
#LEMMY.
The dawg talks anywy. Come aht, Fido! I sy: Is this the lytest fashion o' receivin' guests?
#LITTLE ANN.
Mother always wants people to feel at home. What shall we do? Would you like to hear the speeches? Thomas, open the door a little, do!
#JAMES.
'Umour 'er a couple o' inches, Tommy!
#LITTLE ANN.
There's the old lady. Daddy's looking at her trousers. Listen!
#LEMMY.
That's it, old lydy: give it 'em!
#LITTLE ANN.
Listen!
#VOICE OF LORD WILLIAM.
We are indebted to our friends the Press for giving us the pleasure - er - pleasure of hearing from her own lips - the pleasure -
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh! Daddy!
#LEMMY.
Now yer've done it. See wot comes o' bein' impytient. We was just gettin' to the marrer.
#LITTLE ANN.
What can we do for you now?
#LEMMY.
Wot is this one, anywy?
#JAMES.
Daughter o' the house.
#LEMMY.
Is she insured agynst 'er own curiosity?
#LITTLE ANN.
Why?
#LEMMY.
As I daon't believe in a life beyond the gryve, I might be tempted to send yer there.
#LITTLE ANN.
What is the gryve?
#LEMMY.
Where little gells goes to.
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh, when?
#LEMMY.
Well, I dunno if I've got time to finish yer this minute. Sy to - mower at. 'arf past.
#LITTLE ANN.
Half past what?

#JAMES.
That's 'is Grace. 'E's gettin' wickets, too.
#POULDER.
Lord William is slippin' in.
#LEMMY.
Wot oh! I am the portly one!
#POULDER.
Any such allusion aggeravates your offence.
#LEMMY.
Oh, ah! Look 'ere, it was a corked bottle. Now, tyke care, tyke care, 'aughty! Daon't curl yer lip! I shall myke a clean breast o' my betryal when the time comes!
#THE PRESS.
Look out!
#JAMES.
Do you want him in or out, me Lord?
#LEMMY.
I sy, you've divided the Press; 'e was unanimous.
#LORD WILLIAM.
I'm so sorry.
#LEMMY.
Would yer like me to see to 'is gas?
#LORD WILLIAM.
So you're my friend of the cellars?
#LEMMY.
I daon't deny it.
#LITTLE ANN.
Let me stay, Daddy; I haven't seen anything yet! If I go, I shall only have to come down again when they loot the house. Listen!
#LORD WILLIAM.
Take her up, Poulder!
#LITTLE ANN.
Well, I'm coming down again - and next time I shan't have any clothes on, you know.
#LEMMY.
Luv'ly pyces!
#LORD WILLIAM.
Now then; let's have our talk, Mr. -
#LEMMY.
Lemmy.
#THE PRESS.
"Bombed and Bomber face to face - "
#LEMMY.
I didn't come 'ere agyne on me own, yer know. The Press betryed me.
#LORD WILLIAM.
Is that old lady your mother?
#LEMMY.
The syme. I tell yer stryte, it was for 'er I took that old bottle o' port. It was orful old.
#LORD WILLIAM.
Ah! Port? Probably the '83. Hope you both enjoyed it.
#LEMMY.
So far - yus. Muvver'll suffer a bit tomower, I expect.
#LORD WILLIAM.
I should like to do something for your mother, if you'll allow me.
#LEMMY.
Oh! I'll allow yer. But I dunno wot she'll sy.
#LORD WILLIAM.
I can see she's a fine independent old lady! But suppose you were to pay her ten bob a week, and keep my name out of it?
#LEMMY.
Well, that's one wy o' YOU doin' somefink, 'yn't it?
#LORD WILLIAM.
I giving you the money, of course.
#THE PRESS.
"Lord William, with kingly generosity - "
#LEMMY.
I sy - I daon't mind, meself - if you daon't -
#LORD WILLIAM.
He won't write anything to annoy me.
#THE PRESS.
This is the big thing, Lord William; it'll get the public bang in the throat.
#LEMMY.
Bit dyngerous, 'yn't it? trustin' the Press? Their right 'ands never knows wot their left 'ands is writin'. 'Yn't that true, speakin' as a man?
#THE PRESS.
Mr. Lemmy, even the Press is capable of gratitude.
#LEMMY.
Is it? I should ha' thought it was too important for a little thing like that. But ye're quite right; we couldn't do wivaht the Press - there wouldn't be no distress, no coffin, no revolution - 'cos nobody'd know nuffin' abaht it. Why! There wouldn't be no life at all on Earf in these dyes, wivaht the Press! It's them wot says: "Let there be Light - an' there is Light."
#LORD WILLIAM.
Umm! That's rather a new thought to me.
#LEMMY.
But abaht Muvver, I'll tell yer 'ow we can arrynge. You send 'er the ten bob a week wivaht syin' anyfink, an' she'll fink it comes from Gawd or the Gover'ment yer cawn't tell one from t'other in Befnal Green.
#LORD WILLIAM.
All right; we'll' do that.
#LEMMY.
Will yer reely? I'd like to shyke yer 'and.
#THE PRESS.
"The heartbeat of humanity was in that grasp between the son of toil and the son of leisure."
#LEMMY.
'Ere, 'arf a mo'! Which is which? Daon't forget I'm aht o' wori; Lord William, if that's 'is nyme, is workin 'ard at 'is Anti - Sweats! Wish I could get a job like vat - jist suit me!
#LORD WILLIAM.
That hits hard, Mr. Lemmy.
#LEMMY.
Daon't worry! Yer cawn't 'elp bein' born in the purple!
#LORD WILLIAM.
Ah! Tell me, what would you do in my place?
#LEMMY.
Why - as the nobleman said in 'is well - known wy: "Sit in me Club winder an' watch it ryne on the dam people!" That's if I was a average nobleman! If I was a bit more noble, I might be tempted to come the kind'earted on twenty thou' a year. Some prefers yachts, or ryce 'orses. But philanthropy on the 'ole is syfer, in these dyes.
#LORD WILLIAM.
So you think one takes to it as a sort of insurance, Mr. Lemmy? Is that quite fair?
#LEMMY.
Well, we've all got a weakness towards bein' kind, somewhere abaht us. But the moment wealf comes in, we 'yn't wot I call single - 'earted. If yer went into the foundytions of your wealf - would yer feel like 'avin' any? It all comes from uvver people's 'ard, unpleasant lybour - it's all built on Muvver as yer might sy. An' if yer daon't get rid o' some of it in bein' kind - yer daon't feel syfe nor comfy.
#LORD WILLIAM.
Your philosophy is very pessimistic.
#LEMMY.
Well, I calls meself an optimist; I sees the worst of everyfink. Never disappynted, can afford to 'ave me smile under the blackest sky. When deaf is squeezin' of me windpipe, I shall 'ave a laugh in it! Fact is, if yer've 'ad to do wiv gas an' water pipes, yer can fyce anyfing. 'Ark at the revolution!
#LORD WILLIAM.
I know - hunger and all the rest of it! And here am I, a rich man, and don't know what the deuce to do.
#LEMMY.
Well, I'll tell yer. Throw yer cellars open, an' while the populyce is gettin' drunk, sell all yer 'ave an' go an' live in Ireland; they've got the millennium chronic over there. That's speakin' as a practical man. Speakin' as a synt "Bruvvers, all I 'ave is yours. To - morrer I'm goin' dahn to the Lybour Exchynge to git put on the wytin' list, syme as you!"
#LORD WILLIAM.
But, d - it, man, there we should be, all together! Would that help?
#LEMMY.
Nao; but it'd syve a lot o' blood. Yer thought the Englishman could be taught to shed blood wiv syfety. Not 'im! Once yer git 'im into an 'abit, yer cawn't git 'im out of it agyne. 'E'll go on sheddin' blood mechanical - Conservative by nyture. An' 'e won't myke nuffin' o' yours. Not even the Press wiv 'is 'oneyed words'll sty 'is 'and.
#LORD WILLIAM.
And what do you suggest we could have done, to avoid trouble?
#LEMMY.
I'll tell yer. If all you wealfy nobs wiv kepitel 'ad come it kind from the start after the war yer'd never 'a been 'earin' the Marseillaisy naow. Lord! 'Ow you did talk abaht Unity and a noo spirit in the Country. Noo spirit! Why, soon as ever there was no dynger from outside, yer stawted to myke it inside, wiv an iron'and. Naow, you've been in the war an' it's given yer a feelin' 'eart; but most of the nobs wiv kepitel was too old or too important to fight. They weren't born agyne. So naow that bad times is come, we're 'owlin' for their blood.
#LORD WILLIAM.
I quite agree; I quite agree. I've often said much the same thing.
#LEMMY.
Voice cryin' in the wilderness - I daon't sy we was yngels - there was faults on bofe sides. The Press could ha' helped yer a lot. Shall I tell yer wot the Press did? "It's vital," said the Press, "that the country should be united, or it will never recover." Nao strikes, nao 'omen nature, nao nuffink. Kepitel an' Lybour like the Siamese twins. And, fust dispute that come along, the Press orfs wiv its coat an' goes at it bald'eaded. An' wot abaht since? Sich a riot o' nymes called, in Press - and Pawlyement. Unpatriotic an' outrygeous demands o' lybour. Blood - suckin' tyranny o' Kepitel; thieves an' dawgs an 'owlin Jackybines - gents throwin' books at each other; all the resources of edjucytion exhausted! If I'd bin Prime Minister I'd 'ave 'ad the Press's gas cut 'orf at the meter. Puffect liberty, of course, nao Censorship; just sy wot yer like - an' never be 'eard of no more. Why! 'Is 'end's out o' breath! Fink o' vet!
#LORD WILLIAM.
Great tribute to your eloquence, Mr. Lemmy!
#LADY WILLIAM.
Bill!
#LEMMY.
She calls 'im Bill. 'Ow! 'Yn't she IT?
#LADY WILLIAM.
Have you - spoken to him? Not? What have you been saying, then?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Nothing, he's talked all the time.
#LADY WILLIAM.
What a little caution!
#LORD WILLIAM.
Steady, old girl! He's got his eye on you!
#LADY WILLIAM.
Well, I'm going to tackle him.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Don't 'ee du that, Bob. Yu must forgive'im, Ma'am; it's 'is admiration. 'E was always one for the ladies, and he'm not used to seein' so much of 'em.
#LADY WILLIAM.
Don't you think you owe us an explanation?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Speak up, Bob. My gudeness! 'E've a - lost 'is tongue. I never knu that 'appen to 'e before.
#LORD WILLIAM.
No ill - feeling, you know, Lemmy.
#LADY WILLIAM.
Don't you think it was rather - inconsiderate of you?
#LEMMY.
Muvver, tyke me aht, I'm feelin' fynte!
#POULDER.
The populace, me Lord!
#LADY WILLIAM.
What!
#LORD WILLIAM.
Where've you put 'em, Poulder?
#POULDER.
They've put theirselves in the portico, me Lord.
#LORD WILLIAM.
Phew! I say, this is awful, Nell! Two speeches in one evening. Nothing else for it, I suppose. Open the window, Poulder!
#POULDER.
We are prepared for any sacrifice, me Lord.
#THE PRESS.
"Lady William stood like a statue at bay."
#LORD WILLIAM.
Got one of those lozenges on you, Nell?
#LEMMY.
'Ave one o' my gum drops?
#LORD WILLIAM.
Ah! thanks! Thanks awfully!
#JAMES.
If they get saucy, me Lord, I can always give 'em their own back.
#LORD WILLIAM.
Steady, James; steady!
#HANK.
'Ere they are - the bally plutocrats.
#LORD WILLIAM.
Poulder, go and tell the chef to send out anything there is in the house - nicely, as if it came from nowhere in particular.
#POULDER.
Very good, me Lord. Any wine? If I might suggest - German - 'ock?
#LORD WILLIAM.
What you like.
#POULDER.
Very good, me Lord.
#LORD WILLIAM.
I say, dash it, Nell, my teeth are stuck!
#LADY WILLIAM.
Take it out, darling.
#LORD WILLIAM.
What the deuce did I put it in for?
#THE PRESS.
"With inimitable coolness Lord William prepared to address the crowd."
#LORD WILLIAM.
Stand by to prompt, old girl. Now for it. This ghastly gum drop!
#HANK.
Dahn with the aristo -
#LADY WILLIAM.
Oh! Bill - oh! It's gone into a mouth!
#LORD WILLIAM.
Good God!
#HANK.
Wet's this? Throwin' things? Mind aht, or we'll smash yer winders!
#LORD WILLIAM.
My friends, you've come to the wrong shop. There's nobody in London more sympathetic with you. Look out, old girl; they can see your shoulders. If I were a speaker, I could make you feel -
#HANK.
Look at his white weskit! Blood - suckers - fattened on the people!
#LORD WILLIAM.
I've always said the Government ought to take immediate steps -
#HANK.
To shoot us dahn.
#LORD WILLIAM.
Not a bit. To relieve the - er -
#LADY WILLIAM.
Distress.
#LADY WILLIAM.
Distress, and ensure - er - ensure
#LADY WILLIAM.
Quiet.
#LORD WILLIAM.
No, no. To ensure - ensure -
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh, Daddy!
#HANK.
'E wants to syve 'is dirty great 'ouse.
#LORD WILLIAM.
D - if I do!
#JAMES.
Me Lord, let me blow 'em to glory!
#LORD WILLIAM.
Drop it, James; drop it!
#THE PRESS.
No, no; don't drop it!
#LORD WILLIAM.
Look here, I must have fought alongside some of you fellows in the war. Weren't we jolly well like brothers?
#A VOICE.
Not so much bloomin' "Kamerad"; hand over yer 'Ouse.
#LORD WILLIAM.
I was born with this beastly great house, and money, and goodness knows what other entanglements - a wife and family -
#HANK.
Born with a wife and family!
#LORD WILLIAM.
I feel we're all in the same boat, and I want to pull my weight. If you can show me the way, I'll take it fast enough.
#A DEEP VOICE.
Step dahn then, an' we'll step up.
#ANOTHER VOICE.
'Ear, 'Ear!
#LORD WILLIAM.
By George! I can't get in anywhere!
#LADY WILLIAM.
Then shut the window, Bill.
#LEMMY.
Lemme sy a word to 'em. Cheerio! Cockies! I'm one of yer. Gas an' water I am. Got more grievances an' out of employment than any of yer. I want to see their blood flow, syme as you.
#THE PRESS.
"Born orator - ready cockney wit - saves situation."
#LEMMY.
Wot I sy is: Dahn wiv the country, dahn wiv everyfing. Begin agyne from the foundytions. But we've got to keep one or two o' these 'ere under glawss, to show our future generytions. An' this one is 'armless. His pipes is sahnd, 'is 'eart is good; 'is 'ead is not strong. Is 'ouse will myke a charmin' palace o' varieties where our children can come an' see 'ow they did it in the good old dyes. Yer never see rich waxworks as 'is butler and 'is four conscientious khaki footmen. Why - wot dyer think 'e 'as 'em for - fear they might be out o' - works like you an' me. Nao! Keep this one; 'e's a Flower. 'Arf a mo'! I'll show yer my Muvver. Come 'ere, old lydy; and bring yer trahsers. Tell abaht yer speech to the meetin'.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh dear! Well, I cam' in with me trousers, an' they putt me up on the pedestory at once, so I tole 'em. "I putt in the button'oles, I stretches the flies; I lines the crutch; I putt on this bindin', I presses the seams - Tuppence three farthin's a pair."
#LEMMY.
Seventy - seven! Wot's 'er income? Twelve bob a week; seven from the Gover'ment an' five from the sweat of 'er brow. Look at 'er! 'Yn't she a tight old dear to keep it goin'! No workus for 'er, nao fear! The gryve rather! You cawn't git below 'er - impossible! She's the foundytions of the country - an' rocky 'yn't the word for 'em. Worked 'ard all 'er life, brought up a family and buried 'em on it. Twelve bob a week, an' given when 'er fingers goes, which is very near. Well, naow, this torf 'ere comes to me an' says: "I'd like to do somefin' for yer muvver. 'Ow's ten bob a week?" 'e says. Naobody arst 'im - quite on 'is own. That's the sort 'e is. Sorft. You bring yer muvvers 'ere, 'e'll do the syme for them. I giv yer the 'int.
#HANK.
What's 'is nyme?
#LEMMY.
They calls 'im Bill.
#HANK.
Bill What?
#LITTLE ANN.
Dromondy.
#LADY WILLIAM.
Anne!
#LEMMY.
Dromedary 'is nyme is.
#HANK.
Three cheers for Bill Dromedary.
#LEMMY.
I sy, there's veal an' 'am, an' pork wine at the back for them as wants it; I 'eard the word passed. An' look 'ere, if yer want a flag for the revolution, tyke muvver's trahsers an' tie 'em to the corfin. Yer cawn't 'ave no more inspirin' banner. Ketch! Give Bill a double - barrel fast, to show there's no ill - feelin'. Ip, 'ip!
#THE PRESS.
"And far up in the clear summer air the larks were singing."
#LORD WILLIAM.
James! Ready?
#JAMES.
Me Lord!
#LITTLE ANN.
Daddy!
#LADY WILLIAM.
Bill! It's all right, old man - all right!
#LORD WILLIAM.
Those infernal larks! Thought we were on the Somme again! Ah! Mr. Lemmy, no end obliged to you; you're so decent. Now, why did you want to blow us up before dinner?
#LEMMY.
Blow yer up? "Is it a dream? Then wykin' would be pyne."
#MRS. LEMMY.
Bo - ob! Not so saucy, my boy!
#LEMMY.
Blow yet up? Wot abaht it?
#LADY WILLIAM.
This, Mr. Lemmy!
#LORD WILLIAM.
Come, all's forgiven! But why did you?
#LEMMY.
Orl right! I'm goin' to tyke it awy; it'd a - been a bit ork'ard for me. I'll want it to - mower.
#LORD WILLIAM.
What! To leave somewhere else?
#LEMMY.
'Yus, of course!
#LORD WILLIAM.
No, no; dash it! Tell us what's it filled with?
#LEMMY.
Filled wiv? Nuffin'. Wot did yet expect? Toof - pahder? It's got a bit o' my lead soldered on to it. That's why it's 'eavy!
#LORD WILLIAM.
But what is it?
#LEMMY.
Wot is it? I fought everybody knew 'em.
#LADY WILLIAM.
Mr. Lemmy, you must clear this up, please.
#LEMMY.
Wiv lydies present? 'Adn't I better tell the Press?
#LORD WILLIAM.
All right; tell someone - anyone!
#THE PRESS.
No, no; it's too horrible. It destroys my whole -
#LEMMY.
Well, I tell yer it is.
#THE PRESS.
No, no; I can't have it. All my article! All my article! It can't be - no -
#LEMMY.
I never see sick an obstinate thick - head! Yer 'yn't worvy of yet tryde.
#LEMMY.
Blimy! It amooses 'em, all but the genteel ones. Cheer oh! Press! Yer can always myke somefin' out o' nufun'? It's not the fust thing as 'as existed in yer imaginytion only.
#THE PRESS.
No, d - it; I'll keep it a bomb!
#LEMMY.
Ah! Keep the sensytion. Wot's the troof compared wiv that? Come on, Muvver! Come on, Little Aida! Time we was goin' dahn to 'Earf.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Gude naight, sir; gude naight, ma'am; thank yu for my cup o' tea, an' all yore kindness.
#LEMMY.
Aoh! An' jist one frog! Next time yer build an 'ouse, daon't forget - it's the foundytions as bears the wyte.
#LITTLE ANN.
Oh! Mum! what was it?
