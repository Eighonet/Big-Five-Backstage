#MRS PERKINS.
What I mean t’ say is that it’s not much fun for us.
#MR PERKINS.
All right, Ma.
#MISS PERKINS.
Bother!
#MRS PERKINS.
It makes a long evenin’ of it. Same every night. We ’ave our tea and then we just set down till it’s time to go to bed. It’s not fair.
#MR PERKINS.
Same for all of us.
#MRS PERKINS.
That it’s not.
#MR PERKINS.
Why isn’t it?
#MRS PERKINS.
Do y’ or do y’ not go out o’ this ’ouse every mornin’ and spend the day out?
#MR PERKINS.
It’d be a poor job for you if I didn’t.
#MRS PERKINS.
I don’t say anythin’ about that. I don’t interfere.
#MR PERKINS.
’Ow could y’ interfere?
#MISS PERKINS.
Bother!
#MRS PERKINS.
Don’t interrup’ like that when me and your pa’s talkin’, Polly.
#MISS PERKINS.
My name isn’t Polly.
#MR PERKINS.
What is it?
#MISS PERKINS.
It’s Marie.
#MR PERKINS.
Well, I’m blowed!
#MRS PERKINS.
An’ why shouldn’t she ’ave a bit of a change? She’s tired of bein’ Polly.
#MISS PERKINS.
I do think we might have a little more change.
#MR PERKINS.
Don’t you start.
#MISS PERKINS.
We might have gone out to the pictures to - night, as Mother said.
#MR PERKINS.
Your young man might ’ave come and found you out.
#MISS PERKINS.
You know he’s engaged in the evenings.
#MR PERKINS.
Yes, and what at?
#MISS PERKINS.
Never mind!
#MRS PERKINS.
I do think, Polly, that he ought to be a bit more open with you. What does he do?
#MR PERKINS.
Ay; what does Albert Watkins do?
#MISS PERKINS.
Never you mind!
#MRS PERKINS.
’E’s never told ’er.
#MR PERKINS.
I ’ope it’s nothin’ to be ashamed of.
#MISS PERKINS.
P’raps I know more than you think.
#MRS PERKINS.
’As ’e said?
#MISS PERKINS.
It’s confidential.
#MR PERKINS.
Oh! I know that tale.
#MRS PERKINS.
Well, Polly’s got ’er young man and you’ve got your business an’ out all day seein’ people. What ’ave I got?
#MR PERKINS.
Well, what should y’ ’ave? What does any woman ’ave? I dunno what you’re botherin’ about. Y’ ’ad a week at Margate this year.
#MRS PERKINS.
’Ome from ’ome! good woman ought to like ’er ’ome.
#MRS PERKINS.
I never said I didn’t like it.
#MR PERKINS.
Well -
#MRS PERKINS.
’Ome’s a place to come back to.
#MISS PERKINS.
Mother’s romantic. That’s what she is.
#MRS PERKINS.
What is that, Polly? It’s a word I never rightly -
#MR PERKINS.
Romantic! At ’er age!
#MRS PERKINS.
You know what it is, do y’?
#MR PERKINS.
It’s penny dreadfuls and the pictures and gassin’ about love and the deep blue sea.
#MRS PERKINS.
Well, y’ might do worse.
#MR PERKINS.
Whatever’s come over ’er?
#MRS PERKINS.
I’ve always thought I should like to travel.
#MISS PERKINS.
I think there’s a bit missing.
#MRS PERKINS.
Eh? A bit missin’? That’s the way with me; there’s always bin a bit missin’.
#MR PERKINS.
I dunno why y’re startin’ like this now. Y’ve ’ad all these years to settle down in. What’s come over yer?
#MRS PERKINS.
Eh! Don’t ask me. I think ’er Albert’s comin’ about ’as unsettled me.
#MISS PERKINS.
Albert!
#MRS PERKINS.
Well, I see ’im an’ you and I think what might ’a’ been.
#MR PERKINS.
What’s that?
#MRS PERKINS.
Well, I was young onct.
#MR PERKINS.
But y’re not now.
#MRS PERKINS.
You’ve no call to throw it in m’ teeth.
#MR PERKINS.
Teeth indeed!
#MRS PERKINS.
Don’t be insultin’, Mr Perkins.
#MR PERKINS.
I wasn’t bein’.
#MRS PERKINS.
Yes, y’ was.
#MISS PERKINS.
I don’t see why Albert should unsettle you.
#MRS PERKINS.
If I was you I’d want to know ’ow ’e spends ’is evenings.
#MISS PERKINS.
It’s no business of yours, Ma.
#MR PERKINS.
It’ll be some bus’ness of mine. I think it’s about time Albert spoke to me.
#MISS PERKINS.
Spoke to you?
#MR PERKINS.
Placed ’is position an’ prospects before me.
#MISS PERKINS.
Well, I believe he’s a confidential agent. what!
#MR PERKINS.
What sort of a’ agent?
#MISS PERKINS.
It’s confidential - or financial p’raps.
#MR PERKINS.
He’s kiddin’ yer.
#MRS PERKINS.
Do they work at night?
#MISS PERKINS.
I’ve always understood that Rothschilds and people like that did this business at parties - on the quiet.
#MR PERKINS.
Bosh!
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh, very well, Pa.
#MRS PERKINS.
Well, it’s too late for the movies now.
#MISS PERKINS.
Ah! That’s it.
#MRS PERKINS.
What’s in the paper, Pa?
#MR PERKINS.
There’s a Cabinet crisis.
#MRS PERKINS.
Isn’t there anythin’ interestin’?
#MR PERKINS.
’Ere’s a child stole a shillin’ an’ swallowed it t’ escape detection.
#MRS PERKINS.
Poor thing!
#MR PERKINS.
’Ere! Is this more in your line? Great Jewel Robbery! The Grand Cham’s Diamond missing.
#MRS PERKINS.
Eh! What’s that?
#MISS PERKINS.
Who is the Grand Cham?
#MR PERKINS.
’E’s - one o’ them Eastern potentates. ’E’s been stayin’ at the Majestic Hotel. The dimond was taken out of the settin’ and a walnut substituted. walnut! It must be a whopper.
#MISS PERKINS.
Why did they substitute a walnut?
#MR PERKINS.
You must substitute somethin’.
#MISS PERKINS.
Why?
#MR PERKINS.
I don’t know. They always do. The brightest treasure of the East. Not the slightest trace. Supposed Asiatic gang. Sherlock Holmes and Father Brown have been summoned and a telegram despatched to Mossier Lecock.
#MRS PERKINS.
Well, that’s somethin’ like.
#MISS PERKINS.
What’s it worth?
#MR PERKINS.
Eh! I dunno. Thousands, thousands. They say it makes the Koh - i - noor take a back seat.
#MRS PERKINS.
Reelly?
#MR PERKINS.
What ’ud you do, old lady, if I brought it ’ome for y’r birthday?
#MRS PERKINS.
Well, I’d wear it, I s’pose.
#MISS PERKINS.
You’d never dare, Ma.
#MRS PERKINS.
I would that.
#MISS PERKINS.
But thieves’d always be after it.
#MRS PERKINS.
What ’d these thieves do with it when they’ve got it?
#MR PERKINS.
I s’pose they chop it up and sell it in bits.
#MRS PERKINS.
What a shame!
#MR PERKINS.
I dessay they’re off to South America.
#MRS PERKINS.
Why?
#MR PERKINS.
No extrydition.
#MRS PERKINS.
What’s that? D’ y’ mean last ’dition extra?
#MISS PERKINS.
No, Ma. It means that thieves can’t be turned out.
#MRS PERKINS.
Why not?
#MR PERKINS.
It’s like it used to be with slaves here. Once the South American flag’s waved over ’em, they’re all right.
#MISS PERKINS.
It isn’t all one country there, Pa.
#MR PERKINS.
Well, I reckon they’re much of a muchness.
#MRS PERKINS.
An’ could you sell it there?
#MR PERKINS.
Yes, they’re great people for jewl’ry.
#MRS PERKINS.
Polly, you’re doin’ nothin’. Y’ might as well be mendin’ that blind.
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh, bother!
#MRS PERKINS.
It looks bad hangin’ down like that.
#MISS PERKINS.
People’ll see in.
#MRS PERKINS.
There’s not many passin’ at this time o’ night.
#MISS PERKINS.
It makes it so public. Where’s the white thread, Ma?
#MRS PERKINS.
Here y’ are. Now, make a job of it.
#MRS PERKINS.
Might as well all be asleep.
#MISS PERKINS.
Listen, Ma!
#MRS PERKINS.
Somebody runnin’. Seem in an ’urry.
#MISS PERKINS.
Good gracious!
#MRS PERKINS.
Mercy on us!
#MR PERKINS.
Fire! Where is it?
#MRS PERKINS.
Nonsense, Pa! It’s them boys. Out arter ’em.
#MR PERKINS.
What! Where?
#MISS PERKINS.
No. Don’t go. Don’t leave us. It can’t be boys.
#MR PERKINS.
This is very careless, Polly.
#MISS PERKINS.
It wasn’t me. It’s a stone, I think.
#MRS PERKINS.
They’re far enough now. Where is it?
#MISS PERKINS.
I’m all of a tremble.
#MRS PERKINS.
You ought to ’ave run right out, Pa, and you might ’ave caught ’em. I never did see such a thing.
#MR PERKINS.
It’s an outrage, this is. Did y’ see anybody?
#MRS PERKINS.
We ’eard somebody runnin’.
#MISS PERKINS.
I thought I ’eard somebody passing after that. Quietly like. Runnin’ very light.
#MR PERKINS.
Nonsense, Polly. Better put that blind up now.
#MISS PERKINS.
You put it up.
#MR PERKINS.
Do as I tell you.
#MISS PERKINS.
I don’t like.
#MRS PERKINS.
’Ere, ’ere. Give it me.
#MISS PERKINS.
Come away, Ma.
#MR PERKINS.
Where’s the stone?
#MISS PERKINS.
Here it is. Here’s something. Why! it’s a lump of glass.
#MR PERKINS.
Let’s look!
#MRS PERKINS.
Let me see.
#MR PERKINS.
I say!
#MISS PERKINS.
What is it? What is it?
#MRS PERKINS.
Give it me, Polly.
#MR PERKINS.
Hold it up to the light.
#MISS PERKINS.
Why! What can it be?
#MRS PERKINS.
Nonsense! Nonsense!
#MR PERKINS.
It’s a rum thing, this is.
#MISS PERKINS.
Eh! Isn’t it beautiful?
#MR PERKINS.
It might be a -
#MISS PERKINS.
Diamond?
#MR PERKINS.
Nonsense!
#MRS PERKINS.
Hide it!
#MISS PERKINS.
Why! What d’ y’ mean, Ma!
#MRS PERKINS.
It’s it.
#MR PERKINS.
What’s it?
#MRS PERKINS.
You know.
#MR PERKINS.
What - what - what rubbish! The idea!
#MRS PERKINS.
It’s the Grand Cham’s dimond.
#MR PERKINS.
Then it’s dangerous.
#MRS PERKINS.
Never mind that.
#MISS PERKINS.
What shall we do?
#MRS PERKINS.
Stop that, Polly.
#MR PERKINS.
P’raps we’d better look out for a policeman.
#MRS PERKINS.
No.
#MR PERKINS.
If it is it we’re not safe.
#MRS PERKINS.
I don’t care.
#MR PERKINS.
But what d’ y’ want to do?
#MRS PERKINS.
Here! Let’s put it inside the clock. Now!
#MR PERKINS.
What are y’ up to, Ma?
#MISS PERKINS.
I wish you’d throw it out in the street again.
#MRS PERKINS.
No, no.
#MR PERKINS.
But what are y’ up to?
#MRS PERKINS.
It’s come to us, this ’as. We’ll stick to it if we can.
#MR PERKINS.
But -
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh, Ma!
#MRS PERKINS.
They may not find the ’ouse again. They’re all alike in this street.
#MR PERKINS.
There’s the broken window.
#MRS PERKINS.
Let’s ’ave the bits of glass out. Then it won’t be noticed.
#MR PERKINS.
You’ve cut yourself now.
#MRS PERKINS.
Never mind that. Polly, pick all the bits off the floor. Don’t leave a trace.
#MR PERKINS.
Now, what’s all this about?
#MISS PERKINS.
I dunno what’s come over ’er.
#MRS PERKINS.
’Ere, Polly, look alive. ’Ave y’ got ’em all?
#MISS PERKINS.
All I can find.
#MRS PERKINS.
Drat it! A bit’s fallen outside. Go out and pick it up, Pa. No; p’raps better not.
#MR PERKINS.
Look here! What’s y’r game?
#MRS PERKINS.
Give here! If anyone comes, mind we know nothin’ about it.
#MR PERKINS.
It depends ’oo comes, doesn’t it?
#MRS PERKINS.
No.
#MR PERKINS.
It might be the police.
#MRS PERKINS.
Never mind the police.
#MR PERKINS.
Why! What d’ y’ mean? What do y’ mean?
#MRS PERKINS.
It’s the chanct of a lifetime. We’ll take it.
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh, Ma!
#MR PERKINS.
Look ’ere -
#MRS PERKINS.
It’s come to us. It might a’ bin the answer to a prayer.
#MR PERKINS.
Was it?
#MRS PERKINS.
Not exactly, but I’ve been thinkin’ a lot.
#MR PERKINS.
More likely the devil.
#MRS PERKINS.
There’s no such thing. Y’re talkin’ nonsense.
#MR PERKINS.
No devil. Then is there God?
#MRS PERKINS.
There may be. ’E may ’av sent it.
#MR PERKINS.
It’s awful talk, this.
#MISS PERKINS.
Why! What could you do with it?
#MRS PERKINS.
Chop it up and sell it.
#MR PERKINS.
Where?
#MRS PERKINS.
In South America.
#MR PERKINS.
Good ’eavens!
#MISS PERKINS.
Ma, how can you?
#MR PERKINS.
’Ave y’ took leave of y’r senses?
#MRS PERKINS.
Yes, if y’ like.
#MR PERKINS.
Well, I’ve ’eard tell as women aren’t honest like men and now I know it.
#MRS PERKINS.
’Ow do I know you’re honest?
#MR PERKINS.
I’ve never took a thing in my life. I’ve a record, ’aven’t I?
#MRS PERKINS.
I dessay. I dunno. I won’t give it up. I won’t. I won’t. So there!
#MR PERKINS.
’Ow can y’ ’elp it?
#MRS PERKINS.
I’ve sat there darnin’ and mendin’, waitin’ and dozin’ till I’m tired. I’ve never ’ad a go at anythin’. The chanct ’as come.
#MISS PERKINS.
I did think you were honest, Ma.
#MRS PERKINS.
Honest! It’s ours.
#MR PERKINS.
’Ow can it be?
#MRS PERKINS.
’Oo’s is it?
#MR PERKINS.
Why! That Grand Cham’s.
#MRS PERKINS.
An’ ’ow did ’e get it? ’E’s a tyrant. ’E stole it off some nigger. Now it’s come to me. It’s mine. It’s mine as much as anyone’s. It’s come like a miracle.
#MISS PERKINS.
But you can’t keep it.
#MR PERKINS.
Y’r ma amazes me.
#MRS PERKINS.
First thing in the mornin’ y’ll get a list o’ them ships sailin’ for South America.
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh, Ma! Ma!
#MR PERKINS.
She’s off ’er chump.
#MRS PERKINS.
I’ll go alone if y’ like.
#MR PERKINS.
It’s dangerous. It’s dangerous. There may be a revolver levelled at y’ now.
#MRS PERKINS.
I don’t care.
#MR PERKINS.
I never knew she was like this.
#MISS PERKINS.
South America? Where? shall ’ave jewels and dresses no end, Polly.
#MISS PERKINS.
Don’t, Ma.
#MR PERKINS.
South America! Like that chap Jabez Balfour.
#MISS PERKINS.
He was brought back, wasn’t he?
#MR PERKINS.
I object to be put along of ’im, any’ow.
#MRS PERKINS.
We’d manage better than that. Riches! Livin’ at ease. Motors an’ champagne. We’ve never ’ad a chanct!
#MR PERKINS.
It can’t be done. It’s all nonsense. An’ it’s ’orrible to think of.
#MRS PERKINS.
Oh! It’s a beautiful thing. I couldn’t bear to break it up. We’ll keep it. We’ll look at it now and then. Every Sunday.
#MR PERKINS.
Sunday!
#MRS PERKINS.
I could go on settin’ ’ere if I knew it was there all the time. I think I could be ’appy.
#MISS PERKINS.
You’d never be safe.
#MRS PERKINS.
Safe! I’ve bin too safe.
#MR PERKINS.
Oh, missis! Oh, missis!
#MISS PERKINS.
It’s strange nobody’s come.
#MRS PERKINS.
Nobody’s comin’. It’s a gift.
#MR PERKINS.
It may not be - what y’ think.
#MRS PERKINS.
It is.
#MR PERKINS.
Then they’ll be after us. Police - or worse.
#MRS PERKINS.
Let ’em come.
#MR PERKINS.
Now, there.
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh, dear!
#MRS PERKINS.
You’ll not say a word. You’ll do as I tell you. Mind that. We know nothing.
#MISS PERKINS.
There’s the window.
#MRS PERKINS.
Leave that to me.
#MR PERKINS.
Oh! But, I say -
#MRS PERKINS.
Thomas Perkins, you’ll rue it to your dyin’ day if -
#MR PERKINS.
Who’s goin’?
#MRS PERKINS.
I am. Remember!
#MISS PERKINS.
What are we to do, Pa?
#MR PERKINS.
Eh! I’m beat.
#MISS PERKINS.
Shall we throw it out of the window?
#MR PERKINS.
No, no. Best not. Humour her a bit. It may be nothin’.
#MRS PERKINS.
No, you don’t. ’Ere. I tell yer -
#EVERYCHILD.
Excuse me.
#MRS PERKINS.
Pa, ’ere’s a man forcin’ ’is way -
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh, dear!
#MR PERKINS.
Dash it all! I say!
#MRS PERKINS.
Well, I must say! Pushin’ a lady about like that! What bis’ness ’ave y’ ’ere?
#EVERYCHILD.
I’ve told you, madam. fine tale! Y’r boy an’ ’is glass marble! Where is ’e? I tell yer we know nothin’ about it. Do we, Pa?
#MR PERKINS.
Now what’s all this?
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh, Ma!
#MRS PERKINS.
Shut up!
#EVERYCHILD.
I’m sorry to intrude, sir, but I’ve lost something in your room.
#MRS PERKINS.
What nonsense! ’Ow could yer?
#EVERYCHILD.
As I have told this lady, my little boy -
#MRS PERKINS.
Where is ’e?
#EVERYCHILD.
His favourite glass marble. He pretended to throw it. It slipped from his hand and, I am sorry to say, went through your window. I apologise and shall be glad to pay. Please give me the - marble at once. Where is it? I’ve no time to lose.
#MRS PERKINS.
Where’s the boy?
#EVERYCHILD.
He’s just round the corner. y’ expect us to believe that tale?
#EVERYCHILD.
You’d better. Now, sir!
#MR PERKINS.
It’s a bit thick, y’ know; I mean thin.
#EVERYCHILD.
It will have to do. No trifling. Come!
#MRS PERKINS.
None o’ y’r liberties here. Get out!
#MR PERKINS.
’Ere, y’ know! Ma, I don’t like it.
#EVERYCHILD.
The devil! Where’s the glass?
#MRS PERKINS.
What glass?
#EVERYCHILD.
The pane’s gone. You see! I knew this was the house.
#MRS PERKINS.
That’s easy explained.
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh, Ma! Tell him and -
#MRS PERKINS.
Of course I’ll tell ’im. It’s my daughter’s newfangled ideas of ventilation. She would ’ave it so. It’s been that way a fortnight. No - let’s see - to - day’s Tuesday. Nigh on a month.
#EVERYCHILD.
Damnation! Where is it? Where’s the diamond?
#MRS PERKINS.
The diamond!
#EVERYCHILD.
Yes, let me tell you then. Your lives are in danger. You’ve got the Grand Cham’s diamond.
#MR PERKINS.
’Ow did it get ’ere?
#EVERYCHILD.
The thief was pursued. He threw it in.
#MR PERKINS.
Why did ’e throw it in ’ere?
#EVERYCHILD.
Don’t be a fool.
#MRS PERKINS.
An’ ’oo are you?
#EVERYCHILD.
I am - the Grand Cham’s representative.
#MRS PERKINS.
Prove it.
#EVERYCHILD.
Enough of this.
#MR PERKINS.
Ma! Ma!
#EVERYCHILD.
Where is it?
#MRS PERKINS.
I’ll tell yer.
#EVERYCHILD.
At once.
#MRS PERKINS.
I’ve swallered it.
#EVERYCHILD.
What!
#MRS PERKINS.
It went down as easy as a oyster.
#EVERYCHILD.
Swallowed it! You’re joking!
#MRS PERKINS.
No. I got the idea out of the evenin’ paper. Where is it, Pa? ’Ere. “Child swallows Shillin’. Curious Case.”
#EVERYCHILD.
Is this true?
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh, I don’t know. see, I was asleep.
#EVERYCHILD.
Asleep!
#MR PERKINS.
Wasn’t I, Mother?
#MRS PERKINS.
’E’d sleep through anythin’. you mean to say - ? Where is it?
#MRS PERKINS.
I’ve just told yer.
#EVERYCHILD.
On your oath -
#MRS PERKINS.
Oath! D’ y’ doubt the word of a lady?
#EVERYCHILD.
Then - d’ you feel it - I mean - whereabouts is it now?
#MRS PERKINS.
I don’t think that’s a question a gentleman ’d ask.
#EVERYCHILD.
Kites of hell! You’ll have to be cut open.
#MRS PERKINS.
Nay, I won’t.
#EVERYCHILD.
Cremation? Would it melt the diamond?
#MRS PERKINS.
I won’t be cremated. There! Y’ ’ve to get the deceased’s consent. I’m goin’ to be buried when my time comes.
#EVERYCHILD.
What’s to be done? An emetic?
#MRS PERKINS.
You’d better go ’ome an’ say it’s lost.
#EVERYCHILD.
Unhappy woman! Do you understand that your life is a trifle, a pawn in the game?
#MRS PERKINS.
Pawn! Yes, an’ y’ can’t get it out without the ticket.
#EVERYCHILD.
It’s impossible. It can’t be. The truth! Did she swallow it? If she did, she dies.
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh, no, no. She didn’t.
#MRS PERKINS.
You silly!
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh, Ma!
#MR PERKINS.
Ma, Ma, what can we do?
#MRS PERKINS.
Y can ’old y’r tongues. Y’re no ’elp at all.
#EVERYCHILD.
What folly this is! What can you do with it? That diamond means death to you. Death! Destruction! You haven’t a chance of keeping it. You’re mad. Your lives now are not worth a minute’s purchase.
#MISS PERKINS.
Give it up, Ma. I’ll tell you where it is. It’s -
#MRS PERKINS.
Stop!
#MR PERKINS.
What can you do, Ma? Chuck it! Chuck it!
#MRS PERKINS.
’E don’t bluff me. ’E’s in a great ’urry. I believe ’e’s the thief.
#EVERYCHILD.
Thousand devils! We’re wasting time. Your clock’s slow. It’s stopped. It was that time when I came in.
#MISS PERKINS.
Tell him. Tell him.
#MR PERKINS.
Oh, chuck it!
#EVERYCHILD.
What stopped the clock?
#MISS PERKINS.
Give it ’im.
#MRS PERKINS.
Polly, I’m ashamed of yer.
#EVERYCHILD.
Is it there?
#MRS PERKINS.
No, it’s not; and y’ shan’t meddle with my furniture.
#EVERYCHILD.
Move aside!
#MRS PERKINS.
Move aside yerself.
#EVERYCHILD.
Is it there? Quick!
#MISS PERKINS.
Albert!
#MRS PERKINS.
What! It’s Albert.
#ALBERT.
Who’s got it?
#MR PERKINS.
He’s gone.
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh! Albert!
#ALBERT.
Where’s the diamond?
#MR PERKINS.
It was in the clock.
#ALBERT.
The clock? Where is it?
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh! Albert!
#MR PERKINS.
’E’s taken it. ’E’s got the clock.
#MRS PERKINS.
Nay, ’e ’asn’t.
#MR PERKINS.
Well, I’m blowed!
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh, Ma!
#ALBERT.
What is it? Have you got it?
#MRS PERKINS.
I’ve got it right enough.
#ALBERT.
No, he won’t.
#MRS PERKINS.
How d’ y’ know?
#ALBERT.
I know.
#MRS PERKINS.
Polly, just put that blind back, will yer? I don’t like bein’ too public.
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh! I daren’t.
#ALBERT.
Now, ma’am, give it to me.
#MRS PERKINS.
Eh?
#ALBERT.
Let’s have it. Quick.
#MRS PERKINS.
Where d’ you come in, Albert?
#ALBERT.
Come on. This’ll be the making o’ me. me too, I ’ope. But ’adn’t we all better be movin’?
#MISS PERKINS.
Where to, Ma?
#MRS PERKINS.
Out at the back door. Pack a few things in a bag.
#ALBERT.
What are y’ up to? Whad’ y’r mean?
#MRS PERKINS.
Now, Albert, there’s no time to make explanations. We’re all in at this, aren’t we?
#ALBERT.
Well - in a way. But look here -
#MRS PERKINS.
South America’s the place, isn’t it? D’ y’ know anythin’ o’ the sailin’s! Or ’ad we better cross to France? Better take the midnight train somewhere.
#ALBERT.
Has she gone dotty?
#MRS PERKINS.
Y’re all asleep. Come on, Polly. A few things in a bag. Now, Pa. Better put this light out p’raps. Is the front door shut? Look at the time - table, Pa.
#ALBERT.
Give me the diamond. I dunno what y’re talkin’ about.
#MRS PERKINS.
Nay, I stick to this.
#ALBERT.
You can’t! What nonsense! Give it here! This job’s the making o’ me. Let’s have it.
#MRS PERKINS.
Nay, it’s mine an’ I’ll stick to it.
#ALBERT.
Yours!
#MRS PERKINS.
Yes. Dimonds like this belongs to them as can get ’em. Nobody’s honest with things like this. I got it an’ y’ shall all share. But it’s mine. It’s mine. Eh! It’s a beauty. I’d stick to this if all the p’lice in London was after me.
#ALBERT.
Y’d do what?
#MRS PERKINS.
Ay, an’ Scotland Yard too.
#ALBERT.
Bah! I’m Scotland Yard.
#MRS PERKINS.
What!
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh! Albert!
#ALBERT.
Didn’t y’ know? Didn’t y’ guess? Didn’t y’ understand? What did y’ take me for?
#MRS PERKINS.
D’y mean to say - ?
#ALBERT.
I mean t’ say it’s ’igh time I was on my way back with this dimond. The gang’s all rounded up by this time.
#MISS PERKINS.
The gang?
#MR PERKINS.
That feller was one of ’em, then? Where is he?
#ALBERT.
He was copped when he left ’ere. Y’ didn’t know y’r ’ouse was surrounded.
#MRS PERKINS.
But ’ow did the dimond come ’ere? ’Oo threw it in?
#ALBERT.
I did.
#MISS PERKINS.
You!
#MR PERKINS.
You did!
#ALBERT.
I did that.
#MR PERKINS.
Why?
#ALBERT.
Becos they were after me. I was a dead man if I stuck to it then. I threw it in ’ere to gain time and knowin’ the ’ouse.
#MISS PERKINS.
Well, I never!
#ALBERT.
They’re a desp’rate lot.
#MR PERKINS.
It’s all most unusual. Never since I’ve been an ’ouse’older ’ave I -
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh, Albert! You might ’ave told me.
#ALBERT.
I ’ad my reasons.
#MRS PERKINS.
Y’re a detective, then?
#ALBERT.
I am that. So let’s ’ave it. I tell yer I must be off.
#MRS PERKINS.
Look at it, Albert!
#ALBERT.
I see it.
#MRS PERKINS.
Can y’ be honest? Look at it!
#ALBERT.
She’s off ’er chump.
#MR PERKINS.
She doesn’t reelly mean it. I’ve borne a ’igh character all my life.
#MRS PERKINS.
It’s my dimond.
#MISS PERKINS.
I’m ashamed of my ma.
#MR PERKINS.
My employers ’as always put the utmost confidence in me.
#ALBERT.
What’s she up to? Now ma’am, you’ll just ’and that over or -
#MRS PERKINS.
Or?
#ALBERT.
I wouldn’t ’andle yer myself.
#MRS PERKINS.
That’s it, is it?
#ALBERT.
That’s it.
#MRS PERKINS.
Then let it go the way it came.
#MR PERKINS.
’Old on. There’s another pane gone!
#ALBERT.
O ’ell!
#MISS PERKINS.
You’ll ruin us, Ma.
#MRS PERKINS.
A good shuttance.
#MISS PERKINS.
Oh! I hope he’ll find it. There he is, and a policeman’s with him. They’ve got it, I think. Yes. Albert, Albert! I wish he’d look up. They’re seeing if it’s damaged. There! He’s waved his hand.
#MRS PERKINS.
Well, we’ve ’ad quite a busy evenin’.
#MISS PERKINS.
I don’t know what Albert’ll think of you.
#MRS PERKINS.
’E’s not going to marry me, thank ’eaven. y’ want t’ know what I think of yer?
#MRS PERKINS.
Go on! Y’ve no ’magernation.
#MISS PERKINS.
I never thought to be ashamed of my own mother.
#MR PERKINS.
Wantin’ in the very el’ments of morality. I wonder ’ow Sossiety ’d get on if they was all like you.
#MRS PERKINS.
Polly, put up that blind. It’s a bit chilly with them broken panes.
#MISS PERKINS.
Most unladylike as well.
#MRS PERKINS.
’Ow much did y’ say it was worth, Pa?
#MR PERKINS.
Never mind.
#MRS PERKINS.
Well, I ’ad my bit o’ fun for onct.
