#MONS.
That's four o'clock, is it not?
#THE WIFE.
Of course.
#MONS.
Sounds like fire.
#THE WIFE.
Is that any special sound?
#MONS.
Yes, it sounds like "help - help, help - help!"
#THE WIFE.
That's the way it has sounded ever since the King carried off our bells, it seems to me.
#MONS.
Be quiet! And don't talk behind anybody's back. The King will soon be here himself.
#THE WIFE.
Has the King sent word of his visit, as you have put everything in order to receive him?
#MONS.
Not exactly, but when he sends word that he is coming to Copperberg, it is not to be expected that he will pass by his friend Mons Nilsson, who helped him in the days of trial, and who has stood by him both against Master Knut and Peder the Chancellor, not to speak of the False Sture. And he acted as godfather for my girl besides.
#THE WIFE.
That was a good while ago; but when the King's bailiff came here to get the bells two years ago, you helped to kill him.
#MONS.
That was two years ago, and I guess he was set on having our heads at that time. But just then King Christian broke into the country from Norway. Our own King turned meek as a lamb at once, and when he asked us for help, we Dalecarlians stood by him like one man, and gave him all the help he wanted. So I think we can call it even.
#THE WIFE.
So you think, but the King never calls it even except when it is to his own advantage.
#MONS.
Perhaps not. But as long as Christian still is free, he will not dare to break with us.
#THE WIFE.
Well, is Christian still free?
#MONS.
I have heard nothing to the contrary. Anyhow, the King owes us such a lot of money that, leaving old friendship aside....
#THE WIFE.
God bless you! And I hope He will protect you from the friend that is always breaking his word and safe - conduct!
#MONS.
Don't open the old wounds, but let bygones be bygones.
#THE WIFE.
If you do that, and he won't, you can hardly call it a reconciliation. Take care!
#MONS.
The sound of that bell is really dreadful!
#THE WIFE.
So it is to my ears, because it always reminds me of the big Mary, which the bailiff took away. Do you remember when the Mary was cast out of the best refined copper and the whole town brought milk and cream to give the clay of the form more firmness - and then, when the melt was ready, we threw in one - half of our table silver to improve the tone? It was baptised at Candlemas and rung for the first time at the burial of my father.... And then it went to Herman Israel at Luebeck, who made coin out of it.
#MONS.
All that is perfectly true, but now it must be forgotten - or we shall never have peace. BARBRO, their daughter, enters with a basket full of finely chopped spruce branches; she is dressed in black and white, and so are several younger children who follow her, also carrying baskets. All of them begin to spread the chopped spruce over the floor.
#THE WIFE.
Is there to be a funeral?
#MONS.
No, but not being the season, we couldn't get any leaves.
#THE WIFE.
I think the children might put off their mourning at least.
#MONS.
No, that's just what they should not do, because when the King asks whom they are mourning - well, what are you to answer, Barbro?
#BARBRO.
"We mourn our beloved teacher, Pastor John at Svärdsjö."
#MONS.
And what are you to say, if the King asks you why?
#BARBRO.
"Because he was an early friend of King Gustavus and saved his precious life for our country."
#MONS.
What year was that?
#BARBRO.
"The very year when Christian the Tyrant cut the head off the Swedish nobility."
#MONS.
That's right, children. And over there you see the picture of Master John when he is holding the towel for the outlaw who has been threshing in the barn. On the other hand, it is not necessary to tell the children that the King took his friend's head two years ago.
#THE WIFE.
Have you really that much sense left? - Do you think the King likes any reminder of a deed that has brought him so little honour?
#MONS.
Let him like it or dislike it, he'll have to swallow it. It was an ugly deed, and Master John was a saint and a martyr, who died for his faith - the faith of his childhood, which he would not forswear.
#BARBRO.
Is the King to sit here?
#MONS.
Yes, child, that's where the marvellous man of God is to sit when he visits his friend Mons Nilsson of Aspeboda. His whole life is like a miracle story, children: how the Lord guided him out of a Danish prison up to Dalecarlia, and how, after many hardships, he finally freed his country from oppression. Those pictures on the walls tell you the whole story, down to the moment when the ski - runner overtook him at Sälen, close by the Norwegian border - line.
#BARBRO.
Is it true, father, that the ski - runner was named Engelbrecht, like the great chieftain we had in the past century?
#MONS.
Yes, it's true, child, and we used to speak of it as "the finger of God," but now we call it mere superstition.
#THE WIFE.
Don't put that sort of thing into the children's heads!
#MONS.
Oh, keep quiet! I teach the children nothing but what is right and proper. - And bear in mind, little girls, that, no matter what you may hear, you must never believe or say anything bad of the King. Earth bears no heavier burden than a thankless man. And for that reason you must sing the ballad of King Gustav when he comes here. Do you still remember it?
#BARBRO.
Oh, yes!
#MONS.
Let me hear you read it then.
#BARBRO.
,
#CHILDREN.
,
#MONS.
That's good, children. Go back to your own room now, and be ready when the time comes. and the CHILDREN. But won't the King frighten us?
#MONS.
Oh, he is not at all dangerous, and he is very fond of children. Besides, he is your godfather, Barbro.
#THE WIFE.
Do you know what you are doing?
#MONS.
Hope so! Of course, I know what you mean?
#THE WIFE.
What do I mean?
#MONS.
That I should take your advice. So I have done in the past, and it has ended badly every time.
#THE WIFE.
Try it once more!
#MONS.
No!
#THE WIFE.
Then - may the will of God be done!
#MONS.
That's the longest afternoon I have ever lived through! - And my friends don't seem to be coming.
#THE WIFE.
Yes, I think I hear them outside.
#MONS.
Well, you were right that time!
#MONS.
God be with you, Anders Persson! God be with you, Nils Söderby! God be with you, Inghel Hansson! God be with you, Master Stig! Come forward and be seated.
#ANDERS.
You are getting ready, I see.
#MONS.
So we are. - And where's the King?
#ANDERS.
The other side of the hill, says the ski - runner that just returned.
#MONS.
As near as that? - And what errand is supposed to bring him here?
#ANDERS.
Ask Nils of Söderby.
#NILS.
They say he is headed for Norway to fight Christian.
#INGHEL.
There are others who think that he is coming to thank us Dalecarlians for the good help rendered in his last fight.
#STIG.
That would not be like him.
#ANDERS.
To thank anybody - no, indeed!
#MONS.
Do you think there is any cause for fear?
#NILS.
Not while Christian is still free.
#INGHEL.
It's queer that we should have to look to Christian for safety.
#STIG.
We knew what we had, but not what we might get. Christian took the heads of the noble lords and left the people alone. This one leaves the lords alone and rides roughshod over the people. Who should be called a tyrant?
#MONS.
Be quiet now!
#ANDERS.
In other words, the last war of liberation was fought against our liberator. Did we know at all what we were doing at that time?
#INGHEL.
We were to clear the country of the Danes; and the first man to raise his hand for the King against the Danes in our parts was Rasmus Dane, who killed Nils Westgoth. That was a strange beginning.... strange beginning, indeed, but just like the ending.
#NILS.
The King is coming.
#MONS.
In the name of the Lord, be quiet! That kind of talk will bring no peace. - All that you say is true, of course, but what has happened was the will of Providence -
#STIG.
Which let the children have their will in order that they should see their own folly.
#ANDERS.
Are you quite sure that the King will visit you, Mons Nilsson?
#MONS.
What a question!
#ANDERS.
Remember Master John!
#MONS.
Let us forget! Everything must be forgotten.
#ANDERS.
No wonder if you and NILS want to forget that you burned the King's house at Hedemora and looted Räfvelstad two years ago! But he will never forget it.
#ALL.
What's that?
#MONS.
Don't you know the hornet that buzzes before it stings?
#ANDERS.
That's the kind of noise he made that Ash Wednesday at Tuna Flat.
#INGHEL.
Don't mention that blood - bath, or I can't control myself. Don't talk of it!
#NILS.
Hear him spinning, spinning like a cat! No, don't trust him!
#STIG.
Might it not be wise for you, as personal friends of the King, to meet him and bid the stem master welcome?
#MONS.
I wonder. Then he might not come here afterward....
#THE WIFE.
Stay, Mons! Stay where you are!
#MONS.
Oh, the place smells of spruce, and the drums are flattened as for a funeral. Who's that?
#THE WIFE.
Pray for us!
#MONS.
Who is doing me the honour?
#OLAVUS.
I am the acting secretary of his Highness, the King. And this is the venerable representative of the free city of Luebeck.
#MONS.
Come in, my good sirs, and - let us hear the news!
#OLAVUS.
The King is here and has pitched his camp on Falu Flat. Personally he has taken his abode at the Gildhall of Saint Jorghen.
#MONS.
What is the errand that has made the King cross Långhed Forest and Brunbeck Ford without permission and safe - conduct?
#OLAVUS.
He hasn't told.
#MONS.
Then I had better go and ask him.
#OLAVUS.
With your leave, this is the message our gracious lord, the King, sends you through us: "Greetings to the goodly miners of the Copperberg, and let every man stay in his own house." If he desires speech with any one, that one will be called.
#MONS.
What is the meaning of it?
#OLAVUS.
I don't know.
#ANDERS.
Has the Danish war come to an end, sir?
#OLAVUS.
I don't know.
#ANDERS.
Do you know with whom you are talking?
#OLAVUS.
No, I don't.
#ANDERS.
I am Anders Persson of Rankhyttan. Have you ever heard that name before?
#OLAVUS.
Yes - it's a good name.
#MONS.
Is that chap from Luebeck a royal person, too?
#OLAVUS.
No, he is not, but he is in charge of the national debt, and we must never forget that our gracious King was able to free our country of the Danes only with the help of Luebeck.
#MONS.
With the help of Luebeck only? And how about the Dalecarlians?
#OLAVUS.
Oh, of course, they helped, too.
#MONS.
Does he speak Swedish?
#OLAVUS.
I don't think so, but I am not sure of it.
#MONS.
Is that so?
#OLAVUS.
We happened to arrive together, but I have not yet spoken to him.
#MONS.
Very strange! I suppose the King has sent him?
#OLAVUS.
Probably.
#MONS.
Perhaps he is the fellow who buys up the bells?
#OLAVUS.
Perhaps.
#MONS.
And the church silver?
#OLAVUS.
And the church silver, too!
#MONS.
What was his name again?
#OLAVUS.
Herman Israel.
#MONS.
Oh, Israel!
#OLAVUS.
Our gracious lord, the King, requests Inghel Hansson to meet him at Saint Jorghen's Gild.
#INGHEL.
Well, well, am I to be the first?
#NILS.
The oldest first.
#MONS.
Stand up for yourself, Inghel, and tell the truth. The King is a gracious gentleman who won't mind a plain word in proper time.
#INGHEL.
Don't you worry. I have said my say to kings before now.
#OLAVUS.
Well, Nils, how is the mining nowadays?
#NILS.
Not bad, thank you. The last fall flood left a little water in the mine, but otherwise we have nothing to complain of.
#OLAVUS.
Times are good, then?
#NILS.
Well, you might say so.... Hm! Good times will mean better taxes, I suppose?
#OLAVUS.
I know nothing about the taxes.
#ANDERS.
Oh, yes, and plenty of cattle in the pastures, too.
#OLAVUS.
Old Dalecarlia is a pretty good country, is it not?
#MONS.
Yes, everything is fat here - dripping with fat, so that one can eat the bark off the trees even.
#OLAVUS.
Yes, they have told me that you have to eat bark and chew resin now and then. Is that a common thing or does it happen only once in a while?
#NILS.
When the famine comes, you have to eat what you can get.
#OLAVUS.
There is something you should know, Master Stig. How was it during the last famine, when the King sent grain to be distributed here: did it go to those who needed it?
#STIG.
Yes, it did, although there was not enough of it.
#OLAVUS.
Was there not enough of it?
#ANDERS.
That depends on what you mean by "enough."
#OLAVUS.
Do you know what is meant by "enough," Mons Nilsson?
#MONS.
Oh, well, everybody knows that.
#OLAVUS.
As we now know what is meant by "enough," I ask you, Master Stig Larsson, if anybody perished from hunger during the last famine?
#STIG.
Man doth not live by bread only....
#OLAVUS.
There you spoke a true word, Master Stig, but....
#OLAVUS.
The King requests Nils Söderby to meet him at Saint Jorghen's Gildhall.
#NILS.
Won't Inghel Hansson come back first?
#OLAVUS.
I don't know.
#NILS.
Well, nobody is afraid here, and....
#OLAVUS.
What have you to be afraid of?
#NILS.
Nothing! The big bell at Mora has not been taken out of Siljan valley yet, Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson. That's a devil of a bell, and when it begins to tinkle, they can hear it way over in Norway, and fourteen thousand men stand like one!
#OLAVUS.
I don't understand what you mean.
#NILS.
But you two understand! God bless you and defend you!
#MONS.
What do you mean?
#ANDERS.
What are you thinking of, Nils?
#NILS.
Oh, my thoughts are running so fast that I can't keep up with them. But one thing I am sure of: that it's going hard with Inghel Hansson.
#OLAVUS.
Is this sulphur smoke always hanging over the place?
#MONS.
Mostly when the wind is in the east.
#OLAVUS.
Is it the quartz or the pyrites that make the worst smoke?
#ANDERS.
Why do you ask?
#OLAVUS.
That's a poor answer!
#MONS.
May I ask you in return whether King Christian still is free?
#OLAVUS.
Do you put your trust in the enemy? What kind of a man is Nils of Söderby?
#MONS.
His friends think him better and his enemies worse than anybody else.
#OLAVUS.
What kind of a bell in the Siljan valley was that you spoke of?
#MONS.
It's the largest one in all Dalecarlia.
#OLAVUS.
Have you many bells of that kind?
#ANDERS.
Of the kind that calls the people to arms we have still a lot.
#OLAVUS.
I am glad to hear it, and I am sure it will please his Highness still more. - Are the people attending church diligently, Master Stig?
#STIG.
I can't say that they are.
#OLAVUS.
Are the priests bad, or is the pure word of God not preached here?
#STIG.
There are no bad priests here, and nothing but the pure word of God is preached!
#OLAVUS.
That's the best thing I have heard yet! Nothing but the pure word of God, you say! Nils intimated a while ago that fourteen thousand men will take up arms when you ring the big bell at Mora. That was mere boasting, I suppose?
#MONS.
Oh, if you ring it the right way, I think sixteen thousand will come. What do you say, Anders Persson?
#ANDERS.
Sixteen, you say? I should say eighteen!
#OLAVUS.
Fine! Then we shall ring it the right way when the Dane comes next time. Only seven thousand answered the last call - to fight the enemies of our country.
#MONS.
That fellow is dangerous. We had better keep quiet after this.
#STIG.
Why has Inghel Hansson not come back?
#OLAVUS.
I don't know.
#STIG.
Then I'll go and find out.
#OLAVUS.
Master Stig Larsson is commanded before the King at once!
#STIG.
Commanded? Who commands here?
#OLAVUS.
The King.
#MONS.
Treachery!
#OLAVUS.
Exactly: treachery and traitors! - If you don't go at once, Master Stig, you'll ride bareback!
#STIG.
To hell!
#OLAVUS.
Yes, to hell! - Away!
#MONS.
Do you know who I am - that I am a free miner and a friend of the King?
#OLAVUS.
Be seated then, and keep your peace. If you are a friend of the King, there has been a mistake. Sit down, Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson! No harm will befall you or anybody else who is innocent. Let Master Stig go, and don't get excited. Where does the thought of violence come from, if not from your own bad conscience?
#STIG.
That's true. We have done nothing wrong, and no one has threatened us. - Be quiet, friends. I shall soon be back.
#MONS.
That's right!
#OLAVUS.
Throw a stick at the pack, and the one that is hit will yelp.
#ANDERS.
That was stupid of us! Let us keep calm! You see, doctor, one gets suspicious as one grows old, particularly after having seen so many broken words and promises....
#OLAVUS.
I understand. In these days, when people change masters as the snake changes its skin, a certain instability of mind is easily produced. In young men it may be pardonable, but it is absolutely unpardonable in old and experienced persons.
#MONS.
As far as age is concerned, there is nothing to say about the King, who still is in his best years....
#OLAVUS.
And for that reason pardonable....
#MONS.
I think he must be the devil himself!
#ANDERS.
How long are we to wait here? And what are we to wait for?
#OLAVUS.
The King's commands, as you ought to know.
#MONS.
Are we regarded as prisoners, then?
#OLAVUS.
By no means, but it is not wise to venture out for a while yet.
#MONS.
Some great evil is afoot. I can feel it within me.
#ANDERS.
It must be very hot in here.... I am sweating. Would you like a glass of beer, doctor?
#OLAVUS.
No, thank you.
#ANDERS.
Or a glass of wine?
#OLAVUS.
Not for me, thanks!
#MONS.
But it's real hock.
#ANDERS.
In the name of Christ, will this never come to an end?
#OLAVUS.
Yes, this is the end!
#OLAVUS.
Look! and ANDERS. Another blood - bath!
#MONS.
Without trial or hearing!
#OLAVUS.
The trial took place two years age, and sentence was passed. But the King put mercy above justice and let the traitors remain at large to see whether their repentance was seriously meant. When he learned that they remained incorrigible and went on with their rebellious talk as before, he decided to execute the sentences. That's how the matter looks when presented truthfully.
#MONS.
And yet there was a lot of talk about everything being forgiven and forgotten....
#OLAVUS.
So it was, provided the same offence was not repeated. But it was repeated, and what might have been forgotten was again remembered. All that is clear as logic. These two trustworthy men.... You are trustworthy, are you not? and ANDERS. Hope so!
#OLAVUS.
Answer yes or no! Are you trustworthy? and ANDERS. Yes!
#OLAVUS.
In the presence of you as my witness, syndic, these two trustworthy men have given a true report of conditions in Dalecarlia. They have unanimously assured us that the mines are being worked profitably; that agriculture and cattle - breeding prosper no less than the mining; that famines occur but rarely, and that, during the last one, our gracious King distributed grain in quantities not insufficient, which went to those that really were in need. These trustworthy and upright miners have also confirmed the following facts: that bells to summon the congregations still remain in all the churches; that no bad priests are spreading devices of men, and that nothing is preached here but the pure word of God. You have likewise heard them say, syndic, that the province of Dalecarlia can raise from sixteen to eighteen thousand men capable of bearing arms - the figures vary as their courage falls or rises. Being in charge of the current debt, and for that reason entitled to know the actual status of the country, you have now heard the people declare with their own lips, that all the Dalecarlian grievances are unwarranted, and that those who have spread reports to the contrary are traitors and liars.
#MONS.
Veto!
#ANDERS.
I deny it!
#OLAVUS.
If you deny your own words, then you are liars twice over!
#MONS.
He is drawing the noose tighter! Better keep silent!
#ANDERS.
No, I most speak. I want to know what our fate is to be.
#OLAVUS.
So you shall. Your fate is in your own hands. You are invited to Stockholm and given full safe - conduct. You can travel freely by yourselves. This is granted you as old friends of the King, to whom he acknowledges a great debt of gratitude.
#MONS.
More guile!
#OLAVUS.
No guile at all. Here is the King's safe - conduct, signed by his own hand.
#ANDERS.
We know all about his safe - conducts!
#MONS.
We must consent and submit in order to gain time! Will you let us go into the next room and talk the matter over?
#OLAVUS.
You can now go wherever you want - except to the King.
#MONS.
We'll bring you an answer shortly.
#OLAVUS.
As you please, and when you please.
#OLAVUS.
A stiff - necked people, true as gold, but full of distrust. very fine people.
#OLAVUS.
Rather stupid, however. Did you notice how I trapped them?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
That was good work. How did you learn to do it?
#OLAVUS.
By long observation of innumerable human beings I have been led to conclude at last that vanity the primal sin and mother of all the vices. To get the truth out of criminals, I have merely to set them boasting.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
What wisdom! What wisdom! And you are not yet an old man! - But there are modest people, too, and out of these you cannot get the truth, according to what you have just said.
#OLAVUS.
Modest people boast of their modesty, so that is all one.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
If you'll pardon me - Master Olavus was your name, I think? You cannot be Olavus Petri?
#OLAVUS.
I am.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Who carried out the Reformation?
#OLAVUS.
I am that man.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
And who was subsequently tried for high treason on suspicion of having known about a plot against the King's life?
#OLAVUS.
Confidences given me under the seal of confession, so that I had no right to betray them.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Hm - hm! A mysterious story it was, nevertheless.
#OLAVUS.
No, I don't think so. Gorius Holst and Hans Bökman were found guilty. And it was so little of a secret, that the people of Hamburg heard of the King's murder as an accomplished fact long before the plot was exposed at Stockholm.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
That is just what I call mysterious, especially as we knew nothing about it at Luebeck.
#OLAVUS.
Yes, I call that mysterious, too, because the road to Hamburg goes through Luebeck as a rule. And it was rumoured at the time, that Marcus Meyer and Juerghen Wollenweber were no strangers to the plot.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
I have never heard of it, and I don't believe it. Must those things stay here?
#OLAVUS.
Yes, for the present.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
It seems to me that these royal visits are rather sanguinary affairs.
#OLAVUS.
I don't allow myself to pass judgment on the actions of my King, partly because I am not capable of doing so, and partly because I know there is a judge above too, who guides his destiny.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
That is beautifully said and thought. Have you always been equally wise?
#OLAVUS.
No, but what you have not been you frequently become.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Won't those people in there try to get away?
#OLAVUS.
That, too, has been foreseen, just as their desire to discuss the matter had been reckoned with. Do you know what they are talking of?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
No, I have not the slightest idea.
#OLAVUS.
They still imagine that King Christian is free, and they are planning to seek help from him.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
What a senseless thought!
#OLAVUS.
Especially as Christian is a prisoner.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
It sounds like madness, but when you hear how devoted these good men of the mining districts are to their King, it cannot surprise you that they may have in mind the oath binding them to their only lawful sovereign....
#OLAVUS.
Now, with your pardon, I am surprised....
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Oh, mercy, I am merely putting myself in their place.
#OLAVUS.
It is always dangerous to put oneself in the place of traitors.
#BARBRO.
Is father here? Goodness, here is the King!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
No, no, dear children, I am not the King. I am only a poor merchant from Luebeck. noble answer! This is Herman Israel, the far - famed and influential councillor, who, with Cord König and Nils Bröms, saved our King out of Danish captivity and enabled him to carry out the war of liberation. You will find him on the picture in Saint Jorghen's Gildhall which represents Gustavus Vasa appearing before the City Council of Luebeck. Honour to the man who has honour deserved. Give homage to the friend of your country and your King.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
My dear little friends.... All I can do is to thank you.... I have really not deserved this.... You see, a merchant does nothing except for payment, and I have been richly paid.
#OLAVUS.
Don't believe him! But bear in mind that there are services that can never be paid, and beautiful deeds that can never be wiped out by ingratitude or forgetfulness. - Go back to your own room now. Your father will come in a moment.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
I had never expected such a thing of you, doctor.
#OLAVUS.
I think I understand why. However, my dear syndic, don't ever compel us to become ungrateful. Ingratitude is such a heavy burden to carry.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
What is the use of talking of it? There is nothing of that kind to be feared.
#MONS.
After talking it over, we have decided to go to Stockholm with the King's good word and safe - conduct, so that we can quietly discuss the matter with him and the lords of the realm.
#OLAVUS.
Then my errand here is done, and both of us can leave. I wish you, Mons Nilsson, and you, Anders Persson, welcome to the capital.
#MONS.
Thank you, doctor.
#MONS.
These shall be our blood - stained banners! King Christian will furnish the staffs, and then - on to Stockholm!
#ANDERS.
And down with it!
#OLAVUS.
There was one thing I forgot to tell you. Do you hear?
#ANDERS.
Well!
#OLAVUS.
King Christian has been captured and made a prisoner at Sonderborg Castle, in the island of Als.
#OLAVUS.
You understand, don't you? - Stinderborg Castle, in the island of Als? crucifix of silver, gilded; weighs twelve ounces.
#DAVID.
Twelve ounces....
#MARCUS.
Item: a monstrance of gold - a perfect thumper. Weighs.... Let me see now.... Oh, it's hollow - and the base is filled with lead.... Put down a question - mark.
#DAVID.
Question - mark it is. paten of silver - well, I don't know. It tastes like copper at least. Put it down as "white metallic substance."
#DAVID.
White metallic substance. - Do you think those rustics are cheating us?
#MARCUS.
Us? Nobody can cheat us!
#DAVID.
Don't be too certain. Niegels Bröms, the goldsmith, says that interlopers from Holland are going through the country selling church vessels full of coggery, probably meant to be exchanged for the genuine goods.
#MARCUS.
We'll have to get it back on the bells, which contain a lot of silver, according to old traditions.
#DAVID.
The bells - yes, they were to go to Luebeck, but instead they are going to the royal gun - foundry to be cast into culverins and bombards.
#MARCUS.
So it is said. If only the Dalecarlians knew of it, they would come galloping across the border forests, I suppose.
#DAVID.
I think their galloping came to an end with the recent fall slaughter.
#MARCUS.
No, there will be no end to it while the two blackest rogues are still at leisure....
#DAVID.
You mean Mons Nilsson of Aspeboda and Anders Persson of Rankhyttan, who are still hanging about the town, hoping to get an audience with the King?
#MARCUS.
Those are the ones.
#DAVID.
Calling them rogues is rather an exaggeration, and our Principal seems to put great store on them.
#MARCUS.
Now, David, don't forget the first and last duty of a Hanseatic clerk - which is to keep his mouth closed. And bear in mind the number of talkative young fellows who have vanished for ever through water - gates and cellar holes. You had better remember!
#DAVID.
I'll try, although it seems about time for the Hansa itself to be thinking of the great silence.
#MARCUS.
Do you know where the Principal is?
#DAVID.
With the King, I suppose, taking an inventory of Eskil's Chamber.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Is my father here?
#MARCUS.
No, he is not. I think the Principal is with the King.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Then I'll sit down here and wait. Go on with your writing. I won't disturb you.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Why did you leave me, Jacob?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
I was tired of playing.
#PRINCE ERIC.
I don't think that was the reason. Some one offended you - some one who is not my friend.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
No one has offended me, Prince, but I have such a strong feeling that I ought not to appear at court.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Oh, Jacob, my friend, why do you cease to call your old schoolmate by name? And why do you look at me like a stranger? Give me your hand You won't? And I, who have been lonely and deserted ever since my mother died; who am hated by my stepmother, by my father, and by my half - brother; I am begging for the friendship which you gave me once and which you are now taking back.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
I am not taking back anything, Eric, but we are not allowed to be friends. The fact that we two, as mere boys, formed ties of friendship that were nursed by common sufferings, has been ignored or tolerated by our fathers so far. Now, when you are about to marry a foreign princess and take possession of a duchy, it has been deemed politic to separate us.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Your words are stilted, as if you meant to hide your own thoughts, but your feelings are not to be concealed....
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Pardon me, Eric, but this is not the place for a conversation like this....
#PRINCE ERIC.
Because this is a place for trading, you mean - as if the parties to such a transaction were degraded by it? I don't object to it, although I am rather inclined to think the seller more broad - minded than the buyer.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Oh, let them hear. Marcus and I are old friends, and we met at the Blue Dove last night.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Ugh! Why do you visit a vulgar place like that, Prince?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Where can I go? I have no one to talk with at home; and it seems to me, for that matter, that people are equally good or bad everywhere - although I prefer what is generally called bad company. - Do you know John Andersson?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
I have never heard his name even. Who is he? man from Småland who is full of sensible ideas. - Do you still need to have your forehead bandaged?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Do you think I wear the bandage as an ornament, or as a souvenir of the city mob?
#PRINCE ERIC.
You should not bear a grudge against the good folk because some scamp has misbehaved himself.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
I don't, my friend, and I know perfectly well what a stranger must expect in a hostile country. If you come to Luebeck, you will see how they stone Swedes.
#PRINCE ERIC.
You talk just like Jorghen Persson. Do you know him?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
I don't.
#PRINCE ERIC.
He looks at everything in the same way as you do.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
How do you mean?
#PRINCE ERIC.
He thinks every one is right, and that whatever happens is juste. There is something sensible and enlightened in his view of life. That's why my father hates him....
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Don't talk badly of your father. It sounds dreadful - if you will pardon me!
#PRINCE ERIC.
But if he acts badly, why shouldn't I say so? And I hate him, for that matter!
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Don't say that - don't! The greatness of your royal father is so boundless that you can't grasp it.
#PRINCE ERIC.
It only looks that way - I know! Last night he came up to me and put his arm around my shoulders - for the first time in my life - and I, who have been living in the belief that I barely came up to his hip, found to my surprise that I am as tall as he. But as soon as I looked at him from a distance again, he grew taller and turned into a giant.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
That's what he is. And he resembles one of Buonarotti's prophets - Isaiah, I think. And, verily, the Lord on high is with him.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Do you really believe in God?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Are you not ashamed of yourself?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Well, what are you to believe in times like these, when kings and priests persecute the faithful and profane everything that used to be held sacred. And yet they call themselves "defenders of the faith."
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Can't we talk of something else? Please, let us!
#PRINCE ERIC.
That's what the King always says when I go after him, and for that reason I hate him still more - as he hates me! Do you know that it was your father who brought my mother to him from Lauenburg?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
No, I didn't know that.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Yes, but the marriage turned out badly. They hated each other beyond all bounds - and one day I saw him raise his stick against her - against my mother - and he struck her! That day I lost my youth - and I can never forgive him - never!
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Look at me, Eric! Look at me! I have a stepmother, too - who is always tormenting me when I am at home - but hush, hush! If it can help you to hear that I am worse off than you - very much worse - then - you know it now! Remember that it won't last for ever, as we are growing up to freedom....
#PRINCE ERIC.
And you don't hate her?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Such a feeling has no place beside the new one that is now filling my soul.
#PRINCE ERIC.
That means - you are in love.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
That's what we may call it.... And when your own time comes, you, too, will see your hatred change form and vanish.
#PRINCE ERIC.
I wonder! - Perhaps you are right The lovelessness in which I was born and brought up has turned into a flame that is consuming my soul. My blood was poisoned at my birth, and I doubt the existence of an antidote.... Why do you leave me?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Because ... because we are not allowed to be friends - because we cannot be friends.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Do you think me so vile?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
No, no! - But I mustn't say anything more. Let us part. I shall always watch your fate with sympathy, for I think you were born to misfortune.
#PRINCE ERIC.
What makes you utter what I have thought so many times? - Do you know that I was also born to be in the way? I stand in the way of my father's desire to see Johan on the throne. I stand in the way of his wish to forget the hated German woman. My mind has not the true Swedish quality, and the fault lies in my German blood. Although I am a Vasa, I am Saxony, too, and Lauenburg, and Brunswick. I am so little of a Swede that it gives me pleasure when the free city of Luebeck imposes a penal tax on my country - and keeps it humiliated.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Is that the truth, or do you merely talk like that out of politeness?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Do you notice how much I love you, seeing that I pardon such a question? - Yes, my friend, the first words taught me by my mother were German, and in German I learned to say my evening prayers - that old and beautiful "Heil dir, Maria, Mutter Gottes".... Oh, that time - that time.... Oh, damn it! I am crying, I think! - Come to the Blue Dove to - night, Jacob There you'll find Rhine wine and merry maidens! Jorghen will be there, too. He's a man you should know.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
I - shall - come.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Thank you, friend! Really, the place has a look of pawn - shop.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
That was just what I had in mind before.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Well, then we agree to that extent at least. Until to - night, then! Do you know Agda?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
No!
#PRINCE ERIC.
Farewell! - What became of those two little pawnbrokers?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Good - bye, then, Baruch! - Have you read the Book of Baruch? That's a good one, isn't it? I made it myself!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Are you alone?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Yes, father.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
I heard somebody speaking.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
That was the Heir Apparent.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
What did he want?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
I don't think he has the slightest idea of what he wants.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Is he your friend?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Yes, so he calls himself, but I am not his. Because he thinks that he is honouring me with his friendship, he flatters himself with the belief that I return it.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
You are frightfully wise for a young man of your age.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Why, it's an axiom in the art of living, that you must not be the friend of your enemy.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Can he be made useful?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Running errands, perhaps, provided you keep him wholesomely ignorant of the matter at stake. Otherwise I don't think I ever saw an heir apparent more useless than this one.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Do you hate him?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
No, I pity him too much for that. He is more unfortunate than he deserves. That he will end badly, seems pretty certain. It seems clear to himself, too, and to such an extent that he appears anxious to hasten the catastrophe.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Listen, my son. I have long noticed that I can keep no secrets from you, and so I think it is better for me to tell you everything. Sit down and give me your attention while I walk back and forth.... I can think only when I am walking....
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Talk away, father. I am thinking all the time.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
You have probably guessed that some great event is preparing under the surface You have probably noticed that our free city of Luebeck is fighting for its rights here in the North. I speak of rights, because we have the right of the pioneer who has broken new roads - roads of trade in this case - to demand compensation and profit from the country on which he has spent his energy. We have taught these people to employ their natural products and to exchange them with profit; and we have set Sweden free. Having used us, they wish now to cast us aside. That's always the way: use - and cast aside! But there are greater and more powerful interests than those of trade that should compel the North to join hands with the free cities. The Emperor and the Pope are one. Our free cities made themselves independent first of the Emperor and then of the Pope. Now, when this country has been helped by us and its great King to do the same, we must, willy - nilly, remain allies against the common enemy. And until quite recently we did stick together. Then an evil spirit seemed to take possession of this Vasa. Whether misled by pride or fatigue, he wishes now to enter a path that must lead us all to disaster.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Wait a little. - All of us, you say? You had better say "us of Luebeck," for the Swedes will gain by entering that path.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Are you on their side?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
No, I am not. But I can perfectly well see where their advantage lies. And I beg you, father, don't try to fight against Vasa, for he is guided by the hand of the Lord! Have you not recognised that already?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
I wonder how I could be such a fool as to give my confidence to one still in his nonage!
#JACOB ISRAEL.
It won't hurt you to have your plans discussed from another point of view than your own while there is still time to correct them. And you know, of course, that you can rely on me. Go on, now!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
No, I can't now.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
The pen won't write when its point has been broken. If you will not get angry, I can tell you a little more myself.
#MARCUS.
The one you have been waiting for is outside, sir.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
I suppose it is John Andersson.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Let him wait. Do you know him, too?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
I have never seen him, but now I can figure out who he is.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
You can figure it out, you say?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
I merely add one thing to another. Now, when the Dalecarlians have been squelched, a new beginning will have to be made with the good folk of Småland.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Of Småland, you say?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Yes, I understand that this John Andersson is from Småland. I don't think his name is John Andersson, however, but - Nils Dacke!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Have you been spying?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
No, I merely listen, and look, and add together.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Well, you have made a false calculation this time.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Thus you tell me that there are two persons concerned in the matter, and that Nils Dacke is the silent partner who will not appear until the war has begun.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
I am afraid of you.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
You shouldn't be, father. I dare not do anything wrong, because then I am always made to suffer.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Do you think I am doing anything wrong?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
You are more likely than I to do so, because, like Prince Eric, you believe in nothing.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
And such a thing I must hear from my own child!
#JACOB ISRAEL.
It is better than to hear it from other people's children - later on.
#MARCUS.
Two Dalecarlians ask to see you.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Tell them to wait.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
They'll pay for it with their heads.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Who are they, then?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Anders Persson of Rankhyttan and Mons Nilsson of Aspeboda, who have tried in vain to get an audience with the King, and who are now moved by their futile anger to turn to you for revenge.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
So you know that, too?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Without wishing to show you any disrespect, father - how can a man of your age believe that secrets exist?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Time has run away from me. I don't know any longer where I stand.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Now you speak the truth! And I don't think that you estimate the results of your venture correctly.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
That will appear in due time. But now you must go, for even if you know of my venture, you must not become involved in it.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
I shall obey, but you must listen to me.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
No, you must listen to me! Tell Marcus that I shall expect my visitors in the hall of state. You stay here with David and pack all valuables into boxes ready to be sent southward.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Father!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Silence!
#JACOB ISRAEL.
One word: don't rely on me if you should do anything wrong!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
There is one thing you may rely on; that, having power of life and death in this house, I shall see that every traitor is tried and executed, whether he be my own son or no. First comes my country, then my family; but first and last - my Arty! And now - go!
#PRINCE ERIC.
You want to go to sleep, Jorghen, and I prefer to dream while still awake. To go to bed is to me like dying: to be swathed in linen sheets and stretch out in a long bed like a coffin. And then the corpse has the trouble of washing itself and reading its own burial service.
#JORGHEN.
Are you afraid of death, Prince?
#PRINCE ERIC.
As the children are afraid of going to bed, and I am sure I'll cry like a child when my turn comes. If I only knew what death is!
#JORGHEN.
Some call it a sleep, and others an awakening, but no one knows anything with certainty.
#PRINCE ERIC.
How could we possibly know anything of that other life, when we know so little of this one?
#JORGHEN.
Yes, what is life?
#PRINCE ERIC.
One large madhouse, it seems to me! Think of my sane and shrewd and sensible father - doesn't he act like a madman? He rids the country of foreigners and takes the heads of those that helped him. He rids the country of foreigners only to drag in a lot of others, like Peutinger and Norman, whom he puts above the lords of the realm and all other authorities. He is mad, of course! - He rids the Church of human inventions only to demand the acceptance of new inventions at the penalty of death. This liberator is the greatest tyrant that ever lived, and yet this tyrant is the greatest liberator that ever lived! This evening, you know, he wanted to prohibit me from coming here; and when I insisted on going all the same, he threw his Hungarian war - hammer after me, as if he had been the god Thor chasing the trolls. He came within an inch of killing me, just as it is said - which you may not have heard - that he killed my mother.
#JORGHEN.
No, I never heard of that.
#PRINCE ERIC.
That's what they say. And I can understand it. There is greatness in it. To feel raised above all human considerations; to kill whatever stands in the way? and trample everything else.... Sometimes, you know, when I see him coming in his big, soft hat and his blue cloak, using his boar - spear in place of a stick, I think he is Odin himself. When he is angry, the people say that they can hear him from the top story down to the cellars, and that the sound of it is like thunder. But I am not afraid of him, and that's why he hates me. At the same time he has a great deal of respect for me. Yes, you may smile! That's only because you have no respect for anything; not, even for yourself.
#JORGHEN.
That least of all.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Are you really such a beast?
#JORGHEN.
That's what every one thinks me, so I suppose I must believe it.
#PRINCE ERIC.
And.... There is a thought that pursues me.... He looks like old Odin, I said: Odin who has returned to despoil the temples of the Christians just as they once robbed his temples.... You should have seen them weighing and counting church treasures at Herman Israel's yesterday. It was ghastly!... And do you know, he is lucky in everything he undertakes. There is favourable wind whenever he goes sailing; the fish bite whenever he goes fishing; he wins whenever he gambles. They say that he was born with a caul.... most unusual man.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Do you know young Jacob, the son of Herman Israel? He promised to come here to - night. Rather precocious, perhaps, but with sensible ideas on certain subjects - and I think I admire some of his qualities because I lack them myself.
#JORGHEN.
Is that so?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Otherwise he is probably a perfect rascal like his father.
#JORGHEN.
Then I shall be pleased to make his acquaintance.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Because he is a rascal? - Ha - ha!
#JORGHEN.
In spite of it!
#AGDA.
Did you call me, Prince?
#PRINCE ERIC.
No, but you are always welcome. Sit down here.
#AGDA.
The honour is too great for me.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Of course, it is!
#AGDA.
And so I leave - to save my honour.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Dare you sting, you gnat?
#AGDA.
That's your fancy only. I am too sensible and humble to hurt the feelings of a great lord like yourself, my Prince.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Very good! Very good, indeed! Come here and talk to me a little more.
#AGDA.
If your lordship commands, I must talk, of course, but....
#PRINCE ERIC.
Give me the love that I have begged for so long!
#AGDA.
What one does not have one cannot give away.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Alas!
#AGDA.
Not loving your lordship, I cannot give you any love.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Diantre! - Give me your favour, then!
#AGDA.
Favours are not given away, but sold.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Listen to that! It is as if I heard my wise Jacob himself philosophising. Did you ever hear anything like it?
#JORGHEN.
All wenches learn that kind of patter from their lovers.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Don't talk like that! This girl has won my heart.
#JORGHEN.
And some one else has won hers.
#PRINCE ERIC.
How do you know?
#JORGHEN.
You can hear it at once, even though the proofs be not visible.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Do you believe in love?
#JORGHEN.
In its existence, yes, but not in its duration.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Do you know how a woman's love is to be won?
#JORGHEN.
All that's necessary is to be "the right one." If you are not, your case is hopeless.
#PRINCE ERIC.
That's a riddle.
#JORGHEN.
One of the greatest.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Who do you think can be my rival?
#JORGHEN.
Some clerk, or pikeman, or rich horsemonger.
#PRINCE ERIC.
And I who am not afraid of tossing my handkerchief to the proud virgin - queen that rules Britannia!
#JORGHEN.
Yet it's true.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Perhaps Agda is too modest - and does not dare to believe in the sincerity of my feelings?
#JORGHEN.
I don't believe anything of the kind.
#PRINCE JOHAN.
I hope my dear brother will pardon my intrusion at this late hour, but I have been sent by our father out of fond concern for my dear brother's....
#PRINCE ERIC.
Be quick and brief, Jöns, or sit down and use a beaker as punctuation mark! The sum of it is: the old man wants me to come home and go to bed. Reply: the Heir Apparent decides for himself when he is to sleep.
#PRINCE JOHAN.
I shall not convey such a reply, especially as my dear brother's disobedience may have serious results in this case.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Won't you sit down and drink a goblet, Duke?
#PRINCE JOHAN.
Thank you, Prince, but I don't wish to cause my father sorrow.
#PRINCE ERIC.
How dreadfully serious that sounds!
#PRINCE JOHAN.
It is serious. Our father has new and greater worries to face because disturbances have been reported from the southern provinces, especially from Småland.... And as it is possible that the King may have to leave his capital, he looks to the Heir Apparent for assistance in the administration of the government.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Half of which is nothing but lies, of course - and then there are such a lot of people governing already. Go in peace, my brother. I shall come when I come.
#PRINCE JOHAN.
My duty is done, and all I regret is being unable to gain more of my brother's ear; of his heart I possess no part at all!
#PRINCE ERIC.
Can you make anything out of that boy?
#JORGHEN.
I can't.
#PRINCE ERIC.
I wonder if he believes in his own preachings?
#JORGHEN.
That is just the worst of it. Ordinary rascals like you and me, who don't believe in anything, can't get words of that kind over their lips; and for that reason we can never deceive anybody.
#PRINCE ERIC.
You are a beast, Jorghen.
#JORGHEN.
Of course, I am.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Is there nothing good in you at all?
#JORGHEN.
Not a trace! And besides - what is good? My mother was always saying that I should end on the gallows. Do you think one's destiny is predetermined?
#PRINCE ERIC.
That's what Master Dionysius asserts - the Calvinist who uses Holy Writ to prove that the dispensation of grace is not at all dependent on man.
#JORGHEN.
Come on with the gallows then! That's the grace dispensed to me.
#PRINCE ERIC.
That fellow Jacob says always that I was born to misfortune, and that's what father says, too, when he gets angry. What do you think my end will be?
#JORGHEN.
Was it not Saint Augustine who said that he who has been coined into a groat can never become a ducat?
#PRINCE ERIC.
That's right. But I don't think we have drunk enough to make us start any theological disputes. Here we have been disputing for a lifetime now, and every prophet has been fighting all the rest. Luther has refuted Augustine, Calvin has refuted Luther, Zwingli has refuted Calvin, and John of Leyden has refuted all of them. So we know now just where we stand!
#JORGHEN.
Yes, it's nothing but humbug, and if it were not for that kind of humbug, I should never have been born.
#PRINCE ERIC.
What do you mean?
#JORGHEN.
Oh, you know perfectly well that my father was a monk who went off and got married when they closed the monasteries. It means that I'm a product of perjury and incest, as my father broke his oath and established an illicit relationship like any unclean sheep.
#PRINCE ERIC.
You are a beast, Jorghen!
#JORGHEN.
Have I ever denied it?
#PRINCE ERIC.
No, but there are limits....
#JORGHEN.
Where?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Here and there! A certain innate sense of propriety generally suggests the - approximate limits.
#JORGHEN.
Are you dreaming again, you dreamer?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Take care! There are limits even to friendship....
#JORGHEN.
No, mine is limitless!
#PRINCE ERIC.
There you are at last, Jacob! You have kept me waiting a long time, and just now I was longing for you.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Pardon me, Prince, but my thoughts were so heavy that I did not wish to bring them into a merry gathering.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Yes, we are devilishly merry, Jorghen and I! This is Jorghen Persson, you see - my secretary, and a very enlightened and clever man, but a perfect rascal otherwise, as you can judge from his horrible looks and treacherous eyes.
#JORGHEN.
At your service, my dear sir!
#PRINCE ERIC.
Sit down and philosophise with us, Jacob. Of course, I promised you pretty maidens, but we have only one here, and she is engaged.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
What do you mean by - engaged?
#PRINCE ERIC.
That she has bestowed her heart on somebody, so that you may save yourself the trouble of searching her bosom for it.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Are you talking of Agda?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Do you know Agda the Chaste, who has told us that she would sell her favours, but never give them away?
#AGDA.
My God, I never, never meant anything of the kind!
#JACOB ISRAEL.
No, she cannot possibly have meant it that way.
#PRINCE ERIC.
She has said it.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
It must be a lie.
#PRINCE ERIC.
The devil, you say! tavern brawl of the finest water! The words have been given almost correctly, but they were not understood as they were meant.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Do you dare to takes sides against me, you rascal?
#JORGHEN.
Listen, friends....
#PRINCE ERIC.
With a hussy against your master....
#JACOB ISRAEL.
She's no hussy!
#AGDA.
Thank you, Jacob! Please tell them everything....
#PRINCE ERIC.
Oh, there is something to tell, then? Well, well! And you must needs appear as the defender of innocence!
#JORGHEN.
Why the deuce must you always come poking after me when somebody else has made a fool of himself? Stop it, damn you! Eric. So this is my rival! Ha - ha - ha! A fellow like you! Ventre - saint - gris!
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Once you honoured me with your friendship, Prince, for which I could only give you pity in return. As I did not wish to be false, I asked you to let me go....
#PRINCE ERIC.
Go to the devil!
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Yes, I am going, but first you must hear what I and Agda have in common - something you can never understand, as you understand nothing but hatred, and for that reason never can win love....
#PRINCE ERIC.
Diantre! And I who can have the virgin - queen, the proud maiden of Britannia, at my feet any time I care ha - ha, ha - ha!
#JACOB ISRAEL.
King David had five hundred proud maidens, but for happiness he turned to his humble servant's only wife....
#PRINCE ERIC.
Must I hear more of that sort of thing? great deal more!
#PRINCE ERIC.
Die, then!
#CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD.
Your sword, if you please, Prince Eric!
#PRINCE ERIC.
What is this?
#CAPTAIN.
The King's order. You are under arrest....
#PRINCE ERIC.
Go to the devil, old Stenbock!
#CAPTAIN.
That's not a princely answer to a royal command!
#PRINCE ERIC.
Yes, talk away!
#CAPTAIN.
Away with him! And put him in the tower! That's order number one! Then comes number two - Mr. Secretary! Put on the handcuffs! And then - to the Green Vault with him! To - morrow at cockcrow - ten strokes of the rod!
#JORGHEN.
Must I be spanked because he won't go to bed?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Do you dare to lay hands on the Heir Apparent? 'Sdeath!
#CAPTAIN.
God is still alive, and so is the King! - March on! -
#CAPTAIN.
And now you'll close your drink - shop. That's the final word. And as there is no question about it, you need not make any answer.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Always this titanic hand that is never seen and always felt! Now it has been thrust out of a cloud to alter our humble fates. The liberator of the country has descended during the darkness of night to set my little bird free. - Will you take flight with me?
#AGDA.
Yes, with you - and far away!
#JACOB ISRAEL.
But where?
#AGDA.
The world is wide!
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Come, then!
#KING.
Good morrow, my rose! splendid morning!
#KING.
The first spring day after a long winter.
#QUEEN.
Is my King in a gracious mood to - day?
#KING.
My graciousness is not dependent on weather or wind. - Go on now! Is it a question of Eric?
#QUEEN.
It is.
#KING.
Well, he has my good grace once more after having slept himself sober in the tower. And Jorghen comes next, I suppose?
#QUEEN.
Yes.
#KING.
He, on the other hand, will not have my good grace until he reforms.
#QUEEN.
But....
#KING.
He is bad through and through, and he is spoiling Eric. Whatever may be the cause of his badness, I cannot dispose of it, but I can check the effects. Have you any more protégés of the same kind?
#QUEEN.
I won't say anything more now.
#KING.
Then we can talk of something else. How is my mother - in - law?
#QUEEN.
Oh, you know.
#KING.
And Johan? Where is Johan?
#QUEEN.
He is not far away.
#KING.
I wish he were still nearer - nearer to me - so near that he could succeed me when the time comes.
#QUEEN.
It is not right to think like that, and still less to talk like that, when a higher Providence has already decided in favour of Prince Eric.
#KING.
Well, I can't tell whether it was vanity that fooled me into looking for a foreign princess or wisdom that kept me away from the homes of our Swedish nobility - one hardly ever knows what one is doing.
#QUEEN.
That's true.
#KING.
But the feet that I became the brother - in - law of the Danish king helped the country to get peace, and so nobody has any right to complain.
#QUEEN.
The country first!
#KING.
The country first and last. That's why Eric must be married.
#QUEEN.
Do you really think he has any hopes with the English queen.
#KING.
I don't know, but we must find out - that is, without risking the honour of the country. It is not impossible. We have had a British princess on the throne before.
#QUEEN.
Who was that?
#KING.
Don't you know that Queen Philippa was a daughter of King Henry
#QUEEN.
No, I didn't know that.
#KING.
Then I suppose you don't know, either, that the Folkungs were among your ancestors, and that you are also descended from King Waldemar, the Conqueror of Denmark?
#QUEEN.
No, no! I thought the bloody tale of the Folkungs was ended long ago.
#KING.
Let us hope it is! But your maternal ancestor was nevertheless a daughter of Eric Ploughpenny of Denmark and had a son with her brother - in - law, King Waldemar of Sweden, the son of Earl Birger....
#QUEEN.
Why do you tell me all these dreadful stories?
#KING.
I thought it might amuse you to know that you have royal blood in your veins, while I have peasant blood. You are too modest, Margaret, and I wish to see you exalted - so high that that fool Eric will be forced to respect you.
#QUEEN.
To have sprung from a crime should make one more modest.
#KING.
Well, that's enough about that. Was there anything else?
#KING.
You are thinking of Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson, but I won't let you talk of them.
#KING.
Please, get up! Then I must leave you.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Did I scare you?
#QUEEN.
Not exactly.
#PRINCE ERIC.
I can take myself out of the way. I was only looking for a glass of water.
#QUEEN.
Are you sick?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Only a little leaky.
#QUEEN.
What do you mean?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Well, dry, if you please. The more wine you drink, the dryer gets your throat. The wetter, the dryer - that's madness, like everything else.
#QUEEN.
Why do you hate me?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Because I am not allowed to love you. You must not be in love with your step - mother and yet you must love her: that's madness, too.
#QUEEN.
Why do you call me stepmother?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Because that's the word, and that's what you are. Is that clear? If it is, then that isn't madness at least.
#QUEEN.
You have the tongue of a viper.
#PRINCE ERIC.
And the reason, too. QUEEN, But no heart!
#PRINCE ERIC.
What could I do with it? Throw it at the feet of the women to be defiled by them? - My heart lies buried in my mother's coffin in the vault of the Upsala cathedral. I was only four years old when it was put there, but there it lies with her, and they tell me there was a hole in her head as if she had been struck by the hammer of Thor - which I did not see, however. When I asked to see my mother for the last time at the burial, they had already screwed on the coffin lid. Well, there lies my heart - the only one I ever had What have you to do with my entrails, for that matter? Or with my feelings? - Look out for my reason; that's all! I grasp your thoughts before you have squeezed them out of yourself. I understand perfectly that you would like to see the crown placed on the red hair of that red devil whom you call son, and whom I must needs call brother. He insists that he has more ancestors than I, and that he is descended from Danish kings. If that's so, he has a lot of fine relatives. Eric Ploughpenny had his head cut off. Abel killed his brother and was killed in turn. Christoffer was poisoned. Eric the Blinking was stuck like a pig. - I have no elegant relatives like those, but if heredity counts, I must keep an eye on my dear brother.
#QUEEN.
Nobody can talk of anything but blood and poison to - day. The sun must have risen on the wrong side this fine morning!
#PRINCE ERIC.
The sun is a deceiver; don't trust it. Blood will be shed in this place before nightfall. Eric and Abel were the names of those elegant relatives; not Cain and Abel! And that time it was Abel who killed Cain - no, Eric, I mean! That's a fine omen to start with! Eric was killed! Poor Eric!
#QUEEN.
Alas, alas!
#PRINCE ERIC.
But it is of no use to take any stock in superstition, as I entered this vale of misery with my fist full of blood.
#QUEEN.
Now you do scare me!
#PRINCE ERIC.
That's more than Jorghen would believe - that I could scare anybody.
#QUEEN.
What blood is to be shed here to - day?
#PRINCE ERIC.
I am not sure, but it is said that those Dalecarlians will have their heads cut off.
#QUEEN.
Can it not be prevented?
#PRINCE ERIC.
If it is to be, it cannot be prevented, but must come as thunder must come after lightning. And besides, what does it matter? Heads are dropping off here like ripe apples.
#KING.
If you have any faith in me at all, Margaret, cease your efforts to judge in matters of state. I have been investigating for two years without being able to make up my mind. How can you, then, hope to grasp this matter? - Go in to the children now. I have a word to say to Eric!
#KING.
If you could see yourself as you are now, Eric, you would despise yourself!
#PRINCE ERIC.
So I do anyhow!
#KING.
Nothing but talk! If you did despise yourself, you would change your ways.
#PRINCE ERIC.
I cannot make myself over.
#KING.
Have you ever tried?
#PRINCE ERIC.
I have.
#KING.
Then your bad company must counteract your good intentions.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Jorghen is no worse than anybody else, but he has the merit of knowing himself no better than the rest.
#KING.
Do you bear in mind that you are to be king some time?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Once I am king, the old slips will be forgotten.
#KING.
There you are mistaken again. I am still paying for old slips. However, if you are not willing to obey me as a son, you must obey me as a subordinate.
#PRINCE ERIC.
The Heir Apparent is no subject!
#KING.
That's why I used the word "subordinate." And all are subordinate to the King.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Must I obey blindly?
#KING.
As long as you are blind, you must obey blindly. When you get your sight, you will obey with open eyes. But obey you must! - Wait only till you have begun to command, and you will soon see how much more difficult that is, and how much more burdensome.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Pooh!
#KING.
Idiot! - Go and wash the dirt off yourself, and see that your hair is combed. And rinse that filthy mouth of yours first of all, so that you don't stink up my rooms. Go now - or I'll give you a week in the tower to sober up. And if that should not be enough, I'll take off your ears, so that you can never wear a crown. Are those words plain enough?
#PRINCE ERIC.
The law of succession....
#KING.
I make laws of that kind to suit myself! Do you understand now? - That's all! - Away!
#COURTIER.
Herman Israel, Councillor of Luebeck!
#KING.
Let him come.
#KING.
Good day, my dear old friend, and welcome! Sit down, sit down! So you have just come from Dalecarlia?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
That's where I was lately.
#KING.
I was there, too, as you know, to straighten out the mess left after the False Sture and the fight about the bells, but you stayed on when I left. - Did you keep an eye on Master Olavus Petri? What sort of a man has he turned out? Can I trust him?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Absolutely! He is not only the most faithful, but the cleverest negotiator I have seen.
#KING.
Really, Herman? I am glad to hear that. Do you really think so, Herman? Well, you know the old affair between him and me, and how that was settled. But it was settled! - So much for that. Let us talk of our affairs now.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
As you say. But let us keep our words as well as actions under control.
#KING.
All right! Control yours as much as you please.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
For the sake of old friendship and good faith, can't we put that away?
#KING.
Ha - ha! With pleasure, if you are afraid of it, Herman! - Go on now! But cut it short!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Then I'll start at the end. The country's debt to Luebeck has been paid, and we are about to part.
#KING.
That sounds like writing! However, we shall part as friends.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
As allies rather....
#KING.
So that's what you are aiming at, Israel? - No, I have had enough of dependence.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Listen, your Highness, or Majesty, or whatever I am to call you....
#KING.
Call me Gustav, as you used to do when I called you father.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Well, my son, there are many things that drive us apart - many, indeed - but there is one thing that keeps us together: our common, legitimate opposition to the Emperor....
#KING.
Right you are! And that's the reason why we can rely on each other without any written treaties.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
You forget one thing, my son: that I am a merchant....
#KING.
And I the customer. Have you been paid?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Paid? Yes.... But there are things that cannot be paid in money....
#KING.
It is for me to speak of the gratitude I owe you and the free city of Luebeck ever since the day I first came to you - a young man who thought himself deserted by God, and who knew himself deserted by all humanity. Be satisfied to find my gratitude expressed in the friendly feelings I harbour and show toward you. A debt like that cannot be paid in money, and still less in treaties. - Why do you want any treaties? In order to tie me and the country for a future of uncertain duration? - Don't force me to become ungrateful, Herman! On my soul, I have enough as it is to burden me - far too much!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
What is weighing on you, my son?
#KING.
This.... Oh, will you believe me, Herman, old friend, that lawyer form a decision or pass a judgment without having turned to the Eternal and Almighty Lord for advice? When, after fasting, prayer, and meditation, I have got the answer from above that I was asking for, then I strike gladly, even if it be my own heart - roots that must be cut off. But you remember Master John.... John, the old friend of my youth, who assisted me in that first bout with Christian? He changed heart and incited the Dalecarlians to rise against me. His head had to fall, and it did fall! Since that day my peace is gone. My nearest and dearest don't look at me in the same way they used to do. My own wife, my beloved Margaret.... She turns away from me when I want to kiss her pure brow, and can you imagine? Yesterday, at the dinner - table, she kept looking at my hand as if she had seen blood on it! - I don't regret what I did. I have no right to regret it. I was right - by God, I was right! But nevertheless - my peace is gone!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Those feelings are an honour to your heart, my son, and I must admit that I didn't think you quite as sensitive....
#KING.
Never mind! It was not meant as a boast. But now I find myself in the same situation again. Tell me, Herman, what you think of Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Will my opinion have any influence on their fate, or have you already made up your mind?
#KING.
I am still in doubts, as you ought to know.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Then I must ask permission to remain silent.
#KING.
Are you my friend?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Yes, up to a certain point. But you must not trust me too far, as I am not my own master and have no right to give away what is not mine.
#KING.
Fie on such astuteness!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
You should get some of it yourself!
#KING.
I'll try. - First of all you must give me a final receipt for the country's paid - up debt.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
I don't carry such documents with me, and the receipt has to be signed by the Council in regular session.
#KING.
Herman!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Please put that thing away!
#KING.
I can see that you wish to lead me where I don't want to go. You have some purpose in mind that I can't make out. Speak out, old man, or you'll have me in a rage! You want to coax me into signing some kind of paper. What is it?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Nothing but a treaty providing for mutual friendship and mutual trade. That's all!
#KING.
And that I will never sign! I know all about Luebeck's friendship as well as its trade. Talk of something else!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
I have nothing else to talk of. Why don't you believe me?
#KING.
Because you lie!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Because you are unfortunate enough to think that I lie, you will never know the truth.
#KING.
Yes, unfortunate, indeed - as unfortunate as a man can be, for I have not a single friend.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
It hurts me to hear you talk like that, Gustav, and - and it makes me sad to see that your greatness and your exalted office have brought you so little true happiness. I shall say nothing more about gratitude, because the idea of it is too vague in human minds, but I have loved you like a son ever since that hour when the Lord of Hosts put your fate in my hands. I have followed your brilliant course as if it had been my own. I have joyed over your successes, and I have sorrowed over your sorrows.... Frequently my duties toward my own people have kept me from lending you a helping hand. Frequently, too, your own hardness has stood between us. But now, when I behold you so deeply crushed, and when you have treated me with a confidence that I may well call filial, I shall forget for a moment that I am your enemy - which I must be as a man of Luebeck, while as Herman Israel I am your friend. I shall forget that I am a merchant, and - I hope that I may never regret it - and - and.... Do you know John Andersson?
#KING.
I don't.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
But I do, and I know Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson, too! They called on me yesterday, and - to - morrow the southern provinces will rise in rebellion!
#KING.
So that's what was coming? Oh! Who is John Andersson?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Hard to tell. But back of his face appears another one that looks like the devil's own. Have you heard the name of Dacke?
#KING.
Yes, but only in a sort of dream. Dacke? - Dacke? - It sounds like the cawing of a jackdaw. - Who is he?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Nobody knows. It is the name of one invisible, whom all know and none have seen. But that name has been seen on a letter signed by - the Emperor.
#KING.
The Emperor?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
The Emperor of the Holy Roman and German Empire!
#KING.
Fairy - tales!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
You won't believe me? Investigate!
#KING.
I believe you and I thank you! - You say that Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson have been plotting with the rebels right here in my own city?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
As surely as I have ears to hear with.
#KING.
My God! My God! - Then I know what to do with them! Two years of struggle with myself and my conscience, and at last I know what to do with them! At last!
#COURTIER.
Jacob Israel of Luebeck!
#KING.
Who dares to disturb me?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
My noble King, an humble youth has ventured to disturb you because your life is at stake!
#KING.
Speak up! What more? Who are you?
#JACOB ISRAEL.
I am Jacob Israel, your Highness. KING, It's your Jacob, is it not?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
It's my boy.
#KING.
What do you want? Speak quickly, or away with you!
#KING.
Who is after my life? If you mean John Andersson or Dacke, I know it already. - For the sake of your good intention and your youth, but particularly for the sake of your father, I shall forgive you.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
But I have no right to forgive so quickly. - You came here to accuse your father? Answer me yes or no.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Yes!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Go then, and take my curse with you!
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Forgive, father!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
No more your father! You silly, impudent youth, who think that you understand the art of statesmanship and the laws of honour better than he who brought you into the world! What you did not foresee was that I might change my mind.
#KING.
Oh, forgive him, Herman!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
I have forgiven him already, but our sacred laws will never do so. Take this ring, Jacob, and go to - you know whom! - But bid me good - bye first.
#JACOB ISRAEL.
Take away your curse, father!
#KING.
What are you two doing?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
That is a family secret. Now we can go on.
#KING.
Or quit. You have given me proof of your unswerving friendship, Herman, and I thank you for the last time. Give me your hand!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Not to promise anything that cannot be kept!
#KING.
No promises, then! Farewell, and peace be with you!
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
I thank you!
#KING.
What is that? You are crying?
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Perhaps, for now I am your equal in misfortune. I have lost my son!
#KING.
He'll come back to you.
#HERMAN ISRAEL.
Never! - Good - bye!
#KING.
Good - bye, Herman, old friend!
#KING.
Good morning, mother - in - law.
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
Are you busy?
#KING.
Very much so.
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
But not so much that you cannot hear the justified complaint of a subject.
#KING.
You are too modest. However, let me decide whether your complaint be justified or no. I must hear too many unjustified ones, God wot!
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
If I condescend to make a complaint, you may be sure that I have reasons for it.
#KING.
But they must be good. Most reasons are no good at all. - Is it a question of Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson?
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
No, of myself.
#KING.
Then you should be well informed at least.
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
Is there law and justice in this country?
#KING.
Both law and justice, but also a lot of wrong - doing.
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
Do you know that the Queen's mother - that is, I - has been insulted by the mob?
#KING.
No, I didn't know, but I have long expected it, as I have told you before this.
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
You think it right, then?...
#KING.
No, I think it wrong of you to wear that dress in public, when it is forbidden. And it is only out of respect for yourself and your - hm! - sex, that I have not long ago ordered you to be stripped of it.
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
Ha - ha!
#KING.
And it has been wrong of me to leave the Convent of Vreta standing for you to live in, when the law demands that it be tom down.
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
Ha - ha!
#KING.
Since you, by persuading me into letting the convent remain, have placed me before the public in the awkward position of a perverter of justice, you should, at least, show me the consideration of not appearing on the streets in that dress. And as I have given you permission to come here at your own risk, you must bear that risk yourself. To show you that justice exists, however, I shall see that those who insulted you be found - they had no right to insult you, even if you had been the humblest woman of the people. Now that matter is settled! Call four of the guards. Put two at that door and two at the other
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
Thus I am treated like a thief and a murderer by my own kinsman....
#KING.
No, you are not! But no one knows what may happen.... It depends on your own conduct.
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
Do you call that freedom?
#KING.
It is freedom for me - to be free from unreasonable people.
#KING.
Outside that door. And no one can get in here; literally no one! If anybody should come, whoever it be - whoever it be, mind you - and try to force his way in here, cut him down - cut him down!
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
Here?
#KING.
Yes, here! Do you wish to look on?
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
I shall go in a moment, but first you must hear something for your own benefit....
#KING.
If it is for my benefit, I can guess the nature of it. Well, spit it out now!
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
This man Herman Israel, whom you regard as a friend, is speaking ill of you on your back.
#KING.
When I do what's ill, he has the right to speak ill of me - has he not?
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
Oh, it's impossible to reason with you!
#KING.
Have you really discovered that at last? - At last! Let Master Olavus Petri come in.
#KING.
Good day, Olof. I have read your report on the conditions at Copperberg, and I am pleased with you. - Have Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson been arrested?
#OLAVUS.
They have been locked up since last night.
#KING.
Order Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson to be brought up here at once. Have you any proof that the prisoners have been plotting with John Andersson?
#OLAVUS.
Proof and witnesses.
#KING.
Good! - Tell me something What do you think of Herman Israel - as a man, and more particularly in his relationship to me?
#OLAVUS.
He seems to me a good and faithful friend of your Highness. As a private person he is honest in every respect, big - minded, and straight in all his actions.
#KING.
I am glad to hear it just now, when I have all but lost my faith in friendship. So you think I can rely on him?
#OLAVUS.
Absolutely.
#KING.
Have you heard of the restlessness in the southern provinces?
#OLAVUS.
Yes, I am sorry to say.
#KING.
They say that it is pretty serious.
#OLAVUS.
So serious that nothing but quick and determined action can save the country.
#KING.
Have you heard the Emperor's name mentioned in this connection?
#OLAVUS.
I have.
#KING.
I want a piece of advice, although I may not take it. What would you, in my place, do with Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson?
#OLAVUS.
Have them executed before the sun has set.
#KING.
You are a stem man, Olof!
#OLAVUS.
Yes, why not?
#KING.
Do you think you could sleep nights - having shown that kind of - sternness?
#OLAVUS.
Only then should I be able to sleep in peace....
#KING.
Very well! - Have you anything to ask me about?
#OLAVUS.
I have - but it's a delicate question.
#KING.
Let's see!
#OLAVUS.
It concerns the mother of the Queen....
#KING.
The people are muttering?
#OLAVUS.
The people think that when the King has ordered the introduction of a new faith, he should not for family reasons overlook the violation of the established law....
#KING.
It's not the people, but you, who are saying that....
#OLAVUS.
Suppose I took the liberty of telling my King the truth....
#KING.
You're no court fool who needs to run about dropping truths wherever you go! Now, I am willing to admit that the indiscretion of my gracious mother - in - law puts me in a false position toward the adherents of the new faith.... But this is not the bedchamber, and we'll let that question stay where it belongs; back of the bed curtains. Is there anything else?
#OLAVUS.
Nothing else. But this question....
#KING.
I'll solve myself!
#OLAVUS.
Can your Highness solve it?
#KING.
I think you ask too many questions!
#OLAVUS.
If it were a private matter, yes - but as it concerns the whole country....
#KING.
Which I am looking after! I am looking after the whole country. And if you must know, I have just settled that very question, so that your advice is a little belated. The Convent of Vreta will be closed before you have time to write another sermon. Do you realise now that I have a right to be angry with your needless and unsolicited questions?
#OLAVUS.
I stand corrected!
#KING.
I have got you on account of my sins, and I suppose I must take your faults with your merits, which are great. Now we are done with that I Go back and roar in your pulpit now. Here I do the roaring!
#KING.
Eternal Lord, who rules the destinies of princes and of peoples, illumine my mind and strengthen my will, so that I may not judge unrighteously! Bring in the prisoners!
#KING.
Stay where you are! Once I called you my friends, Anders Persson and Mons Nilsson. You know why. But that was long ago. I let you keep life and goods when you had forfeited both, and thus Providence rid me mercifully of the debt of gratitude I had come to owe you. Two years ago you withdrew your oath of loyalty and opened war on me for the sake of those bells. Being victorious, I had a right to your heads, but I let you go. That's how my debt was paid. Your ingratitude wiped out my gratitude, and so that bill was settled. Now the time has come for a new settlement, and this time the balance is against you. To find out just where you stood, I invited you to my capital, and you might have guessed that I would keep my eyes on you. My ears have been open, too, and I have learned that you have begun plotting all over again. Do you know John Andersson? and MONS. No!
#KING.
Do you know Dacke? and MONS. Mercy!
#KING.
Yes, mercy! But there will be no more mercy. You have had it once, and twice is too much.
#KING.
Silence! I am doing the speaking now! You were going to talk about friendship, of course. I cannot be the friend of my enemies, and having cancelled your acquaintance, I don't even know you. Were I to let old devotion influence my judgment, I should not be acting as an unbiassed judge. And he who has incurred the disfavour of the law cannot be helped by any favour of mine! That's enough words spent on this matter! Take away these culprits, guard!
#ANDERS.
What is the sentence?
#KING.
That you lose life, honour, and property.
#KING.
My hand? Oh, no! Shake hands with the heads - man, and kiss the block - that's good enough for you!
#ANDERS.
One word!
#KING.
Not one!
#AGDA.
You ask what that big red house is? It used to be the Convent of St. Clara. Now it is the Hanseatic office.
#KARIN.
Do they ever buy any flowers there?
#AGDA.
Not now, I think. I used to bring flowers there when an image of the Virgin Mary stood at the corner. - I wish she were there still!
#KARIN.
What do they do in that house? They tell so many queer stories about it, and no one is ever admitted....
#AGDA.
Have you heard that, too? I suppose they buy and sell, like all that come from Luebeck.
#KARIN.
Of course, but they say that people have disappeared in that house and that those who live there are heathens who sacrifice....
#AGDA.
You have heard that, too? But it can't be true! Do you think so?
#KARIN.
How could I tell? And why are you so disturbed by those stories? Gossip says that you used to have a friend in there. Is it true?
#AGDA.
Well, as you have heard about it But whether he still be there Oh, if I only knew!
#KARIN.
I'll ring and ask.
#AGDA.
No, no! You don't know what kind of people they are!
#KARIN.
Do you think they'll eat me? Listen! That's the old vesper bell! I know it! Bing - bong! Bing - bong!
#AGDA.
Stop it! Somebody might come.
#KARIN.
Isn't that what we want? But no one does come, my dear. - It's a gruesome place. And I shall leave it alone now. - Do you know Prince Eric, Agda?
#AGDA.
Yes, it was on his account they closed up the Blue Dove. Now I am working over there, at the Golden Apple.
#KARIN.
They say that he used to be very polite to you.
#AGDA.
No, he was most impolite, not to say nasty.
#KARIN.
He had been drinking then. Otherwise he is merely miserable, they say.
#AGDA.
Do you know him?
#KARIN.
No, I have only seen him, but I cannot forget his sad eyes and his long face. He looks so much like a doll I had once - I called it Blinkie Bloodless.... I suppose they are not kind to him at home, either.
#AGDA.
Probably not, but a man has no right to act like a brute because he is unhappy.
#KARIN.
Why do you talk like that? He drinks a lot of wine, like most young men and Hush! Somebody is coming....
#AGDA.
Good - bye, Karin. I have to run....
#KARIN.
I'll be back.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Here's my new well - spring of wine. Come quick to the bower here.
#JORGHEN.
And Agda is here, too!
#PRINCE ERIC.
Well, what of it?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Bring us some Rhine wine and then make yourself invisible. You know, Jorghen, I am facing a crucial moment and must be ready to act at once. The King has lost his reason and is committing acts that cannot be defended! Yesterday he cut off the heads of those Dalecarlians. To - day comes the news that his troops have been beaten by the peasants of Småland, who are now crossing Holaved Forest. Now the Dalecarlians will rise, of course, and everything is lost.
#JORGHEN.
What does that concern us? Let the world perish, and I shall laugh at it.
#PRINCE ERIC.
But this is what beats everything else for madness. Finding his treasury empty, the King, in his incredible simplicity, tries to borrow money from these Luebeckians, who are his enemies.
#JORGHEN.
Well, if you need money, your enemies are the best ones to take it from.
#PRINCE ERIC.
If I am not crazy already, you'll make me so! Please be serious a moment!
#PRINCE ERIC.
Ha - ha! That's a good one. But then, I made it myself. - Well, Agda, or Magda, or what it is, where's your pawnbroker to - day?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Do you know that those Hanseatic people are in the habit of butchering little boys and selling them to the Turk?
#PRINCE ERIC.
There is some truth in it, I think.
#JORGHEN.
Let the maiden go before she begins to cry. I can't bear tears.
#PRINCE ERIC.
I suppose you have never cried, Jorghen?
#JORGHEN.
Twice: when I was born, and once after that - out of rage.
#PRINCE ERIC.
You are a beast, Jorghen.
#JORGHEN.
However - you wish to figure out what is to happen, and to form a decision on the basis of your false calculations. Have you not noticed how all our plans are foiled? That's the game of the gods. Sometimes we act wisely, and everything goes to the devil, and then we act like fools, and everything turns out right. It's nothing but humbug - all of it!
#PRINCE ERIC.
I think so, too, and yet there must be some sort of sense in it.
#JORGHEN.
Not as far as I can see. It's just like dicing.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Let the dice rattle, then!
#JORGHEN.
Let them rattle! That's the right word for it. Now it's a question of head or tail, however - whether the King is to be the tail, and the man from Småland the head.... Look, who comes here!
#PRINCE ERIC.
Who - is - that? flower girl.
#PRINCE ERIC.
No - this is - something else! Do you see?
#JORGHEN.
What?
#PRINCE ERIC.
What I see - but, of course, you can't.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Look! Now the wreath has been added to the crown.
#JORGHEN.
What crown?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Didn't you see? Get up, child! You should not be kneeling to me, but I to you. I don't want to ask your name, for I know who you are, although I have never seen you or heard of you before. - What do you ask of me? Speak!
#KARIN.
That your Grace buy my flowers.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Put your flowers there. There!
#KARIN.
No, I cannot wear that ring, your Grace - it's much too grand for me. And if I try to sell it, I shall be seized as a thief.
#PRINCE ERIC.
You are as wise as you are beautiful.
#KARIN.
I thank your Grace, but it is too much.
#PRINCE ERIC.
As you named no price, I can do so myself.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Did you see?
#JORGHEN.
Not a thing.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Didn't you hear, either? Didn't you notice her voice? voice like that of any jade - rather pert.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Stop your tongue, Jorghen! I love her!
#JORGHEN.
She is not the first.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Yes, the first, and the only one!
#JORGHEN.
Well, seduce her if you must.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Take care, or by God!...
#JORGHEN.
Have we now got to the poking point again?
#PRINCE ERIC.
I don't know what has happened, but this moment has made me despise you. The same city can't hold you and me. Your eyes defile me, and your whole being stinks. I shall leave you, and I don't want to see you face to face again. - It is as if an angel had come to take me away from the habitations of the damned. I despise my whole past, as I despise you and myself.
#JORGHEN.
Seems to be serious this time. But I guess you'll come back.
#JORGHEN.
Do you know Karin, the flower girl?
#AGDA.
Yes, I do.
#JORGHEN.
What kind of a piece is she? nice and decent girl, of whom I have never heard anything bad.
#JORGHEN.
Can you see anything beautiful about her?
#AGDA.
No, but she is rather pretty, and there is like a halo of sweetness about her.
#JORGHEN.
Oh, it was that he saw, then!
#AGDA.
Tell me, secretary, are you really as hard as people say?
#JORGHEN.
I am not hard to anybody, child, but the world has been hard to me ever since I was born.
#AGDA.
Why don't you always speak like that? However, the Prince is enamoured, bewitched.
#AGDA.
Poor fellow! - Tell me, secretary, is the Prince quite right?
#JORGHEN.
You and your questions are very amusing. Let me ask you one now. Hm! Do you think a woman could possibly - hm! - love me?
#AGDA.
No, I don't. Not unless you try to be good.
#JORGHEN.
How the devil is that to be done?
#AGDA.
Shame! Shame!
#JORGHEN.
If you never see anything good, how can you believe in it?
#AGDA.
Tell me, secretary, did the Prince mean what he said about the Hanseatic people and what they are doing in that house?
#JORGHEN.
No, child! That was only a cruel jest. But no Swedish authority can interfere with what they are doing in there. That much you should know, if you are worrying about your Jacob.
#AGDA.
Will you do me a favour? It won't cost you anything.
#JORGHEN.
With the greatest pleasure, my dear girl.
#AGDA.
Find Jacob for me! He had promised to meet me, and he never came. We have been ringing the bell at the door, but no one answers.
#JORGHEN.
I don't want to hurt you, Agda, but unfortunately I have reason to believe that all the Luebeck people have gone away on account of the new rebellion.
#AGDA.
And he won't come back, you think?
#JORGHEN.
I don't like to prophesy, because it generally turns out the other way, but I don't think he will be back soon.
#AGDA.
Lord Jesus!
#JORGHEN.
What is it, girl? - Tell me! A child?
#AGDA.
He had given me his promise.
#JORGHEN.
Poor woman!
#JORGHEN.
Misery, always misery, wherever love gets in its work!
#AGDA.
And you don't despise me?
#JORGHEN.
I pity you, as I pity all of us.
#AGDA.
Can you see now that good exists?
#JORGHEN.
Where?
#AGDA.
Within yourself.
#JORGHEN.
Pooh! - Is there anything else I can do for you?
#AGDA.
Yes, secretary, if you would write to Luebeck and ask Jacob....
#JORGHEN.
I have not much use for love - affairs, but I'll write, nevertheless, provided we find that he really has gone away.
#AGDA.
Thank you!
#JORGHEN.
What are you doing, woman? I am no bishop! - But hush! Here comes illustrious company. So I think I'll sneak off!
#AGDA.
Please, secretary, don't forget me now!
#JORGHEN.
So you don't trust me? Well, there is not much to trust in!
#KING.
Do you think we have been recognised?
#PRINCE JOHAN.
No, I don't think so, father.
#KING.
Bing, then.
#PRINCE JOHAN.
The bell does not ring.
#KING.
Knock.
#PRINCE JOHAN.
Nobody seems to answer.
#KING.
I must get hold of Herman Israel this very evening - I must!
#PRINCE JOHAN.
You are worried, father?
#KING.
I am certainly not at ease.
#PRINCE JOHAN.
Money cares again?
#KING.
Oh, don't talk of it! - Knock again.
#PRINCE JOHAN.
There is no one there.
#KING.
Are you mocking me?
#FIRST BEGGAR.
We are perishing, my noble lord!
#KING.
I am perishing, too! - Why are you begging, anyhow?
#SECOND BEGGAR.
I'll tell you. Because the King has seized the tithes that went to the poor before. And when he did so, he said: "You can beg!"
#KING.
And what is he doing with the tithes of the poor?
#FIRST BEGGAR.
Paying Prince Eric's le - lecheries!
#KING.
No, paying the country's debt, you knaves! Give them money, so we get rid of them.
#PRINCE JOHAN.
You'll have to share it between you, and then away - at once!
#KING.
I wonder who sent them? Somebody must have sent them! - Knock again. What unspeakable humiliation! You see, my son, that no matter how high up you get, new and then you have to climb down again. But of anything like this I never dreamt.
#PRINCE JOHAN.
May I speak?
#KING.
No, you may not, for I know what you mean to say.
#BARBRO.
That must be the Councillor himself.
#WIDOW.
Can that be Herman Israel who is sitting there? My eyes have grown blind with sorrow.
#BARBRO.
It must be him.
#BARBRO.
Are you the Councillor?
#KING.
What do you want of him?
#BARBRO.
Mr. Syndic, we are the bereaved dependents of Mons Nilsson, and we have come to pray that you put in a good word for us with the King.
#KING.
Why do you think the Councillor's word will be of any help?
#BARBRO.
We have been told that he is the King's only friend, and we thought he might help us to get back the property of which we have been unjustly deprived.
#KING.
Unjustly, you say? As a traitor, Mons Nilsson was judged forfeit of life and goods - which was only just!
#BARBRO.
But the dower of the innocent widow should not have been taken with the rest.
#KING.
What is your name?
#BARBRO.
I was baptised with the name of Barbro, and the King himself acted as my godfather when he was in Dalecarlia at that time.
#KING.
Barbro? - Have you ever seen the King?
#BARBRO.
Not since I was too small to know him. But the last time he visited Copperberg, my father was expecting him, and we children were to greet him with a song.
#KING.
What song was that?
#BARBRO.
I cannot sing since my father came to his death so miserably, but it was a song about King Gustavus and the Dalecarlians, and this is the way it ended:
#KING.
Say something really bad about the King!
#BARBRO.
No, father told us we must never do that, no matter what we might hear other people say.
#KING.
Did your father tell you that?
#BARBRO.
Yes, he did.
#KING.
Go in peace now. I shall speak to the King, and you shall have your rights, for he wants to do right, and he tries to do it.
#BARBRO.
If the King were as gracious as you are, Councillor, there would be no cause for worry.
#KING.
He is, my child, and I know that he won't refuse his goddaughter anything. Go in peace now!
#KING.
Who can have sent them? Who? - Here I have to sit like a defendant - I, the highest judge of the land!
#PRINCE JOHAN.
May I say a word?
#KING.
No, because I can tell myself what you want to say. I can tell that the hand of the Lord has been laid heavily upon me, although I cannot tell why. If the Lord speaks through conscience and prayer, then it is he who has made me act as I have acted. Why my obedience should be punished, I cannot grasp. But I submit to a higher wisdom that lies beyond my reason. - That girl was my goddaughter, and her father was my friend, and I had to take his head.... Oh, cruel life, that has to be lived nevertheless! Knock again.
#MARCUS.
Your Highness!
#KING.
Still more? message from Herman Israel.
#KING.
At last! - Speak!
#MARCUS.
Herman Israel has this afternoon set sail for Luebeck.
#KING.
Then I am lost! - God help me!
#PRINCE JOHAN.
And all of us!
#AGDA.
Is that you, Marcus?
#MARCUS.
Yes, Agda, it's me.
#AGDA.
Where is Jacob?
#MARCUS.
He has started on a journey - a very long one.
#AGDA.
Where?
#MARCUS.
I cannot tell. But he asked me to bring you his greeting and to give you this ring.
#AGDA.
As a keepsake only, or as a plight of his troth?
#MARCUS.
Read what it says.
#AGDA.
Yes, I can spell a little "For ever," it says. What does it mean?
#MARCUS.
I fear it means - farewell for ever.
#AGDA.
No, no, it means that he is dead!
#AGDA.
Who killed him?
#MARCUS.
The law and his own crime. He rebelled against his father and his country.
#AGDA.
To save mine! - Oh, what is to become of me?
#MARCUS.
That's the way of the world. Nothing but deceit and uncertainty.
#AGDA.
Alas, he was like all the rest!
#MARCUS.
Yes, all human beings are pretty much alike. He who is no worse than the rest is no better, either. Good - bye!
#CHRISTINE.
Do I disturb you?
#OLAVUS.
Naturally, as I am writing.
#CHRISTINE.
Are you sure that you are writing?
#OLAVUS.
Absolutely sure.
#CHRISTINE.
But I have not seen your pen move for a long while.
#OLAVUS.
That was because I was thinking.
#CHRISTINE.
Once....
#OLAVUS.
Yes, once upon a time!
#CHRISTINE.
Can Reginald come in and say good - bye?
#OLAVUS.
Are we that far already?
#CHRISTINE.
The carriage is waiting and all his things have been packed.
#OLAVUS.
Let him come, then.
#CHRISTINE.
Are you certain that he is going to Wittenberg to study?
#OLAVUS.
I have seen too much uncertainty, as you know, to be certain of anything. If you have reason to doubt the feasibility of his plans, you had better say so.
#CHRISTINE.
If I had any doubts, I would not disturb you with them.
#OLAVUS.
Always equally amiable! Will you please ask Reginald to come here?
#CHRISTINE.
I'll do whatever you command.
#OLAVUS.
And as I never command, but merely ask....
#CHRISTINE.
If you would command your precious son now and then, he might be a little more polite and obedient to his mother.
#OLAVUS.
Reginald is hard, I admit, but you do wrong in trying to educate him to suit your own high pleasure.
#CHRISTINE.
Do you side with the children against their parents?
#OLAVUS.
If I am not mistaken, I have always done so when the natural rights of the children were concerned.
#CHRISTINE.
Have the children any natural rights to anything?
#OLAVUS.
Of course, they have! You haven't forgotten how we....
#CHRISTINE.
Yes, I have forgotten every bit of that old tommy - rot! I have forgotten how you swore to love me. I have forgotten the noise made about the pope's beard, and the stealing of the church silver, and the humbug with the bells, and the pure faith, and roast ducks and cackling swans, and martyrs with a taste for fighting, and the following of Christ with wine and women, and the scratching of eyes and tearing of hair, until we now have twenty - five brand new faiths in place of a holy Catholic Church.... I have forgotten every bit of it!
#OLAVUS.
Perhaps that was the best thing you could do. And will you please ask Reginald to come here now?
#CHRISTINE.
Certainly, I'll ask him to come here, and it will be a great pleasure to do so.
#OLAVUS.
Happy she, who has been able to forget! I remember everything! returns with REGINALD.
#REGINALD.
I want mother to go out, because I can't talk when she is here.
#OLAVUS.
There won't be so very much to talk about.
#CHRISTINE.
I won't say a word; only listen - and look at you.
#REGINALD.
No, you mustn't look at us.
#OLAVUS.
Be quiet, boy, and be civil to your mother! When you go travelling, there is no telling whether you ever come back.
#REGINALD.
So much the better!
#OLAVUS.
What's that?
#REGINALD.
I am tired of everything, and I just wish I were dead!
#OLAVUS.
Yes, that's the way youth talks nowadays!
#REGINALD.
And why? Because we don't know what to believe!
#OLAVUS.
Oh, you don't? And how about the articles of confession? Don't you believe in them?
#REGINALD.
Believe, you say? Don't you know that belief comes as a grace of God?
#OLAVUS.
Are you a Calvinist?
#REGINALD.
I don't know what I am. When I talk with Prince Johan, he says I am a papist, and when I meet Prince Eric, he tells me I am a follower of Zwingli.
#OLAVUS.
And now you wish to go to Wittenberg to learn the true faith from Doctor Martin Luther?
#REGINALD.
I know his teachings and don't believe in them,
#OLAVUS.
Is that so?
#REGINALD.
To him belief is everything, and deeds nothing. I have believed, but it didn't make my deeds any better at all, and so I felt like a perfect hypocrite in the end.
#OLAVUS.
Is Prince Johan a Catholic?
#REGINALD.
So he must be, as he sticks to deeds, which ought to be the main thing.
#OLAVUS.
And Prince Eric belongs to the Reformed Church, you say?
#REGINALD.
Yes, in so far as he believes in the dispensation of grace. And Jorghen Persson must be a Satanist, I think. And young Sture is absolutely an Anabaptist....
#OLAVUS.
Well, this is news to me! I thought the days of schism were past....
#REGINALD.
Schism, yes - that's the word Prince Johan is using always. We had a Catholic Church, and then....
#OLAVUS.
Oh, shut your mouth and go to Wittenberg!
#REGINALD.
As it is your wish, father - but I won't study any more theology.
#OLAVUS.
Why not?
#REGINALD.
I think it is device of the devil to make people hate each other.
#CHRISTINE.
Good for you, Reginald!
#OLAVUS.
And it had to come to this in my own house! Pulchre, bene, rede! - Who, Reginald, do you think has caused this dissension under which you young people are suffering now?
#REGINALD.
That's easily answered.
#OLAVUS.
Of course! We old ones, you mean? But we, too, were children of our time, and were stripped of our faith by our prophets. Who is, then, to blame?
#REGINALD.
No one.
#OLAVUS.
And what do you mean to do with your future?
#REGINALD.
My future? It appears to me like a grey mist without a ray of sunlight. And should a ray ever break through, it will at once be proved a will - o' - the - wisp leading us astray.
#OLAVUS.
That's just how I felt once! At your age I could see my whole future as in vision. I foresaw the bitter cup and the pillory. And yet I had to go on. I had to enter the mist, and I myself had to carry the will - o' - the - wisp that must lead the wanderers astray. I foretold this very moment, even, when my son would stand before me saying: "Thus I am, because thus you have made me!" You noticed, perhaps, that I was not surprised - and this is the reason.
#REGINALD.
What am I to do? Advise me!
#OLAVUS.
You, no more than I, will follow the advices given you.
#REGINALD.
Inform me, then! Tell me: what is life?
#OLAVUS.
That's more than I know. But I think it must be a punishment or an ordeal. At your years I thought I knew everything and understood everything. Now I know nothing and understand nothing. For that reason I rest satisfied with doing my duty and bearing what comes my way.
#REGINALD.
But I want to know!
#OLAVUS.
You want to know what is not allowed to be known. Try to know and you will perish! - However, do you want to go or stay?
#REGINALD.
I am going to Wittenberg to pull Luther to pieces!
#OLAVUS.
That's the way to speak! O thou splendid youth with thy Alexandrian regret that there are no more things to pull to pieces!
#REGINALD.
Are you not a Lutheran?
#OLAVUS.
I am a Protestant.
#CHRISTINE.
If you have finished now, I shall ask permission to tell in a single word what Luther is - just one word!
#OLAVUS.
Oh, do, before you burst!
#CHRISTINE.
Luther is dead!
#OLAVUS.
Dead?
#CHRISTINE.
That's what my brother - in - law writes me in this letter from Magdeburg.
#OLAVUS.
Dead! My poor Alexander, what will you pull to pieces now?
#REGINALD.
First the universe, and then myself.
#OLAVUS.
Go ahead, then, but begin with yourself. The universe will always remain.
#CHRISTINE.
Will there be peace on earth now?
#OLAVUS.
That will never be! - Let me have that letter.
#OLAVUS.
Come!
#OLAVUS.
The King!
#KING.
Yes, but for how long? Do you know who Dacke is? - A farm labourer who has killed a bailiff; a common thief and incendiary, who is now writing to me with a demand of answer. I am to take pen in hand and open correspondence with a scamp like him! Do you know that he has crossed the Kolmord Forests and stands with one foot in West Gothia and the other in East Gothia? - Who is back of him? The Emperor, the Elector Frederick of the Palatinate, Magnus Haraldsson, the runaway Bishop of Skara, the Duke of Mecklenburg. The Emperor wishes to put the children of Christian the Tyrant back on the throne. But what troubles me more than anything else is to find the Luebeckians and Herman Israel on the same side - my old friend Herman! I ask you how it can be possible. And who has done this to me? Who? - Have you not a word to say?
#OLAVUS.
What can I say, and what - may I say?
#KING.
Don't be hard on me, Olof, and don't be vengeful, I am nothing but an unfortunate human creature who has had to drink humiliation like water, and I come to you as my spiritual guide. I am in despair because I fear that the Lord has deserted me for ever. - What an infernal notion of mine that was to take the head of the Dalecarlians just now, when I am in such need of them! Do you think that deed was displeasing to the Lord? But if I have sinned like David, you must be my Nathan.
#OLAVUS.
I have lost the power of prophecy, and I am not the right man to inflict punishment.
#KING.
Console me, then, Olof.
#OLAVUS.
I cannot, because only those who repent can accept consolation.
#KING.
You mean that I have transgressed - that I have gone too far? Speak up! But do it like a servant of the Lord, and not like a conceited schoolmaster.... Have I gone too far?
#OLAVUS.
That is not the way to put the question. The proper way is to ask whether the others have any right on their side.
#KING.
Go ahead and ask!
#OLAVUS.
Dacke is the mouthpiece of warranted dissatisfaction. Being the brother - in - law of Christian II, the Emperor is the guardian of his children, and they have inherited a claim to the Swedish throne, as the constitution cannot be cancelled by a rebellion. Bishop Magnus Haraldsson is the spokesman of all the illegally exiled bishops.
#KING.
Illegally, you say?
#OLAVUS.
Yes, because the law of Sweden does not drive any man away on account of his faith.
#KING.
Take care!
#OLAVUS.
Too late now! - The dissatisfaction of the peasants is warranted, because the Riksdag at Vesterås authorised the King to seize only the property of bishops and convents. When he took what belonged to parish churches and private persons, he became guilty of a crime.
#KING.
You are a daring man!
#OLAVUS.
Nothing compared with what I used to be! - As far as Herman Israel is concerned, he called recently on the King to offer a treaty of friendship, and it was stupid of the King to reject it.
#KING.
Stop!
#OLAVUS.
Not yet! - The gold and silver of the churches was meant to pay the debt to Luebeck, and much of it was used for that purpose, but a considerable part found its way to Eskil's Chamber under the Royal Palace, and has since been wasted on Prince Eric's silly courtships among other things....
#KING.
The devil you say!
#OLAVUS.
Well, Queen Elizabeth is merely making fun of him.
#KING.
Do you know that?
#OLAVUS.
I do. - The bells were also to be used in payment of the debt to Luebeck, but a part of them went to the foundry and were turned into cannon, which was not right.
#KING.
Is that so?
#OLAVUS.
Add also that the Convent of Vreta was left unmolested in violation of the ordinance concerning the closing of all such places - and for no other reason than that the King's mother - in - law happened to be a Catholic. This is a cowardly and mischievous omission that has caused much bad blood.
#KING.
The convent is to be closed.
#OLAVUS.
It should be closed now, and it is not! - If I were to sum up what is reprehensible in my great King, I should call it a lack of piety.
#KING.
That's the worst yet! What do you mean?
#OLAVUS.
Piety is the respect shown by the stronger even if he be a man of destiny - for the feelings of the weaker, when these spring from a childlike, and for that reason religious, mind.
#KING.
Oh, is that what it is?
#OLAVUS.
Now I have said my say.
#KING.
Yes, so you have - time and again.
#OLAVUS.
And if my King had been willing to listen now and then, he would have learned a great deal more. But it is a common fault of princes that they won't listen to anybody but themselves.
#KING.
Well, I never heard the like of it! I am astounded - most of all because I haven't killed you on the spot!
#OLAVUS.
Why don't you?
#KING.
Who are you? humble instrument of the Lord, shaped to serve what is really great - that marvellous man of God, to whom it was granted to unite all Swedish men and lands.
#KING.
That was granted Engelbrecht, too, and his reward was the axe that split his head. Is that to be my reward, too?
#OLAVUS.
I don't think so, your Highness, but it depends on yourself.
#KING.
What am I to do?
#OLAVUS.
What you advised me to do when I was carried away by the zeal of my youth.
#KING.
And you think it necessary to return that advice to me now?
#OLAVUS.
Why not? I have learned from life, and you have forgotten.
#KING.
What am I to do?
#OLAVUS.
Answer Dacke's letter.
#KING.
Never! Am I to bow down to a vagabond?
#OLAVUS.
The Lord sometimes uses mere vagabonds for our humiliation. Picture it to yourself as an ordeal by fire.
#KING.
There is truth in what you say. I can feel it, but it does not fetch bottom in my mind. Say one word more.
#OLAVUS.
Dacke will be right as long as you are in the wrong, and God will be with him until you take your place on the side of right.
#KING.
I can't bend!
#OLAVUS.
Then you'll be broken by someone else.
#KING.
Are you thinking of the Dalecarlians? Have you heard of a rising among them on account of the executions?
#OLAVUS.
Such a thing has been rumoured.
#KING.
I am lost.
#OLAVUS.
Write to Dacke!
#KING.
I won't.
#OLAVUS.
The Emperor does.
#KING.
That's true! If the Emperor can write to him, why shouldn't I? - But it is perfectly senseless. Who is this mysterious man who never appears?
#OLAVUS.
Perhaps another marvellous man of God - in his own way.
#KING.
I must see him face to face. I'll write and offer him safe - conduct, so that I can talk with him. That's what I'll do. - Bring me pen and paper! Or you write, and I'll dictate.
#KING.
How do we begin? What am I to call him?
#OLAVUS.
Let us merely put down "To Nils Dacke."
#KING.
Oh, his name is Nils? After St. Nicolaus, who comes with rods for children on the sixth of December? Write now.... No, I'll go home and do the writing myself.... Have you heard that Luther is dead?
#OLAVUS.
I have, your Highness.
#KING.
He was a splendid man! May he rest in peace! - Yes, such as he was, he was a fine man, but we got rather too much of him.
#OLAVUS.
Too many dogmas and not enough of religion.
#KING.
He was an obstinate fellow and went too far. What he needed was a taskmaster like you to call him to terms now and then.
#OLAVUS.
I hope the time of schism and dissension will come to an end now. time of dissension you may well call it! - Good - bye, Olof. Yes, yes, I will write!
#QUEEN.
For the last time I beg you, mother, don't wear that dress!
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
It is my festive garb, and I am as proud of it as you of your ermine robe.
#QUEEN.
What is the use of being proud? The day of disaster is upon us all, and we must hold together.
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
Let us do so then, and have peace.
#QUEEN.
Yes, so you say, but you won't even change dress for the sake of the country's peace.
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
I don't change faith as you change clothes, and there is a solemn vow to God connected with this dress. The people are making threats against my life. Let them take it! I have my grave - clothes on.
#QUEEN.
Don't you know that we may have to flee this very day, if the news should prove as bad as yesterday?
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
I will not flee.
#QUEEN.
Everything has already been packed by order of the King, and our sloop lies at the foot of the southern hills, ready to hoist sail.
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
I have nothing to pack, because I own nothing. "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life." That's what I used to learn. But you have sold your birthright for a crown which soon will no longer be yours.
#QUEEN.
Go on and punish me; it feels like a relief.
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
Can you tell me what has come over Eric these last days? He looks quite submissive, and something new has come into his face that used to be so hard.
#QUEEN.
I don't know, but they say that he has changed his ways and cannot bear the company of Jorghen. I have heard whispers about a serious affection....
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
No!
#QUEEN.
What news do you bring?
#PRINCE ERIC.
No news at all, mother.
#QUEEN.
He called me mother! How fare you, Eric? Is life heavy?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Heavier than it was the day before yesterday.
#QUEEN.
What happened yesterday?
#PRINCE ERIC.
What happens to a human being only once in a lifetime. - Are you much wiser now?
#QUEEN.
How childlike he has grown! Have you heard anything of your friend Jacob?
#PRINCE ERIC.
Yes, he was my real friend, and so they took his head.
#QUEEN.
Now you are unjust. There has been no attempt to take the head of Jorghen....
#PRINCE ERIC.
He is no longer my friend. But now I don't want to be questioned any longer, least of all about my secrets - that is, about the secrets of my heart. Queen. He is quite charming in his childishness. Apparently he would love to talk of his secret.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Soon we may have nothing left to fight over, brother Johan, and so - it seems to me we may as well be friends.
#PRINCE JOHAN.
With a right good heart, brother! Nothing could give me greater pleasure.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Give me your hand! I don't want to be the enemy of any human being after this.
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
What's the matter with Eric?
#PRINCE JOHAN.
He has found a sweetheart, they say.
#QUEEN.
What did I say?
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
Are you coming with me to the mass in the chapel, Johan? Johan!
#QUEEN.
Mother!
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
Is he free to follow his conscience, or is he not?
#QUEEN.
If you will leave his conscience alone, he will be free.
#MOTHER-IN-LAW.
Well, I am going, and you know where, Johan.
#QUEEN.
Johan!
#PRINCE JOHAN.
What do you wish?
#QUEEN.
That you do not desert your childhood faith.
#PRINCE JOHAN.
My childhood faith, which I got from my nurse, and not from you, was also the childhood faith of my father. Why did you not give me yours?
#QUEEN.
Yes, punish me. You have a right to do so. Everything comes home to us now. I was young then. Life was nothing but a game. The King demanded my company at banquets and festivities, and so your cradle was left unattended and unguarded. Those were the days when we were drunk with victory and happiness. And now! - Go where you find it possible to worship, Johan, and pray for your mother!
#PRINCE JOHAN.
If it hurts my gracious mother, I won't go.
#QUEEN.
Pray for us all! I do not know the new prayers and must not use the old ones! - Hush now! The King is coming.
#KING.
Have everything ready for the start. We are lost!
#QUEEN.
The will of God be done!
#KING.
That's what seems to be happening. Go and look after your house, child.
#KING.
This is the situation. Dacke answers that he does not care to see "that rebel, and perjurer, and breaker of safe - conducts, Ericsson." He rails me Ericsson, mind you. His people have reached as far north as Södermanland - which means that they are right at our gates! Furthermore, two thousand Dalecarlians are encamped at the North Gate. Their intentions are not known, but can easily be guessed. A fine prophet you are, Olof!
#OLAVUS.
We have not seen the end yet.
#KING.
Where do you get your confidence from?
#OLAVUS.
That's more than I can tell, but I know that everything will end well.
#KING.
You say that you know? How do you know? I have ceased to believe anything - except in the wrath of God, which has been turned against me. I am now waiting for the axe. Good and well! I have done my service and am now to be discharged. That's why I wish to leave before I am kicked out. - Do you know what day it is to - day? Nobody has thought of it, and I didn't remember until just now.... It is Midsummer Day: my day, which no one celebrates. A generation ago I made my entry into the capital on this day. That was the greatest moment of my life. I thought the work of liberation was done, and I thanked God for it! - But it had not been done, and I am not done with it yet. - The Dalecarlians rose. I subdued them, and thought that I was done, which I was not. Twice more they rose, and each time I gave thanks to God, thinking I had done - which was not the case. The lords of West Gothia rose. I squelched them, and was happy, thinking that I surely must have done by that time - which I had not. And now, Olof? - We are never done until done for - and that's where I am now!
#OLAVUS.
Oh, no, there is a whole lot left.
#KING.
Where do you get your fixed ideas from? Have you heard some bird sing, or have you been dreaming?
#OLAVUS.
Neither.
#KING.
Listen! That's the sound of birch - horns. Do they mean to give me a crown of birch, like the one I gave to Peder the Chancellor and Master Knut? Or is it the scaffold that.... that?...
#OLAVUS.
Oh, don't!
#KING.
What was it you called that thing - piety? Much it would have availed me to have piety at Larv Heath or Tuna Plain! - No, I have been right, right, right, so God help me, amen!
#KING.
They have drums, too. - Oh, everything comes home! - Do you think I can get out of this, Olof?
#OLAVUS.
I do! And let me give you a final piece of advice: don't leave!
#KING.
I don't see how it can be avoided. Do you think I'll let them take my head? - Do you know, I can actually hear the tramp - tramp of their feet as they come marching through the North Gate. And that's the Dalecarlians - my own Dalecarlians! Oh, life is cruel! Can you hear it? Tramp - tramp - tramp! Do you think I can get out of this?
#OLAVUS.
I do.
#KING.
When the sun rises to - morrow I shall know my fate. I wish I were that far already! - Now I hear something else! What is that?
#OLAVUS.
The Queen's mother is reading the Romish litany.
#KING.
But I hear a male voice, too.
#OLAVUS.
That's Prince Johan.
#KING.
Johan? - So I must drink that cup, too! I wonder if the cup is full yet? Is everything that I have built to be torn down?
#OLAVUS.
Everything you have torn down must be built up again.
#KING.
Johan a papist, and Eric a Calvinist! - Do you remember the days when we were crying in the words of Von Hutten: "The souls are waking up, and it is a joy to live"? A joy to live, indeed - ha - ha! And the souls woke up to find their feet on the pillows! Was it you who said that the gods are playing with us? - Hush! I was mistaken a while ago! It's the North Bridge they are crossing! Can't you hear their heavy tread on the planking of the bridge? Let us fly! Here I place my resignation.
#OLAVUS.
I'll take care of that. I'll keep it - as a memento! And now we'll hoist a flag of truce.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Father!
#KING.
Croak away, raven!
#PRINCE ERIC.
Our last hope is gone! The sloop has dragged its anchor and gone ashore.
#KING.
And lightning has struck the nursery, and the grasshoppers have eaten the crops, and the waters are rising, and....
#PRINCE ERIC.
The Dalecarlians are negotiating with the palace guards, and they are awfully drunk.
#KING.
Come on, death!
#PRINCE ERIC.
I can hear their wooden shoes on the garden stairs!
#KING.
Anders Persson, Mons Nilsson, Master John.
#PRINCE ERIC.
Now he is here!
#KING.
Inghel Hansson, Master Stig, Nils of Söderby. God is just!
#ENGELBRECHT.
Are you the King?
#KING.
No, I am the King!
#ENGELBRECHT.
Yes, so I see now!
#KING.
Who are you?
#ENGELBRECHT.
Don't you know me?...
#KING.
I don't.
#ENGELBRECHT.
Well, don't you know this one?
#KING.
I don't understand at all. What is your name?
#ENGELBRECHT.
Well - it happens to be Engelbrecht!
#KING.
Eng - el - brecht?
#ENGELBRECHT.
It sounds mighty big, but I am not of that family. - You see, it was like this - once upon a time the King - who was no king at all then - oh, mercy, but I am drunk!... Well, it was me who followed you on skis to the border of Norway, and that time you gave me this here dagger and said: "If you ever need me, come on!" Now I've come, and here I am! And I wish only that I was not so frightfully drunk!
#KING.
And what do you want?
#ENGELBRECHT.
What I want? - I want to fight that man Dacke, of course, and that's what the rest of them want, too.
#KING.
You want to fight Dacke?
#ENGELBRECHT.
Why do you think we have come, anyhow?
#KING.
Eternal God, now you have punished me!
#ENGELBRECHT.
Is it all right? You see, the rest are down there and they'd like to do something to celebrate the day.
#KING.
Is it all right? - Ask me for a favour!
#ENGELBRECHT.
I'd like to shake hands!
#ENGELBRECHT.
My, what a fist! Hard as nails, but clean! Yes, and a devil of a fellow you are, all in all! - I must say I was rather scared when I came here!
#KING.
Are all the rest of them as drunk as you are?
#ENGELBRECHT.
About the same! But they can toot the horns for all that. Poo - ala! Poo - ala! Poo Oy - ala! Oy - ala! Oy!
#KING.
You have punished me, O Lord, and I thank thee!
