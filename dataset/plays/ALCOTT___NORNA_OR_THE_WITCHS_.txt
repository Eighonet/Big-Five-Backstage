#THERESA.
I cannot pray; my aching heart finds rest alone in tears. Ah, what a wretched fate is mine! Forced by a father's will to wed a stranger ere I learned to love, one short year hath taught me what a bitter thing it is to wear a chain that binds me unto one who hath proved himself both jealous and unkind. The fair hopes I once cherished are now gone, and here a captive in my splendid home I dwell forsaken, sorrowing and alone Ha, my brother's signal! What can bring him hither at this hour? Louis, is it thou? Enter; "all's well."
#THERESA.
Ah, Louis, what hath chanced? Why art thou here? Some danger must have brought thee; tell me, dear brother. Let me serve thee.
#LOUIS.
Sister dearest, thy kindly offered aid is useless now. Thou canst not help me; and I must add another sorrow to the many that are thine. I came to say farewell, Theresa.
#THERESA.
Farewell! Oh, brother, do not leave me! Thy love is all now left to cheer my lonely life. Wherefore must thou go? Tell me, I beseech thee!
#LOUIS.
Forgive me if I grieve thee. I will tell thee all. Thy husband hates me, for I charged him with neglect and cruelty to thee; and he hath vowed revenge for my bold words. He hath whispered false tales to the king, he hath blighted all my hopes of rank and honor. I am banished from the land, and must leave thee and Leonore, and wander forth an outcast and alone. But - let him beware! - I shall return to take a deep revenge for thy wrongs and my own. Nay, sister, grieve not thus. I have sworn to free thee from his power, and I will keep my vow. Hope on and bear a little longer, dear Theresa, and ere long I will bear thee to a happy home Ha! what is that? Who comes?
#THERESA.
'Tis my lord returning from the court. Fly, Louis, fly! Thou art lost if he discover thee. Heaven bless and watch above thee. Remember poor Theresa, and farewell.
#LOUIS.
One last word of Leonore. I have never told my love, yet she hath smiled on me, and I should have won her hand. Ah, tell her this, and bid her to be true to him who in his exile will hope on, and yet return to claim the heart he hath loved so faithfully. Farewell, my sister. Despair not, - I shall return.
#THERESA.
Thank Heaven, he is safe! - but oh, my husband, this last deed of thine is hard to bear. Poor Louis, parted from Leonore, his fair hopes blighted, all by thy cruel hand. Ah, he comes! I must be calm.
#RODOLPHO.
What, weeping still? Hast thou no welcome for thy lord save tears and sighs? I'll send thee to a convent if thou art not more gay!
#THERESA.
I'll gladly go, my lord. I am weary of the world. Its gayeties but make my heart more sad.
#RODOLPHO.
Nay, then I will take thee to the court, and there thou must be gay. But I am weary; bring me wine, and smile upon me as thou used to do. Dost hear me? Weep no more. Ha! what is that? 'Tis none of mine. How came it hither? Answer, I command thee!
#THERESA.
I cannot. I must not, dare not tell thee.
#RODOLPHO.
Darest thou refuse to answer? Speak! Who hath dared to venture hither? Is it thy brother? As thou lovest life, I bid thee speak.
#THERESA.
I am innocent, and will not betray the only one now left me on the earth to love. Oh, pardon me, my lord; I will obey in all but this.
#RODOLPHO.
Thou shalt obey. I'll take thy life but I will know. Thy brother must be near, - this dagger was not here an hour ago. Thy terror hath betrayed him. I leave thee now to bid them search the castle. But if I find him not, I shall return; and if thou wilt not then confess, I'll find a way to make thee. Remember, I have vowed, - thy secret or thy life!
#THERESA.
My life I freely yield thee, but my secret - never. Oh, Louis, I will gladly die to save thee. Life hath no joy for me; and in the grave this poor heart may forget the bitter sorrows it is burdened with
#RODOLPHO.
The search is vain. He hath escaped. Theresa, rise, and answer me. To whom belonged the dagger I have found? Thy tears avail not; I will be obeyed. Kneel not to me, I will not pardon. Answer, or I swear I'll make thee dumb forever.
#THERESA.
No, no! I will not betray. Oh, husband, spare me! Let not the hand that led me to the altar be stained with blood I would so gladly shed for thee. I cannot answer thee.
#RODOLPHO.
Then die: thy constancy is useless. I will find thy brother and take a fearful vengeance yet.
#THERESA.
I am faithful to the last. Husband, I forgive thee.
#RODOLPHO.
'Tis done, and I am rid of her forever; but 'tis an ugly deed. Poor fool, there was a time when I could pity thee, but thou hast stood 'twixt me and Lady Leonore, and now I am free. I must conceal the form, and none shall ever know the crime.
#NORNA.
Heaven shield us! What is this? His cruel hand hath done the deed, and I am powerless to save. Poor, murdered lady, I had hoped to spare thee this, and lead thee to a happier home. Perchance, 'tis better so. The dead find rest, and thy sad heart can ache no more. Rest to thy soul, sweet lady. But for thee, thou cruel villain, I have in store a deep revenge for all thy sinful deeds. If there be power in spell or charm, I'll conjure fearful dreams upon thy head. I'll follow thee wherever thou mayst go, and haunt thy sleep with evil visions. I'll whisper strange words that shall appall thee; dark phantoms shall rise up before thee, and wild voices ringing in thine ear shall tell thee of thy sins. By all these will I make life like a hideous dream, and death more fearful still. Like a vengeful ghost I will haunt thee to thy grave, and so revenge thy wrongs, poor, murdered lady. Beware, Rodolpho! Old Norna's curse is on thee.
#LOUIS.
Yes; 'tis the spot. How dark and still! She is not here. Ho, Norna, mighty sorceress! I seek thy aid.
#NORNA.
I am here.
#LOUIS.
I seek thee, Norna, to learn tidings of one most dear to me. Dost thou know aught of Count Rodolpho's wife? A strange tale hath reached me that not many nights ago she disappeared, and none know whither she hath gone. Oh, tell me, is this true?
#NORNA.
It is most true.
#LOUIS.
And canst thou tell me whither she hath gone? I will reward thee well.
#NORNA.
I can. She lies within her tomb, in the chapel of the castle.
#LOUIS.
Dead! - it cannot be! They told me she had fled away with some young lord who had won her love. Was it not true?
#NORNA.
It is false as the villain's heart who framed the tale. I bore the murdered lady to her tomb, and laid her there.
#LOUIS.
Murdered? How? When? By whom? Oh, tell me I beseech thee!
#NORNA.
Her husband's cruel hand took the life he had made a burden. I heard him swear it ere he dealt the blow.
#LOUIS.
Wherefore did he kill her? Oh, answer quickly or I shall go mad with grief and hate.
#NORNA.
I can tell thee little. From my hiding - place I heard her vow never to confess whose dagger had been found in her apartment, and her jealous lord, in his wild anger, murdered her.
#LOUIS.
'Twas mine. Would it had been sheathed in mine own breast ere it had caused so dark a deed! Ah, Theresa, why did I leave thee to a fate like this?
#NORNA.
Young man, grieve not; it is too late to save, but there is left to thee a better thing than grief.
#LOUIS.
Oh, what?
#NORNA.
Revenge!
#LOUIS.
Thou art right. I'll weep no more. Give me thine aid, O mighty wizard, and I will serve thee well.
#NORNA.
Who art thou? The poor lady's lover?
#LOUIS.
Ah, no; far nearer and far deeper was the love I bore her, for I am her brother.
#NORNA.
Ha, that's well! Thou wilt join me, for I have made a vow to rest not till that proud, sinful lord hath well atoned for this deep crime. Spirits shall haunt him, and the darkest phantoms that my art can raise shall scare his soul. Wilt thou join me in my work?
#LOUIS.
I will, - but stay! thou hast spoken of spirits. Dread sorceress, is it in thy power to call them up?
#NORNA.
It is. Wilt see my skill. Stand back while I call up a phantom which thou canst not doubt.
#LOUIS.
'Tis enough! I own thy power, and by the spirit of my murdered sister I have looked upon, I swear to aid thee in thy dark work.
#NORNA.
'Tis well; and I will use my power to guard thee from the danger that surrounds thee. And now, farewell. Remember, - thou hast sworn.
#RODOLPHO.
They told me that old Norna's cave was 'mong these rocks, and yet I find it not. By her I hope to learn where young Count Louis is concealed. Once in my power, he shall not escape to whisper tales of evil deeds against me. Stay! some one comes. I'll ask my way. Ho, stand, good sir. Canst guide me to the cell of Norna, the old sorceress?
#LOUIS.
It were little use to tell thee; thou wouldst only win a deeper curse than that she hath already laid upon thee.
#RODOLPHO.
Hold! who art thou that dare to speak thus to Count Rodolpho?
#LOUIS.
That thou canst never know; but this I tell thee: I am thy deadliest foe, and, aided by the wizard Norna, seek to work thee evil, and bring down upon thy head the fearful doom thy sin deserves. Wouldst thou know more, - then seek the witch, and learn the hate she bears thee.
#RODOLPHO.
Fool! thinkst thou I fear thee or thy enchantments? Draw, and defend thyself! Thou shalt pay dearly for thine insolence to me!
#LOUIS.
I will not stain my weapon with a murderer's blood. I leave thee to the fate that gathers round thee.
#RODOLPHO.
"Murderer," said he. I am betrayed, - yet no one saw the deed. Yet, stay! perchance 'twas he who bore Theresa away. He has escaped me, and will spread the tale. Nay, why should I fear? Courage! One blow, and I am safe! What's that? - her deathlike face, - the wound my hand hath made! Help! help! help!
#RODOLPHO.
I see no way save that. Were young Count Louis dead she would forget the love that had just begun, and by sweet words and gifts I may yet win her. The young lord must die Ha! what is that? 'Tis nothing; fie upon my fear! I'll banish all remembrance of the fearful shape my fancy conjured up within the forest. I'll not do the deed myself, - I have had enough of blood. Hugo the bandit: he is just the man, - bold, sure of hand, and secret. I will bribe him well, and when the deed is done, find means to rid me of him lest he should play me false. I saw him in the courtyard as I entered. Perchance he is not yet gone. Ho, without there! Bid Hugo here if he be within the castle. - He is a rough knave, but gold will make all sure.
#HUGO.
What would my lord with me?
#RODOLPHO.
I ask a favor of thee. Nay, never fear, I'll pay thee well. Wouldst earn a few gold pieces?
#HUGO.
Ay, my lord, most gladly would I.
#RODOLPHO.
Nay, sit, good Hugo. Here is wine; drink, and refresh thyself.
#HUGO.
Thanks, my lord. How can I serve you?
#RODOLPHO.
Dost thou know Count Louis, whom the king lately banished?
#HUGO.
Nay, my lord; I never saw him.
#RODOLPHO.
Ha! that is well. It matters not; 'tis not of him I speak. Take more wine, good Hugo. Listen, there is a certain lord, - one whom I hate. I seek his life. Here is gold - thou hast a dagger, and can use it well. Dost understand me?
#HUGO.
Ay, my lord, most clearly. Name the place and hour; count out the gold, - I and my dagger then are thine.
#RODOLPHO.
'Tis well. Now harken. In the forest, near old Norna's cave, there is a quiet spot. Do thou go there to - night at sunset. Watch well, and when thou seest a tall figure wrapped in a dark cloak, and masked, spring forth, and do the deed. Then fling the body down the rocks, or hide it in some secret place. Here is one half the gold; more shall be thine when thou shalt show some token that the deed is done.
#HUGO.
Thanks, Count; I'll do thy bidding. At sunset in the forest, - I'll be there, and see he leaves it not alive. Good - even, then, my lord.
#RODOLPHO.
Hugo, use well thy dagger, and gold awaits thee. Yet, stay! I'll meet thee in the wood, and pay thee there. They might suspect if they should see thee here again so soon. I'll meet thee there, and so farewell.
#HUGO.
Adieu, my lord.
#RODOLPHO.
Yes; all goes well. My rival dead, and Leonore is mine. With her I may forget the pale face that now seems ever looking into mine. I can almost think the deep wound shows in her picture yonder. But this is folly! Shame on thee, Rodolpho. I'll think of it no more. Ha! what is that? Am I going mad? See the eyes move, - it is Theresa's face! Nay, I will not look again. Yes, yes; 'tis there! Will this sad face haunt me forever?
#THERESA.
Forever! Forever!
#RODOLPHO.
Fiends take me, - 'tis her voice! It is no dream. Ah, let me go away - away!
#NORNA.
It is the hour I bid him come with the letter for Lady Leonore. Poor youth, his sister slain, his life in danger, and the lady of his love far from him, 'tis a bitter fate. But, if old Norna loses not her power, he shall yet win his liberty, his love, and his revenge. Ah, he comes, - nay, 'tis the ruffian Hugo. I will conceal myself, - some evil is afoot
#HUGO.
This is the spot. Here will I hide, and bide my time
#LOUIS.
She is not here. I'll wait awhile and think of Leonore. How will she receive this letter? Ah, could she know how, 'mid all my grief and danger, her dear face shines in my heart, and cheers me on. Ha, villain, thou hast killed me! I am dying! God bless thee, Leonore! Norna, remember, vengeance on Rodolpho!
#HUGO.
Nay, nay, thou wilt take no revenge; thy days are ended, thanks to this good steel. Now, for the token Ah, this he cannot doubt. I will take this ring too; 'tis a costly one. I'll hide the body in the thicket yonder, ere my lord arrives
#RODOLPHO.
Not here? Can he have failed? Here is blood - it may be his. I'll call. Hugo, good Hugo, art thou here?
#HUGO.
Ay, my lord, I am here. All is safely done: the love - sick boy lies yonder in the thicket, dead as steel can make him. And here is the token if you doubt me, and the ring I just took from his hand
#RODOLPHO.
Nay, nay, I do not doubt thee; keep thou the ring. I am content with this. Tell me, did he struggle with thee when thou dealt the blow?
#HUGO.
Nay, my lord; he fell without a groan, and murmuring something of revenge on thee, he died. Hast thou the gold?
#RODOLPHO.
Yes, yes, I have it. Take it, and remember I can take thy life as easily as thou hast his, if thou shouldst whisper what hath been this day done. Now go; I've done with thee.
#HUGO.
And I with thee. Adieu, my lord.
#RODOLPHO.
Now am I safe, - no mortal knows of Theresa's death by my hand, and Leonore is mine.
#HANK.
Never - never!
#RODOLPHO.
Curses on me! Am I bewitched? Surely, I heard a voice; perchance 'twas but an echo Fiends take the wood! I'll stay no longer! 'Tis there, - help, help -
#NORNA.
Ha, ha! fiends shall haunt thee, thou murderer! Another sin upon thy soul, - another life to be avenged! Poor, murdered youth, now gone to join thy sister. I will lay thee by her side and then to my work. He hath raised another ghost to haunt him. Let him beware!
#LEONORE.
Ah, how wearily the days go by. No tidings of Count Louis, and Count Rodolpho urges on his suit so earnestly. I must accept his hand to - day, or refuse his love, and think no more of Louis. I know not how to choose. Rodolpho loves me: I am an orphan and alone, and in his lovely home I may be happy. I have heard it whispered that he is both stern and cruel, yet methinks it cannot be, - he is so tender when with me. Ah, would I could forget Count Louis! He hath never told his love, and doubtless thinks no more of her who treasures up his gentle words, and cannot banish them, even when another offers a heart and home few would refuse. How shall I answer Count Rodolpho when he comes? I do not love him as I should, and yet it were no hard task to learn with so fond a teacher. Shall I accept his love, or shall I reject?
#NORNA.
Reject.
#LEONORE.
Who art thou? Leave me, or I call for aid.
#NORNA.
Nay, lady, fear not. I come not here to harm thee, but to save thee from a fate far worse than death. I am old Norna of the forest, and though they call me witch and sorceress, I am a woman yet, and with a heart to pity and to love. I would save thy youth and beauty from the blight I fear will fall upon thee.
#LEONORE.
Save me! from what? How knowest thou I am in danger; and from what wouldst thou save me, Norna?
#NORNA.
From Lord Rodolpho, lady.
#LEONORE.
Ah! and why from him? Tell on, I'll listen to thee now. He hath offered me his heart and hand. Why should I not accept them, Norna?
#NORNA.
That heart is filled with dark and evil passions, and that hand is stained with blood. Ay, lady, well mayst thou start. I will tell thee more. The splendid home he would lead thee to is darkened by a fearful crime, and his fair palace haunted by the spirit of a murdered wife.
#LEONORE.
Wife, sayest thou? He told me he was never wed. Mysterious woman, tell me more! How dost thou know 'tis true, and wherefore was it done? I have a right to know. Oh, speak, and tell me all!
#NORNA.
For that have I come hither. He hath been wed to a lady, young and lovely as thyself. He kept her prisoner in his splendid home, and by neglect and cruelty he broke as warm and true a heart as ever beat in woman's breast. Her brother stole unseen to cheer and comfort her, and this aroused her lord's suspicions, and he bid her to confess who was her unknown friend. She would not yield her brother to his hate, and he in his wild anger murdered her. I heard his cruel words, her prayers for mercy, and I stood beside the lifeless form and marked the blow his evil hand had given her. And there I vowed I would avenge the deed, and for this have I come hither to warn thee of thy danger. He loves thee only for thy wealth, and when thou art his, will wrong thee as he hath the meek Theresa.
#LEONORE.
How shall I ever thank thee for this escape from sorrow and despair? I did not love him, but I am alone, and his kind words were sweet and tender. I thought with him I might be happy yet, but - Ah, how little did I dream of sin like this! Thank Heaven, 'tis not too late!
#NORNA.
How wilt thou answer Lord Rodolpho now?
#LEONORE.
I will answer him with all the scorn and loathing that I feel. I fear him not, and he shall learn how his false vows are despised, and his sins made known.
#NORNA.
'Tis well; but stay, - be thou not too proud. Speak fairly, and reject him courteously; for he will stop at nought in his revenge if thou but rouse his hatred. And now, farewell. I'll watch above thee, and in thy hour of danger old Norna will be nigh. Stay, give me some token, by which thou wilt know the messenger I may find cause to send thee. The fierce Count will seek to win thee, and repay thy scorn by all the evil his cruel heart can bring.
#LEONORE.
Take this ring, and I will trust whoever thou mayst send with it. I owe thee much, and, believe me, I am grateful for thy care, and will repay thee by my confidence and truth. Farewell, old Norna; watch thou above the helpless, and thine old age shall be made happy by my care.
#NORNA.
Heaven bless thee, gentle lady. Good angels guard thee. Norna will not forget.
#LEONORE.
'Tis like a dream, so strange, so terrible, - he whom I thought so gentle, and so true is stained with fearful crimes! Poor, murdered lady! Have I escaped a fate like thine? Ah, I hear his step! Now, heart, be firm and he shall enter here no more.
#RODOLPHO.
Sweet lady, I am here to learn my fate. I have told my love, and thou hast listened; I have asked thy hand, and thou hast not refused it. I have offered all that I possess, - my home, my heart. Again I lay them at thy feet, beloved Leonore. Oh, wilt thou but accept them, poor tho' they be, and in return let me but claim this fair hand as mine own?
#LEONORE.
My lord, forgive me, but I cannot grant it. When last we met thou didst bid me ask my heart if it could love thee. It hath answered, "Nay." I grieve I cannot make a fit return for all you offer, but I have no love to give, and without it this poor hand were worthless. There are others far more fit to grace thy home than I. Go, win thyself a loving bride, and so forget Leonore.
#RODOLPHO.
What hath changed thee thus since last we met. Then wert thou kind, and listened gladly to my love. Now there is a scornful smile upon thy lips, and a proud light in thine eye. What means this? Why dost thou look so coldly on me, Leonore? Who has whispered false tales in thine ear? Believe them not. I am as true as Heaven to thee; then do not cast away the heart so truly thine. Smile on me, dearest; thou art my first, last, only love.
#LEONORE.
'Tis false, my lord! Hast thou so soon forgot Theresa?
#RODOLPHO.
What! Who told thee that accursed tale? What dost thou mean, Leonore?
#LEONORE.
I mean thy sinful deeds are known. Thou hast asked me why I will not wed thee, and I answer, I will not give my hand unto a murderer.
#RODOLPHO.
Murderer! No more of this! Thy tale is false; forget it, and I will forgive the idle words. Now listen; I came hither to receive thy answer to my suit. Think ere thou decide. Thou art an orphan, unprotected and alone. I am powerful and great. Wilt thou take my love, and with it honor, wealth, happiness, and ease, or my hate, which will surely follow thee and bring down desolation on thee and all thou lovest? Now choose, my hatred, or my love.
#LEONORE.
My lord, I scorn thy love, and I defy thy hate. Work thy will, I fear thee not. I am not so unprotected as thou thinkest. There are unseen friends around me who will save in every peril, and who are sworn to take revenge on thee for thy great sins. This is my answer; henceforth we are strangers; now leave me. I would be alone.
#RODOLPHO.
Not yet, proud lady. If thou wilt not love, I'll make thee learn to fear the heart thou hast so scornfully cast away. Let thy friends guard thee well; thou wilt need their care when I begin my work of vengeance. Thou mayst smile, but thou shalt rue the day when Count Rodolpho asked and was refused. But I will yet win thee, and then beware! And when thou dost pray for mercy on thy knees, remember the haughty words thou hast this day spoken.
#LEONORE.
Do thy worst, murderer; spirits will watch above me, and thou canst not harm. Adieu, my lord.
#RODOLPHO.
Foiled again! Some demon works against me. Who could have told her of Theresa? A little longer, and I should have won a rich young bride, and now this tale of murder mars it all. But I will win her yet, and wring her proud heart till she shall bend her haughty head and sue for mercy. How shall it be done? Stay! Ha, I see a way! - the letter Louis would have sent her ere he died. She knows not of his death, and I will send this paper bidding her to meet her lover in the forest. She cannot doubt the lines his own hand traced. She will obey, - and I'll be there to lead her to my castle. I'll wed her, and she may scorn, weep, and pray in vain. Ha, ha! proud Leonore, spite of thy guardian spirits thou shalt be mine, and then for my revenge!
#LEONORE.
'Tis strange; an unknown page thrust this into my hand while kneeling in the chapel. Ah, surely, I should know this hand! 'Tis Louis's, and at last he hath returned, and still remembers Leonore He loves me, and mid danger still remembers. Ah, Louis, there is nothing thou canst ask I will not gladly grant. I'll go; the sun is well - nigh set, and I can steal away unseen to whisper hope and comfort ere we part forever. Now, Count Rodolpho, thou hast given me another cause for hate. Louis, I can love thee tho' thou art banished and afar. Hark! 'tis the vesper - bell. Now, courage, heart, and thou shalt mourn no longer.
#LEONORE.
Norna is not here, nor Louis. Why comes he not? Surely 'tis the place. Norna! Louis! art thou here?
#RODOLPHO.
I am here, dear lady. Do not fear me; I may not unmask even to thee, for spies may still be near me. Wilt thou pardon, and still trust me tho' thou canst not see how fondly I am looking on thee. See! here is my ring, my dagger. Oh, Leonore, do not doubt me!
#LEONORE.
I do trust thee; canst thou doubt it now? Oh, Louis! I feared thou wert dead. Why didst thou not tell me all before. And where wilt thou go, and how can I best serve thee? Nought thou canst ask my love shall leave undone.
#RODOLPHO.
Wilt thou let me guide thee to yonder tower? I fear to tell thee here, and old Norna is there waiting for thee. Come, love, for thy Louis's sake, dare yet a little more, and I will tell thee how thou canst serve me. Wilt thou not put thy faith in me, Leonore?
#LEONORE.
I will. Forgive me, if I seem to fear thee; but thy voice sounds strangely hollow, and thine eyes look darkly on me from behind this mask. Thou wilt lay it by when we are safe, and then I shall forget this foolish fear that hangs upon me.
#RODOLPHO.
Thine own hands shall remove it, love. Come, it is not far. Would I might guide thee thus through life! Come, dearest!
#LEONORE.
Where art thou leading me, dear Louis? Thy hiding - place is a pleasant one, but where is Norna? I thought she waited for us.
#RODOLPHO.
She will soon be here. Ah, how can I thank thee for this joyful hour, Leonore. I can forget all danger and all sorrow now.
#LEONORE.
Nay, let me cast away this mournful mask! I long to look upon thy face once more. Wilt thou let me, Louis?
#RODOLPHO.
Ay, look upon me if thou wilt; - dost like it, lady? 'Tis useless; there are none to answer to thy call. All here are my slaves, and none dare disobey. Where are thy proud words now? hast thou no scornful smile for those white lips, no anger in those beseeching eyes? Where are thy friends? Why come they not to aid thee? Said I not truly my revenge was sure?
#LEONORE.
Oh, pardon me, and pity! See, I will kneel to thee, pray, weep, if thou wilt only let me go. Forgive my careless words! Oh, Count Rodolpho, take me home, and I will forget this cruel jest
#RODOLPHO.
Ha, ha! It is no jest, and thou hast no home but this. Didst thou not come willingly? I used no force; and all disguise is fair in love. Nay, kneel not to me. Did I not say thou wouldst bend thy proud head, and sue for mercy, and I would deny it? Where is thy defiance now?
#LEONORE.
I'll kneel no more to thee. The first wild fear is past, and thou shalt find me at thy feet no more. As I told thee then, I tell thee now, - thine I will never be; and think not I will fail or falter at thy threats. Contempt of thee is too strong for fear.
#RODOLPHO.
Not conquered yet. Time will teach thee to speak more courteously to thy master. Ah, thou mayst well look upon these bawbles. They were thy lover's once. This ring was taken from his lifeless hand; this dagger from his bleeding breast, as he lay within the forest whence I led thee. This scroll I found next his heart when it had ceased to beat. I lured thee hither with it, and won my sweet revenge. Now rest thee; for when the castle clock strikes ten, I shall come to lead thee to the altar. The priest is there, - this ring shall wed thee. Farewell, fair bride; remember, - there is no escape, and thou art mine forever.
#LEONORE.
Never! I shall be free when thou mayst think help past forever. There is a friend to help me, and an arm to save, when earthly aid is lost. Thine I shall never be! Thou mayst seek me; I shall be gone.
#RODOLPHO.
Thou wilt need thy prayers. I shall return, - remember, when the clock strikes ten, I come to win my bride.
#LEONORE.
He has gone, and now a few short hours of life are left to me; for if no other help shall come, death can save me from a fate I loathe. Ah, Louis, Louis, thou art gone forever! Norna, where is thy promise now to guard me? Is there no help? Nor tears nor prayers can melt that cruel heart, and I am in his power. Ha! what is that? - his dagger, taken from his dying breast. How gladly would he have drawn it forth to save his poor Leonore! Alas, that hand is cold forever! But I must be calm. He shall see how a weak woman's heart can still defy him, and win liberty by death It is the hour, - the knell of my young life. Hark! they come. Louis, thy Leonore ere long will join thee, never more to part.
#ADRIAN.
Stay, lady! stay thy hand! I come to save thee. Norna sends me, - see, thy token; doubt not, nor delay; another moment, we are lost. Oh, fly, I do beseech thee!
#LEONORE.
Heaven bless thee; I will come. Kind friend, I put a helpless maiden's trust in thee.
#ADRIAN.
Stay not! away, away!
#RODOLPHO.
Is my fair bride ready? Ha! Leonore, where art thou?
#HANK.
Gone, - gone forever!
#RODOLPHO.
Girl, mock me not; come forth, I say. Thou shalt not escape me. Leonore, answer! Where is my bride?
#HANK.
Here -
#RODOLPHO.
Why do I fear? She is there concealed The fiends! what is that? The spirit haunts me still!
#HANK.
Forever, forever -
#RODOLPHO.
What ho! without there! Beat down the door! Pedro! Carlos! let me come forth! They do not come! Nay, 'tis my fancy; I will forget it all. Still, the door is fast; Leonore is gone. Who groans so bitterly? Wild voices are sounding in the air, ghastly faces are looking on me as I turn, unseen hands bar the door, and dead men are groaning in mine ears. I'll not look, not listen; 'tis some spell set on me. Let it pass!
#HANK.
The spell will not cease,
#RODOLPHO.
Again, spirit or demon, wherefore dost thou haunt me, and what art thou? Ha! am I gone mad? Unbar the door! Help! help!
#NORNA.
Lie there, thou sinful wretch! Old Norna's curse ends but with thy life.
#RODOLPHO.
Dangers seem thickening round me. Some secret spy is watching me unseen, - I fear 'tis Hugo, spite the gold I gave him, and the vows he made. A higher bribe may win the secret from him, and then I am undone. Pedro hath told me that a stranger, cloaked and masked, was lurking near the castle on the night when Leonore so strangely vanished Ha! - what's that? - methought I heard that mocking laugh again! I am grown fearful as a child since that most awful night. Well, well, let it pass! If Hugo comes to - night, obedient to the message I have sent, I'll see he goes not hence alive. This cup shalt be thy last, good Hugo! He comes, - now for my revenge! Ah, Hugo, welcome! How hath it fared with thee since last we met? Thou lookest weary, - here is wine; sit and refresh thyself.
#HUGO.
I came not hither, Count Rodolpho, to seek wine, but gold. Hark ye! I am poor; thou art rich, but in my power, for proud and noble though thou art, the low - born Hugo can bring death and dishonor on thy head by whispering one word to the king. Ha! - now give me gold or I will betray thee.
#RODOLPHO.
Thou bold villain, what means this? I paid thee well, and thou didst vow to keep my secret. Threaten me not. Thou art in my power, and shall never leave this room alive. I fear thee not. My menials are at hand, - yield thyself; thou art fairly caught, and cannot now escape me.
#HUGO.
Nay, not so fast, my lord. One blast upon my horn, and my brave band, concealed below, will answer to my call. Ha! ha! thou art caught, my lord. Thy life is in my hands, and thou must purchase it by fifty good pistoles paid down to me; if not, I will charge thee with the crime thou didst bribe me to perform, and thus win a rich reward. Choose, - thy life is nought to me.
#RODOLPHO.
Do but listen, Hugo. I have no gold; smile if thou wilt, but I am poor. This castle only is mine own, and I am seeking now a rich young bride whose wealth will hide my poverty. Be just, good Hugo, and forgive the harsh words I have spoken. Wait till I am wed, and I will pay thee well.
#HUGO.
That will I not. I'll have no more of thee, false lord! The king will well reward me, and thou mayst keep thy gold. Farewell! Thou wilt see me once again.
#RODOLPHO.
Stay, Hugo, stay! Give me but time; I may obtain the gold. Wait a little, and it shall be thine. Wilt thou not drink? 'Tis the wine thou likest so well. See! I poured it ready for thee.
#HUGO.
Nay; I will serve myself. Wine of thy mixing would prove too strong for me Think quickly, my good lord; I must be gone I'll wait no more; 'tis growing late, and I care not to meet the spirits which I hear now haunt thy castle. Well, hast thou the gold?
#RODOLPHO.
Not yet; but if thou wilt wait -
#HUGO.
I tell thee I will not. I'll be deceived no longer. Thou art mine, and I'll repay thy scornful words and sinful deeds by a prisoner's cell. And so, adieu, my lord. Escape is useless, for thou wilt be watched. Hugo is the master now!
#RODOLPHO.
Thou cunning villain, I'll outwit thee yet. I will disguise myself, and watch thee well, and when least thou thinkest it, my dagger shall be at thy breast. And now one thing remains to me, and that is flight. I must leave all and go forth poor, dishonored, and alone; sin on my head, and fear within my heart. Will the sun never set? How slow the hours pass! In the first gloom of night, concealed in yonder old monk's robe, I'll silently glide forth, and fly from Hugo and this haunted house. Courage, Rodolpho, thou shalt yet win a name and fortune for thyself. Now let me rest awhile; I shall need strength for the perils of the night
#NORNA.
Poor fool! thy greatest foe is here, - her thou shalt not escape. Hugo shall be warned, and thou alone shalt fall.
#RODOLPHO.
Ah, what fearful dreams are mine! Theresa - Louis - still they haunt me! Whither shall I turn? Who comes? Art thou another phantom sent to torture me?
#GASPARD.
'Tis I, leader of the king's brave guards, sent hither to arrest thee, my lord; for thou art charged with murder.
#RODOLPHO.
Who dares to cast so foul a stain on Count Rodolpho's name.
#GASPARD.
My lord, yield thyself. The king may show thee mercy yet -
#RODOLPHO.
I will yield, and prove my innocence, and clear mine honor to the king. Reach me my cloak yonder, and I am ready.
#GASPARD.
Ha! he hath escaped, - curses on my carelessness! Ho, there! surround the castle, the prisoner hath fled! We'll have him yet, the blood - stained villain!
#ADRIAN.
Dear lady, can I do nought to while away the lonely hours? Shall I go forth and bring thee flowers, or seek thy home and bear away thy bird, thy lute, or aught that may beguile thy solitude? It grieves me that I can do so little for thee.
#LEONORE.
Nay, 'tis I should grieve that I can find no way to show my gratitude to thee, my brave deliverer. But wilt thou not tell me who thou art? I would fain know to whom I owe my life and liberty.
#ADRIAN.
Nay, that I may not tell thee. I have sworn a solemn vow, and till that is fulfilled I may not cast aside this sorrowful disguise. Meanwhile, thou mayst call me Adrian. Wilt thou pardon and trust me still?
#LEONORE.
Canst thou doubt my faith in thee? Thou and old Norna are the only friends now left to poor Leonore. I put my whole heart's trust in thee. But if thou canst not tell me of thyself, wilt tell me why thou hast done so much for me, a friendless maiden?
#ADRIAN.
I fear it will cause thee sorrow, lady; and thou hast grief enough to bear.
#LEONORE.
Do not fear. I would so gladly know -
#ADRIAN.
Forgive me if I make thee weep: I had a friend, - most dear to me. He loved a gentle lady, but ere he could tell her this, he died, and bid me vow to watch above her whom he loved, and guard her with my life. I took the vow: that lady was thyself, that friend Count Louis.
#LEONORE.
Ah, Louis! Louis! that heart thou feared to ask is buried with thee.
#ADRIAN.
Thou didst love him, lady?
#LEONORE.
Love him? Most gladly would I lie down within my grave tonight, could I but call him back to life again.
#ADRIAN.
Grieve not; thou hast one friend who cannot change, - one who through joy and sorrow will find his truest happiness in serving thee. Hist! I hear a step: I will see who comes.
#LEONORE.
Kind, watchful friend, how truly do I trust thee!
#ADRIAN.
Conceal thyself, dear lady, with all speed. 'Tis Count Rodolpho. Let me lead thee to the inner cave, - there thou wilt be safe.
#RODOLPHO.
At last I am safe. Old Norna will conceal me till I can find means to leave the land. Ha! - voices within there. Ho, there! old wizard, hither! I have need of thee!
#ADRIAN.
What wouldst thou?
#RODOLPHO.
Nought. Get thee hence! I seek old Norna.
#ADRIAN.
Thou canst not see her; she is not here.
#RODOLPHO.
Not here? 'Tis false, - I heard a woman's voice within there. Let me pass!
#ADRIAN.
'Tis not old Norna, and thou canst not pass.
#RODOLPHO.
Ah, then, who might it be, my most mysterious sir?
#ADRIAN.
The Lady Leonore.
#RODOLPHO.
Ha! - how came she hither? By my soul, thou liest! Stand back and let me go. She is mine!
#ADRIAN.
Thou canst only enter here above my lifeless body. Leonore is here, and I am her protector and thy deadliest foe. 'Tis for thee to yield and leave this cell.
#RODOLPHO.
No more of this, - thou hast escaped me once. Draw and defend thyself, if thou hast courage to meet a brave man's sword!
#ADRIAN.
But for Leonore I would not stoop so low, or stain my sword; but for her sake I'll dare all, and fight thee to the last.
#RODOLPHO.
At length fate smiles upon me. I am the victor, - and now for Leonore! All danger is forgotten in the joy of winning my revenge on this proud girl! Thou art mine at last, Leonore, and mine forever! There 'tis again! I will not fly, - I do defy it! 'Tis vain: I cannot - dare not pass. It comes, it follows me. Whither shall I fly?
#ADRIAN.
I have saved her once again, - but oh, this deathlike faintness stealing o'er me robs me of my strength. Thou art safe, Leonore, and I am content.
#LEONORE.
They are gone. Ah, what has chanced? I heard his voice, and now 'tis still as death. Where is my friend? God grant he be not hurt! I'll venture forth and seek him Oh, what is this? Adrian, kind friend, dost thou not hear me? There is blood upon his hand! Can he be dead? No, no! he breathes, he moves; this mask, I will remove it, - surely he will forgive.
#ADRIAN.
Nay, nay; it must not be. I am better now. The blow but stunned me, - it will pass away. And thou art safe?
#LEONORE.
I feared not for myself, but thee. Come, rest thee here, thy wound is bleeding; let me bind it with my kerchief, and bring thee wine. Let me serve thee who hath done so much for me. Art better now! Can I do aught else for thee?
#ADRIAN.
No more, dear lady. Think not of me, and listen while I tell thee of the dangers that surround thee. Count Rodolpho knows thou art here, and may return with men and arms to force thee hence. My single arm could then avail not, though I would gladly die for thee. Where then can I lead thee, - no place can be too distant, no task too hard for him whose joy it is to serve thee.
#LEONORE.
Alas! I know not. I dare not seek my home while Count Rodolpho is my foe; my servants would be bribed, - they would betray me, and thou wouldst not be there to save. Adrian, I have no friend but thee. Oh, pity and protect me!
#ADRIAN.
Most gladly will I, dearest lady. Thou canst never know the joy thy confidence hath wakened in my heart. I will save and guard thee with my life. I will guide thee to a peaceful home where no danger can approach, and only friends surround thee. Thy Louis dwelt there once, and safely mayst thou rest till danger shall be past. Will this please thee?
#LEONORE.
Oh, Adrian, thou kind, true friend, how can I tell my gratitude, and where find truer rest than in his home, where gentle memories of him will lighten grief. Then take me there, and I will prove my gratitude by woman's fondest friendship, and my life - long trust.
#ADRIAN.
Thanks, dear lady. I need no other recompense than the joy 'tis in my power to give thee. I will watch faithfully above thee, and when thou needest me no more, I'll leave thee to the happiness thy gentle heart so well deserves. Now rest, while I seek out old Norna, and prepare all for our flight. The way we have to tread is long and weary. Rest thee, dear lady.
#LEONORE.
Adieu, dear friend. I will await thee ready for our pilgrimage, and think not I shall fail or falter, though the path be long, and dangers gather round us. I shall not fear, for thou wilt be there. God bless thee, Adrian.
#LEONORE.
'Tis strange that I can sing, but in this peaceful home my sorrow seems to change to deep and quiet joy. Louis seems ever near, and Adrian's silent acts of tenderness beguile my solitary hours, and daily grow more dear to me. He guards me day and night, seeking to meet my slightest wish, and gather round me all I hold most dear. Angelo, what wouldst thou?
#PAGE.
My master bid me bring these flowers and crave thee to accept them lady.
#LEONORE.
Bear him my thanks, and tell him that his gift is truly welcome. These are the blossoms he was gathering but now upon the balcony; he hath sent the sweetest and the fairest But what is here? He hath never sent me aught like this before
#ADRIAN.
Dearest Lady, - Wilt thou pardon the bold words I here address to thee, and forgive me if I grieve one on whom I would bestow only the truest joy. In giving peace to thy heart I have lost mine own. I was thy guide and comforter, and soon, unknown to thee, thy lover. I love thee, Leonore, fondly and truly; and here I ask, wilt thou accept the offering of a heart that will forever cherish thee. If thou canst grant this blessed boon, fling from the casement the white rose I send thee; but if thou canst not accept my love, forgive me for avowing it, and drop the cypress bough I have twined about the rose. I will not pain thee to refuse in words, - the mournful token is enough. Ask thine own heart if thou, who hast loved Louis, can feel aught save friendship for the unknown, nameless stranger, who through life and death is ever Thy loving, Adrian.
#LEONORE.
Oh, how shall I reply to this, - how blight a love so tender and so true? I have longed to show my gratitude, to prove how I have revered this noble friend. The hour has come when I may make his happiness, and prove my trust. And yet my heart belongs to Louis, and I cannot love another. Adrian was his friend; he loved him, and confided me to him. Nobly hath he fulfilled that trust, and where could I find a truer friend than he who hath saved me from danger and from death, and now gives me the power to gladden and to bless his life. Adrian, if thou wilt accept a sister's love and friendship, they shall be thine. Louis, forgive me if I wrong thee; for though I yield my hand, my heart is thine forever. This rose, Adrian, to thee; this mournful cypress shall be mine in memory of my blighted hopes See! he is waiting yonder by the fountain for the token that shall bring him joy or sorrow. Thou noble friend, thy brave, true heart shall grieve no longer, for thus will Leonore repay the debt of gratitude she owes thee He hath placed it in his bosom, and is coming hither to pour forth his thanks for the poor gift bestowed. I will tell him all, and if he will accept, then I am his.
#ADRIAN.
Dear lady, how can I tell thee the joy thou hast given me. This blessed flower from thy dear hand hath told thy pardon and consent. Oh, Leonore, canst thou love a nameless stranger who is so unworthy the great boon thou givest.
#LEONORE.
Listen, Adrian, ere thou dost thank me for a divided heart. Thou hast been told my love for Louis; he was thy friend, and well thou knowest how true and tender was the heart he gave me. He hath gone, and with him rests my first deep love. Thou art my only friend and my protector; thou hast won my gratitude and warmest friendship. I can offer thee a sister's pure affection, - my hand is thine; and here I pledge thee that as thou hast watched o'er me, so now thy happiness shall be my care, thy love my pride and joy. Here is my hand, - wilt thou accept it, Adrian?
#ADRIAN.
I will. I would not seek to banish from thy heart the silent love thou bearest Louis. I am content if thou wilt trust me with thy happiness, and give me the sweet right to guide and guard thee through the pilgrimage of life. God bless thee, dearest.
#LEONORE.
Dear Adrian, can I do nought for thee? I have now won the right to cheer thy sorrows. Have faith in thy Leonore.
#ADRIAN.
Thou hast a right to know all, and ere long thou shalt. My mysterious vow will now soon be fulfilled, and then no doubt shall part us. Thou hast placed thy trust in me, and I have not betrayed it, and now I ask a greater boon of thy confiding heart. Wilt thou consent to wed me ere I cast aside this mask forever? Believe me, thou wilt not regret it, - 'tis part of my vow; one last trial, and I will prove to thee thou didst not trust in vain. Forgive if I have asked too much. Nay, thou canst not grant so strange a boon.
#LEONORE.
I can - I will. I did but pause, for it seemed strange thou couldst not let me look upon thy face. But think not that I fear to grant thy wish. Thy heart is pure and noble, and that thou canst not mask. As I trusted thee through my despair, so now I trust thee in my joy. Canst thou ask more, dear friend?
#ADRIAN.
Ever trust me thus! Ah, Leonore, how can I repay thee? My love, my life, are all I can give thee for the blessed gift thou hast bestowed. A time will come when all this mystery shall cease and we shall part no more. Now must I leave thee, dearest. Farewell! Soon will I return.
#LEONORE.
I will strive to be a true and loving wife to thee, dear Adrian; for I have won a faithful friend in thee forever.
#LEONORE.
At length the hour hath come, when I shall look upon the face of him whom I this day have sworn to love and honor as a wife. I have, perchance, been rash in wedding one I know not, but will not cast a doubt on him who hath proved the noble heart that beats within his breast. I am his, and come what may, the vows I have this day made shall be unbroken. Ah, he comes; and now shall I gaze upon my husband's face!
#ADRIAN.
Dearest, fear not. Thou wilt not trust me less when thou hast looked upon the face so long concealed. My vow is ended, thou art won. Thy hand is mine; Leonore, I claim thy heart.
#LEONORE.
Louis, Louis! 'Tis a blessed dream!
#LOUIS.
No dream, my Leonore; it is thy living Louis who hath watched above thee, and now claims thee for his own. Ah, dearest, I have tried thee too hardly, - pardon me!
#LEONORE.
Oh, Louis, husband, I have nought to pardon; my life, my liberty, my happiness, - all, all, I owe to thee. How shall I repay thee?
#LOUIS.
By banishing these tears, dear love, and smiling on me as you used to do. Here, love, sit beside me while I tell thee my most strange tale, and then no longer shalt thou wonder. Art happy now thy Adrian hath flung by his mask?
#LEONORE.
Happy! What deeper joy can I desire than that of seeing thy dear face once more? But tell me, Louis, how couldst thou dwell so long beside me and not cheer my bitter sorrow when I grieved for thee.
#LOUIS.
Ah, Leonore, thou wouldst not reproach me, didst thou know how hard I struggled with my heart, lest I should by some tender word, some fond caress, betray myself when thou didst grieve for me.
#LEONORE.
Why didst thou fear to tell thy Leonore? She would have aided and consoled thee. Why didst thou let me pine in sorrow at thy side, when but a word had filled my heart with joy?
#LOUIS.
Dearest, I dared not. Thou knowest I was banished by the hate of that fiend Rodolpho. I had a fair and gentle sister, whom he wed, and after cruelty and coldness that I dread to think of now, he murdered her. I sought old Norna's aid. She promised it, and well hath kept her word. When Count Rodolpho's ruffian left me dying in the forest, she saved, and brought me back to life. She bade me take a solemn vow not to betray myself, and to aid her in her vengeance on the murderer of
#THERESA.
Nor could I own my name and rank, lest it should reach the king who had banished me. The vow I took, and have fulfilled.
#LEONORE.
And is there no danger now? Art thou safe, dear Louis, from the Count?
#LOUIS.
Fear not, my love. He will never harm us more; his crimes are known. The king hath pardoned me. I have won thee back. He is an outcast, and old Norna's spells have well - nigh driven him mad. My sister, thou art well avenged! Alas! alas! would I could have saved, and led thee hither to this happy home.
#LEONORE.
Ah, grieve not, Louis; she is happy now, and thy Leonore will strive to fill her place. Hast thou told me all?
#LOUIS.
Nay, love. Thou knowest how I watched above thee, but thou canst never know the joy thy faithful love for one thou mourned as dead hath brought me. I longed to cast aside the dark disguise I had vowed to wear, but dared not while Rodolpho was at liberty. Now all is safe. I have tried thy love, and found it true. Oh, may I prove most worthy of it, dearest.
#LEONORE.
Louis, how can I love too faithfully the friend who, 'mid his own grief and danger, loved and guarded me. I trusted thee as Adrian; as Louis I shall love thee until death.
#LOUIS.
And I shall prize most tenderly the faithful heart that trusted me through doubt and mystery. Now life is bright and beautiful before us, and may you never sorrow that thou gav'st thy heart to Louis, and thy hand to Adrian the "Black Mask."
#NORNA.
Thy fate is sealed, thy course is run,
#RODOLPHO.
Mine eyes are bewildered by the forms I have looked upon in sleep. Methought old Norna stood beside me, whispering evil spells, calling fearful phantoms to bear me hence.
#HUGO.
Thy evil conscience gives thee little rest, my lord.
#RODOLPHO.
Who is there? Stand back! I'll sell my life most dearly. Ah, 'tis no dream, - I am fettered! Where is my sword?
#HUGO.
In my safe keeping, Count Rodolpho, lest in thy rage thou may'st be tempted to add another murder to thy list of sins. Didst think thou couldst escape? Ah, no; although most swift of foot and secret, Hugo hath watched and followed thee. I swore to win both gold and vengeance. The king hath offered high reward for thy poor head, and it is mine. Methinks it may cheer your solitude my lord, so I came hither on my way to bear thy death warrant to the captain of the guard. What wilt thou give for this? Hark ye! were this destroyed, thou might'st escape ere another were prepared. How dost thou like the plot?
#RODOLPHO.
And wilt thou save me, Hugo? Give me not up to the king! I'll be thy slave. All I possess is thine. I'll give thee countless gold. Ah, pity, and save me, Hugo!
#HUGO.
Ha, ha! I did but jest. Thinkest thou I could forego the joy of seeing thy proud head laid low? Where was thy countless gold when I did ask it of thee? No, no; thou canst not tempt me to forget my vengeance. 'Tis Hugo's turn to play the master now. Mayst thou rest well, and so, good even, my lord.
#RODOLPHO.
Thus end my hopes of freedom. My life is drawing to a close, and all my sins seem rising up before me. The forms of my murdered victims flit before me, and their dying words ring in mine ears, - Leonore praying for mercy at my feet; old Norna whispering curses on my soul. How am I haunted and betrayed! Oh, fool, fool that I have been! My pride, my passion, all end in this! Hated, friendless, and alone, the proud Count Rodolpho dies a felon's death. 'Tis just, 'tis just! What's that? Who spoke? Ah, 'tis mine unknown foe. What wouldst thou here?
#LOUIS.
Thou didst bribe one Hugo to murder the young Count Louis, whom thou didst hate. He did thy bidding, and thy victim fell; but Norna saved, and healed his wounds. She told him of his murdered sister's fate, and he hath joined her in her work of vengeance, and foiled thee in thy sinful plots. I saved Leonore, and guarded her till I had won her heart and hand, and in her love find solace for the sorrow thou hast caused. Dost doubt the tale? Look on thine unknown foe, and find it true
#RODOLPHO.
Louis, whom I hated, and would kill, - thou here, thou husband of Leonore, happy and beloved! It is too much, too much! If thou lovest life, depart. I'm going mad: I see wild phantoms whirling round me, voices whispering fearful words within mine ears. Touch me not, - there is blood upon my hands! Will this dream last forever?
#LOUIS.
May Heaven pity thee! Theresa, thou art avenged.
#RODOLPHO.
Ah, these are fearful memories for a dying hour!
#NORNA.
Sinful man, didst think thy death - bed could be peaceful? As they have haunted thee in life, so shall spirits darken thy last hour. I bore thy murdered wife to a quiet grave, and raised a spirit to affright and haunt thee to thy death. I freed the Lady Leonore; I mocked and haunted thee in palace, wood, and cell; I warned Hugo, and betrayed thee to his power; and I brought down this awful doom upon thee. As thou didst refuse all mercy to thy victims, so shall mercy be denied to thee. Remorse and dark despair shall wring thy heart, and thou shalt die unblessed, unpitied, unforgiven. Thy victims are avenged, and Norna's work is done.
#RODOLPHO.
Ha! ha! 'tis gone, - yet stay, 'tis Louis' ghost! How darkly his eyes shine on me! See, see, - the demons gather round me! How fast they come! Old Norna is there, muttering her spells. Let me go free! Unbind these chains! Hugo, Louis, Leonore, Theresa, - thou art avenged!
