#MRS. SKINFLINT.
I declare I’ll never buy another thing at Thompson’s store. I paid fifteen cents a yard for my last kaliker dress, and Mis’ Hobbs bought one of a peddler yesterday, jest as good, for thirteen cents and three quarters. It’s a shame! On twelve yards I lost fifteen cents. That’s too much money to lose in these hard times. I wish that peddler would come along. I need a sight o’ things, and if I couldn’t beat him down, my name aint Betsy Jane Skinflint.
#EZEKIEL.
Mornin’, marm. Anything in my line to - day? Dress - patterns, hoop - skirts, shawls, laces, ribbons, jewelry, spectacles, buttons, scissors, needles, pins—
#MRS. SELWYN.
Massy sakes! don’t tell any more of ’em. I shall forget what you sed fust. You haint got no good clocks, hev ye?
#EZEKIEL.
Haint I though! I kin beat everybody on clocks. I’ve got some that cum clear from Switzerland. I imported ’em myself. Here’s one , the pootiest and best little timepiece ever you see.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Does it keep good time?
#EZEKIEL.
I guess it does—tip - top. It goes ahead of anything ever you set your eyes on.
#MRS. SELWYN.
What d’ye charge for it?
#EZEKIEL.
Well, I hev been sellin’ on ’em all along for twelve dollars apiece, but seein’ it’s you, I’ll let you have it for ten.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Ten dollars! D’ye think I’m made o’ money? Besides, the clock aint wuth half that. But I don’t mind givin’ you five for it.
#EZEKIEL.
That don’t pay the cost of importin’ ’em; but, ef you’re goin’ to buy consider’ble, I’ll say five for it. What’s the next thing?
#MRS. SELWYN.
I want ter git a pair o’ spettercles. As I was ridin’ to meetin’, last Sunday, mine fell off, and the wheel run right over ’em, and smashed the glass all to pieces. I cared more about ’em ’cause they’d ben in the famerly so long. Marm and granny both used ’em afore me.
#EZEKIEL.
Mebbe they might be mended. Let’s see ’em.
#EZEKIEL.
I s’pose they might be fixed, but it’s my opinion ’twouldn’t pay. Besides, the bows are too heavy to wear. Didn’t nobody ever tell ye that wearin’ heavy - bowed specs sometimes made folks round - shouldered?
#MRS. SELWYN.
No. Dew tell!
#EZEKIEL.
But I’ve got somethin’ here that’ll suit you to a T. Jest try ’em on That’s jest the article you want.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Well, they’re pooty fair. But I s’pose you’ll charge as much as a dollar for ’em. dollar! Why, woman alive, you don’t think I’d sell them specs for a dollar. They’re the real genuine periscopic Scotch pebble. They’re well wuth five dollars, but I shall only charge you three for them. ’Taint often you can get such a good article so cheap.
#MRS. SELWYN.
I’ll give you two dollars for ’em.
#EZEKIEL.
No, I can’t afford to sell ’em so low. But I’ll tell you what I will do. I’ll split the difference, and let you have ’em for two - fifty. They’re very becomin’ to you—make you look ten years younger than the others did.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Well, I s’pose I shall have to take ’em. But I shouldn’t think ’twould take you long to get rich at that rate.
#EZEKIEL.
The fact is, I’m growin’ poorer every day. I ought not to sell my goods so cheap; but the wimmen have such captivatin’ ways that I can’t resist ’em. What’s the next thing?
#MRS. SELWYN.
Well, I want some caliker for a new gown. I bought enough for one at Thompson’s, the other day; but I want another.
#EZEKIEL.
I’ve got jest the thing for you That’s exactly your style, and it’s only twelve and a half cents a yard.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Will it wash?
#EZEKIEL.
Like white cloth. I’ve sold yards and yards of that same pattern. It takes so well that one factory don’t make nothin’ else.
#MRS. SKINFLINT.
Twelve and a half cents a yard is too much. I can’t afford it, but I’ll give you a dollar for twelve yards.
#EZEKIEL.
Couldn’t do it. Think of a nice dress pattern like that bein’ sold for a dollar. No, marm, I can’t sell it any less.
#MRS. SELWYN.
I’ll give you a dollar and a quarter.
#EZEKIEL.
Well, as you’re taking consider’ble, I’ll let you have it for that; but you mustn’t say nothin’ about it. Why, Mis’ Hobbs bought some of it, and paid full price. I’m boardin’ there at Mis’ Hobbs’s. She’s got a pooty daughter—that Sairy Jane. Between you and me, that’s the reason I went to boardin’ there, for Mis’ Hobbs aint much of a cook.
#MRS. SELWYN.
I allers knew that. She never did hev much of a bringin’ up
#EZEKIEL.
Thank ye, marm. Well, aint there sumthin’ more? You’ll want some hooks and eyes, and thread to make your dress with, don’t ye?
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, you’ll throw them in, won’t ye? The store people do.
#EZEKIEL.
That’s askin’ a little too much.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Well, I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll give you a mince pie for ’em. I made some fresh ones to - day. What d’ye say? You know yer boardin’ - place aint anything to boast of.
#EZEKIEL.
Well, I don’t mind doin’ it for once. But I think I’d better be goin’. It don’t pay much to trade with you. You’re a deal too sharp.
#MRS. SELWYN.
I think I did make a good trade. Trust me for that. I saved enough on them trades to buy me a set of furs, next winter. They don’t cost but eight dollars, and I daresay I could get ’em for five. But there, it’s most twelve o’clock. I must be gettin’ dinner ready.
#MRS. SELWYN.
How d’ye do, Mis’ Hobbs?
#MRS. HOBBS.
Why, how d’ye do, Mis’ Skinflint? I’m glad to see you. Sit right down in the rockin’ - chair, do. It’s a pleasant evenin’.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Yes, very pleasant. I cum over this evenin’, Mis’ Hobbs, to see if there’s a peddler stoppin’ here. I bought a clock of one, this mornin’, and he sed he boarded here. The clock don’t go, and I want him to come and fix it, or give me another one.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Yes, that’s him; jest come into the kitchen. He’ll be right in, I guess. He always sits in here, evenin’s.
#SARAH JANE.
Well, what adventures have you had to - day, ’Zekiel?
#EZEKIEL.
The richest was with Mis’ Skinflint. Mis’ Deacon Pettengill told me she was as mean as dirt , and I thought I see if I couldn’t sarcumvent her.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
What did you do?
#EZEKIEL.
I offered her a clock for twelve dollars, and she beat me down to five. I usually sell ’em for a dollar and a half.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
I suppose ’twasn’t worth even that.
#EZEKIEL.
It doesn’t go much, but when it does, it makes up for lost time. Then she wanted some spettercles. She took a pair for two dollars and a half that I generally get seventy - five cents for; but I’ll warrant they won’t magnify any too much, for there’s nothing but winder - glass in ’em.
#MRS. SELWYN.
The villain!
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
You was rather too bad, ’Zekiel.
#EZEKIEL.
Not at all. She bought some calico, and asked if it would wash. I told her it would wash like white cloth, and I guess ’twill. After two or three washings, there won’t be a bit of color left in it.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, the wretch! Won’t I give it to him!
#EZEKIEL.
But the cream of the joke was that she wanted some hooks and eyes and a spool of thread, and gave me a mince pie for them. I tasted it, but it was such wretched stuff that I couldn’t eat it, so I threw it into the river for the fishes.
#MRS. SELWYN.
What do you mean, you wretch, by cheatin’ me in such a way?
#EZEKIEL.
I didn’t cheat you. You tried to keep me from gettin’ any profit on my goods. I put a price on them, and you could take them or not, as you pleased. You was willin’ to pay what I asked for them; so I don’t see how I cheated you.
#MRS. SELWYN.
You didn’t tell me the truth about ’em Then you called the nice pie I gave you wretched stuff. I shouldn’t ’a thought of givin’ it to you ef ye hadn’t said you didn’t git anythin’ fit to eat here.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
What’s that? What did he say?
#MRS. SELWYN.
He said you wasn’t much of a cook, and, ef it warn’t for courtin’ Sairy Jane, he couldn’t stand it boardin’ here.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
So that’s the way you repay my kindness in taking you in, is it, you miserable villain? I’m mad enough to pull your hair—if you only had enough to pull.
#EZEKIEL.
I shouldn’t dare to pull yours, marm, for fear ’twould come off in my hand.
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Get out of the house, you insultin’ creature, and never let me set eyes on you again!
#MRS. HILLCHRIST.
Now, old Skinflint, do you go too. You’ve made mischief enough here. I don’t blame the man for throwin’ your miserable pie away. I hope it wont pizen the fishes.
#MRS. SELWYN.
I guess you’ll find you’ve got enough to look after, without ’tendin’ to your neighbors’ business There goes Sairy Jane with that peddler’s arm round her waist.
