#HANSCOMB.
Steve, Pete, come, come, hurry, hurry, wake up! This is really encouraging. The Fatted Calf, just opened, is rapidly filling up, and such customers, too; real upper crust, - nabobs, millionnaires, heiresses, generals, majors, captains, colonels, and all sorts of stylish people! Now let’s look at the situation. I have on my books already thirty permanent boarders at five dollars a day. Pretty high for the times, but that draws the style. Of these thirty, ten will pay up promptly, ten wont pay at all, and the other ten will be obliged to leave their baggage to settle the bill. Well, I think that will pay. We must give a wide margin for profit, and in course of time may make a fortune, or manage to fail for seventy - five or a hundred thousand, either of which will create a sensation. Where can those waiters be? Ah, here’s Steve at last, as stiff and pompous as one of the nabobs whom he delights to wait upon.
#STEVE.
Mr. Hanscomb, allow me to present for your inspection this document just left at the bar, with the compliments of the landlord of the Hotel Bullock.
#MR. HANSCOMB.
What is it? “Stop, thief! Nab him! Strayed from the Hotel Bullock an individual passing by the singular name of John Smith.” John Smith? I think I’ve heard that name before.
#STEVE.
It has a very distangue air.
#MR. HANSCOMB.
“Tall, red hair, pale, ferocious - looking countenance; wore, when last seen, dark mixed pants, blue coat with brass buttons, white hat, and a shawl. A reward of one cent will be given for the arrest of the missing individual, and fifty dollars for the recovery of one dozen silver spoons, which said individual, probably accidentally, took with him.” So, so, a hotel thief. Mr. John Smith will no doubt pay me a visit; so, Steve, just keep a sharp look - out for this spoony. Well, what’s the matter with you?
#PETE.
Mr. Hanscomb, I don’t wish to be troubulous, - I don’t wish to be troubulous, Mr. Hanscomb, but dar are t’ings, Mr. Hanscomb, dat stir de heart of man, as Deacon Foster eloquentially distresses himself, and - and - and - well, what I mean - rile him - rile him.
#MR. HANSCOMB.
What’s the matter, stupid?
#PETE.
Mr. Hanscomb, you’re my massa.
#MR. HANSCOMB.
Well, well?
#PETE.
You’re my massa, Mr. Hanscomb, and I s’pose you can call me what you please.
#MR. HANSCOMB.
Of course I can.
#PETE.
Ob course, ob course, kase I look upon you as my equel.
#MR. HANSCOMB.
Well, I’m much obliged -
#PETE.
Don’t apologize; no matter ’bout nuffin; but dat ar hostler down dar, he’s an ignoramus, down dar, he is, down dar; he’s low and insultin’, he is. By golly! de imperance of dat feller is distressin’. He says I’m bound to asswociate wid him kase he’s a man and a brudder. Guess not, Mr. Hanscomb, - guess not; don’t asswociate wid people dat smell ob de stable.
#MR. HANSCOMB.
You attend to your business, and he shall not trouble you.
#PETE.
Dat’s all I ask, Mr. Hanscomb, - dat’s all I ask. Jes’ you keep hisself to hisself, and I wont say nuffin. I’s perfectly dissatisfied, but if he jes’ trubble me, I’ll brush him off - brush him off.
#MR. HANSCOMB.
Well, well, you go about your business.
#STEVE.
Here’s a queer - looking customer, and I’m not sure but what it is our friend, John Smith, of the spoon adventure; just the dress, even to the shawl.
#MR. HANSCOMB.
Ah, so soon? Now, boys, look sharp and catch him in the act, - in the act, mind.
#STEVE.
Where are you going, Pete?
#PETE.
Going? Going after de axe, ob course.
#STEVE.
After the axe! What do you want of the axe?
#PETE.
Cotch dat ar spoon feller. Didn’t massa say be sure and cotch him wid de axe?
#STEVE.
Well, you are an ignoramus.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Up this way, eh? Oh! never mind, Mister, I’ll find the way. First turn to the right, second to the left, and then keep straight on, and here you are. So this is eighty - six, first floor from the roof. It’s airy, anyhow. Here, you African, bring back that umbrella, and you, Mr. Upstart, bring back that valise. I choose to have them under my own observation.
#PETE.
Don’t you want your wardrobe aired?
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
No, I don’t want it aired. What’s your name, African?
#PETE.
My name, massa, am White; dey calls me Pete.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
And what’s your name, Upstart?
#STEVE.
My name is Black; I am called here Stephen.
#PETE.
“Steben, Steben; don’t you bleeb ’im.” He’s called Steeb, short Steeb.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Well, you cut short, African, and cut off. Do you see that entrance? Well, you both get outside that entrance instantly.
#STEVE.
Pete, that is John Smith.
#PETE.
No! De spoon feller?
#STEVE.
The same. Don’t you see the pants and the coat and the shawl? ’Tis the pettifogger.
#PETE.
Petti who? I fought it was Smiff, - John Smiff.
#STEVE.
So it is; look out for spoons. Sh!
#PETE.
Look out for de spoons. Sh!
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
What ails them objects? They look at me awful hard; they are evidently not accustomed to the presence of so elegant an individual in this hotel. So this is an hotel; this is the first time that ever I was in one. I declare, it’s quite elegant. And this is Boston, the hub of the universe, as Artemus Ward says. I wonder I have ever lived to get here, after having been cooped up in that horrid hole, Dismaltown. It is refreshing to get among civilized individuals. I’ve passed my whole life in that place without ever seeing anybody or anything, and I should be there now but for my uncle, the captain; and somehow I do feel quite homesick when I think of my Annastasia; but then my Annastasia is not there; she is nearer to me in Boston than in Dismaltown, for my Annastasia is now on a visit to her aunt in Brighton. I have received epistles often from the object of my heart’s adoration, and the last one was particularly interesting. She invited me in the name of her aunt to come and spend Christmas with her. I was particularly overjoyed at first, but how was I to get there? The people of Dismaltown never go anywhere, and I should never have got here but for my uncle, the captain. My uncle has always been called captain, though he never went to sea, but for years has been behind the counter of the little grocery at Dismaltown, where he made some money. Well, my uncle took it into his head to buy a sloop; so he bought a sloop; it was a very good sloop for a second - hand one. The sloop was well sold, and so, they said, was my uncle, the captain. My uncle bought her, and then was bent on going a voyage in her as skipper, and so he invited me to go with him on his first voyage to Boston. He never went to sea before, and don’t know anything about a sloop, and he was awful sick all the way, but he had a good mate, and he is a beautiful skipper; he talks such sea lingo, and swears so beautifully, though people do say that he knows no more about the sea than an owl; but that is all envy. Well, after I got aboard, I happened to think of one sentence in Annastasia’s letter, which read, “Be sure to learn how to carve before you come, as uncle is away, and aunt will expect you to carve the Christmas goose.” What an idea! they might as well ask me to carve an ox or an alligator. However, when I reached Boston, I bought a little book on the art of carving, and came up to this hotel to have a little practice. Look here, African. Do you know what a goose is?
#PETE.
Yes, massa; one ob dem two - legged fellers dat flops his wings jes’ so - dis way - so.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Well, I want one of them.
#PETE.
One ob dem flappers? Live one?
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
No, ignorance, - roasted.
#PETE.
Yes, massa. Roast goose for 86.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
No, no, stupid! Not for eighty - six; I only want it for one.
#PETE.
It’s all right, massa; dat’s what I fought, - dat’s what I fought. Dar wont but one goose come up here, so decompose yourself, - decompose yourself.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
What horrid grammar that African does indulge in! There’s my uncle, the captain.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Shiver my timbers, blast my eyes, and keel - haul me, if this here craft ar’n’t the biggest seventy - four that ever I saw in all my cruisings. Such a climbing up hatchways and over bulkheads is trying to the narves of a tar with his sea - legs on.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Now, isn’t that beautiful language? It sounds so briny! But I say, uncle, where’s your tar?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Blast my eyes! Shiver my timbers! Do you mean to insult me? Aint I the skipper of the “Jemima Matilda,” as stanch a craft as ever sailed out of harbor, with spanker jib - boom hauled taut, and foretop main - truck flying at the mast - head?
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Oh, aint he a spanker?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Now, look here, nevy, none of your jokes, or, shiver my timbers, I’ll disinherit you. Aint I the skipper of the “Jemima” -
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Oh, uncle, you said that before.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Blast my eyes, I’ll say it again. Look here, messmate, I’m a sailor; not one of your fresh - water sailors, but a regular - built old sea - dog.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Eight days old; hasn’t got his eyes open yet.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
I’ve climbed the rigging in the darkest night.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
So dark nobody could see him.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
I’ve seen the waves roll mountains high.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
That’s a great idea.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
I’ve been alone in the middle of the ocean in a jolly - boat.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
That’s a jolly lie.
#STEVE.
Well, captain, what can I do for you?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
I say, messmate, did you ever hear of the escape of the “Jemima Matilda” on her trip from Dismaltown to Puddock?
#STEVE.
Never did.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Then, blast my eyes, but you shall now, messmate.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
I say, uncle, don’t tell that horrid fiction again.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Fiction! You young dog, I’ll have you court - martialed. Well, you must know, messmate - What you got there?
#STEVE.
Tobacco; will you have a chew?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
No, I thank you; I don’t chew.
#STEVE.
You don’t? Well you are the first sailor I ever saw who didn’t chew.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
I say, messmate, give us a chew. If sailors chew this, I can.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Don’t, uncle, don’t chew that horrid stuff; it’ll make you as sick as a horse.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Shiver my timbers, nevy, what’s the use in being a sailor, if you don’t do as sailors do? Give us another chew, messmate. Thank ye. You must know, messmate, that the “Jemima Matilda,” of which I am the skipper, left the harbor of Dismaltown on the second of July for a trip to Puddock.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
With a cargo of onions.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
We hauled off from the wharf wing and wing.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
It takes a pretty good sailor to put a sloop wing and wing.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
As the wind freshened, we put more sail on the mizzenmast, and took a reef in the capstan, and set a hen - coop on top of the caboose, as a look - out. Then came on a perfect hurricane. We were within the latitude of forty - two degrees below zero, when I went below to take an observation. I hadn’t been gone long before there was a cry from the look - out of “There she blows!” I rushed on deck, and sure enough it did blow strong from the nor - nor - east, nor - east - by - nor, and the ship was nearly on her bulkheads. The crew clung around me and entreated me to save the ship. I alone was calm. I had all the heavy furniture of my cabin, consisting of a pine table, a musquito netting, and a looking - glass, brought up and consigned to the waves; but all in vain. Desperation nerved my arm, and seizing a hatchet, I rushed abaft the hen - coop, and with one terrific blow cut away -
#STEVE.
The mast!
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
No, three feet of the cook’s stove - pipe. But she righted, and we were saved. Then a new danger arose on our weather bow. Three fathoms to windward arose a rock with a shelving surface nearest us even with the water, but the farthest part rising four feet. We were in danger of striking, when I rushed to the helm, bore hard on the compass, doused the binnacle lights, and steered straight for the rock. Fortune favored the bold manœuvre, for a sudden squall from the sou - sou - west raised the ship upon the rock. She slid swiftly over, and came down into the water with such a shock that, blast my eyes, if all the salt junk in the caboose didn’t turn of its own accord. Give us another chew, messmate.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
If my uncle aint a sailor, it isn’t for want of ability to lie.
#STEVE.
Captain, is there anything I can do for you?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Ay, ay, messmate; show me a room, and give me something comfortable.
#STEVE.
Ay, ay, sir! A warm room and a good pipe.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Pipe! Blast my eyes, I don’t smoke!
#STEVE.
You are the first sailor that ever I saw who didn’t smoke.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Oh, shiver my timbers, let’s have the pipe!
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
I say, uncle, don’t smoke a horrid pipe; you’ll be awful sick.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Blast my eyes, nevy, do you take me for a land - lubber? You just keep a sharp look - out here on the quarter - deck, while I turn in and take a shot in the locker. Heave ahead, my hearty , or, shiver my timbers, I’ll rake you fore and aft.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
My uncle knows a thing or two, but I’m afraid that, with smoking and chewing, he’ll get awful sick of this sailor business. Ah, here comes my goose. What an elegant spread!
#PETE.
Anything else, massa?
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Let me see: there’s no ale; bring me some ale; and - why, there’s no spoons!
#STEVE.
Spoons?
#PETE.
Spo - spo - spo - spoons?
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Yes, spoons. How do you suppose an individual is to eat without spoons?
#STEVE.
I’ll bring them, sir.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Well, African, what are you grinning at?
#PETE.
At de goose, massa, - at de goose.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Now leave. Get out.
#STEVE.
Keep your eye on the spoons.
#PETE.
By golly, Steve, if he take de spoons, he must take African too.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
It seems to me that those individuals have a great deal of anxiety on my account. Well, now to business. Where’s my “Art of Carving”? Now let me see. No. 1 is the head, this must be it. No, this is the head. Now for it. “Grasp the knife firmly in the right hand,” - that’s so, - “take the fork in the left;” but what shall I do with the “Art of Carving”? It doesn’t say anything about that: I’ll fix it. Now , “stick the fork in No. 8.” That must be No. 8. “Draw your knife across No. 11” -
#PETE.
Did you ring, sar?
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
No, I didn’t ring, you outrageous ignorant -
#PETE.
Beg pardon, sar. Must have been 84. Spoons are dar.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Blast 84! What does he ring for just as I’ve got my knife across No. 11? I must go all over it again. Put your fork in No. 4, draw your knife across No. 11 -
#STEVE.
Did you ring, sir?
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Ring, you blasted upstart? With my fork in No. 4 and my knife across No. 11! How was I to ring? Ring? - no.
#STEVE.
Beg pardon, sir; it must have been 82. Spoons all right.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
82 be blowed! This is a queer proceeding. I’ll try it again. Put your fork in No. 4, draw your knife across No. 11, force yourself, and off comes the blasted animal.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Ring? Blast your ignorance, no! Where’s your bell?
#STEVE.
There it is, sir.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
When I want you, I’ll ring it loud, and open the door, - so get out. After all my trouble, I must go back to No. 4. No, I wont; I’ll push ahead and trust to luck. This is the toughest old gander that ever I saw. I can do nothing with it. O Annastasia! that leg wont come off. O Annastasia! if you could only see me now, - I can’t start that wing. Why did you not ask me to get a horn of the moon, or extinguish the Etna volcano. O Annastasia! - there’s a piece of the breast; what a horrid looking object! What shall I do with him? I can’t eat him, and I should get laughed at if it should be seen. I’ll give him away to some poor individual. Nobody about - yes, there’s an urchin. Sh! look here.
#BOBBY.
Shine your boots? Yes, sir, all right; put yer foot there, and I’ll give yer true Union polish in about forty - five seconds.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
I don’t want my boots polished.
#BOBBY.
Oh, can’t stand the press? Look ahere, gent, stand on my head, play yer a tune on my chin, and give yer the Union polish, all for five cents.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
I don’t want your Union polish. I’m an Englishman.
#BOBBY.
Oh, yer an Englishman! Say, don’t yer want to go over to Bunker Hill? Stand on my head, play yer a tune, and carry yer over to Bunker Hill, for five cents.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
I don’t want to go to Bunker Hill.
#BOBBY.
Well, say what do you want?
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Sh! Do you want a goose?
#BOBBY.
Do I want - Say that again, gent.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Do you want a goose? This one?
#BOBBY.
What’s the matter with the poor old gobbler? somebody’s been mauling on him.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Yes, all right, just cooked; here, take him and leave.
#BOBBY.
Thank yer. I’ll take him right down among the Union Polishers, and if we don’t polish his bones, my name is not Bobby Small.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Well, Bobby, here you are.
#BOBBY.
Thank yer, sir; may yer live forever! But I say, can’t I do something for yer? Stand on my head? No! Play yer a tune on my chin? No! Union polish yer? Oh! yer don’t like that. Well, when yer do want a shine, just drop down into Brattle Square. You’ll find me there in business hours, ready to stand on my head, give yer a tune on my chin, or give yer the Union polish.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Well, I’ve got rid of that unfortunate animal, and now let’s see if I can find my uncle, the captain. Here, African, clear away this truck.
#PETE.
Clear away de truck? By golly! I t’ink it pretty well cleared itself, bones and all. I say, Steve, de old gobbler am clean gone.
#STEVE.
Is it possible? Look under the table.
#PETE.
By golly! dere am no goose dar. Dat are feller is a what yer call him, he is.
#STEVE.
What do you mean by a what yer call him?
#PETE.
Why, one of dem fellers, connubial, connubial.
#STEVE.
Connubial? You mean a cannibal.
#PETE.
Dat’s what I said, a connubial.
#STEVE.
Well, cannibal or connubial, our gravy spoon is missing.
#PETE.
By golly! Steve, it’s Smiff, - John Smiff. Cotch him wid de axe! cotch him wid de axe!
#STEVE.
Here, take these things right down, and tell Mr. Hanscomb. Be quick, for the gong will sound for dinner in three minutes. More spoons, monsieur.
#PETE.
More spoons, spoons, monster! Sam. What does this mean? Oh, horror! a light dawns upon me. Spoons, spoons! I must have given away one of the spoons with the goose. I remember there was one in the dish. Oh, heavens! what’s to be done? They’ll have me arrested. Where can my uncle, the captain, be? I can’t find him anywhere, and he’s got all the money. Oh, Annastasia, why did you ask me to learn the horrid art of carving? Oh, what will become of me? Oh, agony, agony! I’ll ring the bell and disclose all. Oh, what have I done, what have I done? Hear the crockery go! I’ve pulled down a whole crockery shop.
#STEVE.
Did you ring?
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
No, I didn’t touch anything, - I say, much broke?
#STEVE.
Much broke! you’ll find out what’s broke.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
What’s to be done? That upstart’s gone for an officer. It wont do for me to stop here. I’ll make a run of it.
#STEVE.
You can’t pass here.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Oh, excuse me; I’ll go the other way. This port blockaded?
#PETE.
Yes, massa, by Burnside.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Oh, oh, you ignoramus! do you want to torture me?
#PETE.
Only a little game of poker, massa.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
This is insulting! What do you mean by stopping an Englishman in this way?
#STEVE.
Want to overhaul you, to see if there is anything contraband aboard.
#PETE.
’Taint de fust time a British mail has been stopped.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
I must submit. What would Annastasia say? It must be that unfortunate goose. I can’t pay my bill till I find my uncle, the captain. There’s that urchin again. What is he making such awful faces for?
#BOBBY.
The gent gave me a spoon with the goose. It must have been by mistake, so I brought it back. Perhaps the gent will stand a dime. Sh, sh! I’ve got it.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Got it! so have I. Audacious! Here’s the goose , and here’s the spoon. Hurrah! I’m saved.
#HANSCOMB.
Are you? That’s a very ingenious dodge, Mr. John Smith, but it wont do. Steve, seize that man; and you, Pete, look after the boy. You’re a handsome couple, you are! What have you to say for yourselves?
#BOBBY.
Look here, contraband, don’t soil my linen. I say, gent, what kind of a scrape have you got me into?
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
I am innocent, I am innocent, I am innocent!
#PETE.
Dat’s a lie, dat’s a lie, dat’s a lie! Jest look at dat poor old gobbler; somebody’s massacred him.
#HANSCOMB.
Take them to the station - house at once.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Oh, dear! is there no escape? Oh, Annastasia, if thou couldst only see the agony of thy unfortunate Samuel! Will nobody save me?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
O Sammy, Sammy! where are you, Sammy?
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
My uncle, the captain, at last.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Oh, Sammy, oh, Sammy, I’m so sick! I want to go home, I want to go home. I went down - stairs, and a chap there as was a sailor wanted me to go over to Chelsea, and the horrid ferry - boat made me sick, and the awful pipe made me sick, and I want to go home.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
In the “Jemima”?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
No, never; don’t let me see the water again, or a ship, or a sailor. I hate the sea, and I want to go home.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
But I can’t go; I’m arrested for stealing.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Arrested for stealing! Who accuses the nephew of Capt. Nat Skillings of stealing?
#HANSCOMB.
Capt. Nat Skillings, of Dismaltown, Nova Scotia?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Just so.
#HANSCOMB.
I used to know a Capt. Skillings, of Dismaltown, but he was not a sea captain.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Well, I guess it’s the same man. I sha’n’t be one after to - day.
#HANSCOMB.
Captain, don’t you remember your old friend, Sol Hanscomb?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
To be sure I do.
#HANSCOMB.
Well, I’m his son.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Be you, though? Why, how you have grown! But what have you been doing to my nephew?
#HANSCOMB.
That your nephew! I thought it was John Smith.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Not a bit of it. That’s Sam Skillings.
#HANSCOMB.
Not John Smith! I’m confounded.
#STEVE.
Not Smith? I’m dumb.
#PETE.
Not Smiff? I’m scorched.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Yes, Sam Skillings, who would scorn to do a mean action, but who accidentally purloined one of this gentleman’s spoons, for which he is willing to make all possible reparation.
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Oh, I see how it is; Sam has been practising the art of carving.
#HANSCOMB.
The art of carving? Why, I’ll teach him that in twenty minutes.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
Will you, though? I’ll be greatly obliged to you; so will Annastasia, and my uncle, the captain, skipper of the “Jemima” -
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Sammy, sink the ship. I’ve concluded that the sea don’t agree with my constitution. I’ll sell her. Is there anybody here wants her? She’s A1¾, stanch and well - built, copper - bottomed, and tarred throughout, especially the cabin; Morgan stock, sound and kind in harness; will stand all winds, especially nor - nor - east, nor - east by nor, shiver my timbers -
#STEVE.
Have a chew, captain?
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Oh, Sam, Sam, take me home!
#HANSCOMB.
Ladies and Gentlemen, “The Fatted Calf” has been opened under rather unfavorable circumstances, but if you will give us another call, you shall find a hospitable landlord -
#STEVE.
Accommodating waiters -
#PETE.
Who - who - who will gib you ebery detention, wid - wid -
#BOBBY.
De Union polish.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
And if a word from me would not be out of place, I would recommend this house, as I expect to stop here with my Annastasia on our bridal tour, on which occasion we expect to be accompanied by that extraordinary seaman -
#CAPT. HAGBERD.
Oh, Sammy, don’t.
#SAMUEL JENKINS.
My uncle, the captain.
