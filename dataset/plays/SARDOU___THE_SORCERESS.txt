#RAMIRO.
Go, march on, there! Arrest those laggards and keep them for me! Silence, there! You will explain to the governor in Toledo.
#ENRIQUE.
Hold on! Wait! What is that noise?
#RAMIRO.
Those shouts! Go and see who is uttering them.
#ARIAS.
Some cavaliers passing along the road.
#ENRIQUE.
Do you hear me? Who is there?
#ARIAS.
It is our commander, Don Enrique Palacios, who is returning home from the chase.
#RAMIRO.
He arrives opportunely. My lord, it is I, your esquire, Ramiro.
#ENRIQUE.
What are you doing there?
#RAMIRO.
Making arrests, my lord. And, may I venture to pray Your Honor to dismount and climb up this rough path? We have warrants which are very important.
#ENRIQUE.
Very good! - I will come.
#RAMIRO.
Here is our general, Don Enrique Palacios, commander of the archers and cross - bowmen of the city. He will examine you on the spot.
#THE PEASANTS.
Good! - Good! - He is a good man! - He will listen to us and set us at liberty!
#RAMIRO.
Up this side, my lord, if you please! Scene Two
#ENRIQUE.
Oh, ho! This is a fine catch with one stroke of the hand!
#RAMIRO.
I was going to conduct these people to Toledo to be examined. Your Honor may spare me the pain.
#THE PEASANTS.
Mercy, Excellency! - Pity! - Pity! - We are innocent! - We did not do it!
#RAMIRO.
Peace! Keep quiet, there, brawlers! Do not bewilder his lordship with your croakings!
#ENRIQUE.
Be considerate, Ramiro. They have the right to speak in their own defence. What has caused this disturbance?
#RAMIRO.
Your lordship has not forgotten a young Moorish armourer employed on his estate, named Kalem?
#ENRIQUE.
Kalem? Yes! a clever artisan and also a handsome lad, who worked for me.
#RAMIRO.
Unfortunately one of those black, obstinate rebels, who will not admit since the conquest of Granada by our glorious sire that the dominion of the Moors and the cult of their great devil Mohammed have ended in Spain.
#ENRIQUE.
Yes. Whenever I urged Kalem to become converted he always refused.
#RAMIRO.
He went from bad to worse - defying a royal edict, which forbids all intimacy between an unconverted Moor and a Christian, he betrayed the daughter of a neighbor, a good Catholic. For that offence the two culprits, in conformance with the law, have been punished during your lordship's absence: the girl thrown into solitude for life in the convent of Mercy! - and Kalem, stoned to death!
#ENRIQUE.
Ah! the poor boy!
#RAMIRO.
Yesterday at sunset, up there at the foot of an elm! - After which I left the body fastened to the tree - trunk, according to custom, to serve as a warning to these accursed heathen. But, no! They are enraged! The body has disappeared!
#ENRIQUE.
When was it removed?
#RAMIRO.
Last night.
#ENRIQUE.
By whom?
#RAMIRO.
I do not know. The news was slow in coming and I was ordered to go out during the night and surprise the residents of this vicinity in their beds and bring them to an inquest.
#ENRIQUE.
And the result?
#ARIAS.
Nothing! - They have nothing to say!
#THE PEASANTS.
We know nothing, your lordship, nothing! So truly as there is a God, we are innocent.
#ENRIQUE.
Is there among them a relative or friend of Kalem?
#ALL.
Not one, your lordship.
#A PEASANT.
None, my lord!
#ENRIQUE.
No one who would have a reason for stealing his body?
#ALL.
Not one, my lord! - Far from here! - A dog of a Mussulman! - We are good Christians!
#A WOMAN.
We should have stoned him to death a second time!
#RAMIRO.
Keep quiet, there! - Listen!
#ARIAS.
Here is something more to please us. Scene Three
#AN ARCHER.
Go in! you beggar!
#THE GOATHERD.
Lord! have mercy!
#THE ARCHER.
He attempted to flee, the fool! He ran faster than his goats.
#ENRIQUE.
Is he a goatherd?
#THE ARCHER.
So he says.
#RAMIRO.
Answer, villain, Don Enrique Palacios!
#ENRIQUE.
It is you, then, who stole the body?
#THE GOATHERD.
Me! my Sweet Deliverer! - touch a corpse!
#ENRIQUE.
Then why did you run?
#THE GOATHERD.
For not speaking - and for fear she would revenge herself upon me for exposing her!
#ENRIQUE.
And who - is she?
#THE GOATHERD.
She who took the body. woman?
#THE GOATHERD.
The Moorish woman!
#THE OTHERS.
The Sorceress! - Yes! - Yes! - It was she! - It was she!
#ENRIQUE.
The Sorceress?
#THE GOATHERD.
Certainly, my lord. I have often seen her at night wandering on the heights and making conjurations to the moon, so I was not surprised to see her up there at daybreak this morning making curious gestures, in this way - I hurried my flock to avoid her - when two nigger devils approached her along that path! I was seized with a foolish fancy to know what these three were charming, and I clambered and crawled over the rocks toward them. But she pricked up her ears, the magician, and scrutinized the slope where I was lying with such a terrible gaze that I rolled down and scampered away, saying to myself: "I hope that her eyes have not changed me into a brown owl, or into a bad beast!"
#ENRIQUE.
Then she is the guilty one?
#THE PEASANTS.
It is she, your lordship; it is the Sorceress, without a doubt.
#ENRIQUE.
And who among you believe she is a sorceress?
#THE PEASANTS.
Oh, all!
#FIRST MAN.
It is believed everywhere.
#A WOMAN.
She has caused enough misfortune with her deviltries!
#SECOND MAN.
It has been proved that words from her will give rot to the sheep.
#A PEASANT.
And sickness to men.
#THE WOMAN.
Listen to the testimony of the wife of Zuniga, a wet - nurse, whose milk supply she caused to go dry.
#FIRST MAN.
And to Jos√© Barilla on whose barn she caused lightning to descend.
#THE WOMAN.
Oh! the wicked she - goat!
#ANOTHER WOMAN.
She is the plague of this community!
#SECOND MAN.
Arrest her, my lord! - It is she who stole the body!
#THE GOATHERD.
To make magic powders of the bones!
#ALL.
Yes! Yes!
#THE GOATHERD.
It is well for you to shrug your shoulders, you!
#FAREZ.
Me?
#THE GOATHERD.
Yes. You who act so cunningly.
#THE WOMAN.
Yes. He laughs at all we say.
#FAREZ.
At all of your stupidities!
#ENRIQUE.
Come forward. Pay no attention to them. What is your name?
#FAREZ.
Farez. Moor?
#THE GOATHERD.
But converted.
#ENRIQUE.
What is your trade?
#FAREZ.
Muleteer.
#ENRIQUE.
Then, according to your opinion, these people are wrong?
#FAREZ.
This is all idle talk, my lord - the ravings of old women.
#ENRIQUE.
Do you know this Moorish woman?
#FAREZ.
Zoraya?
#ENRIQUE.
Is her name Zoraya?
#FAREZ.
Yes, my lord; that is to say, in the Arabic tongue, "The Star of the Morning." I have long known her. I was in Granada before the conquest, employed as a servant by her father, Abou - Abassa, a scholar and physician of the last King Boabdil.
#ENRIQUE.
Maiden, woman or widow - this Zoraya?
#FAREZ.
Widow, my lord! - Sometime before the siege she was married to a very valiant Moor, who was killed in a sortie.
#ENRIQUE.
Being now a Granadan, does she reside in Toledo?
#FAREZ.
After the capture of Toledo, the wise Bishop Talavera, Governor of our city, took a strong fancy to Abou - Abassa because of his great knowledge and made him come here to reside. The daughter, of course, lived with him. The mother is no longer of this earth.
#ENRIQUE.
Does she reside in Toledo?
#FAREZ.
No, my lord; but near here on this mountain - slope in a house built by her father, who died in the past year. She lives there alone with her old servants and her few surviving friends. Her door is always open to those of her race and her religion who appeal to her in need or in sickness.
#ENRIQUE.
Ah! She likewise practises healing?
#FAREZ.
Free of charge! Her father left her great wealth and the knowledge of his art. Those of her own race are not the only ones who have sought her aid. More than one Christian who has secretly begged gold and medicines from her now shows his ingratitude by accusing her of causing hail to fall upon the fields.
#ENRIQUE.
That is enough! Keep the muleteer. Release the others.
#THE PEASANTS.
Ah, thanks! your lordship! God will reward you! Long live His Excellency!
#ARIAS.
Go! Go! Disperse without noise! Scene Four
#ENRIQUE.
You say that she resides near here?
#FAREZ.
On this hillside - a white house, half way up the slope, with beautiful gardens and a terrace mirrored in the waters of the Tagus.
#ENRIQUE.
You may conduct me there. Go!
#FAREZ.
If Your Grace will follow me - But she is not far - There she is!
#ENRIQUE.
The Moorish woman?
#FAREZ.
It is she herself - I see her coming up the slope.
#ENRIQUE.
You may return home. You, here, step to one side and keep quiet. And observe her practicing her black art.
#ENRIQUE.
That is a strange task!
#ARIAS.
See, my lord, in her hand?
#ENRIQUE.
That silver sickle?
#ARIAS.
Which shines like the crescent moon.
#RAMIRO.
The crescent of Mohammed - the moon is a Saracen and a sorceress!
#ENRIQUE.
Speak lower! - What curious harvest brings her into the midst of these rocks?
#RAMIRO.
She is gathering bad herbs for her philters and poisons. beautiful creature, truly. See the grace and suppleness in her movements.
#RAMIRO.
One might say as much of a serpent.
#ENRIQUE.
For shame!
#RAMIRO.
Your Honor should be careful or this she - devil may throw over him the same charm that Circe of yore threw over Ulysses.
#ENRIQUE.
Am I like the goatherd to believe that she will change me into a beast?
#RAMIRO.
No! But through love - it is the same!
#ENRIQUE.
Enough! - I must speak to her! Zoraya!
#ZORAYA.
Who is calling me?
#ENRIQUE.
I, Enrique Palacios, commander of the archers of the city.
#ZORAYA.
What does his lordship desire?
#ENRIQUE.
The truth! - It was you and two accomplices who took down and carried away Kalem's body?
#ZORAYA.
It was, my lord.
#ENRIQUE.
For use in some conjurations - for you are a magician, it appears?
#ZORAYA.
Me?
#ENRIQUE.
So it is said.
#ZORAYA.
By those who hate me because I am Moorish and faithful to the law of the Koran.
#ENRIQUE.
Peace, there. So you have not come here to work some magic in the moonlight, or to meet an accomplice in your sorceries?
#ZORAYA.
I come to gather herbs in the night and to be alone; and in moonlight because it is easier to recognize them.
#ENRIQUE.
What do you do with them?
#ZORAYA.
From the hearts of these flowers, my lord, I extract essences and perfumes for myself and ointments, elixirs and powders for curing diseases.
#ENRIQUE.
Are these remedies, these poisonous herbs?
#ZORAYA.
Yes; wholesome and healing. The vermilion fruit of the black henbane and that of the deadly nightshade or belladonna cure delirium and insanity. They also put sufferers to sleep. Also these others. They are like all things of the world, in love the same: according to the case and the dose, cure or kill.
#ENRIQUE.
Oh! by that I understand that you deal in love philters.
#ZORAYA.
What need of them, my dear lord? - Love is born of a smile, rather than of a philter.
#ENRIQUE.
Do you often make that test?
#ZORAYA.
Never!
#ENRIQUE.
Oh! - so chaste - in spite of those eyes, there?
#ZORAYA.
Through pride! It is not necessary to search for dignity in me!
#ENRIQUE.
Bless me! the beautiful! You are very difficult. - But let that pass! - If it were not for some evil work why did you steal Kalem's body?
#ZORAYA.
The human flesh is not made to feed ravens and wolves.
#ENRIQUE.
You have buried it?
#ZORAYA.
In a crevice in the rocks - you may assure yourself. criminal.
#ZORAYA.
To me he was not a criminal, whose only crime was to have loved. Christian! - in spite of the law which forbids love between your race and mine.
#ZORAYA.
It is love, however, which will reconcile them in the long run.
#ENRIQUE.
Ah, well! to justify that you shall explain to His Eminence the Cardinal Xim√©n√®s.
#ZORAYA.
The Inquisitor!
#ENRIQUE.
It is to him that I must take you.
#ZORAYA.
Oh, no, my dear lord! No! You must not say that.
#ENRIQUE.
Why not?
#ZORAYA.
You know that the high priest detests us and persecutes us. You do not want to injure me; for you are good -
#ENRIQUE.
How do you know that?
#ZORAYA.
Oh, I see it!
#ENRIQUE.
In truth, what indications do you see?
#ZORAYA.
Those which my father revealed to me.
#ENRIQUE.
Of the nature of men?
#ZORAYA.
And their destinies.
#ENRIQUE.
Do you read this in the stars?
#ZORAYA.
My knowledge does not come from them. - But through the crystal, the mirror, the silver disc and the lines of the hands.
#ENRIQUE.
Ah! By God! - I am curious to see what you read in mine! - Come here!
#RAMIRO.
Ah! the bewitcher! - See how she takes him little by little into her coils in order to escape punishment.
#ZORAYA.
You are loyal, my lord, and brave - but your will is feeble and unsteady.
#ENRIQUE.
Where do you see that?
#ZORAYA.
In the shape of your head and the first phalange of your thumb, which is short - I see here that you are subject to sudden and terrible bursts of anger.
#ENRIQUE.
It is true! Is it not, Ramiro?
#RAMIRO.
Rain of Heaven! Why has he not strangled this accursed woman?
#ZORAYA.
The life - line, beautiful at the beginning - stops short - danger of death - struck as with lightning!
#ENRIQUE.
A soldier's death - so much the better! Seat yourself; you will be more at ease.
#ZORAYA.
These wrinkles which cross at the base of the thumb show an inclination very - very amorous!
#ENRIQUE.
Oh! as to that - Yes!
#ZORAYA.
This deep red line, which connects the thumb with the life - line - a passion! Oh! - that! Like she who possesses you! - It will end only with your life!
#ENRIQUE.
Then it is to be returned?
#ZORAYA.
I do not know - why should one be troubled about that?
#ENRIQUE.
What flower have you robbed of this perfume?
#ZORAYA.
The golden cassie!
#ENRIQUE.
It is exquisite! - You who read the future so well in the hand - No! No! Do not take away your hand! - do you also know how to read the present in my thoughts?
#ZORAYA.
Yes! You think that I am beautiful and desirable!
#ENRIQUE.
Yes.
#ZORAYA.
But I am a Saracen, a pagan, an outcast! I am one whom you have not the right to love!
#ENRIQUE.
Therefore, you are more desirable!
#ZORAYA.
Don't you find the royal edict which would punish us very severe: I thrown into the oubliette - you sent to the galleys or to the stake?
#ENRIQUE.
Too severe - certainly!
#ZORAYA.
Wasn't Kalem excusable for risking such a cruel fate?
#ENRIQUE.
Yes.
#ZORAYA.
And doesn't she, this unfortunate girl who had not the strength to resist the madness of a similar love, deserve pity?
#ENRIQUE.
The Christian girl!
#ZORAYA.
Ah! I understand why she forgot that she was a Spaniard and a Catholic and became only a woman, simply a woman! - O Nature! the victory was thine! - I envy her for having been given a body to be loved and adored without fear of the torture which menaces this world - and the damnation promised in the next!
#ENRIQUE.
You could be so brave as she?
#ZORAYA.
Ah! certainly, yes! - who could be braver than she! - Can your race produce a Kalem? If so, he is worthy of me! I promise hours of beauty and rapture to him who does not fear the executioner and who will brave the flames at the stake for that which the sun of Africa has set burning in my veins! -
#ENRIQUE.
I shall be that man! Ah! demon! You have intoxicated me! Go away from me!
#ZORAYA.
Adieu, then, my dear lord.
#ENRIQUE.
Adieu! - Yes, adieu! - It is better so! Let that woman go! What creature is that! - her hand burned in mine and her gaze set my brain awhirl!
#RAMIRO.
I have a remedy, my lord! Say a pater quickly and repeat an ave twice to break the charm!
#ARIAS.
I have a better one! - Kill the beast, kill -
#ENRIQUE.
Ah! brute! - Stop! Go! Go! He will not make another attempt. But, I want never again to find you in my path!
#ZORAYA.
"No one," says an Arabic proverb, - "no one in the world today has seen the dawn of tomorrow."
#ENRIQUE.
Let us hasten away from here!
#ZAGUIR.
My aunt! - My aunt!
#AISHA.
What? - Who? - Who is calling me out there?
#ZAGUIR.
I have something important to tell you while the mistress is still here.
#AISHA.
Something serious?
#ZAGUIR.
Yes.
#AISHA.
Then come in and speak quickly. What is it?
#ZAGUIR.
Here! - last night at sunset, I saw sitting and conversing near the path which leads down toward the bridge of San Martino, perhaps a hundred paces or more from this house, two men who were not mere passers - by, or residents of this neighborhood. When the sun rose this morning they were still there, lying behind some fig trees, as if they had passed the night in watching.
#AISHA.
The same! - you are positive?
#ZAGUIR.
Positive! - They are still there. You can see them. Stop! they are standing at present.
#AISHA.
There are three of them!
#ZAGUIR.
Yes! - the one with the grizzled beard was not there. He has just arrived.
#AISHA.
Be careful in returning.
#ZAGUIR.
As they have been there since last evening, it must be that they are lying in wait for some one.
#AISHA.
And whom?
#ZAGUIR.
Perhaps those who come at night and return at dawn.
#AISHA.
What did you say?
#ZAGUIR.
Don't be angry - I am only warning you! Otherwise, I should have said nothing.
#AISHA.
And what do you know, naughty boy?
#ZAGUIR.
Only the worst of things. For example, that he comes down the slope and enters through the orchard gate, which has a key; that he steals along in the shadow of the arcades until he reaches here and that he goes away in a similar manner - on foot as he comes, without entrusting to us his horse.
#AISHA.
Above all you have not mentioned this?
#ZAGUIR.
Indeed to no person! - it is serious!
#AISHA.
He is a Moor, a refugee in the Sierra, a rebel who comes secretly to obtain medicine for his wife who is ill.
#ZAGUIR.
Poor woman! - to consume all the remedies which he has obtained every night during two months!
#AISHA.
You presumptuous boy!
#ZAGUIR.
Do not call me after all kinds of beasts, auntie dear! I don't ask you who this unknown is; he concerns me not. But I know truly that I should be cut in pieces before I would whisper a word. You may tell your mistress that!
#AISHA.
Allah protect me! I shall not tell her that you know.
#ZAGUIR.
As you wish! But whisper to her that they are watching her house.
#AISHA.
And in vain for two days.
#ZAGUIR.
Yes, fortunately! - He did not come last night, or the night before.
#AISHA.
And Zoraya is worried enough! - Go, thou! - Quickly! - I hear her! Scene Two
#ZORAYA.
Who is here with you?
#AISHA.
Zaguir, who has no right to be here! - but he has a good excuse - since yesterday he has seen men prowling round the house.
#ZAGUIR.
They have passed the night under the fig trees.
#AISHA.
On the hillside - look! Ah! They are going away - do you see them?
#ZORAYA.
Yes! - They are going down to the bridge. Follow them!
#ZAGUIR.
As far as the city?
#ZORAYA.
All about the city - and see where they stop.
#ZAGUIR.
Yes, mistress!
#ZORAYA.
Go! Go! Scene Three
#ZORAYA.
Why are those bells ringing on this beautiful morning? - Is there some Christian festival today?
#AISHA.
I know of none.
#ZORAYA.
After waiting for him all night I finally fell asleep. They awakened me and I heard your voice. I believed he was there, and I nearly betrayed myself by calling his name in the boy's presence.
#AISHA.
We must continue hoping that Don Enrique will come tonight.
#ZORAYA.
Two nights without seeing him! - And no word from him - what torture! And those bad dreams! Give me the spotted cards.
#AISHA.
He has probably been warned of the presence of those men.
#ZORAYA.
Last night, yes - But the night before - did Zaguir see them then?
#AISHA.
No.
#ZORAYA.
Then it was something else.
#AISHA.
Perhaps some sudden duty?
#ZORAYA.
Doubtful! He is free! He has no father, no mother, no wife, no children!
#AISHA.
He commands the archers, the blunderbuss men and the cross - bowmen of the city. He may be detained by the service.
#ZORAYA.
For two days?
#AISHA.
He is a member of the Council of Castile, which may have been summoned to Aranjuez where the king is sojourning.
#ZORAYA.
Yes, possibly that is so! - Ah! if only we had some means of secretly writing to each other!
#AISHA.
Allah protect us! That would be a quicker way of losing ourselves! - we are threatened often enough, now!
#ZORAYA.
Ah!
#AISHA.
What?
#ZORAYA.
The Cavalier of the Sword - now I am beginning to detect the cause!
#AISHA.
You see! - I thought until this minute that we should not be left long in security! You had decided to do as the others advised and flee to the coast of Africa to escape the persecutions of the Nazarenes! Then, it was necessary to meet this man! Ah! misery upon us! Ever since the time when he unexpectedly appeared while we were breathing the evening breeze on the hill and when you so foolishly threw yourself into his arms, I have believed that I hear the black wings of Azrael, the angel of death, brushing the roof of our house!
#ZORAYA.
"Our Destiny," says the Prophet, "is suspended from our necks" - If it is written that I shall die for Enrique, then I may likewise wish that it should be in his arms!
#AISHA.
Oh! my daughter, you who were so chaste in your widowhood, why are you enamored with this infidel, this enemy of the true God?
#ZORAYA.
Do you know how and why I love him? I was at his mercy! A word, and he could have thrown me into the dungeons of the Inquisition. It was good of him to save my honor, a price which they always extort from our other women. I will risk anything for him. Those men were there to act as my safeguards during the night. I shall wait for an opportune time and flee to Toledo before evening!
#AISHA.
Rain of Heaven!
#ZORAYA.
But what weakness is ours! He is young, he is generous in his love, his gaze is tender! - when he liberated me, I could dream no more of fleeing.
#AISHA.
Alas!
#ZORAYA.
Ah! "The King!" - A powerful enemy!
#AISHA.
You see! You see!
#ZORAYA.
Sh -
#AISHA.
What?
#ZORAYA.
I believe I hear him.
#AISHA.
No!
#ZORAYA.
Besides, he would not come before night!
#AISHA.
Ah! I hope he will not come this evening - and never again!
#ZORAYA.
Silence! You wretch! Do you want me to die of sorrow?
#AISHA.
That would be better than being buried alive in an oubliette as poor Kalem's accomplice and for a crime similar to his!
#ZORAYA.
I should die first!
#AISHA.
Allah! Allah! listen to her - Where is there a love that has made any one reasonable! All these nights I have been there, I, cowering on my couch waiting and listening and trembling at the least noise. And you can be happy - you - with such a menace hanging over you! - What folly!
#ZORAYA.
You do not understand anything, poor Aisha! To love without peril is beautiful - it is the common kind of love. But the kind that is outlawed, accursed and condemned at its beginning - the love that braves all perils, that defies death, that brings the bitter - sweet of forbidden kisses and maddening embraces during which it is said, "This may be the last!" - that is love! - that is love!
#AISHA.
Ah!
#ZORAYA.
Be silent! This time it is his step. It is he! - Ah! it is he! - It is he!
#ZORAYA.
Finally - Ah! God! - At last! at last! Watch carefully. Scene Four
#ZORAYA.
Your heart beats! - You have been running?
#ENRIQUE.
Yes!
#ZORAYA.
They have pursued you?
#ENRIQUE.
No!
#ZORAYA.
And on the road, did you see no one?
#ENRIQUE.
Not one person! I did not come by way of the bridge, but by the path up the hillside after crossing the river in a boat.
#ZORAYA.
In daylight! What imprudence! And instead of coming last night when I waited so anxiously for you!
#ENRIQUE.
I, too, have had occasion to think of that! - When I left you at dawn the day before yesterday I saw standing at the end of the bridge a man whom I knew had no ordinary reason for being there at that hour. I passed him quickly, covering myself closely with my cloak. He followed me, but I reached my residence after throwing him off my trail in an alley.
#ZORAYA.
He followed you? - You are certain?
#ENRIQUE.
Absolutely certain. It was to baffle him that I forced myself to remain away from you last night and the night before and that I crossed the river in a boat, below the Mirador.
#ZORAYA.
Yes! Oh! it is clear now! It is well for you that they watched only at night.
#ENRIQUE.
And why?
#ZORAYA.
The men watched there behind those fig trees. No! - they have gone away, thinking it useless to watch for you in the daytime.
#ENRIQUE.
How many?
#ZORAYA.
Three. One of them seemed to be the chief.
#ENRIQUE.
Did he have a small, grizzly beard?
#ZORAYA.
Yes.
#ENRIQUE.
It was he who spied upon me. I believe I recognize him! It is Cardenos, one of my father's old soldiers, but now an agent of the Holy Office and a religious bigot!
#ZORAYA.
Then! he has recognized you!
#ENRIQUE.
I doubt it. He would hardly wait one day. He knows only that you are receiving some unknown person in the night. If I were suspected they would prowl round my house and I have seen nothing of them - At least, whatever there is in this, we must be on guard.
#ZORAYA.
Oh, yes!
#ENRIQUE.
And for the sake of prudence give up seeing each other.
#ZORAYA.
For several days - surely.
#ENRIQUE.
Say - some weeks.
#ZORAYA.
Several weeks?
#ENRIQUE.
It is the only way to stop them from spying upon us.
#ZORAYA.
Several weeks! - without seeing each other?
#ENRIQUE.
My Zoraya, you must resign yourself to it.
#ZORAYA.
Resign myself! - Oh, resignation is easy for you! Our love is not the only affair of your life! - But I! - I cannot conquer my loneliness after you depart with the thought that you will return when the first star flowers in the heavens. I shall no more, during the great heat of the day, dream of the night's divine joys, which live again in thoughts of you. I shall feel lonely enough in this house during the coolness of evening when alone I shall hear the soft wind in the branches, the songs of my birds, the purling of my streams - then all that charms me at other times will bring in your absence only sorrow and tears! - Those two nights without you, how long they seemed! - and you speak of weeks! - several weeks, you say. "Where is he? What is he doing? Does he think of me? If he should never return!" Ah! perhaps that is what you wish to say and dare not tell me!
#ENRIQUE.
I!
#ZORAYA.
If you fear those men? - If you wish to see me no more?
#ENRIQUE.
You believe me cowardly! - When I have risked myself in plain day to see you for an instant!
#ZORAYA.
That is true! - But you seem so preoccupied, so troubled -
#ENRIQUE.
Like yourself - by this danger.
#ZORAYA.
Yes, but I am more tender than you - While you - they say that your heart is always far away - far away from me! - Look at me! - I want you to look at me! - Quickly! - without taking time to invent a lie! Your gaze seems to tell me that your love has been stolen from me!
#ENRIQUE.
Ah! My charmer! What a long time until then! - Since the hour when we first met, they have followed me everywhere, those eyes, there - they call to me day and night! - Ramiro had said to me, "Take care, my lord, that the magician does not throw over you some kind of a love charm!"
#ZORAYA.
Ramiro is a silly fellow. There has been neither a magician nor magic. "Life," said my father, "is a combat, where, like flights of arrows, contrary minds strive among themselves for a victory, which finally rests with the fallen." I desired ardently to be loved by you. You did not know how to defend yourself. I have shot my arrow into your heart - in that lies all of my sorcery.
#ENRIQUE.
And why did you so fervently desire me to love you?
#ZORAYA.
First, because of cowardice, my dear lord! - to extort from you my pardon - and later on, if I conquered you, to flee from Toledo!
#ENRIQUE.
Ingrate!
#ZORAYA.
It is bold of me to tell you now - and next - for bravado, malice and revenge!
#ENRIQUE.
Revenge?
#ZORAYA.
Yes, yes, revenge! I wanted to have the pleasure of humiliating in you the Spaniard, the Christian, the conqueror of my people, the enemy of my race, which you declare impure! I wanted to make you renounce your faith like the heroes of that book of love , "Celastine," which you have given me to read - like Calixte, who said to his dear Melibee: "I am no more Christian or pagan. I am Melibee! I believe in no one but Melibee, I adore no one but Melibee!" And, after all! - after all! - I wanted to be loved - for the sake of love! Leaning against you, nearly in your arms, as I am now, with your cheek brushing my cheek - I felt little by little the chaste coldness of my widowhood, which Aisha always glorified, melting like snow in the glowing warmth of our clasped hands, in the burning breath from our hot lips - This fever of love which I believe will never be cured has crept stealthily into my blood. I am like one intoxicated. And when you say to me: "Go away, you are free!" I shall take with me in leaving the hope, the dear hope, that you will come to me very soon on some dark night and demand a ransom for my freedom. Ah! my adored conqueror, you are well avenged! She who would rule is no more than an humble slave at your feet, subdued and tender as a tamed gazelle! What disturbs you?
#ENRIQUE.
Those bells!
#ZORAYA.
Well, they are ringing. What is that to us?
#ENRIQUE.
It means that they are calling me and that it is time for us to part.
#ZORAYA.
So soon? What for? You may remain here until the hour of the siesta when the streets are deserted.
#ENRIQUE.
Oh, no! That is impossible!
#ZORAYA.
Impossible!
#ENRIQUE.
There is to be a great feast in the palace and a great ceremony in the cathedral. All of my men are under arms and I must be at their head. I have scarcely time to return to the city in the same way that I came.
#ZORAYA.
By boat?
#ENRIQUE.
Yes.
#ZORAYA.
And if they should watch for you on the other side of the river?
#ENRIQUE.
Do not dream of that! - Fear nothing!
#ZORAYA.
Oh! I fear everything just now, those men - and for you!
#ENRIQUE.
For me?
#ZORAYA.
Yes! Yes! For either of us, who knows? Last night I had a menacing dream! You entered by that door! I ran to you! You were nothing but a shadow, a vapor which dissolved in my arms!
#ENRIQUE.
What folly! - A dream!
#ZORAYA.
All dreams are not lies! If this one should be true, what then? - Do assure me that you are not going away to forsake me!
#ENRIQUE.
Oh!
#ZORAYA.
For another!
#ENRIQUE.
Hush! Hush!
#ZORAYA.
I would kill you first! - No, no! Do not believe that! Pardon me for saying that - I have suffered so much during these last two days. And such bad omens! When do we meet again?
#ENRIQUE.
God knows when! So soon as we can without danger.
#ZORAYA.
Here?
#ENRIQUE.
Oh, no!
#ZORAYA.
Where then?
#ENRIQUE.
I shall advise you.
#ZORAYA.
And how shall I know?
#ENRIQUE.
That will be arranged! - And, until I come, my dear love, believe nothing, do you hear! - nothing, only in my love for you!
#ZORAYA.
Ah! those bells which always take you from my arms!
#ENRIQUE.
I hope to see you soon!
#ZORAYA.
Watch carefully during your return to the city.
#ENRIQUE.
Yes, yes! Scene Five
#AISHA.
He is gone?
#ZORAYA.
Yes, and let us hope safely. He will not return until many days have passed.
#AISHA.
I have turned away the poor men who came at their usual hour seeking aid from you.
#ZORAYA.
Ah! I am in a fine state of mind to console others!
#AISHA.
I have again given Al Mansour's wife that black liquor which lessens her husband's sufferings. I also gave a purse of gold to Farizade. Poor Saada is here again. She is discouraged. Her sister suffers more than ever from that malady.
#ZORAYA.
Alas! And there is no remedy!
#AISHA.
She begs you to have pity on this unfortunate woman, who asks that death relieve her and who implores you to send her a beverage which will put her into a sweet and everlasting sleep.
#ZORAYA.
Ah! that is the right kind of charity. They give that to a diseased dog, but they condemn human beings whom they love to suffer useless tortures - it is barbarous and stupid!
#AISHA.
Saada will return tomorrow.
#ZORAYA.
Prepare for her bitter almond essence in a covering of pure wax the size of a muscat grain. That will take away the poor girl in less time than one can say: "There is no other God but Allah!" If it is a crime to do this, I am ready to face the charge. Is that all?
#AISHA.
No! - there is another whom I did not want to send away. It is an urgent case, she said. She is anxiously waiting out there.
#ZORAYA.
Do I know her?
#AISHA.
She is an old friend of your mother's - Fatoum.
#ZORAYA.
That wretched woman who was converted! I will not see her!
#AISHA.
She assures me she has been faithful to the Prophet's law.
#ZORAYA.
Well, what does she want?
#AISHA.
She is accompanied by a young girl in a litter.
#ZORAYA.
Ill?
#AISHA.
Probably.
#ZORAYA.
Let Fatoum alone enter. Scene Six
#ZORAYA.
Come forward!
#FATOUM.
May Allah be merciful to you and rain his gifts upon you!
#ZORAYA.
Dare you pronounce His sacred name, you who have renounced the God of your fathers! Take care that He does not hear you!
#FATOUM.
He reads my heart and sees that I am converted only because I do not want to be separated from the child, whom I have brought here.
#ZORAYA.
Your daughter?
#FATOUM.
By birth, no, Zoraya; by affection, ah! certainly, yes! She was ten years old when her mother died, and I have reared her. Spaniard?
#FATOUM.
Yes! You alone can heal her.
#ZORAYA.
That is a case for the Christian physicians.
#FATOUM.
They know little or nothing. I have come to you because your father - on him rested Allah's benediction - was their master in everything and taught you the secrets of his art.
#ZORAYA.
Well, who is she?
#FATOUM.
She consented to come only when I promised not to reveal her name.
#ZORAYA.
Then she may go!
#FATOUM.
Zoraya, have pity! This child's father is a hardened Catholic! - If he knew that I had taken his daughter to a Moor's home, I would be cruelly punished! Out of fondness for me, she keeps it a secret!
#ZORAYA.
She need not know that you have betrayed it.
#FATOUM.
If you promise me -
#ZORAYA.
Yes, I promise! - Who is she?
#FATOUM.
Do√±a Joana, daughter of the Governor of Toledo!
#ZORAYA.
That madman who is hunting our refugees in the Sierra and killing them without pity!
#FATOUM.
Allah, the Most High, rewards the faithful for their sufferings! This child is innocent of her father's cruelties. She is charitable and good, the same as we ourselves. Moreover, she is very pious. She has been out of the convent only four days and will be married today.
#ZORAYA.
Ah! those bells!
#FATOUM.
Her marriage! In order to have her visit you we have taken advantage of a journey to the convent of Mercy on this beautiful morning to ask the benediction of the abbess.
#ZORAYA.
The convent of Mercy! - In it is confined the poor creature who loved Kalem, whom they stoned to death.
#FATOUM.
I do not know.
#ZORAYA.
I, myself, know it - and I shall tell Joana my price for healing her - Let her enter! Scene Seven
#ZORAYA.
Do you not fear, se√±orita, to come into a pagan's home?
#JOANA.
Fatoum has told me that you are charitable. That is the law of the Gospel!
#ZORAYA.
And also that of the Koran - In that our religions are the same! - Seat yourself, my daughter - and tell me your trouble.
#JOANA.
Permit Fatoum to tell it instead of me.
#FATOUM.
It is very strange - She rises in her sleep at night. Without seeing any one, she goes, comes, attends to her ordinary duties and returns to her bed - and during all that time she is in a dream.
#ZORAYA.
And she remembers nothing of it?
#JOANA.
Oh, nothing!
#FATOUM.
This also happened in the convent.
#ZORAYA.
No, no! I prefer to have her tell me about it, herself.
#JOANA.
While in the convent I was frequently seized at night by a desire which led me to walk barefoot through the corridors to the chapel where I lighted the altar candles, prayed and sang a canticle! - and the next day the candles were still burning and I would not believe that I had lighted them. I prayed in vain to God to deliver me from this infirmity. I decided to come to you this morning with Fatoum, who says you are so wise! - For I am to be married today. If my husband sees me get up in the night and promenade like a phantom, he will believe it is a punishment from Heaven! - He will abhor me and I will die of shame!
#ZORAYA.
And during the day when you pray you fall into a dream of ecstasy, do you not - and you make believe that you are no more on this earth?
#JOANA.
Oh, yes - yes! - It is so beautiful! Ah, it is delicious! I see Heaven! - blue - all blue, encircled with a golden light! - I hear the songs of seraphim and archangels! -
#ZORAYA.
And is all beautiful in this delicious slumber into which you are falling?
#JOANA.
Yes! - Yes, beautiful!
#ZORAYA.
As this?
#JOANA.
Yes! - I see - I - I -
#ZORAYA.
Sleep! I want you to!
#FATOUM.
Is she asleep?
#ZORAYA.
It is a sleep like that in which she walks at night.
#FATOUM.
Joana! - Se√±orita! - My child!
#ZORAYA.
She does not hear your voice! - Does she also speak of taking the veil?
#FATOUM.
Ah, God! - It is her only dream. But she is her father's only child. He will not consent to it and is obliging her to marry, which makes her disconsolate.
#ZORAYA.
Does she object to the marriage, or to the man who is to be her husband? Joana! Answer! - Do you feel tenderly for him whom you are to marry?
#JOANA.
I do not love him.
#ZORAYA.
Then, it is a feeling of aversion?
#JOANA.
No! I do not want to marry! - I want to be a nun.
#FATOUM.
Do you hear that! - To me, to her father, to the abbess and to the sisters at Mercy - she has nothing to say but: "I want to be a nun." Do you think that they have encouraged her with that idea in the convent and pictured marriage as something frightful? She is afraid that she will fall into one of those sleep - walking dreams tonight, which would cause a scandal!
#ZORAYA.
Perhaps marriage would cure this malady.
#FATOUM.
Oh! I implore you, Zoraya, to heal her yourself, at once -
#ZORAYA.
In a day, it is impossible! - Can you not come later? I shall surely succeed in curing her by frequently placing her in the present state in which she thinks of nothing, feels nothing and moves only at my command.
#FATOUM.
Is it possible? - It is magic!
#ZORAYA.
No! - It is one of the mysterious laws of Nature that one will can fasten upon another, as mine has upon this child's, and cause it to submit. It is so, Fatoum, for good or bad. If my power over this weaker creature were better established, and not so recent, I could say to her at this moment: "On such a day, at such an hour, you shall sleep this same sleep." And unless she guarded herself while asleep, the least remembrance of that order on the stated day and hour would cause her to sleep unexpectedly in spite of her will, completely enslaved by mine. It is time to awaken her.
#FATOUM.
Not yet, I pray you! - Your will is so powerful. Can you not give her some protection against this disease tonight?
#ZORAYA.
I can attempt it with great hope of success.
#FATOUM.
Oh! do it, Zoraya! - Do it! I shall forever bless you!
#ZORAYA.
Joana! I tell you not to have the least fear that your trouble will return tonight. I have protected you. Do you understand?
#JOANA.
Yes! - Yes!
#FATOUM.
May Allah reward you!
#ZORAYA.
I tell you to awaken.
#JOANA.
Ah! you see! - I have slept again.
#ZORAYA.
No, se√±orita, no! - It is I who made you sleep.
#JOANA.
You can do that!
#ZORAYA.
And can also cure you.
#JOANA.
God has guided you!
#ZORAYA.
Be assured, your malady will not trouble you tonight. All service, of course, is worthy of reward. Therefore, I put a price on your healing.
#JOANA.
Ah! I promise to pay in advance.
#ZORAYA.
You are going to the convent of Mercy?
#JOANA.
Yes, to ask for the blessing of the Holy Abbess.
#ZORAYA.
There is in that convent a Christian maid, who, for having loved Kalem, is confined in a dungeon where she never sees daylight, where she awaits death to deliver her, if she has not yet answered its call.
#JOANA.
Yes, poor girl, I know - but her crime -
#ZORAYA.
You should quickly judge her as being the least guilty. - Implore for that unfortunate girl the mercy of the abbess, who will refuse you nothing on this, your nuptial day - Ask that this miserable creature be brought out of her living tomb, that she be given a cell where she may see a ray of sunlight, and that she be fed with other nourishment than bread and water, which increase the sufferings to which she is condemned. As for this today - Too late, we fear.
#JOANA.
I shall request this as a favor.
#ZORAYA.
You swear that you will?
#JOANA.
Before God!
#ZORAYA.
Those are your marriage bells, dear child. I hope that you will have good health, a happy and contented love and that your youth will be decked with flowers.
#FATOUM.
Allah's benediction upon you! Scene Eight
#ZORAYA.
You followed those men?
#ZAGUIR.
Yes, mistress! - Far into the city, but I lost them in the crowd. All of the world seems to be in the streets, for there is a great f√™te.
#ZORAYA.
Yes, I know - the marriage.
#ZAGUIR.
Of the Governor's daughter and Don Enrique Palacios!
#AISHA.
Ah! unhappy child! My Zoraya! - My poor Zoraya!
#DO√ëA FABIA.
Ah! here is Do√±a Rufina.
#RAMIRO.
Then, Se√±ora, you were not at the cathedral?
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
No! - I have just arrived from Aranjuez, bringing the Queen's gift to the bride - a very costly girdle - buckle.
#CRISTOBOL.
It was a beautiful ceremony, Se√±ora.
#RIOUBOS.
His Eminence Cardinal Xim√©n√®s himself pronounced the nuptial blessing.
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
Naturally! Do√±a Joana is his god - daughter.
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
The city seems to me very gay.
#DO√ëA FABIA.
Compared with it ordinarily.
#RAMIRO.
Yes, all day they have had on the Plaza del Zocodover entertainments by jugglers, buffoons, dancers and monstrous African monkeys!
#DON AMBROSIO.
Yes, at this moment there is singing and dancing in all the public places.
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
Among us, this marriage was a long time postponed.
#DO√ëA FABIA.
Yes - they were betrothed five years.
#RAMIRO.
Pardon me, Se√±oras. When Don Enrique's father - the Lord Palacios - felt that he could not live much longer he decided to select a wife for his son's future marriage. He and the Governor made an arrangement whereby Don Enrique and Do√±a Joana were affianced. As Do√±a Joana was then only ten years old, her father made her go to the convent to grow up!
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
They say she became so devout they believed she would never come out.
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
She did not have a radiant air in the church - the bride!
#RIOUBOS.
No more than did Enrique.
#CRISTOBOL.
There was one radiant person - the Governor!
#VELASCO.
Undoubtedly because his daughter did not take the veil!
#RAMIRO.
What! are you here, Velasco? - I believed you were in Alpujarras, chasing the Moors.
#VELASCO.
I was, in a way; but I have returned for this f√™te.
#DON AMBROSIO.
Have they not yet taught these rebels to be reasonable?
#VELASCO.
They have retreated into inaccessible places where it is impossible to follow them.
#DON AMBROSIO.
They are chasing these pagans too long.
#RAMIRO.
Not now, Don Ambrosio. His Eminence and the Governor are after them with the hand of death.
#DON AMBROSIO.
Then, Ramiro, you will see the advantages of severe treatment. Within six months thousands of Moors will be converted.
#CARDENOS.
That is a mere farce, my Lord Ambrosio! These new Christians are liars - they go to mass, only to laugh when they come away. They themselves confess of avowing only to silly things. When their children are baptized, they wash them quickly to cleanse them of what they call the pollution of the blessed holy oil. Their daughters are married at our altars, dressed as Christians, but when they re√´nter their homes they dress themselves as Moors - and celebrate their nuptials with dances and forbidden Arabian songs, such as the zambra, to the music of tambourines, trumpet - shells, cymbals and other instruments also forbidden!
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
For my part, I can overlook the zambra and the tambourine, but I strongly approve prohibiting Moorish women from dyeing their eyebrows and eyelashes. They are bold enough looking without that.
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
Oh, my! I think the most admirable royal edict is the one which provides the penalty of execution for any intimacy between a Spaniard and a Mooress - for there are truly beautiful girls in the homes of these Africans, and you are not too little inclined, my lords, to perceive them.
#RIOUBOS.
And for my part, Se√±ora, I strongly approve of the edict which punishes with solitary confinement in a dungeon any Spanish woman who loves one of these blacks to whose beauty you are not always indifferent.
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
Oh! but that is all the more excusable.
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
Ah, my dear, what did you say then?
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
You see! - Yes! - The circumstances are very different.
#RAMIRO.
Ah! see, I beg of you, Se√±ora - see the difference!
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
What! - If the intrigue has results, is it not so?
#ALL.
Yes! child!
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
In the first case, the mother being Moorish the child is a little Mussulman - in the second case, where the mother is Spanish, it is a little Christian! - Dear angel! - And there are never too many of those!
#ALL.
Oh! very good! Very ingenious! Charming!
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
The banquet is ended.
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
They are going to drink to the healths of the newly married ones! Scene Two
#ZORAYA.
Fatoum!
#FATOUM.
Ah! Zoraya!
#ZORAYA.
Yes! - I concluded that results would be surer if I repeated the mesmeric treatment which I gave Joana this morning.
#FATOUM.
Oh! I am grateful to you! You have arrived at an opportune time! It is the end of the banquet. They are now offering congratulations. Joana is about to enter her apartment. You will pass for one of the new servant women whom I have chosen!
#ZORAYA.
Ah! it is there?
#FATOUM.
Yes, where the windows are lighted.
#ZORAYA.
And he! - Where is he?
#FATOUM.
He?
#ZORAYA.
The husband!
#FATOUM.
In the large chamber waiting for the poor child to be put to bed. Scene Three
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
Joy and health, Se√±ora!
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
Be happy, Do√±a Joana!
#DO√ëA SERAFINA.
Everlasting happiness, Se√±ora!
#THE CAVALIERS.
Our best wishes, Se√±ora!
#DO√ëA FABIA.
She is pale, the dear!
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
With emotion!
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
They create such false ideas about a moment like that!
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
And exaggerate them so!
#CLEOFAS.
Whew! - it is warm in that chamber!
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
Especially after they have emptied all the flagons!
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
Cleofas would have done well had he given the bride some comforting elixir.
#CLEOFAS.
Oh, yes! Those nuns have pictured marriage to her as something horrible!
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
The poor little child has had no one to give her a mother's care.
#RAMIRO.
Oh, yes! - there is Fatoum, the convert, who has brought her up.
#DON AMBROSIO.
And, speaking of converts, Master Cleofas, the Very Holy Inquisition, of which you are the physician, seems to me to be enjoying a very long moment of leisure.
#CLEOFAS.
Oh, oh! the Tribunal is not out of work. And, after a short time, I believe that I may promise these ladies a very jolly bonfire.
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
Of heretics?
#CLEOFAS.
Of heretics. Moors, Jews, renegades and backsliders - a sample of each.
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
And of sorcerers?
#CLEOFAS.
Of sorcerers and sorceresses, also - but fewer in number than is desirable.
#CARDENOS.
Master Cleofas, I should like to say two words to you in that regard.
#CLEOFAS.
At Your Grace's disposition!
#CARDENOS.
You have not forgotten an Arabian physician named Abou - Abassa? physician! - said to be a charlatan, who resided on the left bank of the river in a house on the hillside, where his daughter now lives.
#CARDENOS.
Zoraya!
#CLEOFAS.
Oh, yes! I knew him! - I was enraged to see Bishop Talavera honor and protect a Moor, who had, they say, healed a sprain with friction - in reality, Cardenos, by means of mystic signs and magic incantations.
#CARDENOS.
Then you are sure that man was - necromancer! And worse than that! Listen and judge, friend Cardenos! One day I was riding my mule on the road leading to the bridge of San Martino. They called to me to examine a child which had been taken from the river apparently dead. "Have you," I asked, dismounting, "suspended it by the feet in order to expel the water from the body? 'Yes, lord' - And that has not resulted in resuscitation? - 'No, lord' - Then, there is nothing more to do. Good evening!" - And I passed on - The child was dead, was it not?
#CARDENOS AND THE YOUNG MEN.
Yes!
#CLEOFAS.
Eight days later I re - passed the same place and whom do you think I saw playing on the rocks with a gang of ragamuffins? - Who? - My drowned child!
#ALL.
Oh!
#CLEOFAS.
Astounded, I questioned the child and found that after I left they had recourse to that quack, Abou - Abassa, who had breathed in the child's mouth, made strange motions with its arms and succeeded in reanimating him after an hour and one half! - The magic was shown in the breathing and gestures and in this diabolical resurrection, which was an ignoble parody on the miracles in the Scriptures!
#CARDENOS.
It is the same evidence.
#CLEOFAS.
The wretch is dead! - But, his daughter, who has been devoted to the works of the devil since her birth, interferes just as he did with the treatment of my patients: even with my own governor, P√©tronille, whom I attended after fainting spells. I gave him hartshorn, which, you know, is the best cure for such illnesses, as is also the oil of ants and the salt of wood - lice - what is it they call this Olivera - whom they have given me for a colleague in the Tribunal?
#CARDENOS.
The surgeon?
#CLEOFAS.
Yes, this ignoramus goes so far as to make sport of the inclusion of pearls and precious stones in our remedies; as if it were not proved every day that sapphires are the principal cures for ulcers, and emeralds infallible preventatives of pests!
#CARDENOS.
Assuredly!
#CLEOFAS.
Between us, this Olivera is to be watched, Cardenos - I am sure he believes more in the devil and witches than he does in medicine.
#CARDENOS.
What is your reason?
#CLEOFAS.
Oh! nothing - He smells of it and I advise you to watch him - I said then - where was I?
#CARDENOS.
You spoke of P√©tronille.
#CLEOFAS.
Ah! yes, my governor! Do you believe that this wretch would, without consulting me, let himself be conducted to Zoraya's home? Seeing him lively and apparently cured, I said: "Ha, my hartshorn powders?" - "No such thing!" he replied. "It was not your powders - it was a remedy which the Moorish woman gave me! - Swindler! pick up your packets and leave at once." - It is better for me to work myself to death giving my own remedies than to deceive patients with the kinds which she uses!
#CARDENOS.
Certainly! - if it is magic -
#CLEOFAS.
It is magic, Cardenos, do not doubt it. This sorceress is competing with me dishonestly. This is not all - she takes no pay from the poor for her attention or her medicines. And will you believe me when I tell you that she sends them away with their hands full of gold? - We shall have to struggle now! - Our practise is being ruined.
#CARDENOS.
Your Honor may be reassured - they have an eye on her.
#THE AGENT.
Lord Cardenos, His Eminence prays you to come without delay, for urgent business.
#CARDENOS.
I shall come at once! - This, Master Cleofas, may have something to do with your Mooress.
#CLEOFAS.
Good! Good! Scene Four RUFINA, DO√ëA FABIA AND DO√ëA SYRENA. Good night, my lord.
#PADILLA.
The only thing which marred this feast, Don Enrique, was the absence of your father, whom we needed.
#ENRIQUE.
It was the fulfillment of his dearest wish and I thank Your Excellency.
#PADILLA.
I have bestowed upon you, my child, all of the esteem and affection which I had for the dear companion - in - arms of my youth. I have placed in your care what is dearest to me in this world with the assurance that you will be a tender husband to my adored daughter.
#ENRIQUE.
And to you, my lord a most respectful son.
#PADILLA.
Then, gentlemen, it is time for such graybeards as we to leave this impatient youth. - Until tomorrow, my child!
#ENRIQUE.
Until tomorrow, my father! Scene Five
#ENRIQUE.
Who are you, woman, and why do you not leave with the others? Do you not hear me? - Who are you?
#ZORAYA.
I am the sorrow and you are the traitor!
#ENRIQUE.
Zoraya!
#ZORAYA.
You have forgotten, have you not, to invite me to this feast?
#ENRIQUE.
You! here - in this house!
#ZORAYA.
In your wife's home, yes.
#ENRIQUE.
To tell her -
#ZORAYA.
Ah! you wretch! Your only thought is for her. My despair does not move you so much as the fear that she will not accept the lover of a Saracen!
#ENRIQUE.
Lower! Speak lower! I beg of you!
#ZORAYA.
You are not so innocent as you were on the steps of the church -
#ENRIQUE.
You were there!
#ZORAYA.
It was to the entire city that I failed to cry: "That Christian is my lover!" But that cry would have sent you to the King's galleys. My heart failed me and coward that I am, I was ready to flee, weeping.
#ENRIQUE.
Do not condemn me without hearing me!
#ZORAYA.
Oh, God! - you, you, who this morning - Oh, God! God! Is it possible?
#ENRIQUE.
My Zoraya, my mistake, mine alone for not telling you the first day -
#ZORAYA.
Do you love this girl?
#ENRIQUE.
Ah! certainly, no! - I was forced -
#ZORAYA.
You betrayed me for her?
#ENRIQUE.
It is she whom I have betrayed for you! - I have known you only three months. She and I were betrothed years ago! - But I was so sure she would take the veil and remain in the convent. After this marriage was arranged contrary to her wish and my own, I found so many pretexts for postponing it that further delay would have roused suspicion. They would have searched for the reason and found it, perhaps. Then! - then, during the last two days when I did not see you, I resolved to confess all to you. - This morning I attempted to tell you - But I saw you so roused over a single thought of another woman that I did not have the courage to cause a scene and withstand your reproaches, which would have been needless, as I could not let your tears cause me to forget my solemn obligations as a Christian, my word as a gentleman and my most sacred duties.
#ZORAYA.
Yes! All of your duties are sacred except those towards me! - and you hope, do you not, that I have considered them as fulfilled?
#ENRIQUE.
Yes!
#ZORAYA.
That I shall receive your return to me with open arms?
#ENRIQUE.
That you will pardon me, at least, and join me in returning faithfully to our love.
#ZORAYA.
Oh, indeed! - More in love than ever! The contrast of the Moor and the Spaniard! A variety of pleasures always prevents one's taste from becoming stale!
#ENRIQUE.
But I do not love this child! - I do not love her!
#ZORAYA.
Yes, this is the cry of the brutal, egotistical male! - You do not love her! - But it is to her that you sacrifice me. - You do not love her, but I stop you on the threshold of her room! - A few paces from her bed! - I should scorn myself as a woman of the street if I could discover in my mind a single thought which is not for you! - I should curse my eyes if they gazed for an instant on any other face but yours! - Where could I wash away the stain if any other lips than yours touched mine? - And it appears natural for you to be at the same time the husband of your wife and the lover of your mistress - to run from one to the other and to bring to me smiling the dessert of your nuptial night! - And it is you who say to me: "Believe nothing, nothing in the world but my love for you!" Ah, coward! - coward! liar! - Here is your love! - Here it is!
#ENRIQUE.
My dear Zoraya!
#ZORAYA.
Oh, leave me! Wretch! Leave me! I hate you!
#ENRIQUE.
Lower! Speak lower! - I beg of you! - If they should hear us!
#ZORAYA.
Oh! If only they would hear! - Let them come! and let them kill me! - It is all the same to me if it happens now!
#ENRIQUE.
Be quiet! - There is some one there!
#THE WATCHMAN.
Ave, Maria! -
#ENRIQUE.
It is the watchman.
#THE WATCHMAN.
It is the sixth hour! - I am the watchman!
#ENRIQUE.
He has passed! But here, these windows! - the valets! - And Joana!
#ZORAYA.
Your wife! - It is not she who can hear us!
#ENRIQUE.
What did you say?
#ZORAYA.
Go, and find out for yourself.
#THE WATCHMAN.
Ave, Maria!
#ENRIQUE.
Joana! Joana!
#THE WATCHMAN.
It is the sixth hour.
#ENRIQUE.
Joana!
#THE WATCHMAN.
I am the watchman!
#ENRIQUE.
Ah, wretch! - It is you who did it?
#ZORAYA.
Yes! It is I!
#ENRIQUE.
You have killed her?
#ZORAYA.
Poor child! - She is asleep!
#ENRIQUE.
I spoke to her - she heard nothing. I raised her - she fell back cold.
#ZORAYA.
She is asleep, I tell you.
#ENRIQUE.
What power do you possess which will produce a sleep like death?
#ZORAYA.
What does it matter so long as this is only the appearance of death! - She will sleep until the hour which I have set for her to awaken. - And this is your punishment: when she awakens she will be deaf to your voice, also distant and cold in your arms! - You will then understand that your true wife was not this angelic creature who wanted no other spouse than God, but the Moor, who gave you more love in a single clasp of her hand than this nun in the entire abandonment of her nerveless body, revolting at your caresses.
#ENRIQUE.
What does it matter to me? - I shall not dispute with that virgin over her celestial spouse. And I shall be free for you, for you alone, without causing her grief, or me remorse.
#ZORAYA.
I do not care to put you to the test!
#ENRIQUE.
You intend to leave?
#ZORAYA.
Yes.
#ENRIQUE.
Alone - tonight?
#ZORAYA.
I intend to leave Toledo before dawn.
#ENRIQUE.
To leave Toledo?
#ZORAYA.
Ah! God, yes! - this accursed city which has nothing but sorrow and peril for me!
#ENRIQUE.
What! It is absurd - you shall not go!
#ZORAYA.
You would prefer to deliver me to the Inquisition?
#ENRIQUE.
Ah! How unworthy!
#ZORAYA.
They are seeking for me - tonight, perhaps.
#ENRIQUE.
And where are you going, poor child?
#ZORAYA.
Into the Sierra, by paths known only to us, to the homes of the rebels. Later I shall go to Africa and find refuge in my father's brother's home in Tangier.
#ENRIQUE.
And there will be between us the mountains, the rivers and the sea! - And shall we always be apart, the one from the other?
#ZORAYA.
You are the one who wishes it.
#ENRIQUE.
No, I do not wish it - Give up your home! - It is wise - But Toledo! - I know where I can find a refuge for you, which is free from danger.
#ZORAYA.
For instance, your wife's home!
#ENRIQUE.
Ah! always she!
#ZORAYA.
Yes! always she between us! - Always, always she!
#ENRIQUE.
Neither she nor any person - No one in this world!
#ZORAYA.
Do you say so truly?
#ENRIQUE.
Before God!
#ZORAYA.
You love so much as that?
#ENRIQUE.
Yes!
#ZORAYA.
You will sacrifice all for me! -
#ENRIQUE.
Yes!
#ZORAYA.
Then! Come with me?
#ENRIQUE.
To the home of your kindred?
#ZORAYA.
They will receive you as a brother!
#ENRIQUE.
Me? A Spaniard - an enemy?
#ZORAYA.
As my lover!
#ENRIQUE.
With the rebels, me, a soldier? - Disclaim my king? tyrant!
#ENRIQUE.
My God?
#ZORAYA.
He is for every one.
#ENRIQUE.
And an exile - forever an exile from my country?
#ZORAYA.
My own country is the country where we may love.
#ENRIQUE.
No, do not say so! It is a crime to listen to your words.
#ZORAYA.
My adored Enrique!
#ENRIQUE.
Deserter! renegade! perjurer. Traitor to all my duties for all time! Never! even for you! Never! Never!
#ZORAYA.
Stay then, coward, who has caused me to lose everything!
#ENRIQUE.
Zoraya!
#ZORAYA.
Go - return to your wife! Scene Six
#ZORAYA.
Cardenos!
#ENRIQUE.
Cardenos here! - at this hour!
#CARDENOS.
I am not more surprised to see you myself, Don Enrique, than to find you in such company.
#ENRIQUE.
Is that advice, or a threat?
#CARDENOS.
Neither one nor the other! - I am here by order of the Holy - Office to arrest this woman who practises sorcery.
#ZORAYA.
That is false!
#ENRIQUE.
Foolishness!
#CARDENOS.
You seem to have forgotten the punishment in store for a crime like yours.
#ENRIQUE.
You are presumptuous!
#CARDENOS.
His Eminence, knowing that this woman was seen to enter this house without coming out, entrusted me with the task of watching at this door to arrest her without noise when she came out and at the same time unknown to you.
#ENRIQUE.
His Eminence had foreseen that I would not let you do it!
#CARDENOS.
He has only foreseen your submission and confession for the care which he has taken - out of regard for your name, your rank, and your young wife, his pupil - to separate your case from that of your accomplice, and inflict upon you only a penance which will reconcile you with the Church!
#ZORAYA.
Ah! if that is so, good - I will go with you!
#ENRIQUE.
Are you foolish? Go tell Xim√©n√®s that he has no right to my confession unless he provides the same indulgence for her whom he calls my accomplice.
#CARDENOS.
You shall say it to him yourself, Se√±or Enrique. Come, you! - Follow me!
#ENRIQUE.
By God! This is insolence!
#ZORAYA.
Enrique!
#ENRIQUE.
Silence! And you - get out of here!
#CARDENOS.
Be careful that you do not render indulgence for yourself impossible!
#ENRIQUE.
That is my own affair!
#CARDENOS.
And you would lose it for nothing!
#ZORAYA.
He has a reason! - Let me go!
#ENRIQUE.
Are you not going?
#CARDENOS.
I beg of you, my lord, to listen to the prayer of a man as old as your father, and who has known you since you were a child.
#ENRIQUE.
During that time you should have learned a better profession than the one you are now engaged in.
#CARDENOS.
He would say the same to you.
#ENRIQUE.
He can blaspheme me if I have the infamy to deliver up the woman whom I love. - And I would deserve the insults of all the scullions of the city!
#ZORAYA.
No! No! Do not listen to him. Take me away.
#ENRIQUE.
Scoundrel! Do not touch this woman!
#CARDENOS.
Do you refuse to let her go?
#ENRIQUE.
I dare to say yes.
#CARDENOS.
If there is a disturbance and a scandal it will be only because you have wanted it!
#ENRIQUE.
Where are you going?
#CARDENOS.
Where I please.
#ENRIQUE.
To bring your men?
#CARDENOS.
You compel me to do so.
#ENRIQUE.
You shall not go! - You shall not call them!
#ZORAYA.
Ah! My God!
#CARDENOS.
Then, there are our special valets who shall help me!
#ENRIQUE.
You venturesome ruffian!
#CARDENOS.
Let me go!
#ENRIQUE.
No!
#CARDENOS.
I shall call my men!
#ENRIQUE.
I defy you to do so!
#CARDENOS.
Help!
#ENRIQUE.
Silence!
#CARDENOS.
Help!
#ENRIQUE.
Silence! Silence!
#CARDENOS.
Help!
#ENRIQUE.
You will be silent, demon!
#ZORAYA.
Ah! unfortunate man! What have you done?
#ENRIQUE.
What? - What have I done to him?
#ZORAYA.
He is dead!
#ENRIQUE.
No!
#ZORAYA.
See! He is dead, I tell you! See! He is dead! He is dead!
#ENRIQUE.
Is it possible!
#ZORAYA.
Be quiet!
#RAMIRO.
Hello! Some one called! - Who is there? Is that you, Gin√®s?
#GIN√àS.
Yes, master!
#RAMIRO.
Did you hear that disturbance - those shouts?
#GIN√àS.
Yes! - They were calls for aid!
#RAMIRO.
Was it in this house?
#GIN√àS.
More likely in the street - those belated drunkards!
#RAMIRO.
Dress yourself, awaken Padillo. - We shall see!
#ZORAYA.
They have gone!
#ENRIQUE.
Except you, no one has seen me and none can accuse me!
#ZORAYA.
That is folly! - A man comes to arrest me - who should kill him but you?
#ENRIQUE.
It is true! - Ah! God, God! Assassin! - Me! me!
#ZORAYA.
Do not become excited or lament. What is done is done. We shall not await them, shall we?
#ENRIQUE.
Go then!
#ZORAYA.
Alone?
#ENRIQUE.
Go, Zoraya.
#ZORAYA.
Without you - No!
#ENRIQUE.
Merciful Heaven! What course shall we take?
#ZORAYA.
Flight!
#ENRIQUE.
And where shall we fly to?
#ZORAYA.
Where I told you!
#ENRIQUE.
It is dishonorable and my life will be lost!
#ZORAYA.
Remain! Then you will lose it more quickly! - Come! Come on! - Come! - Come! The musicians!
#ENRIQUE.
In the street?
#ZORAYA.
If they have come to give the morning serenade, it is for us.
#A MUSICIAN.
Shall we serenade Don Enrique Palacios?
#ANOTHER.
Simpleton! - He cares much for your music at this moment!
#ANOTHER.
Besides, they did not pay us for serenading him!
#THE OTHER.
Come, then! Laggards! - Not there, but in the other street.
#ALL.
Yes! Coming, coming!
#ZORAYA.
They are going farther away. - They have gone round the corner of the house. Oh! Love is the conqueror Whose flames devour me! Open thy heart, Thy lover implores thee! The street is clear. Come quickly! Good God! what are you searching for?
#ENRIQUE.
His dagger, which he dropped.
#ZORAYA.
Ah! yes, yes! - Should they arrest us, you will kill me!
#ENRIQUE.
Yes, and myself afterward!
#ZORAYA.
Their voices! Quickly, come quickly!
#ALL THE THREE.
Cardenos!
#CLEOFAS.
I have slept so well after that excellent feast! Nothing is more injurious to the health than being startlingly awakened during one's first sleep.
#ALBORNOS.
What business is so urgent that we must convene before daybreak?
#CLEOFAS.
You Excellencies should have the goodness to tell us.
#CALABAZAS.
We know no more about it than you.
#IBARRA.
We were greatly surprised at the morning visit of the agent of the Tribunal. We are here at the special request of His Eminence to consider a pressing and serious matter.
#ALBORNOS.
Then you have no idea what it is?
#IBARRA AND CALABAZAS.
None.
#CLEOFAS.
And you, my reverend father?
#MOLINA.
No more than you.
#CALABAZAS.
In any case, I think, without question, that the two women whom we again examined after vespers are guilty of sorcery.
#MOLINA.
Moreover, they confessed.
#IBARRA.
That will simplify the task.
#CLEOFAS.
Is it not the opinion of my excellent colleague. Master Oliveira, that there is not sufficient evidence to condemn them?
#OLIVEIRA.
Since my very venerable colleague has obliged me to give my humble opinion, I must confess that one of the two women, the one called Afrida, appears to me to be an old fool, who after having been forced to listen to sorcery and witchcraft, is possessed with the idea that she is on intimate terms with a demon. She accepts her dreams and nightmares as realities and every woman and girl whom she knows she accuses of having attended a witches' revel. A dozen of these unfortunates have been placed in our dungeons since yesterday. If we listened to that vixen all of the women of Toledo would be sorceresses - especially the young ones!
#CALABAZAS.
Has she not a reason for accusing them if she has seen them at these revels?
#OLIVEIRA.
For her to have seen them, my father, it would have been necessary for her to have gone there herself.
#IBARRA.
She partook in them.
#MOLINA.
And you doubt that?
#OLIVEIRA.
For a good reason! - As she pretended, in spite of the confining walls of her dungeons, to be able to attend the revels again, I determined to see for myself whether she was telling the truth. Three times during the night I found her sleeping deeply on the pallet in her cell in the prison. When she awoke she told me all that she thought she had seen at the home of the devil!
#ALBORNOS.
If you were more experienced in these matters. Master Oliveira, you would know that these sorceresses can leave their bodies lying in their beds and at the same time attend these Satanic love - feasts.
#CLEOFAS.
And that in the same body the devil can place one of his imps, who will not change its appearance.
#CALABAZAS.
And the other sorceress? - This young peasant woman from Torrijos, whom they found in a wood at dawn stretched naked on ground which had been trampled by infernal dances and which was still littered with the remains of an infernal feast and firebrands and ashes - Master Oliveira, do you believe she too is innocent?
#OLIVEIRA.
I have good cause to believe it! - She is a poor girl from the fields who was seduced by her master, who abandoned her and her child and left them in deep misery. A passing vagrant invited her to go to a witches' meeting where Satan would provide her with plenty of gold. He took her to a nocturnal gathering of beggars and ragamuffins, who with the aid of some rogue put her into a sleep, from which she awakened at dawn with the vague memory of horrible debauchery! - An orgie! Yes! But witches' meeting? - Who will prove it? -
#CLEOFAS.
The sigillum or stigma Diaboli, Master Oliveira! That mark which the devil makes with his pitchfork, or the horny spots on the bodies of his creatures, such as we have found, you and I, in two places on this girl's skin. Our needles penetrated them without drawing blood and they were not felt.
#OLIVEIRA.
I found three on the body of the Superior of the Incarnation, who afterward died in unquestioned sainthood!
#CALABAZAS.
This surgeon is too much of a reasoner!
#CLEOFAS.
You need say nothing to me about it! - If they listened to him they would burn no one! Scene Two
#THE USHER.
His Excellency, the Governor.
#PADILLA.
His Eminence is not here?
#ALBORNOS.
Not yet, Lord Padilla.
#PADILLA.
I want to see him! - I must speak to him!
#CALABAZAS.
Be pleased to wait for him with us.
#PADILLA.
Yes! yes! Ah! my father, do you believe it! gentleman, a soldier! my son -
#MOLINA.
Some misfortune has befallen His Excellency?
#D'AGUILAR.
Your lordships, then, do not know why you are called to meet at this hour?
#ALL.
No! - Why? What is it? - We know nothing about it!
#D'AGUILAR.
Lord Palacios has been arrested.
#ALL.
Arrested!
#CALABAZAS.
Don Enrique?
#D'AGUILAR.
For assassinating Cardenos! -
#ALL.
Good God! - Is it possible! Our Agent!
#D'AGUILAR.
With the assistance of a woman! - Both were fleeing towards the river when stopped by pedestrians, who heard shouts in the distance. The fugitives were flung to the earth at the entrance of an alley. The woman cried to Don Enrique desperately and in vain: "Kill me! Kill me!" Mooress?
#D'AGUILAR.
Yes.
#CLEOFAS.
It is Zoraya!
#THE USHER.
His Eminence! Scene Three
#XIM√âN√àS.
God has summoned you to a cruel ordeal, Padilla! I had given to Cardenos orders with the object of sparing you. Who had foreseen this at the hour when I blessed the young couple in the cathedral - your unfortunate daughter?
#PADILLA.
She has heard nothing about it. I found her in a deep sleep and I ordered them not to awaken her. I would always be too soon to tell her the truth. May God will that at the same time she shall learn that Don Enrique is innocent of the crime with which he is accused!
#XIM√âN√àS.
No! - He confesses it!
#PADILLA.
The assassination?
#XIM√âN√àS.
Yes! - The assassination, his infamous relation with the Saracen woman and his plan of fleeing to African soil.
#PADILLA.
The more monstrous the crime the stronger is the proof that he has lost his reason!
#XIM√âN√àS.
It is for this, Governor, that I have called this hasty convocation of the Tribunal before the scandal bursts forth - Toledo must not know at its awakening that a member of the Council of Castile, one honored with royal favor, commander of the archers and crossbowmen of the city, son of a long line of Christians, brave soldier and your son - in - law, has committed such crimes without knowing that he had a right to some explanation - being under the spell of this woman's sorcery - And that is what all say! Where is Gil Andr√®s?
#OLIVEIRA.
Here, Eminence!
#XIM√âN√àS.
Has she spoken some word of confession?
#GIL ANDR√àS.
None, Eminence. She has said nothing since she asked about Don Enrique. She appeared to care less about her own delivery than about his.
#XIM√âN√àS.
Is she there?
#GIL ANDR√àS.
Yes, Your Eminence.
#XIM√âN√àS.
Go get her! Your Excellency may sit down. The Tribunal authorizes you to assist in questioning. My brothers, never more than at this hour had we a better reason for addressing God with our usual prayer: Dominie, auxilium, in reperienda veritate, sit nobis. Spiritus Sanctus, ad majorem Fidei gloriam.
#ALL.
Amen!
#XIM√âN√àS.
Exaudi nos, Domini.
#ALL.
Amen!
#XIM√âN√àS.
Bring in the Mooress! Scene Four
#XIM√âN√àS.
Do you wish to speak, Master Cleofas?
#CLEOFAS.
With the permission of Your Eminence, before the accused is questioned, I should like to inform the Tribunal that, contrary to the royal edict, she has persisted in continuing the damnable Arabian custom of painting her eyelashes, eyelids and eyebrows; and I will wager that her heels and toenails are gilded.
#XIM√âN√àS.
Is this true?
#ZORAYA.
Yes, Your Eminence.
#XIM√âN√àS.
Let that pass - And, Rain of Heaven, if she has not greater crimes to expiate! Your name?
#ZORAYA.
Zoraya, daughter of the scholar and physician, Abou - Abassa.
#XIM√âN√àS.
Your father, it appears, was a genuine necromancer?
#ZORAYA.
That is the calumnious assertion of ignoramuses, who interpret as diabolical everything which surpasses their own knowledge.
#XIM√âN√àS.
He left you the knowledge of his art of healing?
#ZORAYA.
Yes, Your Eminence.
#XIM√âN√àS.
Without magic?
#ZORAYA.
Yes, without magic.
#XIM√âN√àS.
You are accused of improper relations with Don Enrique Palacios. The charge is not doubted, as your accomplice has confessed.
#ZORAYA.
Neither do I deny it.
#XIM√âN√àS.
You know, of course, that for you awaits the dungeon and for him the galleys!
#ZORAYA.
Love is stronger than fear!
#XIM√âN√àS.
You may speak, Governor.
#PADILLA.
Ramiro has told me about the first meeting of Don Enrique and this woman, who had stolen the body of Kalem. He came to me and confessed something which he had always kept secret out of affection for his master - that Don Enrique was compelled to release this wretch while visibly fascinated by her looks and magic words, which she used to obtain her liberty.
#XIM√âN√àS.
Do you hear that?
#ZORAYA.
I had recourse to nothing but the usual attractions of all women.
#XIM√âN√àS.
And you have not made him mad with love for you with the use of incantations, philters, evil methods?
#ZORAYA.
With no other philter than my ardent love for him!
#XIM√âN√àS.
Briefly, you deny being a sorceress?
#ZORAYA.
If I were one, I should be far from here!
#XIM√âN√àS.
The Evil One enjoys abandoning his followers during their time of peril. And you are suspected of sorcery for good reasons, being the daughter of a man accused of magic and an unconverted Mussulman - Why have you not renounced Mahomet for Christ?
#ZORAYA.
I saw that the Christians were no better than we.
#XIM√âN√àS.
And, naturally, you deny being at a witches' revel?
#ZORAYA.
Ah! certainly, yes, I deny it! Yes, I deny it!
#XIM√âN√àS.
You are not, then, afraid to have it proved to you - you defend yourself with such warmth?
#ZORAYA.
How can I prove my innocence if my denials are taken as confessions?
#XIM√âN√àS.
We shall see what they are worth. Bring in the two women who are there. You may be seated. Scene Five
#XIM√âN√àS.
Come forward! Write: "Afrida." You confessed the other day - What is this? - Are you mocking us?
#GIL ANDR√àS.
With your permission. Your Eminence, she is thus frequently seen holding her ear to listen to her favorite demon, whom she calls Verdelet.
#XIM√âN√àS.
That demon there is very bold to face us in our home! Hello there! woman, dismiss this bad gallant and answer this Tribunal, which was not called for his attendance.
#AFRIDA.
Patience! - patience! - There he goes!
#XIM√âN√àS.
What are you laughing at, old ribald?
#AFRIDA.
At the face he made when he went out.
#XIM√âN√àS.
Take care that you are not seated on a wooden horse! Enough of those mummeries. You confessed the other day of practising evil acts upon your neighbors, causing their children and fowls to die, of setting fire to their roofs and sending hail upon their fields.
#AFRIDA.
To avenge myself upon those who were happier than I.
#XIM√âN√àS.
You confessed to being at a nocturnal revelry attended by witches, did you not?
#AFRIDA.
Oh! I have often been more than thirty times.
#XIM√âN√àS.
By what power do you go?
#AFRIDA.
The black sheep or the large red cat, which come to take me from my bed while I sleep - And then. Gee - up! gee - up! across the fields, accompanied by the sound of bells to where they are assembling. There the great devil Astaroth, on seeing me, says: "Ah! here is my little Afrida! Come, mignon, come here that I may pet you!" For she loves me above all and always says: "Go, fear nothing, my little chicken. If they want to burn you, I shall drag away the wood before all the world. And we shall laugh then. Oh! we shall laugh well! Ah! how we shall laugh then!"
#XIM√âN√àS.
Yes, yes! we laugh! That is admitted! - And those whom you accuse of having been at the revel with you - will Astaroth also save them from the fire?
#AFRIDA.
Oh! those who have treated me like an old fool, those who are young and togged out, I shall surely let them burn on your fire, while Astaroth carries me away!
#XIM√âN√àS.
Turn your eyes a little to that side and look at that woman. Yes, she there! - Does she not remind you of something?
#AFRIDA.
Yes! - I have seen that nose there somewhere! Raise your eyes a little, beautiful! What makes you dislike to see me - Yes! yes! I remember her! - Here is one of them! -
#XIM√âN√àS.
One of whom?
#AFRIDA.
One of those from below, there! - One of those who danced at the witches' revel!
#ZORAYA.
Me? Me?
#AFRIDA.
Yes, you! Do not now become a straight - laced prude; I have seen you as clearly as I see you now - carousing with us! -
#ZORAYA.
But, you lie, you wretch! - You lie! - Do not believe such execrable foolishness!
#AFRIDA.
Foolishness! - Ah! you treat me as a fool, also! - Yes, my lords, yes, I have seen her, I tell you; I have seen her enraptured in the arms of a goat - headed devil!
#ZORAYA.
Oh! it is false! It is false!
#AFRIDA.
Go! go! You were given by the Evil One to be rich and beautiful! You will be roasted, my girl! Roasted, those beautiful eyes so fiery! - roasted your skin so white, which all the men want to cling to - roasted all that, roasted, roasted! Scene Six
#ZORAYA.
Ah! the horrible old woman! -
#XIM√âN√àS.
An insult is not a reply! - She affirms; you deny. The accusation stands. And the Tribunal judges. Bring the other. You, also, you have confessed it! - You have gone to the witches' revels?
#MANUELA.
Only once, Your Eminence - Only once! Mercy!
#XIM√âN√àS.
That is once too often!
#MANUELA.
I was so unfortunate! - My employer drove me from his home when he discovered that I was to become a mother - for he was the father of the child. I was too weak to work in the fields and no one would keep me because my poor baby, which I nourished with my thin milk, was so hungry that It cried all of the time! - Ah! I have never known anything but shame and misery! - I have prayed fervently to God - He has done nothing for me - Then - Ah! my benevolent lords! - Have pity! - I have harmed no one! - And I am punished enough now!
#XIM√âN√àS.
What else?
#MANUELA.
Then - a gypsy woman, who saw me on my knees before a cross on the road where I had been begging, said to me: "You are foolish enough to address that object, which helps only the happy ones of this world! Charity for the poor comes only from the Other One! - Come! go home with me and you will see for yourself. He loves the jolly girls and will give you an apron full of gold!"
#XIM√âN√àS.
And you went to the home of the Other One?
#MANUELA.
That night - after having left my child with a woman as poor as myself - the gypsy woman conducted me into a wood where many men and bad women were feasting round a fire! - They gave me food and drink and more and more of - I know not what kind of liquor - until I became like a fool! - And after! - Ah! God, no, oh! no, I cannot relate that! - In the morning I lay asleep on the ground, poorer than before, for my miserable, ragged clothes were gone! The archers threw me into a dungeon, where I have done nothing but shed tears day and night, thinking of my poor little baby! I do not know what has become of that! They will not tell me! Ah! my good lords, do not make me more miserable! If they intend to burn me, why should I not be the first one selected from those doomed to die?
#XIM√âN√àS.
Raise your head - and look at this woman. Do you recognize her as one of those who attended the witches' revel?
#MANUELA.
No, no, Your Eminence.
#XIM√âN√àS.
Look at her carefully. And remember that you will receive some consideration if you answer frankly.
#ZORAYA.
Yes, look at me.
#MANUELA.
They made me drunk - I had no reason left - I do not remember clearly! -
#XIM√âN√àS.
Are you afraid that she will avenge herself? - She cannot harm you! - Then, confess that you saw her at this diabolical feast!
#MANUELA.
I cannot remember!
#XIM√âN√àS.
Take care, for we have sure methods for refreshing your memory.
#MANUELA.
Have mercy, my lord! - I am telling the truth!
#XIM√âN√àS.
No! - You recognize her, but will not admit it!
#MANUELA.
Should I accuse an innocent one! - condemn her without being certain? - I shall lose my soul!
#XIM√âN√àS.
The safety of your soul depends upon us - as does that of your body! - Then, you have seen her, have you not?
#MANUELA.
I am not certain! -
#XIM√âN√àS.
Andr√®s!
#MANUELA.
No, no! Have mercy! - mercy! Do nothing more to me!
#XIM√âN√àS.
Do you recognize her?
#MANUELA.
Yes, yes! I know her! - I recognize her! Ah! pardon, pardon me! - I am too weak!
#ZORAYA.
Yes, poor girl, yes! I pardon you!
#XIM√âN√àS.
Take her away! Scene Seven
#XIM√âN√àS.
Here is more testimony against you.
#ZORAYA.
Testimony! - of that unfortunate girl!
#XIM√âN√àS.
According to her own confessions! -
#ZORAYA.
Ah! her confessions! - made under the threats of your tortures! You can find whatever pleases you with the aid of him, there. You can convict with false testimony and you can make innocent ones confess crimes which they never committed. You, yourself, Bishop, under torture would admit going to a witches' meeting!
#XIM√âN√àS.
It is not likely that I shall have occasion to submit to such a trial! - Prove to us that these women have lied!
#ZORAYA.
And how do you want me to prove it? - Is It possible for me to do so? - You, can you prove to me that these women are telling the truth?
#XIM√âN√àS.
That is the opinion of the Tribunal.
#ZORAYA.
Then all of them say that I must be found guilty at any price. That could be done in a quicker and less cowardly manner.
#XIM√âN√àS.
Do you mean to defy us?
#ZORAYA.
Yes, I defy all of you! If I am to be condemned before I have an opportunity to defend myself, I shall have, at least, the pleasure of shouting my hatred to this Tribunal of the Church, which instead of being more human than those who believe in other religions, is more ferocious!
#CALABAZAS.
Your hatred, villainous Mooress!
#ZORAYA.
Yes, my hatred! - Yes, I abhor you! - I abhor you! - Priests! - who set upon a vanquished people like jackals upon the bodies of the dead after the battle!
#XIM√âN√àS.
Let her alone! - her lips are betraying the disease from which she is suffering.
#ZORAYA.
All the humiliations and sorrows of defeat - we have known them. They have changed our mosques into churches, our courts into kennels, our schools into stables! They have broken our aqueducts, drained our fish - ponds, burned our mills and wine - presses, cut down our orchards and made such a desert of the flowery plain of Granada that a bee cannot gather honey upon it! But that was not enough for us - we must have misery, famine and the brutality of soldiers! There must be refined cruelty at least, so you invented the Inquisition. - Thanks to that, you can assure yourselves with joyful hearts that we are punished like hardened heathens, that we perish in your oubliettes and that we are burned alive in the name of your Savior, who taught only mercy and goodness! And, that prophet - your God! - crucified by the Inquisitors of his time! - A martyr, whom you make an executioner! God of the Christians! - They have nailed thy feet and thy hands, so that thou canst not come to the aid of the unfortunate! But, if thou canst not tear thyself from the cross, cry at least unto these infamous judges that they need not look elsewhere for Hell and the gathering of witches - Here is the Hell where they sacrifice human creatures, where they offer to thee as hymns the lamentations of the tortured, and as incense the smell of burning flesh! Here is Hell, Hell with its furnaces, Hell with its damned, Hell! Hell! with its demons!
#ALL.
Blasphemy! - Blasphemy!
#ALBORNOS.
Shall we let this Saracen continue to insult the Tribunal?
#CALABAZAS.
And the Church!
#IBARRA.
The sentence! - Eminence! the sentence!
#XIM√âN√àS.
Be calm! - She is not alone a blasphemer to the Governor and me. - She is a sorceress!
#ALBORNOS.
That has been proven!
#XIM√âN√àS.
Not yet. I must have more testimony in the form of a confession.
#PADILLA.
Then torture her!
#XIM√âN√àS.
This woman? - All of our torments would not wrest one word from her.
#ALL.
What other means will you use, Eminence?
#XIM√âN√àS.
Then! - We shall question her accomplice and ask him to explain the reason for the murder of Cardenos, which he confesses, and why this woman was in his house on such a night.
#ZORAYA.
In spite of that he! -
#XIM√âN√àS.
It is not for you to plead his case! -
#ZORAYA.
Yes, yes! it is I! Wait! - Oh! wait, wait, then! It is only I who can explain for him! - He was maddened by my tears, my reproaches, my furious jealousy! - The other arrived and insulted me - then, in the height of his rage! - Ah! - that crime - I am more guilty than he! Would he have killed him, had I not been there?
#XIM√âN√àS.
Then you wish to convince us that this murder is your work?
#ZORAYA.
Yes, it is my work!
#XIM√âN√àS.
It is you who caused this unfortunate man to become an assassin?
#ZORAYA.
It is I! - It is I!
#XIM√âN√àS.
And by his flight, a deserter and a renegade?
#ZORAYA.
Yes! yes! - It is I! - It is I!
#XIM√âN√àS.
And is that not enough, wretched woman! It must be that you are bent upon his utter ruin!
#XIM√âN√àS.
For you have condemned him to death!
#PADILLA.
Without pity, too!
#ZORAYA.
Oh! how horrible! I would give my flesh and blood to save him!
#XIM√âN√àS.
No! - You can do that with one word! - And you are too obstinate to speak it!
#ZORAYA.
One word?
#PADILLA.
Tell the truth!
#ZORAYA.
But, I told it! - I told the truth!
#XIM√âN√àS.
No! - there is one thing which you have not admitted - one thing, alone - which will make him innocent of all crime!
#PADILLA.
And save him from all punishment!
#XIM√âN√àS.
The cause of his madness!
#PADILLA.
Madness due to your witchcraft!
#ALBORNOS.
And your philters!
#XIM√âN√àS.
And your poisons!
#ZORAYA.
Ah! I understand! - I understand! You want me to save him? Yes, it is true! It is true! If I have made him mad with some kind of a philter, he is unconscious of his acts! He is not guilty! He is more my accomplice! He is my victim! That is what you want, is it not? - Is it not?
#XIM√âN√àS.
And he escapes execution.
#PADILLA.
He will be sent to the galleys!
#XIM√âN√àS.
To prison!
#ZORAYA.
He is free?
#XIM√âN√àS AND PADILLA.
Yes.
#ZORAYA.
Ah! say so, then! - say it, then! On that condition, yes! on that condition! I will confess to whatever you wish! - But, when will you set him at liberty?
#XIM√âN√àS AND PADILLA.
On the spot!
#ZORAYA.
Then! Quickly! quickly! - Tell me what I must say!
#XIM√âN√àS.
You confess of your own free will and with repentance that you compelled Enrique Palacios to love you madly -
#PADILLA.
Do you hear that?
#XIM√âN√àS.
And that while infatuated he was guilty of crimes of which he had no knowledge, that his conduct was caused by philters you had given him and by enchantments and other tricks of the black art!
#ZORAYA.
Yes! yes! I confess it!
#XIM√âN√àS.
You confess?
#ZORAYA.
Oh! is not that enough?
#XIM√âN√àS.
And that you went to the witches' dance?
#ZORAYA.
Yes! yes! I confess.
#XIM√âN√àS.
That you have taken part in diabolical feasts and obscene dances?
#ZORAYA.
Yes!
#XIM√âN√àS.
And that you gave up your body to the lusts of all present, sorcerers and demons?
#ZORAYA.
Yes! yes!
#ENRIQUE.
Ah! accursed one!
#ZORAYA.
Him! Oh! No! Do not believe that! My Enrique! Not that! not that! - Do not believe it!
#ENRIQUE.
Away from me, prostitute of Hell!
#ZORAYA.
I have lied! - It is false! It is false!
#XIM√âN√àS.
It is false! Detain that man! Is it false?
#ZORAYA.
No! no! - It is true! - I confess! I confess! It is true!
#XIM√âN√àS.
We shall burn her after vespers!
#RAMIRO.
Here is the pyre!
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
They intend to burn her tonight, do they not?
#RAMIRO.
In a short time, Se√±oras - have patience. I have seen them come out of the prison.
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
Is there anything new concerning Don Enrique?
#RAMIRO.
Yes, good news! - His Lordship is free!
#DO√ëA RUFINA AND DO√ëA SYRENA.
Ah! so much the better!
#RAMIRO.
His Eminence has gone to carry the news to the king, leaving, as always, his business in secular hands - that is to say, leaving His Excellency, the Governor, the task of fulfilling the sentence: - for the Church will not spill blood!
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
Where is Don Enrique?
#RAMIRO.
At this moment, I do not know. Here is Cleofas coming out of the church. He will tell you. Master Cleofas!
#CLEOFAS.
Ah! at your service! Charming ladies! -
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
We were speaking of Don Enrique.
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
Saved, by the grace of God!
#AMBROSIO.
Was he released without punishment?
#CLEOFAS.
Pardoned! - This evening he will enter the Franciscan cloisters to do penance for three months. He will live on bread and water, wear hair - cloth and sleep on cinders.
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
That is a jolly honeymoon!
#DO√ëA FABIA.
And what does his young wife say?
#CLEOFAS.
Do√±a Joana?
#DO√ëA FABIA AND DO√ëA RUFINA.
Yes.
#CLEOFAS.
She says nothing! Since yesterday she has been in such a deep sleep that they cannot awaken her.
#ALL.
Since yesterday! Is that possible!
#CLEOFAS.
His Excellency, the Governor, was rejoicing this morning because his daughter knew nothing of what had happened during the night. But they are now very much concerned. She had these sleeps in the convent. But this is a longer sleep than the others, they say. Cleofas is the only one to work over her.
#ALL.
Naturally.
#CLEOFAS.
Naturally! - I cannot make her show a sign of awakening.
#ALL.
Ah!
#CLEOFAS.
Pinchings, prickings! I have tried everything except the red - hot iron, to which His Excellency objects! Pain has vanished! As the Mooress has bewitched the poor child, my art is ineffective. I have advised the only effective remedy: exorcism in the same church, before the highest altar. His Excellency and Don Enrique have had the patient carried into it - and they are praying that the demon which possesses her will be chased away. Master Oliveira, whom I left there, will be likely to profit and become an exorciser himself.
#DO√ëA RUFINA.
And you are going?
#DO√ëA SYRENA.
Without seeing them burn the Sorceress?
#CLEOFAS.
Pooh! I have seen such things as those so often that I no longer find them tasteful. Scene Two
#ENRIQUE.
Ramiro!
#RAMIRO.
Ah! my lord! What a relief your deliverance is to those who love you! And what joy you, yourself, must feel!
#ENRIQUE.
I am very sad, Ramiro, at the sight of the pyre.
#RAMIRO.
Has Your Honor not come to await the arrival of this creature?
#ENRIQUE.
Guilty as she is, I have loved her too well not to pity her. Tell Torillo to come here and consult with me. Are you the person who compels the condemned ones to mount the pyres?
#TORILLO.
Yes, my lord, and I also light the fires.
#ENRIQUE.
How can you sleep after doing such work?
#TORILLO.
From habit.
#ENRIQUE.
You often save the victims from the horror of being burned alive, do you not?
#TORILLO.
Yes, when the Holy Tribunal gives orders to strangle them and attach them to the stake!
#ENRIQUE.
You have not received such an order for her?
#TORILLO.
No, my lord.
#ENRIQUE.
They tell me that the parents or friends of the condemned frequently ask such a favor of you?
#TORILLO.
It is true, my lord.
#ENRIQUE.
And do you consent to give it?
#TORILLO.
For charity.
#ENRIQUE.
And for your own advantage, also?
#TORILLO.
Those are my little profits.
#ENRIQUE.
That must be done for her. - What price have you set upon such concessions?
#TORILLO.
I shall leave that to the judgment of Your Grace. But, being an honest man, I must tell you that a similar request has been made.
#ENRIQUE.
By whom?
#TORILLO.
By a woman - servant, she told me, in the service of the condemned.
#ENRIQUE.
Aisha?
#TORILLO.
I do not know.
#ENRIQUE.
Has she paid you?
#TORILLO.
She has given me ten ducats for agreeing to give to the Mooress a little waxen pill the instant that I untie her hands for public penance.
#ENRIQUE.
Yes! yes! I understand! - You have consented?
#TORILLO.
I promised without fully deciding to do so! But, now that Your Grace desires it also -
#ENRIQUE.
Ah! God, yes! - and you shall have a thousand ducats tomorrow!
#TORILLO.
The bargain is concluded, se√±or.
#ENRIQUE.
But how can you prove to me that you will keep your promise?
#TORILLO.
Because the victim will not utter a cry when I set fire to the pyre; if she restrains then she is dead.
#ENRIQUE.
If she is unable to utter a cry, or a groan, I will double the sum.
#TORILLO.
The bargain is settled, my lord.
#ENRIQUE.
Is that you, Oliveira? - Do√±a Joana?
#OLIVEIRA.
The same all of the time. Here comes that unfortunate woman.
#ENRIQUE.
Yes! it is she! - Ah, Oliveira, who could believe, if she had not confessed it herself, that this exquisite creature is a detestable magician? Oliviera. Oh! her confessions! Don Enrique, you are a man who can rely on himself. When night comes, I shall leave Toledo for I have much to fear because I have expressed myself too frankly concerning this poor woman, who is no more a sorceress than we are magicians, you and me!
#ENRIQUE.
Is it possible! - But her confessions, her confessions?
#OLIVEIRA.
They wrung them from her when they promised your freedom, her sorcery giving you an excuse.
#ENRIQUE.
And when she cried to me: "It is false! It is false!" -
#OLIVEIRA.
She, you see, had condemned herself to the stake!
#ENRIQUE.
Oh! brute that I am! - I have not understood!
#OLIVEIRA.
Be careful! Enrique. Must I be a coward! - I could hack myself into pieces!
#OLIVEIRA.
In God's name, do nothing foolish! There remains one more chance for you.
#ENRIQUE.
Joana?
#OLIVEIRA.
Yes! - Be careful, or they will hear us! Scene Three
#CALABAZAS.
Woman, the Inquisition has delivered you over for punishment to Toledo. Before you are purified by fire, make a public penance on your knees, torch in hand. And ask pardon for your crimes from God, from the Church and from the King.
#ZORAYA.
Ask pardon yourself, priest, for the crime which you are about to commit.
#CALABAZAS.
Do your duty! Scene Four
#PADILLA.
Stop! Is it you, sorceress, who have plunged my daughter into this awful sleep from which even the prayers of the church cannot rouse her?
#ZORAYA.
It is I! And I alone can bring her out of it.
#PADILLA.
Do it then, demon!
#ZORAYA.
Obey you? - No!
#PADILLA.
I will force you to do it!
#ZORAYA.
You cannot burn me twice!
#PADILLA.
Ah! wretch!
#ZORAYA.
Like these monks you have had no pity for me! You added to my tortures by bringing my lover to hear me. Now, I will torture you by means of your daughter. Invoke these priests, ring your bells, swing your censers! Chant your canticles! She will awaken only at the sound of my voice! When my body is burned to ashes, she sleeps her last sleep.
#PADILLA.
Seize her! No! Wait! Wait! Ah! Wretch, I am at your mercy! - Is it a pardon and freedom that you want?
#ZORAYA.
No! life would be only full of sorrow for me! I prefer death, which will give me an opportunity for revenge!
#ENRIQUE.
No! No! Do not use her for revenge. And, in exchange for the life, which you will save, I give you mine - give him his daughter!
#ZORAYA.
Ah! poor man, who implores of me a favor for this official - if you could know -
#ENRIQUE.
I know all! -
#ZORAYA.
Oh!
#ENRIQUE.
All! - And it is for the life of this innocent girl that I want your own - Zoraya!
#ZORAYA.
Ah! that word is enough! - This time I have recognized your voice! - Very well, if the governor promises to pardon me.
#PADILLA.
Absolutely!
#ZORAYA.
On your oath!
#PADILLA.
Before God!
#ZORAYA.
I am ready!
#ENRIQUE.
Come, then!
#CALABAZAS.
The sorceress cannot cross the threshold of the church!
#PADILLA.
Very well! - They can bring my child here!
#CALABAZAS AND THE INQUISITORS.
Governor -
#PADILLA.
I will be obeyed!
#CALABAZAS.
Padilla! - Such a bargain with this woman!
#ALBORNOS.
It is a compact with a demon!
#PADILLA.
My daughter! I want my daughter!
#MOLINA.
Do you want her before going to Hell, yourself?
#PADILLA.
If that is the price! - Give her to me!
#IBARRA.
There goes the salvation of your soul!
#PADILLA.
The salvation of my daughter!
#CALABAZAS.
It were better that she should die!
#PADILLA.
Ah! priests, you have no children! But the King is a father, he - he will understand me!
#ZORAYA.
Joana! Joana! Awaken! I want you to! - Arise!
#JOANA.
Where am I? The Mooress! - Fatoum! - My sisters!
#PADILLA.
Joana!
#JOANA.
My father! miracle! A miracle!
#CALABAZAS.
Silence, people! No miracle is performed by Satan!
#PADILLA.
Go and thank God! Go in peace, Zoraya! And all of you let the Mooress depart. She is free! Ramiro, see her safely home!
#A MONK.
Christians! are you going to let this daughter of Hell go free?
#ALL.
No! No!
#ENRIQUE.
Out of here, monks! - Make way!
#THE MONKS.
No! No! Seize the sorceress!
#THE CROWD.
Upon the sorceress!
#ENRIQUE.
You cowardly wretches!
#A MONK.
Palacios! You will not go free a second time!
#ENRIQUE.
Ramiro! Arias! My archers, help me!
#ALL.
To the stake! To the stake with the sorceress!
#ZORAYA.
They will kill you - Save yourself!
#ENRIQUE.
Go into the church! - into the church!
#ZORAYA.
Open! Open for us!
#THE CROWD.
Death! - to the death!
#ENRIQUE.
Ah! Infamous villains!
#RAMIRO.
My lord, we do not want to harm you, but give us that woman!
#ENRIQUE.
No, ruffians!
#THE CROWD.
To the death!
#A MAN IN THE CROWD.
Executioner, prepare your pyre. We shall burn the sorceress in spite of him!
#THE CROWD.
Yes! Yes!
#ZORAYA.
Here they will kill both of us - Will you not save yourself?
#ENRIQUE.
To me life among such brutes would be horrible!
#ZORAYA.
Then a last kiss! - Give me your lips! -
#RAMIRO.
To the stake with her! The sorceress still lives!
#ZORAYA.
Too late, wild beast!
#ALL.
To the stake with her body! To the stake!
