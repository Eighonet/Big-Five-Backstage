#MRS. CRATCHIT.
There now, here we are at home again, and I'll take these in and make a nice pot of jam with them. I got them very cheap.
#KITTY.
How much were they?
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Twopence each orange, and twopence and three farthings each lemon.
#KITTY.
Mother, why are the bells ringing?
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Because it is Bellringers' Day, when everyone who likes may ring a bell in the streets if he calls out the name of his parish and puts a penny into the parish poor box.
#KITTY.
Oh, I should like to do that. What's our parish?
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
St. Clement's.
#KITTY.
And I could ring my little bell that I got off the Christmas tree.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
But have you a penny for the poor box?
#KITTY.
You give me one, mammy darling.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
I'm afraid I haven't one to spare. I spent my pennies on these.
#KITTY.
Do let me sell them again and have some pennies!
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
What about the jam then?
#KITTY.
Oh, I'd much rather have the pennies for the poor box, so that I could ring my bell too.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
Well, you may try to sell them if you like. Kitty. Oh, mammy darling, you are kind. I'll run in and get my bell.
#MRS. CRATCHIT.
I'm spoiling you, mind.
#KITTY.
It is nice to be spoilt. Now you go indoors, mother, and I'll be a real person all by myself.
#ST. MARTIN'S BOY.
St. Martin's! St. Martin's!
#KITTY.
Oranges and lemons, says the Bells of St. Clement's!
#ST. MARTIN'S BOY.
Jolly good they look.
#KITTY.
Buy one?
#ST. MARTIN'S BOY.
Yes, if they're not too dear. How much are they?
#KITTY.
Two pennies for each orange, and two pennies and three farthings for each lemon.
#ST. MARTIN'S BOY.
All right, I'll have one of each. Now, twopence for this, you say, and twopence three farthings for this. Can you reckon up how much that is?
#KITTY.
No - you must.
#ST. MARTIN'S BOY.
Girls are silly. That makes fourpence three - farthings. Now, here's a sixpence, and you must give me five farthings change.
#KITTY.
Oh dear, I've got no farthings, no change, no nothing.
#ST. MARTIN'S BOY.
Then you'll have no sixpence as well, that's all. And I'll have no oranges and lemons - and no nothing.
#KITTY.
Oh dear, what a pity!
#SHOREDITCH BOY.
Shoreditch! Shoreditch! Hallo, those look good. Look here, little girl, sell me one. No, my pocket's empty.
#OLD BAILEY BOY.
Old Bailey! Old Bailey! Jolly things you've got there, young person.
#KITTY.
Do buy one.
#SHOREDITCH BOY.
I want to buy one if someone will lend me the money.
#OLD BAILEY BOY.
Here, I've got some money. How much do you want?
#SHOREDITCH BOY.
Twopence.
#OLD BAILEY BOY.
Here you are then.
#SHOREDITCH BOY.
Hooray! There, little girl.
#KITTY.
Oh, that is nice!
#OLD BAILEY BOY.
But when will you pay me?
#SHOREDITCH BOY.
"When I grow rich, says the bell of Shoreditch."
#OLD BAILEY BOY.
That's all very well, but it's a long time to wait. You put back that orange and give me back the pennies.
#STEPNEY BOY.
Stepney!
#BOW BOY.
And Bow!
#STEPNEY BOY.
Stepney!
#BOW BOY.
And Bow!
#BOW BOY.
What's all this about?
#OLD BAILEY BOY.
I've lent this Shoreditch boy twopence, and he says he'll pay me when he grows rich.
#STEPNEY BOY.
"When will that be? says the bell of Stepney."
#BOW BOY.
"I'm sure I don't know, says the big bell of Bow."
#OLD BAILEY BOY.
Don't know, indeed!
#BOW BOY.
Well, don't quarrel on Bellringers' Day. Let's make a great noise and disturb the neighbours, that's much more amusing. Come on now, let's each shout something.
#KITTY.
Oranges and lemons, says the bell of St. Clement's.
#ST. MARTIN'S BOY.
You owe me five farthings, says the bell of St. Martin's.
#OLD BAILEY BOY.
When will you pay me? says the bell of Old Bailey.
#SHOREDITCH BOY.
When I grow rich, says the bell of Shoreditch.
#STEPNEY BOY.
When will that be? says the bell of Stepney.
#BOW BOY.
I'm sure I don't know, says the big bell of Bow. Capital. Now, all together, about the chopper.
#NEIGHBOURS.
Oh, what a noise!
#BOW BOY.
It's Bellringers' Day, ma'am. We may make as much noise as we like. Now then, all together.
