#TOMASSO.
Tomorrow comes the great, grand festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?
#PADDY MIKE.
Sure and it is. This is the holy Christmas Eve.
#MEENY.
The night of the day behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it? Sure it is.
#SCHWILLIE.
Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?
#KLINKER.
Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?
#HULDA.
That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different, maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.
#KLINKER.
But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?
#SCHWILLIE.
Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?
#HULDA.
How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.
#MEENY.
Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's awful.
#KLINKER.
But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?
#SCHWILLIE.
Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't I, Klinker?
#KLINKER.
Sure. We've been awfully good boys.
#HULDA.
Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.
#MEENY.
Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.
#BIDDY MARY.
Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?
#SERGIUS.
Of course I'm sure. It was awful big. The biggest fish I ever saw. Even in Russia we do not have such big fish as whales. Paddy Mike saw it, too.
#PADDY MIKE.
Sure and I did. And me two eyes nearly fell out of me head with lookin' at it, it was that wonderful. He shot a big stream of water right up out of his head, he did, and then he dived down in the ocean again, and we didn't see him any more at all, at all.
#HULDA.
There! Now if you get to see the great big whale, that's almost as good as having old Saint Nicholas come, ain't it?
#SCHWILLIE.
Whales can't bring you no Christmas presents, can they, Klinker?
#KLINKER.
Und whales you can see any time. I'd rather have Saint Nicholas, wouldn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?
#SERGIUS.
Who is this Saint Nicholas they are looking for, Hulda?
#HULDA.
Why, don't you know who he is yet? He's the best old man that ever was. Und he comes the night before Christmas und visits all the little children in Holland.
#MEENY.
Und in Germany, too.
#KLINKER.
Und if they're good they get candy und oranges und toys und things, don't they, Schwillie Willie Winkum?
#SCHWILLIE.
Und if they're bad, they get a good big birch stick. But I ain't been bad. I've been awfully good, isn't I, Klinker?
#KLINKER.
Sure. Und me also.
#HULDA.
On Christmas Eve in Holland all the children march around the streets, following one who carries a big silver star. And the people who meet us give us money and gifts to help the poor. Oh, Christmas time is just grand in Holland!
#KLINKER.
Und we set out our leedle wooden shoes und old Saint Nicholas fills 'em with candy.
#SCHWILLIE.
Und we put a leedle bit of hay in our shoes for his good old horsie, Sleipner. Dot makes him happy.
#MEENY.
In Germany we call him Santa Claus, und he comes riding in a sleigh drawn through the sky mit reindeers. Und we have Christmas trees all lighted mit candles und things, und full of toys und paper stars und angels und apples. But Santa Claus could never get out here in der middle of der ocean. If he did maybe he'd get seasick already, und all der reindeers would get drownded in der water.
#SERGIUS.
In Russia there is an old woman named Babouska who visits all the children on the night before Christmas. She carries a big basket full of good things.
#TOMASSO.
In sunny Italy the children all go to midnight church on Christmas Eve, and when we make ourselves awake on Christmas morning, our shoes are all full of candy and chestnuts and figs and oranges. But of course on a big ship like - a this we'll not get - a nothing at all.
#KLINKER.
But I want some presents already.
#SCHWILLIE.
Und me also. I want some presents, too.
#KLINKER.
Und Saint Nicholas can't come. Oh, oh! He can't get out on the big ocean.
#SCHWILLIE.
Maybe he could float out on a piece of ice yet. Could he, Hulda?
#HULDA.
No. I don't think he's much of a floater.
#MEENY.
If he did it would make him awful seasick.
#KLINKER.
I wish we was landed in New York yet, so I do.
#SCHWILLIE.
Where is Anita? She'll know.
#HULDA.
Yes, Anita will know whether he is coming or not. She knows almost everything.
#PADDY MIKE.
Here comes Anita now, and sure she's having a grand time, so she is.
#ALL.
Here she comes. Hurrah for Anita.
#TOMASSO.
Anita, Anita, come here quick. We want you.
#ANITA.
I'm coming. Wait a minute. I'm coming.
#ANITA.
Oh, I've just had the grandest time. It was so superb, magnificent, sublime! I have - a been at the leetla window watching the great, grand, magnificent ocean. It was all so blue and so green and so purple - and the sinking sun is all shining on the great - a, beeg waves, like - a sparkling diamonds. And me, the poor, leetla Italian girl, gets to see all this great - a, grand - a ocean. It is superb, magnificent, sublime! Ah, I am so happy, I could sing and dance and kees everybody on the great - a, grand - a earth!
#MEENY.
Vot makes you so happy, Anita? Maybe I'd be happy yet also, if I didn't get seasick once in a while.
#ANITA.
What makes me so happy, Meeny? It's the sun and the waves, and the sunlight shining like diamonds on the great - a, grand - a ocean. Are you not also happy, Biddy Mary?
#BIDDY MARY.
I am not. Sure, I niver do be having time to be seeing diamonds on the great big waves. I have to be hard at work, so I do, peeling the praties for our Christmas breakfast.
#ANITA.
I watched the great - a red sun as he began to sink, sink, sink way down in the ocean. And the beeg - a waves got more beeg and more beeg and on top of them I saw long white lace fringe. The green silk waves were all - a trimmed with white lace fringe. And sometimes I think I see the leetla mermaid fairies dancing in the foam. Leetla green and white mermaids with the long long - a hair.
#TOMASSO.
You make - a me seek, Anita. There is - a no such things as fairies.
#ANITA.
But I love to think there is. It is a great, grand - a pleasure just to think there is. Is it not, Meeny?
#MEENY.
Oh, sure.
#ANITA.
And that is why we should all be so verra, verra happy. We can think such - a lovely things. The poor leetla children at - a home, pouf! They cannot think such things, because they have never seen such a great, beeg - a ship, or such a great, beeg - a ocean -
#SERGIUS.
Or a whale.
#PADDY MIKE.
Or a sailor man.
#HULDA.
Or a nice little steerage bed built just like a shelf in the wall.
#TOMASSO.
Or the great beeg - a engine that makes the ship go.
#MEENY.
Or the tons and tons of coal vay down deep by the cellar.
#SERGIUS.
Way down deep by the cellar! Whoever heard of a cellar on board of a ship? You mean - down in the hatch.
#MEENY.
Hatch? Vot is dot hatch? Dis ain't a chicken, it's a boat.
#KLINKER.
Anita, we want to ask you a question.
#ANITA.
Well, and what is the question of the leetla Dutch twins?
#SCHWILLIE.
Tonight is the night before Christmas.
#KLINKER.
Und we want to know if the good Saint Nicholas is coming tonight.
#ANITA.
I don't know. You see it would be a great beeg - a, long - a trip way out here on the ocean.
#KLINKER.
But I want him to come. I've been a awful good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?
#SCHWILLIE.
Sure, you is. Und me also, ain't I, Klinker?
#ANITA.
If you have both been verra, verra good I think that maybe the good Saint will come. Have you all been verra, verra good?
#OTHERS.
Yes, all of us.
#HANS.
We're always very, very good at Christmas time.
#AH GOO.
Me velly, velly good.
#ANITA.
See, way up there on the upper deck, are the rich, grand - a ladies and gentlemen coming out from the great, beeg - a dining - room. If you go and stand under the hole maybe they'll throw you some oranges or candy. They're awful nice peoples on the upper deck.
#MEENY.
Let's all go right away quick. Maybe we'll get some oranges und candy.
#KLINKER.
Oh, how I do love oranges und candy, don't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?
#SCHWILLIE.
Sure, und me also, don't I, Klinker?
#SERGIUS.
Let us all go together.
#ANITA.
Surely the good - a Saint Nicholas will come tonight, because there are so many, many verra good children on board this - a ship. There's Hulda from Holland and her two leetla brothers, the Dutch twins, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum. They must have a great - a beeg - a Christmas present. And there's Sergius from Russia, and Meeny and Paddy Mike and Biddy Mary, and Neelda from Spain, and Yakob and Hans and Ah Goo and Mieze and leetla Sano San from afar away Japan. They must all have the great - a, grand - a presents. Maybe I could write old Santa Claus a leetla letter and tell how good the poor children way down in the steerage have been. And there's my cousin Tomasso from Italy. Oh, Santa Claus must bring him a new violin. Then he can make - a the beautiful music on the golden streets of New York. If there is anybody at all in the whole beeg world who should have a nice - a, beeg - a Christmas, it is the verra poor leetla children whose mammas and papas haven't got very much money. But sometimes the good Santa Claus forgets all about the verra poor leetla children - and that's the mostest saddest thing of all, for they are the verra ones he should remember. When I get to be a great - a, beeg, grand - a, reech lady in the golden streets of New York, ah! then I will buy presents and presents and presents, and I will - a give them to all the verra poor leetla children in the world. I wonder why it is that the verra good Santa Claus sometimes forgets the poor leetla children on - a Christmas Day. He never forgets the reech leetla children, only those who are verra, verra poor. And that is a sad misfortune. If I had - a nice - a Christmas present, with many candies and figs and oranges, I could never rest until I had given something nice to all the poor leetla children in the city - for that is what makes the mostest happy Christmas of all.
#SERGIUS.
Guess who it is.
#ANITA.
Sergius!
#SERGIUS.
Why, I thought that you would think it was a goblin.
#ANITA.
Goblin? What is a goblin, Sergius?
#SERGIUS.
It's a little, wee bit of a man with a long beard. And they go around having a good time at night. They are always very active on the night before Christmas. I shouldn't be at all surprised if we should see some tonight.
#ANITA.
Oh, Sergius, will they harm us?
#SERGIUS.
Not very much. They just like to have a little fun, that's all. We have lots of them in Russia. And I believe there are some down here in the steerage.
#ANITA.
Oh, Sergius! Where are they?
#SERGIUS.
Well, last night I could not sleep, so I got up and came in here, and just as I was passing by that barrel
#L.C.
where JACK FROST is concealed), I thought I heard a noise. It was like some one rapping on the barrel. Like this. I thought it was a goblin and I never stopped running until I was safe in my bunk with the bedclothes around my head.
#ANITA.
Pooh! I'm not afraid. No leetla goblin man can make - a me afraid.
#SERGIUS.
They do wonderful things on Christmas Eve. But come; let us go to the bottom of the stairs. The ladies and gentlemen are looking down and Tomasso is playing his violin. Soon they will throw apples and oranges down to us, and perhaps money. Come and see.
#ANITA.
No, I'd rather wait here.
#SERGIUS.
All right, but don't let the goblin man catch you.
#ANITA.
The goblin man! Poof! There is no such thing as a goblin man. In - a Italy we do not have such goblin mans. He said he heard something rap, rap on the inside of the barrel. Poof! Sergius must have been having one beeg, grand - a dream. Never in all my life did I ever hear anything go rap, rap on the inside of a barrel. And if I did, I'd think it was a leetla, weeny - teeny mouse. But a leetla, weeny - teeny mouse never could go rap, rap on the inside of a barrel, try as hard as he could. It must have been a dream.
#ANITA.
Oh, what was that? I thought I heard something. Maybe it is the leetla, teeny - weeny baby mouse. I'll just peek in and see.
#JACK FROST.
Hello!
#ANITA.
Oh!
#JACK FROST.
Did you say oh, or hello?
#ANITA.
I just said, oh.
#JACK FROST.
Well, then, hello.
#ANITA.
Hello.
#JACK FROST.
You aren't frightened, are you?
#ANITA.
Well, I'm a leetla frightened, but not verra much.
#JACK FROST.
Why? I won't hurt you.
#ANITA.
You came up so sudden. I never expected to find a boy in that barrel. And you are such a queer looking boy.
#JACK FROST.
Boy? I'm not a boy.
#ANITA.
You're not? You look like a boy. You're not a girl, are you?
#JACK FROST.
Well, I should say not! I'm just a kind of a sort of a kind of an idea, that's all. I'm your imagination.
#ANITA.
I hope you're not a goblin.
#JACK FROST.
Oh, no. I'm not a goblin. They're old and have long beards. I'm not old at all. See, I'm even younger than you are. I'm a pixie.
#ANITA.
And what is a pixie?
#JACK FROST.
I told you before, it's just your imagination.
#ANITA.
You look like a boy. What is your name?
#JACK FROST.
My name is Claus.
#ANITA.
Claus! Why, what a funny leetla name. I never heard a name like that in Italy. Claus what?
#JACK FROST.
Santa Claus. Haven't you ever heard of Santa Claus?
#ANITA.
Oh, yes; many, many times. But you can't be Santa Claus.
#JACK FROST.
I'd like to know why I can't! It's my name, isn't it?
#ANITA.
But you are not the real, real truly Santa Claus. He is an old, old man. A leetla fat old man with white - a hair just like - a the snow, and a long, white - a beard.
#JACK FROST.
Ho, you must be thinking of my daddy.
#ANITA.
Your daddy? Is Santa Claus your daddy?
#JACK FROST.
Sure, he is. I'm Jack Frost Santa Claus, Jr. Most folks call me Jolly Jack Frost. The little fat man with the white beard is my father.
#ANITA.
Why, I didn't know Santa Claus had any leetla boys.
#JACK FROST.
Sure, he has. Who do you think takes care of the reindeer, and who waters the doll - tree and picks the dolls?
#ANITA.
Picks the dolls? Do the dolls grow on trees?
#JACK FROST.
Yes, indeed, right next door to the taffy cottage, down Chocolate Lane. I take care of the marble bushes and the popgun trees. You just ought to see our wonderful gardens.
#ANITA.
Oh, I'd love to see them.
#JACK FROST.
We've got a Teddy - bear garden, and a tool garden, and a furniture garden, and a game garden, and a candy garden, though most of the candy comes from mines.
#ANITA.
The mines?
#JACK FROST.
Sure. We dig out just the kind we want. We have caramel mines, and vanilla mines and mines full of chocolate almonds, and rivers of fig paste and strawberry ice cream soda. They flow right through the picture - book garden.
#ANITA.
Oh, it must be the most wonderful place in the whole world.
#JACK FROST.
And I help take care of it. I have fourteen little brothers, and we're all twins.
#ANITA.
And have you a mother, too? Has Santa Claus a nice - a, fine - a wife?
#JACK FROST.
Of course he's got a wife. Haven't you ever heard of my mother. Her name is Mary.
#ANITA.
Mary? Mary what?
#JACK FROST.
Why, Merry Mary Christmas, of course. I thought everyone knew that.
#ANITA.
And does she go round the world with Santa Claus on the night before Christmas?
#JACK FROST.
Oh, no, she's too busy for that. She stays at home and takes care of the gardens.
#ANITA.
But what are you doing here on the ship? I should think you'd be with your father.
#JACK FROST.
Ah, that is a secret. You mustn't tell anyone.
#ANITA.
How can I tell anyone when I don't know myself.
#JACK FROST.
Well, maybe I'll tell you.
#ANITA.
Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great - a, beeg, grand - a secret.
#JACK FROST.
You can keep a secret, can't you?
#ANITA.
Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.
#JACK FROST.
Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your name's Anita, isn't it?
#ANITA.
Yes. But how did you know?
#JACK FROST.
Oh, we know everything. How old are you?
#ANITA.
If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I am.
#JACK FROST.
Well, I just guessed it.
#ANITA.
Then why don't you guess how old I am?
#JACK FROST.
Cute, ain't you?
#ANITA.
Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.
#JACK FROST.
Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.
#ANITA.
Cross my heart.
#JACK FROST.
Listen, then; here's the secret.
#ANITA.
He is? He is? Oh!!
#JACK FROST.
Yes, he is.
#ANITA.
Honest?
#JACK FROST.
Honest injun!
#ANITA.
With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?
#JACK FROST.
Yes, ma'am, every single thing.
#ANITA.
Tonight?
#JACK FROST.
Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little children in the steerage are asleep.
#ANITA.
But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?
#JACK FROST.
Fly.
#ANITA.
Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?
#JACK FROST.
Really and truly wings.
#ANITA.
I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.
#JACK FROST.
He only bought them this year.
#ANITA.
Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?
#JACK FROST.
Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.
#ANITA.
Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.
#JACK FROST.
He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air ship. Oh, I'm tired.
#ANITA.
I didn't know pixies ever got tired.
#JACK FROST.
You ought to see the work I've done today.
#ANITA.
Here on the boat?
#JACK FROST.
Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.
#ANITA.
Oh, show me.
#JACK FROST.
I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.
#ANITA.
It isn't anything scary, is it?
#JACK FROST.
Of course not. There; what do you think of that?
#ANITA.
Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell Tomasso.
#JACK FROST.
Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell anybody.
#ANITA.
But are you really, truly sure he's coming?
#JACK FROST.
Of course he is. That is our secret.
#ANITA.
Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all - a my life. I will not tell a soul that he is - a coming. It will be a Christmas surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll always remember this great - a beeg, nice - a secret about old Santa Claus and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.
#JACK FROST.
What are you going to do when you get to America?
#ANITA.
I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de grind - organ. Until last - a month he had - a de nice - a monkey, named Mr. Jocko, but last - a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he send for me to take - a his place.
#JACK FROST.
Take the monkey's place?
#ANITA.
Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my tambourine, so! And then I will - a collect the pennies, just like - a Mr. Jocko used to do.
#JACK FROST.
I suppose you are going to wear a leetla red cap and jump up and down this way , and say, "Give - a de monk de cent!"
#ANITA.
Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and dance the leetla dance, so! Then, when I'm finished, I go to the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so! And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does he?
#JACK FROST.
Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.
#ANITA.
And you must not forget the leetla Dutch twins, and my cousin Tomasso, and Hulda and Meeny and Sergius and Ah Goo and Sano San and Needla and Biddy Mary and Paddy Mike and all the rest.
#JACK FROST.
Whew! That's a big order. But we won't forget a single soul on Christmas Day. And now I've got to go and put the finishing touches on - you know what!
#ANITA.
Why, he's gone.
#JACK FROST.
The sun has set, it's out of sight, so little Jack Frost will say good - night!
#ANITA.
Good - night, Jolly Jack Frost, good - night. Oh, it's the most wonderful secret in all the world. And won't the leetla children be glad to know that old Santa Claus has not forgotten them. He said that Santa Claus was coming tonight in the air ship, and it's got to be true, it's just got to be true.
#TOMASSO.
Anita, if you don't hurry you'll not get any supper at all. It's most eight o'clock.
#ANITA.
Oh, I don't care for supper, Tomasso. I could - a not eat. I'm too much excited to eat.
#TOMASSO.
What make - a you so excited, Anita?
#ANITA.
Why, tonight - Oh, that I cannot tell; it's a secret.
#TOMASSO.
What is the secret?
#ANITA.
If I told - a you, Tomasso, then it would no longer be a secret.
#TOMASSO.
You should - a not have the secrets from me, Anita. I am your cousin, also - I am the head of the family.
#ANITA.
But I made the promise not to tell.
#TOMASSO.
Who you make - a the promise to?
#ANITA.
I promised Jack - I mean, I make - a de promise to someone.
#TOMASSO.
To Jack! Who is this - a Jack, Anita?
#ANITA.
That is part of the secret. Listen, Tomasso, tomorrow morning you shall know everything. Early in the morning shall I tell - a you my secret. That will be my Christmas present to you.
#TOMASSO.
All right. I'll wait. Oh, see, Anita, the moon is coming up. Just like - a big, round - a silver ball.
#ANITA.
Let us stay here and watch the moon, Tomasso.
#TOMASSO.
You'd better go and get your supper. Those leetla Dutch twins are eating everything on the table. I think they'd eat the table itself if it was - a not nailed to the deck. Hurry, Anita!
#ANITA.
I go. It's a awful good - a secret, Tomasso.
#TOMASSO.
Ah, the great, grand - a lady moon. She looks at me, I look at her. Maybe she'll like a leetla serenade.
#BIDDY MARY.
Sure, that's beautiful. It takes me back again to dear ould Ireland where the River Shannon flows.
#HULDA.
What do you do in Ireland the night before Christmas, Biddy Mary?
#MEENY.
Do you have a Christmas tree like we do in Germany?
#BIDDY MARY.
We do not. We don't have any tree at all, at all.
#PADDY MIKE.
And we don't get many presents. But it's a fine time we have for all that. Instead of getting presents, we have the fun of giving presents - and that's the finest thing in all the world, so it is, to make the other fellow happy. Sure, I just love to give presents.
#KLINKER.
You can give me some if you want to.
#SCHWILLIE.
Und me also some.
#BIDDY MARY.
But where would we be getting presents out here in the middle of the ocean? In dear ould Ireland sure it's a fine time we're after having on Christmas Day.
#PADDY MIKE.
It is that. With the fiddles playing and the dancers dancing and the fine suppers upon the table.
#SERGIUS.
In Russia we always set a table in front of the window and put a fine linen cloth on it. Here is the cloth, but we have no window.
#HULDA.
Here, use this box as a table. Now, let us put the cloth on, so!
#BIDDY MARY.
The night before Christmas we always put a big candle, all gay with ribbons, in the window to welcome the Christ child.
#PADDY MIKE.
Here is the candle. Now I'll light it.
#TOMASSO.
We do that also in Italy. And we put a leetla picture of the Christ child on the table.
#BIDDY MARY.
On Christmas Day it's the fine old tales we're after hearing in Ireland, all about the wonderful star that shone so bright that it turned night into day, and led the Wise Men all the way to where a little Babe in the manger lay.
#PADDY MIKE.
And all the angels sang above of peace on earth, good will and love.
#SERGIUS.
May the spirit of Christmas enter every heart tonight, making all the world one big, happy family, no rich, no poor, no high, no low, all brothers and sisters, all children of the Lord on high!
#MEENY.
Maybe good old Santa Claus will come after all. Vell, if he does I want to be ready for him. Come, Yakob and Hans and Mieze, let us hang up our stockings here under the burning candle.
#NEELDA.
Christ was born on the Christmas Day, wreathe the holly, twine the bay! Light and Life and Joy is He, the Babe, the Son, the Holy One of Mary!
#TOMASSO.
Meeny and Yakob and Hans and leetla Mieze have hung up their stockings for the good - a Saint Nicholas, but in Italy we set out our shoes, so! And we always get them full of presents.
#MEENY.
I like stockings much better than shoes already, because the stockings can stretch yet, und if they stretch real, real wide out maybe we can get a baby piano or a automobile in our stockings. Jah, stockings is mooch better als shoes.
#HULDA.
Here is my beautiful star. That will remind us of the Star of Bethlehem that led the three Wise Men across the hills and plains of Judea unto the little manger where, surrounded by cattle and oxen, amid the straw, the Lord of Heaven was born on Christmas Eve.
#SCHWILLIE.
Und all the angels sang, "Peace on earth, good will to men," didn't they, Klinker?
#KLINKER.
Und all the shepherds heard them, and they followed the star and came to the manger to see the little Baby.
#MEENY.
Let us all sit down here in front of the candle and the star, and see if old Santa Claus has forgotten us already. It's almost time for him to be coming.
#HULDA.
Oh, I do hope Santa Claus will come and visit us tonight. But of course he cannot go every place. Some children have to be left out.
#KLINKER.
Yes, that's so; but I hope it ain't us. Don't you, Schwillie Willie Winkum?
#SCHWILLIE.
Sure, I do. I wish old Santa would hurry up and come, 'cause the old Sandman is here already. I'm getting awful sleepy.
#KLINKER.
Me - I'm getting awful sleepy, too.
#TOMASSO.
I wonder what has become of Anita? She said she had a wonderful secret that was - a verra, verra grand. secret, Tomasso?
#TOMASSO.
Yes, a great, beeg, grand - a secret.
#BIDDY MARY.
Oh, what is it, Tomasso?
#MEENY.
Yes, Tomasso, tell us vot it is already.
#BIDDY MARY.
Sure, if there's anything on earth I do love, it's a secret.
#HULDA.
Yes, Tomasso, tell us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.
#MEENY.
Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.
#TOMASSO.
Well, I -
#BIDDY MARY.
Now, you tell me, Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.
#TOMASSO.
Well, I -
#MEENY.
If you're going to tell it, I want to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.
#BIDDY MARY.
Neither do I.
#HULDA.
Neither do I.
#MEENY.
Neither do any of us.
#KLINKER.
I don't want to miss nothing neither.
#SCHWILLIE.
No, und I don't neither.
#ALL.
Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?
#TOMASSO.
It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.
#ALL.
Well, what is Anita's secret.
#TOMASSO.
She wouldn't tell me.
#ALL.
Oh!
#TOMASSO.
She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that would be her Christmas present to us - to tell us the secret.
#SERGIUS.
It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in the middle of the ocean.
#KLINKER.
Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa Claus comes.
#BIDDY MARY.
Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin' sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at all.
#SANO SAN.
They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my little lantern in front of the candle.
#AH GOO.
Allee samee hang mine.
#SERGIUS.
I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap. Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as you hear the bells on his reindeer.
#TOMASSO.
I wonder what has become of Anita?
#HULDA.
I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.
#OTHERS.
So are all of us.
#BIDDY MARY.
We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's time we were all of us fast asleep.
#KLINKER.
Noddin', nid, nid noddin'.
#SCHWILLIE.
Dropping off to sleep, ain't we, Klinker?
#ANITA.
Asleep! Every last one of them is verra sound asleep. Meeny and Biddy Mary, and Sergius and Tomasso and the leetla Dutch twins and all! Jack Frost! Jolly Jack Frost! Come - a quick, come - a quick! They're all asleep.
#JACK FROST.
Hello, what is it?
#ANITA.
It is Anita. The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.
#JACK FROST.
And so was I. They sang a song about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole. I'm still awfully sleepy.
#ANITA.
I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.
#JACK FROST.
You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the middle of the night.
#ANITA.
The middle of the night? What do you mean?
#JACK FROST.
Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?
#ANITA.
Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?
#JACK FROST.
Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now. It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see anything that looks like an air ship, do you?
#ANITA.
No, I cannot see a single thing.
#JACK FROST.
Oh, look here! The children have lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem. And stockings and shoes all in a row.
#ANITA.
I can't see a thing.
#JACK FROST.
Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?
#ANITA.
Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.
#JACK FROST.
Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong end. Turn it around.
#ANITA.
Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny - weeny thing way, way off - far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?
#JACK FROST.
Yes, I believe it is.
#ANITA.
Oh, he's coming, he's coming. I'm going to get to see Santa Claus! Is it not wonderful? I'm going to see him. Let me look. Oh, it's getting bigger and bigger and BIGGER!
#JACK FROST.
Hurray! daddy's coming! daddy's coming!
#ANITA.
Now I can hear the bells. Oh, it's coming closer and closer and CLOSER. Look out, it's going to hit the boat!
#JACK FROST.
He flew right by us.
#ANITA.
Maybe he didn't see the boat. Oh, now he isn't coming at all.
#JACK FROST.
Yes, he is. He's landed right over there. Here he comes; here he comes!
#ANITA.
Here we are, Santa Claus. This is the place. Come in. Merry Christmas, Santa Claus, merry Christmas!
#SANTA CLAUS.
Hello, there - where are you? It's so dark I can't see a single thing.
#JACK FROST.
Hello, daddy; merry Christmas.
#SANTA CLAUS.
Hello yourself. Merry Christmas to you, too. Are you all ready for me?
#JACK FROST.
Yes, it's all ready. The magical tree is just waiting for your touch to turn into a real Christmas tree.
#ANITA.
Oh, we're going to have a real Christmas tree.
#SANTA CLAUS.
Hello, who's this young person?
#JACK FROST.
This is Anita.
#SANTA CLAUS.
And why isn't she sound asleep like the rest of the children?
#JACK FROST.
She's such a good little girl that I told her she could stay up with me and wait until you came.
#SANTA CLAUS.
Oh, ho; so you've made a hit with my boy, Jack Frost, have you? Well, if that's the case, I guess you can stay.
#ANITA.
But all of the children would like to see you, Santa Claus. See, they've prepared the candle and the wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem all for you. There's Sergius and Tomasso and Hulda and Meeny and Hans and Yakob and Neelda and Ah Goo and Sano San and Mieze and the leetla Dutch twins, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum. They've all been awfully good children. And Biddy Mary and Paddy Mike they brought the candle. They're good, too.
#SANTA CLAUS.
Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.
#JACK FROST.
Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.
#SANTA CLAUS.
It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in the steerage.
#ANITA.
Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let them see you?
#SANTA CLAUS.
Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the birth of Christmas Day.
#ANITA.
And don't you have any other place to go this year?
#SANTA CLAUS.
I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things back to the North Pole again.
#JACK FROST.
Here they are, daddy.
#SANTA CLAUS.
Now, where's the tree?
#JACK FROST.
There she is. Isn't she a beauty?
#ANITA.
Oh, it's the greatest, most grand - a tree in all the world.
#JACK FROST.
There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.
#ANITA.
Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!
#JACK FROST.
Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!
#SANTA CLAUS.
Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and give Santa Claus a good, old hug!
#HULDA.
Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!
#SCHWILLIE.
Me, too. I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?
#KLINKER.
Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?
#MEENY.
Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.
#TOMASSO.
And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.
#PADDY MIKE.
Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa Claus.
#ANITA.
And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.
#PADDY MIKE.
Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.
#ANITA.
This was my Christmas secret. Santa Claus and the air ship and the Christmas tree and jolly Jack Frost and everything. This was the secret.
#PADDY MIKE.
Now all of yeez give three cheers for Anita's secret.
