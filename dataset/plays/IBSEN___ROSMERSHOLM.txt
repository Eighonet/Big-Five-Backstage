#MADAM HELSETH.
I suppose I had better begin to lay the table, Miss?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, please do. The Pastor must soon be in now.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Don’t you feel the draught, Miss, where you’re sitting?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, there is a little draught. Perhaps you had better shut the window.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Why, isn’t that the Pastor over there?
#REBECCA WEST.
Where? Yes, it is he. Stand aside—don’t let him see us.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Only think, Miss—he’s beginning to take the path by the mill again.
#REBECCA WEST.
He went that way the day before yesterday too. But let us see whether——
#MADAM HELSETH.
Will he venture across the foot - bridge?
#REBECCA WEST.
That is what I want to see. No, he is turning. He is going by the upper road again. A long way round.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Dear Lord, yes. No wonder the Pastor thinks twice about setting foot on that bridge. A place where a thing like that has happened——
#REBECCA WEST.
They cling to their dead here at Rosmersholm.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Now I would say, Miss, that it’s the dead that clings to Rosmersholm.
#REBECCA WEST.
The dead?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Yes, it’s almost as if they couldn’t tear themselves away from the folk that are left.
#REBECCA WEST.
What makes you fancy that?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Well, if it wasn’t for that, there would be no White Horse, I suppose.
#REBECCA WEST.
Now what is all this about the White Horse, Madam Helseth?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Oh, I don’t like to talk about it. And, besides, you don’t believe in such things.
#REBECCA WEST.
Do you believe in it, then?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Oh, you’d only be for laughing at me, Miss. Why, isn’t that Mr. Rosmer on the mill - path again——?
#REBECCA WEST.
That man there? No, that’s the Rector!
#MADAM HELSETH.
Yes, so it is.
#REBECCA WEST.
This is delightful. You may be sure he’s coming here.
#MADAM HELSETH.
He goes straight over the foot - bridge, he does. And yet she was his sister, his own flesh and blood. Well, I’ll go and lay the table then, Miss West.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, Madam Helseth, you might let us have some little extra dish for supper. You know what the Rector likes best.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Oh yes, Miss, I’ll see to it.
#REBECCA WEST.
At last—! How glad I am to see you, my dear Rector.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Thanks. Then I am not disturbing you?
#REBECCA WEST.
You? How can you ask?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Amiable as ever. Is Rosmer upstairs in his room?
#REBECCA WEST.
No, he is out walking. He has stayed out rather longer than usual; but he is sure to be in directly. Won’t you sit down till he comes?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Many thanks. Why, how you have brightened up the old room! Flowers everywhere!
#REBECCA WEST.
Mr. Rosmer is so fond of having fresh, growing flowers about him.
#RECTOR KROLL.
And you are too, are you not?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes; they have a delightfully soothing effect on me. We had to do without them though, till lately.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, their scent was too much for poor Beata.
#REBECCA WEST.
Their colours, too. They quite bewildered her——
#RECTOR KROLL.
I remember, I remember. Well, how are things going out here?
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, everything is going its quiet, jog - trot way. One day is just like another.—And with you? Your wife——?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Ah, my dear Miss West, don’t let us talk about my affairs. There is always something or other amiss in a family; especially in times like these.
#REBECCA WEST.
How is it you haven’t once been near us during the whole of the holidays?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Oh, it doesn’t do to make oneself a nuisance——
#REBECCA WEST.
If you knew how we have missed you——
#RECTOR KROLL.
And then I have been away——
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, for the last week or two. We have heard of you at political meetings.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, what do you say to that? Did you think I would turn political agitator in my old age, eh?
#REBECCA WEST.
Well, you have always been a bit of an agitator, Rector Kroll.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Why yes, just for my private amusement. But henceforth it is to be no laughing matter, I can tell you.—Do you ever see those radical newspapers?
#REBECCA WEST.
Well yes, my dear Rector, I can’t deny that——
#RECTOR KROLL.
My dear Miss West, I have nothing to say against it—nothing in your case.
#REBECCA WEST.
No, surely not. One likes to know what’s going on—to keep up with the time——
#RECTOR KROLL.
And of course I should not think of expecting you, as a woman, to side actively with either party in the civil contest—I might almost say the civil war—that is raging among us.—But you have seen then, I suppose, how these gentlemen of “the people” have been pleased to treat me? What infamous abuse they have had the audacity to heap on me?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes; but it seems to me you gave as good as you got.
#RECTOR KROLL.
So I did, though I say it that shouldn’t. For now I have tasted blood; and they shall soon find to their cost that I am not the man to turn the other cheek—— But come come—don’t let us get upon that subject this evening—it’s too painful and irritating.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh no, don’t let us talk of it.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Tell me now—how do you get on at Rosmersholm, now that you are alone. Since our poor Beata——
#REBECCA WEST.
Thank you, I get on very well. Of course one feels a great blank in many ways—a great sorrow and longing. But otherwise——
#RECTOR KROLL.
And do you think of remaining here?—permanently, I mean.
#REBECCA WEST.
My dear Rector, I really haven’t thought about it, one way or the other. I have got so used to the place now, that I feel almost as if I belonged to it.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Why, of course you belong to it.
#REBECCA WEST.
And so long as Mr. Rosmer finds that I am of any use or comfort to him—why, so long, I suppose, I shall stay here.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Do you know,—it is really fine for a woman to sacrifice her whole youth to others as you have done.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, what else should I have had to live for?
#RECTOR KROLL.
First, there was your untiring devotion to your paralytic and exacting foster - father——
#REBECCA WEST.
You mustn’t suppose that Dr. West was such a charge when we were up in Finmark. It was those terrible boat - voyages up there that broke him down. But after we came here—well yes, the two years before he found rest were certainly hard enough.
#RECTOR KROLL.
And the years that followed—were they not even harder for you?
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh how can you say such a thing? When I was so fond of Beata—and when she, poor dear, stood so sadly in need of care and forbearance.
#RECTOR KROLL.
How good it is of you to think of her with so much kindness!
#REBECCA WEST.
My dear Rector, you say that with such a ring of sincerity that I cannot think there is any ill - feeling lurking in the background.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Ill - feeling? Why, what do you mean?
#REBECCA WEST.
Well, it would be only natural if you felt it painful to see a stranger managing the household here at Rosmersholm.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Why, how on earth——!
#REBECCA WEST.
But you have no such feeling? Thanks, my dear Rector; thank you again and again.
#RECTOR KROLL.
How on earth did you get such an idea into your head?
#REBECCA WEST.
I began to be a little afraid when your visits became so rare.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Then you have been on a totally wrong scent, Miss West. Besides—after all, there has been no essential change. Even while poor Beata was alive—in her last unhappy days—it was you, and you alone, that managed everything.
#REBECCA WEST.
That was only a sort of regency in Beata’s name.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Be that as it may——. Do you know, Miss West—for my part, I should have no objection whatever if you——. But I suppose I mustn’t say such a thing.
#REBECCA WEST.
What must you not say?
#RECTOR KROLL.
If matters were to shape so that you took the empty place——
#REBECCA WEST.
I have the only place I want, Rector.
#RECTOR KROLL.
In fact, yes; but not in——
#REBECCA WEST.
For shame, Rector Kroll. How can you joke about such things?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Oh well, our good Johannes Rosmer very likely thinks he has had more than enough of married life already. But nevertheless——
#REBECCA WEST.
You are really too absurd, Rector.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Nevertheless——. Tell me, Miss West—if you will forgive the question—what is your age?
#REBECCA WEST.
I’m sorry to say I am over nine - and - twenty, Rector; I am in my thirtieth year.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Indeed. And Rosmer—how old is he? Let me see: he is five years younger than I am, so that makes him well over forty - three. I think it would be most suitable.
#REBECCA WEST.
Of course, of course; most suitable.—Will you stay to supper this evening?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, many thanks; I thought of staying. There is a matter I want to discuss with our good friend.—And I suppose, Miss West, in case you should take fancies into your head again, I had better come out pretty often for the future—as I used to in the old days.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh yes, do—do. Many thanks—how kind and good you are!
#RECTOR KROLL.
Am I? Well, that’s not what they tell me at home. enters by the door on the right.
#REBECCA WEST.
Mr. Rosmer, do you see who is here?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Madam Helseth told me.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Welcome back to this house, my dear Kroll. My dear old friend! I knew that sooner or later things would come all right between us.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Why, my dear fellow—do you mean to say you too have been so foolish as to fancy there was anything wrong?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, only think,—it was nothing but fancy after all!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Is that really the case, Kroll? Then why did you desert us so entirely?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Because my presence would always have been reminding you of the years of your unhappiness, and of—the life that ended in the mill - race.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Well, it was a kind thought—you were always considerate. But it was quite unnecessary to remain away on that account.—Come, sit here on the sofa. No, I assure you, the thought of Beata has no pain for me. We speak of her every day. We feel almost as if she were still one of the household.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Do you really?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, indeed we do.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
It is quite natural. We were both so deeply attached to her. And both Rebec—both Miss West and I know that we did all that was possible for her in her affliction. We have nothing to reproach ourselves with.—So I feel nothing but a tranquil tenderness now at the thought of Beata.
#RECTOR KROLL.
You dear, good people! Henceforward, I declare I shall come out and see you every day.
#REBECCA WEST.
Mind, we shall expect you to keep your word.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
My dear Kroll—I wish very much that our intercourse had never been interrupted. Ever since we have known each other, you have seemed predestined to be my adviser—ever since I went to the University.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, and I have always been proud of the office. But is there anything particular just now——?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
There are many things that I would give a great deal to talk over with you, quite frankly—straight from the heart.
#REBECCA WEST.
Ah yes, Mr. Rosmer—that must be such a comfort—between old friends——
#RECTOR KROLL.
Oh I can tell you I have still more to talk to you about. I suppose you know I have turned a militant politician?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, so you have. How did that come about?
#RECTOR KROLL.
I was forced into it in spite of myself. It is impossible to stand idly looking on any longer. Now that the Radicals have unhappily come into power, it is high time something should be done,—so I have got our little group of friends in the town to close up their ranks. I tell you it is high time!
#REBECCA WEST.
Don’t you think it may even be a little late?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Unquestionably it would have been better if we had checked the stream at an earlier point in its course. But who could foresee what was going to happen? Certainly not I. But now I have had my eyes opened once for all; for now the spirit of revolt has crept into the school itself.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Into the school? Surely not into your school?
#RECTOR KROLL.
I tell you it has—into my own school. What do you think? It has come to my knowledge that the sixth - form boys—a number of them at any rate—have been keeping up a secret society for over six months; and they take in Mortensgård’s paper!
#REBECCA WEST.
The “Beacon”?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes; nice mental sustenance for future government officials, is it not? But the worst of it is that it’s all the cleverest boys in the form that have banded together in this conspiracy against me. Only the dunces at the bottom of the class have kept out of it.
#REBECCA WEST.
Do you take this so very much to heart, Rector?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Do I take it to heart! To be so thwarted and opposed in the work of my whole life! But I could almost say I don’t care about the school—for there is worse behind. I suppose no one can hear us?
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh no, of course not.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Well then, I must tell you that dissension and revolt have crept into my own house—into my own quiet home. They have destroyed the peace of my family life.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What! Into your own house——?
#REBECCA WEST.
My dear Rector, what has happened?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Would you believe that my own children——In short, it is Laurits that is the ringleader of the school conspiracy; and Hilda has embroidered a red portfolio to keep the “Beacon” in.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I should certainly never have dreamt that, in your own house——
#RECTOR KROLL.
No, who would have dreamt of such a thing? In my house, the very home of obedience and order—where one will, and one only, has always prevailed——
#REBECCA WEST.
How does your wife take all this?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Why, that is the most incredible part of it. My wife, who all her life long has shared my opinions and concurred in my views, both in great things and small—she is actually inclined to side with the children on many points. And she blames me for what has happened. She says I tyrannise over the children. As if it weren’t necessary to——. Well, you see how my house is divided against itself. But of course I say as little about it as possible. Such things are best kept quiet. Ah, well, well, well.
#REBECCA WEST.
Do it now!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Not this evening.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, just this evening.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Well, my dear Rosmer, now you know how the spirit of the age has overshadowed both my domestic and my official life. And am I to refrain from combating this pernicious, subversive, anarchic spirit, with any weapon I can lay my hands on? Fight it I will, trust me for that; both with tongue and pen.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Have you any hope of stemming the tide in that way?
#RECTOR KROLL.
At any rate I shall have done my duty as a citizen in defence of the State. And I hold it the duty of every right - minded man with an atom of patriotism to do likewise. In fact—that was my principal reason for coming out here this evening.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Why, my dear Kroll, what do you mean——? What can I——?
#RECTOR KROLL.
You can stand by your old friends. Do as we do. Lend a hand, with all your might.
#REBECCA WEST.
But, Rector Kroll, you know Mr. Rosmer’s distaste for public life.
#RECTOR KROLL.
He must get over his distaste.—You don’t keep abreast of things, Rosmer. You bury yourself alive here, with your historical collections. Far be it from me to speak disrespectfully of family trees and so forth; but, unfortunately, this is no time for hobbies of that sort. You cannot imagine the state things are in, all over the country. There is hardly a single accepted idea that hasn’t been turned topsy - turvy. It will be a gigantic task to get all the errors rooted out again.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I have no doubt of it. But I am the last man to undertake such a task.
#REBECCA WEST.
And besides, I think Mr. Rosmer has come to take a wider view of life than he used to.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Wider?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes; or freer, if you like—less one - sided.
#RECTOR KROLL.
What is the meaning of this? Rosmer—surely you are not so weak as to be influenced by the accident that the leaders of the mob have won a temporary advantage?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
My dear Kroll, you know how little I understand of politics. But I confess it seems to me that within the last few years people are beginning to show greater independence of thought.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Indeed! And you take it for granted that that must be an improvement! But in any case you are quite mistaken, my friend. Just inquire a little into the opinions that are current among the Radicals, both out here and in the town. They are neither more nor less than the wisdom that’s retailed in the “Beacon.”
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes; Mortensgård has great influence over many people hereabouts.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, just think of it! A man of his foul antecedents—a creature that was turned out of his place as a schoolmaster on account of his immoral life! A fellow like that sets himself up as a leader of the people! And succeeds too! Actually succeeds! I hear he is going to enlarge his paper. I know on good authority that he is on the lookout for a capable assistant.
#REBECCA WEST.
I wonder that you and your friends don’t set up an opposition to him.
#RECTOR KROLL.
That is the very thing we are going to do. We have to - day bought the County News; there was no difficulty about the money question. But—— Now I come to my real errand. The difficulty lies in the conduct of the paper—the editing——. Tell me, Rosmer,—don’t you feel it your duty to undertake it, for the sake of the good cause?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I!
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, how can you think of such a thing?
#RECTOR KROLL.
I can quite understand your horror of public meetings, and your reluctance to expose yourself to their tender mercies. But an editor’s work is less conspicuous, or rather——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
No no, my dear friend, you must not ask me to do this.
#RECTOR KROLL.
I should be quite willing to try my own hand at that style of work too; but I couldn’t possibly manage it. I have such a multitude of irons in the fire already. But for you, with no profession to tie you down——. Of course the rest of us would give you as much help as we could.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I cannot, Kroll. I am not fitted for it.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Not fitted? You said the same thing when your father preferred you to the living here——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And I was right. That was why I resigned it.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Oh, if only you are as good an editor as you were a clergyman, we shall not complain.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
My dear Kroll—I tell you once for all—I cannot do it.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Well, at any rate, you will lend us your name.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
My name?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, the mere name, Johannes Rosmer, will be a great thing for the paper. We others are looked upon as confirmed partisans—indeed I hear I am denounced as a desperate fanatic—so that if we work the paper in our own names, we can’t reckon upon its making much way among the misguided masses. You, on the contrary, have always kept out of the fight. Everybody knows and values your humanity and uprightness—your delicacy of mind—your unimpeachable honour. And then the prestige of your former position as a clergyman still clings to you; and, to crown all, you have your grand old family name!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh, my name——
#RECTOR KROLL.
Rosmers of Rosmersholm—clergymen and soldiers; government officials of high place and trust; gentlemen to the finger - tips, every man of them—a family that for nearly two centuries has held its place as the first in the district. Rosmer—you owe it to yourself and to the traditions of your race to take your share in guarding all that has hitherto been held sacred in our society. What do you say, Miss West?
#REBECCA WEST.
My dear Rector—I can’t tell you how ludicrous all this seems to me.
#RECTOR KROLL.
What do you say? Ludicrous?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, ludicrous. For you must let me tell you frankly——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
No no—be quiet! Not just now!
#RECTOR KROLL.
My dear friends, what on earth——? H’m! appears in the doorway on the right.
#MADAM HELSETH.
There’s a man out in the kitchen passage that says he wants to see the Pastor.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Ah, very well. Ask him to come in.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Into the sitting - room?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, of course.
#MADAM HELSETH.
But he looks scarcely the sort of man to bring into the sitting - room.
#REBECCA WEST.
Why, what does he look like, Madam Helseth?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Well, he’s not much to look at Miss, and that’s a fact.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Did he not give his name?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Yes—I think he said his name was Hekman or something of the sort.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I know nobody of that name.
#MADAM HELSETH.
And then he said he was called Uldric too.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Ulric Hetman! Was that it?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Yes, so it was—Hetman.
#RECTOR KROLL.
I’ve surely heard that name before——
#REBECCA WEST.
Wasn’t that the name he used to write under—that strange being——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
It is Ulric Brendel’s pseudonym.
#RECTOR KROLL.
That black sheep Ulric Brendel’s—of course it is.
#REBECCA WEST.
Then he is still alive.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I heard he had joined a company of strolling players.
#RECTOR KROLL.
When last I heard of him, he was in the House of Correction.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Ask him to come in, Madam Helseth.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Oh, very well.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Are you really going to let a man like that into your house?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
You know he was once my tutor.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, I know he went and crammed your head full of revolutionary ideas, until your father showed him the door—with his horsewhip.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Father was a martinet at home as well as in his regiment.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Thank him in his grave for that, my dear Rosmer.—Well!
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Good evening, Johannes!
#RECTOR KROLL.
Excuse me——
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Did you expect to see me again? And within these hated walls too?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Excuse me—— There——
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Right. There he is. Johannes—my boy—my best - beloved——!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
My old teacher.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Notwithstanding certain painful memories, I could not pass by Rosmersholm without paying you a flying visit.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
You are heartily welcome here now. Be sure of that.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Ah, this charming lady——? Mrs. Rosmer, of course.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Miss West. near relation, no doubt. And yonder unknown——? A brother of the cloth, I see.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Rector Kroll.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Kroll? Kroll? Wait a bit?—Weren’t you a student of philology in your young days?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Of course I was.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Why Donnerwetter, then I knew you!
#RECTOR KROLL.
Pardon me——
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Weren’t you——
#RECTOR KROLL.
Pardon me——
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
——one of those myrmidons of morality that got me turned out of the Debating Club?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Very likely. But I disclaim any closer acquaintanceship.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Well, well! Nach Belieben, Herr Doctor. It’s all one to me. Ulric Brendel remains the man he is for all that.
#REBECCA WEST.
You are on your way into town, Mr. Brendel?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
You have hit it, gracious lady. At certain intervals, I am constrained to strike a blow for existence. It goes against the grain; but—enfin—imperious necessity——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh but, my dear Mr. Brendel, you must allow me to help you. In one way or another, I am sure——
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Ha, such a proposal to me! Would you desecrate the bond that unites us? Never, Johannes, never!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But what do you think of doing in town? Believe me, you won’t find it easy to——
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Leave that to me, my boy. The die is cast. Simple as I stand here before you, I am engaged in a comprehensive campaign—more comprehensive than all my previous excursions put together. Dare I ask the Herr Professor—unter uns—have you a tolerably decent, reputable, and commodious Public Hall in your estimable city?
#RECTOR KROLL.
The hall of the Workmen’s Society is the largest.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
And has the Herr Professor any official influence in this doubtless most beneficent Society?
#RECTOR KROLL.
I have nothing to do with it.
#REBECCA WEST.
You should apply to Peter Mortensgård.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Pardon, madame—what sort of an idiot is he?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What makes you take him for an idiot?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Can’t I tell at once by the name that it belongs to a plebeian?
#RECTOR KROLL.
I did not expect that answer.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
But I will conquer my reluctance. There is no alternative. When a man stands—as I do—at a turning - point in his career——. It is settled. I will approach this individual—will open personal negotiations——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Are you really and seriously standing at a turning - point?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Surely my own boy knows that, stand he where he may, Ulric Brendel always stands really and seriously.—Yes, Johannes, I am going to put on a new man—to throw off the modest reserve I have hitherto maintained.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
How——?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
I am about to take hold of life with a strong hand; to step forth; to assert myself. We live in a tempestuous, an equinoctial age.—I am about to lay my mite on the altar of Emancipation.
#RECTOR KROLL.
You too?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Is the local public at all familiar with my occasional writings?
#RECTOR KROLL.
No, I must candidly confess that——
#REBECCA WEST.
I have read several of them. My adopted father had them in his library.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Fair lady, then you have wasted your time. For, let me tell you, they are so much rubbish.
#REBECCA WEST.
Indeed!
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
What you have read, yes. My really important works no man or woman knows. No one—except myself.
#REBECCA WEST.
How does that happen?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Because they are not written.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But, my dear Mr. Brendel——
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
You know, my Johannes, that I am a bit of a Sybarite—a Feinschmecker. I have been so all my days. I like to take my pleasures in solitude; for then I enjoy them doubly—tenfold. So, you see, when golden dreams descended and enwrapped me—when new, dizzy, far - reaching thoughts were born in me, and wafted me aloft on their sustaining pinions—I bodied them forth in poems, visions, pictures—in the rough, as it were, you understand.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, yes.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Oh, what pleasures, what intoxications I have enjoyed in my time! The mysterious bliss of creation—in the rough, as I said—applause, gratitude, renown, the wreath of bays—all these I have garnered with full hands quivering with joy. I have sated myself, in my secret thoughts, with a rapture—oh! so intense, so inebriating——!
#RECTOR KROLL.
H’m.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But you have written nothing down?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Not a word. The soulless toil of the scrivener has always aroused a sickening aversion in me. And besides, why should I profane my own ideals, when I could enjoy them in their purity by myself? But now they shall be offered up. I assure you I feel like a mother who delivers her tender daughters into their bridegrooms’ arms. But I will offer them up, none the less. I will sacrifice them on the altar of Emancipation. A series of carefully elaborated lectures—over the whole country——!
#REBECCA WEST.
This is noble of you, Mr. Brendel! You are yielding up the dearest thing you possess.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
The only thing.
#REBECCA WEST.
How many are there who do as much—who dare do as much?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Who knows?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
My audience is touched. That does my heart good—and steels my will. So now I will proceed to action. Stay—one thing more. Can you tell me, Herr Preceptor,—is there such a thing as a Temperance Society in the town? A Total Abstinence Society? I need scarcely ask.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, there is. I am the president, at your service.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
I saw it in your face! Well, it is by no means impossible that I may come to you and enrol myself as a member for a week.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Excuse me—we don’t receive members by the week.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
À la bonne heure, Herr Pedagogue. Ulric Brendel has never forced himself into that sort of Society. But I must not prolong my stay in this house, so rich in memories. I must get on to the town and select a suitable lodging. I presume there is a decent hotel in the place.
#REBECCA WEST.
Mayn’t I offer you anything before you go?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Of what sort, gracious lady? cup of tea, or——
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
I thank my bountiful hostess—but I am always loath to trespass on private hospitality. Farewell, gentlefolks all! Oh, by the way—Johannes—Pastor Rosmer—for the sake of our ancient friendship, will you do your former teacher a service?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, with all my heart.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Good. Then lend me—for a day or two—a starched shirt—with cuffs.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Nothing else?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
For you see I am travelling on foot—at present. My trunk is being sent after me.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Quite so. But is there nothing else?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Well, do you know—perhaps you could spare me an oldish, well - worn summer overcoat.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, yes; certainly I can.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
And if a respectable pair of boots happened to go along with the coat——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
That we can manage too. As soon as you let us know your address, we will send the things in.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Not on any account. Pray do not let me give you any trouble! I will take the bagatelles with me.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
As you please. Come upstairs with me then.
#REBECCA WEST.
Let me go. Madam Helseth and I will see to it.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
I cannot think of suffering this distinguished lady to——
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, nonsense! Come along, Mr. Brendel.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Tell me—is there nothing else I can do for you?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Upon my word, I know of nothing more. Well, yes, damn it all—now that I think of it——! Johannes, do you happen to have eight crowns in your pocket?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Let me see. Here are two ten - crown notes.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Well well, never mind! I can take them. I can always get them changed in the town. Thanks in the meantime. Remember it was two tenners you lent me. Good - night my own dear boy; Good - night, respected Sir.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Merciful Heaven—so that is the Ulric Brendel people once expected such great things of.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
At least he has had the courage to live his life his own way. I don’t think that is such a small matter either.
#RECTOR KROLL.
What? A life like his! I almost believe he has it in him to turn your head afresh.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh no. My mind is quite clear now, upon all points.
#RECTOR KROLL.
I wish I could believe it, my dear Rosmer. You are so terribly impressionable.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Let us sit down. I want to talk to you.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes; let us.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Don’t you think we lead a pleasant and comfortable life here?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, your life is pleasant and comfortable now—and peaceful. You have found yourself a home, Rosmer. And I have lost mine.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
My dear friend, don’t say that. The wound will heal again in time.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Never; never. The barb will always rankle. Things can never be as they were.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Listen to me, Kroll. We have been fast friends for many and many a year. Does it seem to you conceivable that our friendship should ever go to wreck?
#RECTOR KROLL.
I know of nothing in the world that could estrange us. What puts that into your head?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
You attach such paramount importance to uniformity of opinions and views.
#RECTOR KROLL.
No doubt; but we two are in practical agreement—at any rate on the great essential questions.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
No; not now.
#RECTOR KROLL.
What is this?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
No you must sit still—I entreat you, Kroll.
#RECTOR KROLL.
What can this mean? I don’t understand you. Speak plainly. new summer has blossomed in my soul. I see with eyes grown young again. And so now I stand——
#RECTOR KROLL.
Where—where, Rosmer?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Where your children stand.
#RECTOR KROLL.
You? You! Impossible! Where do you say you stand?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
On the same side as Laurits and Hilda.
#RECTOR KROLL.
An apostate! Johannes Rosmer an apostate!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I should have felt so happy—so intensely happy, in what you call my apostasy. But nevertheless I suffered deeply; for I knew it would be a bitter sorrow to you.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Rosmer—Rosmer! I shall never get over this! To think that you too can find it in your heart to help on the work of corruption and ruin in this unhappy land.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
It is the work of emancipation I wish to help on.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Oh yes, I know. That is what both the tempters and their victims call it. But do you think there is any emancipation to be expected from the spirit that is now poisoning our whole social life?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I am not in love with the spirit that is in the ascendant, nor with either of the contending parties. I will try to bring together men from both sides—as many as I can—and to unite them as closely as possible. I will devote my life and all my energies to this one thing—the creation of a true democracy in this country.
#RECTOR KROLL.
So you don’t think we have democracy enough already! For my part it seems to me we are all in a fair way to be dragged down into the mire, where hitherto only the mob have been able to thrive.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
That is just why I want to awaken the democracy to its true task.
#RECTOR KROLL.
What task?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
That of making all the people of this country noble - men.
#RECTOR KROLL.
All the people——?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
As many as possible, at any rate.
#RECTOR KROLL.
By what means?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
By freeing their minds and purifying their wills.
#RECTOR KROLL.
You are a dreamer, Rosmer. Will you free them? Will you purify them?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
No, my dear friend—I will only try to arouse them to their task. They themselves must accomplish it.
#RECTOR KROLL.
And you think they can?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes.
#RECTOR KROLL.
By their own strength?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, precisely by their own strength. There is no other.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Is this becoming language for a priest?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I am no longer a priest.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Well but—the faith of your fathers——?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
It is mine no more.
#RECTOR KROLL.
No more——!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I have given it up. I had to give it up, Kroll.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Oh, indeed——Yes, yes, yes. I suppose one thing goes with another. Was this, then, your reason for leaving the Church?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes. As soon as my mind was clear—as soon as I was quite certain that this was no passing attack of scepticism, but a conviction I neither could nor would shake off—then I at once left the Church.
#RECTOR KROLL.
So this has been your state of mind all this time! And we—your friends—have heard nothing of it. Rosmer—Rosmer—how could you hide the miserable truth from us!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Because it seemed to me a matter that concerned myself alone. And besides, I did not wish to give you and my other friends any needless pain. I thought I might live on here, as before, quietly, serenely, happily. I wanted to read, to bury myself in all the studies that until then had been sealed books to me. I wanted to make myself thoroughly at home in the great world of truth and freedom that has been revealed to me.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Apostate! Every word proves it. But why, then, do you confess your secret apostasy after all? And why just at this time?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
You yourself have driven me to it, Kroll. Have I driven you——?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
When I heard of your violence on the platform—when I read all the rancorous speeches you made—your bitter onslaughts on your opponents—the contemptuous invectives you heaped on them—oh Kroll, to think that you—you—could come to this!—then my duty stood imperatively before me. Men are growing evil in this struggle. Peace and joy and mutual forbearance must once more enter into our souls. That is why I now intend to step forward and openly avow myself for what I am. I, too, will try my strength. Could not you—from your side—help me in this, Kroll?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Never so long as I live will I make peace with the subversive forces in society.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Then at least let us fight with honourable weapons—since fight we must.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Whoever is not with me in the essential things of life, him I no longer know. I owe him no consideration.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Does that apply to me too?
#RECTOR KROLL.
It is you that have broken with me, Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Is this a breach then?
#RECTOR KROLL.
This! It is a breach with all who have hitherto been your friends. You must take the consequences. enters from the right, and opens the door wide.
#REBECCA WEST.
There now; he is on his way to his great sacrifice. And now we can go to supper. Will you come in, Rector?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Good - night, Miss West. I have nothing more to do here.
#REBECCA WEST.
What is this? Have you spoken?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
He knows everything.
#RECTOR KROLL.
We will not let you go, Rosmer. We will force you to come back to us.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I can never stand where I did.
#RECTOR KROLL.
We shall see. You are not the man to endure standing alone.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I shall not be so completely alone after all.—There are two of us to bear the loneliness together.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Ah——! That too! Beata’s words——!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Beata’s——?
#RECTOR KROLL.
No, no—that was vile. Forgive me.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What? What do you mean?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Don’t ask. Bah! Forgive me! Good - bye!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Kroll! Our friendship must not end like this. I will come and see you to - morrow.
#RECTOR KROLL.
You shall never cross my threshold again.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
It does not matter, Rebecca. We will see it out, we two faithful friends—you and I.
#REBECCA WEST.
What do you think he meant when he said “That was vile”?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Don’t trouble about that, dear. He himself didn’t believe what was in his mind. To - morrow I will go and see him. Good - night!
#REBECCA WEST.
Are you going upstairs so early to - night? After this?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
To - night as usual. I feel so relieved, now it is over. You see—I am quite calm, Rebecca. Do you, too, take it calmly. Good - night!
#REBECCA WEST.
Good - night, dear friend! Sleep well.
#REBECCA WEST.
You can take away the supper things, Madam Helseth. Mr. Rosmer doesn’t want anything, and the Rector has gone home.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Has the Rector gone? What was the matter with him?
#REBECCA WEST.
He said he thought there was a heavy storm brewing——
#MADAM HELSETH.
What a strange notion! There’s not a cloud in the sky this evening.
#REBECCA WEST.
Let us hope he mayn’t meet the White Horse! I’m afraid we shall soon be hearing something from the bogies now.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Lord forgive you, Miss! Don’t say such awful things.
#REBECCA WEST.
Well, well, well——
#MADAM HELSETH.
Do you really think some one is to go soon, Miss?
#REBECCA WEST.
No; why should I think so? But there are so many sorts of white horses in this world, Madam Helseth.—Well, good - night. I shall go to my room now.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Good - night, Miss.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Lord—Lord! That Miss West! The things she does say!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Come in.
#REBECCA WEST.
Good morning.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Good morning, dear. Do you want anything?
#REBECCA WEST.
I only wanted to hear if you had slept well.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh I have had a beautiful, peaceful night. And you?
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh yes, thanks—towards morning——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I don’t know when I have felt so light - hearted as I do now. I am so glad I managed to speak out at last.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, it is a pity you remained silent so long, Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I don’t understand myself how I could be such a coward.
#REBECCA WEST.
It wasn’t precisely cowardice——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh yes, dear—when I think the thing out, I can see there was a touch of cowardice at the bottom of it.
#REBECCA WEST.
All the braver, then, to make the plunge at last. But now I want to tell you of something I have done—and you mustn’t be vexed with me about it.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Vexed? How can you think——?
#REBECCA WEST.
Well, it was perhaps rather indiscreet of me, but——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Let me hear what it was.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yesterday evening, when Ulric Brendel was leaving—I gave him a note to Peter Mortensgård.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Why, my dear Rebecca——Well, what did you say?
#REBECCA WEST.
I said that he would be doing you a service if he would look after that unfortunate creature a little, and help him in any way he could.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Dear, you shouldn’t have done that. You have only done Brendel harm. And Mortensgård is not a man I care to have anything to do with. You know of that old episode between us.
#REBECCA WEST.
But don’t you think it would be as well to make it up with him again? With Mortensgård? In what way do you mean?
#REBECCA WEST.
Well, you know you can’t feel absolutely secure now—after this breach with your old friends.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Can you really believe that Kroll or any of the others would try to take revenge on me? That they would be capable of——?
#REBECCA WEST.
In the first heat of anger, dear——. No one can be sure. I think—after the way the Rector took it——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh, you ought surely to know him better than that. Kroll is a gentleman, to the backbone. I am going into town this afternoon to talk to him. I will talk to them all. Oh you shall see how easily it will all go—— appears at the door on the left.
#REBECCA WEST.
What is it, Madam Helseth?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Rector Kroll is downstairs in the hall.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Kroll!
#REBECCA WEST.
The Rector! Is it possible——
#MADAM HELSETH.
He wants to know if he may come up and see Mr. Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What did I tell you?—Of course he may. Come up, dear friend! I am delighted to see you.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I knew it couldn’t be the last time——
#RECTOR KROLL.
I see things to - day in quite a different light from yesterday.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Ah yes, Kroll; I was sure you would, now that you have had time to reflect.
#RECTOR KROLL.
You misunderstand me completely. It is of the utmost importance that I should speak to you, alone.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Why may not Miss West——?
#REBECCA WEST.
No no, Mr. Rosmer. I will go.
#RECTOR KROLL.
And I must ask Miss West to excuse my coming at such an untimely hour—taking her unawares before she has had time to——
#REBECCA WEST.
What do you mean? Do you see any harm in my wearing a morning gown about the house?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Heaven forbid! I know nothing of what may now be customary at Rosmersholm.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Why, Kroll—you are not yourself to - day!
#REBECCA WEST.
Allow me to wish you good morning, Rector Kroll.
#RECTOR KROLL.
By your leave——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, Kroll, sit down, and let us talk things out amicably.
#RECTOR KROLL.
I haven’t closed an eye since yesterday. I have been lying thinking and thinking all night.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And what do you say to things to - day?
#RECTOR KROLL.
It will be a long story, Rosmer. Let me begin with a sort of introduction. I can give you news of Ulric Brendel.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Has he called on you?
#RECTOR KROLL.
No. He took up his quarters in a low public - house—in the lowest company of course—and drank and stood treat as long as he had any money. Then he began abusing the whole company as a set of disreputable blackguards—and so far he was quite right—whereupon they thrashed him and pitched him out into the gutter.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
So he is incorrigible after all.
#RECTOR KROLL.
He had pawned the coat too; but I am told that has been redeemed for him. Can you guess by whom?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Perhaps by you?
#RECTOR KROLL.
No; by the distinguished Mr. Mortensgård.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Ah, indeed.
#RECTOR KROLL.
I understand that Mr. Brendel’s first visit was to the “idiot” and “plebeian.”
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Well, it was lucky for him——
#RECTOR KROLL.
To be sure it was. And that brings me to a matter it is my duty to warn you about, for our old—for our former friendship’s sake.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
My dear Kroll, what can that be?
#RECTOR KROLL.
It is this: there are things going on behind your back in this house.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
How can you think so? Is it Reb—is it Miss West you are aiming at?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Precisely. I can quite understand it on her part. She has so long been accustomed to have everything her own way here. But nevertheless——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
My dear Kroll, you are utterly mistaken. She and I—we have no concealments from each other on any subject whatever.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Has she told you, then, that she has entered into correspondence with the editor of the “Beacon”?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh, you are thinking of the few lines she sent by Ulric Brendel?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Then you have found it out. And do you approve of her entering into relations with a scurrilous scribbler, who never lets a week pass without holding me up to ridicule, both as a schoolmaster and as a public man?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
My dear Kroll, I don’t suppose that side of the matter ever entered her head. And besides, of course she has full liberty of action, just as I have.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Indeed? Ah, no doubt that follows from your new line of thought. For Miss West presumably shares your present standpoint?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, she does. We two have worked our way forward in faithful comradeship.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Oh, you blind, deluded being! Why do you say that?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Because I dare not—I will not think the worst. No no, let me say my say out.—You really do value my friendship, Rosmer? And my respect too? Do you not?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I surely need not answer that question.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Well, but there are other questions that do require an answer—a full explanation on your part.—Will you submit to a sort of investigation——?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Investigation?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes; will you let me question you about certain things it may pain you to be reminded of? You see—this apostasy of yours—well, this emancipation, as you call it—is bound up with many other things that for your own sake you must explain to me.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
My dear Kroll, ask what questions you please. I have nothing to conceal.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Then tell me—what do you think was the real, the ultimate reason why Beata put an end to her life?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Can you have any doubt on the subject? Or, rather, can you ask for reasons for what an unhappy, irresponsible invalid may do?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Are you certain that Beata was completely irresponsible for her actions? The doctors, at any rate, were by no means convinced of it.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
If the doctors had ever seen her as I have so often seen her, for days and nights together, they would have had no doubts.
#RECTOR KROLL.
I had no doubts either—then.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh no, unhappily, there wasn’t the smallest room for doubt. I have told you of her wild frenzies of passion—which she expected me to return. Oh, how they appalled me! And then her causeless, consuming self - reproaches during the last few years.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, when she had learnt that she must remain childless all her life.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, just think of that! Such terrible, haunting agony of mind about a thing utterly beyond her control——! How could you call her responsible for her actions?
#RECTOR KROLL.
H’m———. Can you remember whether you had any books in the house at that time treating of the rationale of marriage—according to the “advanced” ideas of the day.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I remember Miss West lending me a work of the kind. The Doctor left her his library, you know. But, my dear Kroll, you surely cannot suppose we were so reckless as to let my poor sick wife get hold of any such ideas? I can solemnly assure you that the fault was not ours. It was her own distempered brain that drove her into these wild aberrations.
#RECTOR KROLL.
One thing at any rate I can tell you; and that is, that poor, overstrung, tortured Beata put an end to her life in order that you might live happily—live freely, and—after your own heart.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What do you mean by that?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Listen to me quietly, Rosmer; for now I can speak of it. In the last year of her life she came to me twice to pour forth all her anguish and despair.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
On this same subject?
#RECTOR KROLL.
No. The first time she came, it was to declare that you were on the road to perversion—that you were going to break with the faith of your fathers.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What you say is impossible, Kroll! Absolutely impossible! You must be mistaken.
#RECTOR KROLL.
And why?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Because while Beata was alive I was still wrestling with myself in doubt. And that fight I fought out alone and in utter silence, I don’t think even Rebecca——
#RECTOR KROLL.
Rebecca?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh well—Miss West. I call her Rebecca for convenience’ sake.
#RECTOR KROLL.
So I have remarked.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
So it is inconceivable to me how Beata could have got hold of the idea. And why did she not speak to me myself about it? She never did—she never said a single word.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Poor creature—she begged and implored me to talk to you.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And why did you not?
#RECTOR KROLL.
At that time I never for a moment doubted that she was out of her mind. Such an accusation against a man like you!—And then she came again—about a month later. This time she seemed outwardly calmer; but as she was going she said: “They may soon expect the White Horse at Rosmersholm now.”
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, yes. The White Horse—she often spoke of it.
#RECTOR KROLL.
And when I tried to divert her mind from such melancholy fancies, she only answered: “I have not long to live; for Johannes must marry Rebecca at once.”
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What do you say? I marry——?
#RECTOR KROLL.
That was on a Thursday afternoon——. On the Saturday evening she threw herself from the bridge into the mill - race.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And you never warned us——!
#RECTOR KROLL.
You know very well how often she used to say that she felt her end was near.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, I know. But nevertheless—you should have warned us!
#RECTOR KROLL.
I did think of it; but not till too late.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But afterwards, why did you not——? Why have you said nothing about all this?
#RECTOR KROLL.
What good would it have done for me to come torturing and harassing you still further? I took all she said for mere wild, empty ravings—until yesterday evening.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Then you have now changed your opinion?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Did not Beata see quite clearly when she declared you were about to desert the faith of your fathers?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I cannot understand it. It is the most incomprehensible thing in the world.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Incomprehensible or not—there it is. And now I ask you, Rosmer,—how much truth is there in her other accusation? The last one, I mean.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Accusation? Was that an accusation?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Perhaps you did not notice the way she worded it. She had to go, she said—why?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
In order that I might marry Rebecca——
#RECTOR KROLL.
These were not precisely her words. Beata used a different expression. She said: “I have not long to live; for Johannes must marry Rebecca at once.”
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Now I understand you, Kroll.
#RECTOR KROLL.
And what then? What is your answer?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
To such an unheard - of——? The only fitting answer would be to point to the door.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Well and good.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Listen to me. For more than a year—ever since Beata left us—Rebecca West and I have lived alone here at Rosmersholm. During all that time you have known of Beata’s accusation against us. But I have never for a moment noticed that you disapproved of Rebecca’s living in my house.
#RECTOR KROLL.
I did not know till yesterday evening that it was an unbelieving man who was living with an—emancipated woman.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Ah——! Then you do not believe that purity of mind is to be found among the unbelieving and the emancipated? You do not believe that morality may be an instinctive law of their nature!
#RECTOR KROLL.
I have no great faith in the morality that is not founded on the teachings of the Church.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And you mean this to apply to Rebecca and me? To the relation between us two——?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Not even out of consideration for you two can I depart from my opinion that there is no unfathomable gulf between free thought and—h’m——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And what?
#RECTOR KROLL.
——and free love,—since you will have it.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And you are not ashamed to say this to me! You, who have known me from my earliest youth!
#RECTOR KROLL.
For that very reason. I know how easily you are influenced by the people you associate with. And this Rebecca of yours—well, Miss West then—we really know little or nothing about her. In short, Rosmer—I will not give you up. And you—you must try to save yourself in time.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Save myself? How——? peeps in at the door on the left.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What do you want?
#MADAM HELSETH.
I wanted to ask Miss West to step downstairs.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Miss West is not up here.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Isn’t she? Well, that’s strange.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
You were saying——?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Listen to me. I am not going to inquire too closely into the secret history of what went on here in Beata’s lifetime—and may still be going on. I know that your marriage was a most unhappy one; and I suppose that must be taken as some sort of excuse——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh, how little you really know me——!
#RECTOR KROLL.
Don’t interrupt me. What I mean is this: if your present mode of life with Miss West is to continue, it is absolutely necessary that the change of views—the unhappy backsliding—brought about by her evil influence, should be hushed up. Let me speak! Let me speak! I say, if the worst comes to the worst, in Heaven’s name think and believe whatever you like about everything under the sun. But you must keep your views to yourself. These things are purely personal matters, after all. There is no need to proclaim them from the housetops.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I feel it an absolute necessity to get out of a false and equivocal position.
#RECTOR KROLL.
But you have a duty towards the traditions of your race, Rosmer! Remember that! Rosmersholm has, so to speak, radiated morality and order from time immemorial—yes, and respectful conformity to all that is accepted and sanctioned by the best people. The whole district has taken its stamp from Rosmersholm. It would lead to deplorable, irremediable confusion if it were known that you had broken with what I may call the hereditary idea of the house of Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
My dear Kroll, I cannot see the matter in that light. I look upon it as my imperative duty to spread a little light and gladness here, where the Rosmer family has from generation to generation been a centre of darkness and oppression.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, that would be a worthy life - work for the last of your race! No, Rosmer; let such things alone; you are the last man for such a task. You were born to be a quiet student.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Perhaps so. But for once in a way I mean to bear my part in the battle of life.
#RECTOR KROLL.
And do you know what that battle of life will mean for you? It will mean a life - and - death struggle with all your friends.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
They cannot all be such fanatics as you.
#RECTOR KROLL.
You are a credulous creature, Rosmer. An inexperienced creature too. You have no conception of the overwhelming storm that will burst upon you. looks in at the door on the left.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Miss West wants to know——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What is it?
#MADAM HELSETH.
There’s a man downstairs wanting to have a word with the Pastor.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Is it the man who was here yesterday evening?
#MADAM HELSETH.
No, it’s that Mortensgård.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Mortensgård?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Aha! So it has come to this, has it?—Already!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What does he want with me? Why didn’t you send him away?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Miss West said I was to ask if he might come upstairs.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Tell him I’m engaged——
#RECTOR KROLL.
Let him come up, Madam Helseth.
#RECTOR KROLL.
I retire from the field—for the moment. But the main battle has yet to be fought.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
On my honour, Kroll—I have nothing whatever to do with Mortensgård.
#RECTOR KROLL.
I do not believe you. On no subject and in no relation whatever will I henceforth believe you. It is war to the knife now. We will try whether we cannot disarm you.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh Kroll—how low—how very low you have sunk! And you think you have the right to say that to me! Remember Beata!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Still harping upon that?
#RECTOR KROLL.
No. You must solve the enigma of the mill - race according to your own conscience—if you have anything of the sort left. enters softly and quietly from the left. He is a small, wiry man with thin reddish hair and beard.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Ah, here we have the “Beacon”—burning at Rosmersholm! Well, now I can no longer hesitate what course to steer.
#MORTENSGARD.
The “Beacon” may always be relied upon to light the Rector home.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes; you have long shown your goodwill. To be sure there’s a commandment about bearing false witness against your neighbour——
#MORTENSGARD.
Rector Kroll need not instruct me in the commandments.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Not even in the seventh?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Kroll——!
#MORTENSGARD.
If I needed instruction, it would rather be the Pastor’s business.
#RECTOR KROLL.
The Pastor’s? Oh yes, unquestionably Pastor Rosmer is the man for that.—Good luck to your conference, gentlemen!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Well, well—so be it then. Will you be good enough to tell me, Mr. Mortensgård, what brings you out here to me?
#MORTENSGARD.
It was really Miss West I came to see. I wanted to thank her for the friendly note I received from her yesterday.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I know she wrote to you. Have you seen her then?
#MORTENSGARD.
Yes, for a short time. I hear there has been a certain change of views out here at Rosmersholm.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
My views are altered in many respects. I might almost say in all.
#MORTENSGARD.
So Miss West told me; and that’s why she thought I had better come up and talk things over with the Pastor.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What things, Mr. Mortensgård?
#MORTENSGARD.
May I announce in the “Beacon” that there has been a change in your views—that you have joined the party of freedom and progress?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Certainly you may. In fact, I beg you to make the announcement.
#MORTENSGARD.
Then it shall appear in to - morrow’s paper. It will cause a great sensation when it’s known that Pastor Rosmer of Rosmersholm is prepared to take up arms for the cause of light, in that sense too.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I don’t quite understand you.
#MORTENSGARD.
I mean that the moral position of our party is greatly strengthened whenever we gain an adherent of serious, Christian principles.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Then you do not know——? Did not Miss West tell you that too?
#MORTENSGARD.
What, Pastor Rosmer? Miss West was in a great hurry. She said I was to go upstairs and hear the rest from yourself.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Well, in that case I may tell you that I have emancipated myself entirely, and on every side. I have broken with all the dogmas of the Church. Henceforth they are nothing to me.
#MORTENSGARD.
Well—if the skies were to fall I couldn’t be more——! Pastor Rosmer himself announces——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, I now stand where you have stood for many years. That, too, you may announce in the “Beacon” to - morrow.
#MORTENSGARD.
That too? No, my dear Pastor—excuse me—I don’t think it would be wise to touch on that side of the matter.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Not touch on it?
#MORTENSGARD.
Not at present, I mean.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I don’t understand——
#MORTENSGARD.
Well you see, Pastor Rosmer—you probably don’t know the ins and outs of things so well as I do. But, since you have come over to the party of freedom—and, as I hear from Miss West, you intend to take an active share in the movement—I presume you would like to be of as much service as possible, both to the cause in general and to this particular agitation.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, that is my earnest wish.
#MORTENSGARD.
Good. But now I must tell you, Pastor Rosmer, that if you openly declare your defection from the Church, you tie your own hands at the very outset.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Do you think so?
#MORTENSGARD.
Yes; believe me, you won’t be able to do much for the cause, in this part of the country at any rate. And besides—we have plenty of freethinkers already, Pastor Rosmer—I might almost say too many. What the party requires, is a Christian element—something that every one must respect. That is what we are sadly in need of. And therefore I advise you to keep your own counsel about what doesn’t concern the public. That’s my view of the matter, at least.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I understand. Then if I openly confess my apostasy, you dare not have anything to do with me?
#MORTENSGARD.
I scarcely like to risk it, Pastor Rosmer. I have made it a rule for some time past not to support any one or anything that is actively opposed to the Church.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Then you have yourself returned to the Church?
#MORTENSGARD.
That concerns no one but myself.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Ah, so that is it. Now I understand you.
#MORTENSGARD.
Pastor Rosmer—you ought to remember that I—I in particular—have not full liberty of action.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What hampers you?
#MORTENSGARD.
The fact that I am a marked man.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Ah—indeed.
#MORTENSGARD.
marked man, Pastor Rosmer. You, above all men, should remember that; for I have chiefly you to thank for the scandal that branded me.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
If I had then stood where I stand now, I should have dealt more gently with your offence.
#MORTENSGARD.
That I don’t doubt. But it is too late now. You have branded me once for all—branded me for life. I suppose you can scarcely understand what that means. But now you may perhaps come to feel the smart of it yourself, Pastor Rosmer.
#MORTENSGARD.
Yes. You surely don’t suppose that Rector Kroll and his set will ever forgive a desertion like yours? I hear the “County News” is going to be very savage in future. You too may find yourself a marked man before long.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
In personal matters, Mr. Mortensgård, I feel myself secure from attack. My life is beyond reproach.
#MORTENSGARD.
That’s a large word, Mr. Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Perhaps; but I have a right to use it.
#MORTENSGARD.
Even if you were to scrutinise your conduct as closely as you once scrutinised mine?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Your tone is very curious. What are you hinting at? Anything definite?
#MORTENSGARD.
Yes, something definite. Only one thing. But that might be bad enough, if malicious opponents got wind of it.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Will you have the kindness to let me hear what it is?
#MORTENSGARD.
Cannot you guess for yourself, Pastor?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
No, certainly not. I have not the slightest idea.
#MORTENSGARD.
Well well, I suppose I must come out with it then.—I have in my possession a strange letter, dated from Rosmersholm.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Miss West’s letter, do you mean? Is it so strange?
#MORTENSGARD.
No, there’s nothing strange about that. But I once received another letter from this house.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Also from Miss West?
#MORTENSGARD.
No, Mr. Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Well then, from whom? From whom?
#MORTENSGARD.
From the late Mrs. Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
From my wife! You received a letter from my wife!
#MORTENSGARD.
I did.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
When?
#MORTENSGARD.
Towards the close of Mrs. Rosmer’s life. Perhaps about a year and a half ago. That is the letter I call strange.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I suppose you know that my wife’s mind was affected at that time.
#MORTENSGARD.
Yes; I know many people thought so. But I don’t think there was anything in the letter to show it. When I call it strange, I mean in another sense.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And what in the world did my poor wife take it into her head to write to you about?
#MORTENSGARD.
I have the letter at home. She begins to the effect that she is living in great anxiety and fear; there are so many malicious people about here, she says; and they think of nothing but causing you trouble and injury.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Me?
#MORTENSGARD.
Yes, so she says. And then comes the strangest part of all. Shall I go on, Pastor Rosmer?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Assuredly! Tell me everything, without reserve.
#MORTENSGARD.
The deceased lady begs and implores me to be magnanimous. She knows, she says, that it was her husband that had me dismissed from my post as teacher; and she conjures me by all that’s sacred not to avenge myself.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
How did she suppose you could avenge yourself?
#MORTENSGARD.
The letter says that if I should hear rumours of sinful doings at Rosmersholm, I am not to believe them; they are only spread abroad by wicked people who wish to make you unhappy.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Is all that in the letter?
#MORTENSGARD.
You may read it for yourself, sir, when you please.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But I don’t understand——! What did she imagine the rumours to be about?
#MORTENSGARD.
Firstly, that the Pastor had deserted the faith of his fathers. Your wife denied that absolutely—then. And next—h’m——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Next?
#MORTENSGARD.
Well, next she writes—rather confusedly—that she knows nothing of any sinful intrigue at Rosmersholm; that she has never been wronged in any way. And if any such rumours should get about, she implores me to say nothing of the matter in the “Beacon.”
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Is no name mentioned?
#MORTENSGARD.
None.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Who brought you the letter?
#MORTENSGARD.
I have promised not to say. It was handed to me one evening, at dusk.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
If you had made inquiries at the time, you would have learnt that my poor unhappy wife was not fully accountable for her actions.
#MORTENSGARD.
I did make inquiries, Pastor Rosmer. But I must say that was not the impression I received.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Was it not?—But what is your precise reason for telling me now about this incomprehensible old letter?
#MORTENSGARD.
To impress on you the necessity for extreme prudence, Pastor Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
In my life, do you mean?
#MORTENSGARD.
Yes. You must remember that from to - day you have ceased to be a neutral.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Then you have quite made up your mind that I must have something to conceal?
#MORTENSGARD.
I don’t know why an emancipated man should refrain from living his life out as fully as possible. But, as I said before, be exceedingly cautious in future. If anything should get abroad that conflicts with current prejudices, you may be sure the whole liberal movement will have to suffer for it.—Good - bye, Pastor Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Good - bye.
#MORTENSGARD.
I shall go straight to the office and have the great news put into the “Beacon.”
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes; omit nothing.
#MORTENSGARD.
I shall omit nothing that the public need know.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Rebecca! Re—— H’m. Madam Helseth,—is Miss West not there?
#MADAM HELSETH.
No, Pastor Rosmer, she’s not here.
#REBECCA WEST.
Rosmer!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What! Were you in my room? My dear, what were you doing there?
#REBECCA WEST.
I was listening.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh, Rebecca, how could you?
#REBECCA WEST.
I could not help it. He said it so hatefully—that about my morning gown——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Then you were there when Kroll——?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes. I wanted to know what was lurking in his mind.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I would have told you.
#REBECCA WEST.
You would scarcely have told me all. And certainly not in his own words.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Did you hear everything, then?
#REBECCA WEST.
Nearly everything, I think. I had to go downstairs for a moment when Mortensgård came.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And then you came back again——?
#REBECCA WEST.
Don’t be vexed with me, dear friend!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Do whatever you think right. You are mistress of your own actions.—But what do you say to all this, Rebecca——? Oh, I seem never to have needed you so much before!
#REBECCA WEST.
Both you and I have been prepared for what must happen some time.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
No, no—not for this.
#REBECCA WEST.
Not for this?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I knew well enough that sooner or later our beautiful, pure friendship might be misinterpreted and soiled. Not by Kroll—I could never have believed such a thing of him—but by all those other people with the coarse souls and the ignoble eyes. Oh yes—I had reason enough for keeping our alliance so jealously concealed. It was a dangerous secret.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, why should we care what all those people think! We know in our own hearts that we are blameless.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Blameless? I? Yes, I thought so—till to - day. But now—now, Rebecca——?
#REBECCA WEST.
Well, what now?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
How am I to explain Beata’s terrible accusation?
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, don’t speak of Beata! Don’t think of Beata any more! You were just beginning to shake off the hold she has upon you, even in the grave.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Since I have heard all this, she seems, in a ghastly sort of way, to be alive again.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh no—not that, Rosmer! Not that!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, I tell you. We must try to get to the bottom of this. What can possibly have led her to misinterpret things so fatally?
#REBECCA WEST.
You are surely not beginning to doubt that she was on the very verge of insanity?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh yes—that is just what I can’t feel quite certain of any longer. And besides—even if she was——
#REBECCA WEST.
If she was? Well, what then?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I mean—where are we to look for the determining cause that drove her morbid spirit over the border - line of madness?
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, why brood over problems no one can solve?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I cannot help it, Rebecca. I cannot shake off these gnawing doubts, however much I may wish to.
#REBECCA WEST.
But it may become dangerous—this eternal dwelling upon one miserable subject.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I must have betrayed myself in one way or another. She must have noticed how happy I began to feel from the time you came to us.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes but, dear, even if she did——?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Be sure it didn’t escape her that we read the same books—that the interest of discussing all the new ideas drew us together. Yet I cannot understand it! I was so careful to spare her. As I look back, it seems to me I made it the business of my life to keep her in ignorance of all our interests. Did I not, Rebecca?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, yes; certainly you did.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And you too. And yet——! Oh, it’s terrible to think of! She must have gone about here—full of her morbid passion—saying never a word—watching us—noting everything—and misinterpreting everything.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, I should never have come to Rosmersholm!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
To think of all she must have suffered in silence! All the foulness her sick brain must have conjured up around us! Did she never say anything to you to put you at all on the alert?
#REBECCA WEST.
To me! Do you think I should have stayed a day longer if she had?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
No, no, of course not.—Oh, what a battle she must have fought! And alone too, Rebecca; desperate and quite alone!—and then, at last, that heart - breaking, accusing victory—in the mill - race.
#REBECCA WEST.
Listen, Rosmer. If it were in your power to call Beata back—to you—to Rosmersholm—would you do it?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh, how do I know what I would or would not do? I can think of nothing but this one thing—that cannot be recalled.
#REBECCA WEST.
You were just beginning to live, Rosmer. You had begun. You had freed yourself—on every side. You felt so buoyant and happy——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh yes—I did indeed.—And now this crushing blow falls on me.
#REBECCA WEST.
How beautiful it was when we sat in the twilight, in the room downstairs, helping each other to lay out our new life - plans! You were to set resolutely to work in the world—the living world of to - day, as you said. You were to go as a messenger of emancipation from home to home; to win over minds and wills; to create noble - men around you in wider and wider circles. Noble - men.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Happy noble - men.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes—happy.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
For it is happiness that ennobles, Rebecca.
#REBECCA WEST.
Should you not say—sorrow as well? A great sorrow?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes—if one can get through it—over it—away from it.
#REBECCA WEST.
That is what you must do.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I shall never get over this—wholly. There will always be a doubt—a question left. I can never again know that luxury of the soul which makes life so marvellously sweet to live!
#REBECCA WEST.
What is it you mean, Rosmer?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Peaceful, happy innocence.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes. Innocence.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And what extraordinary penetration she showed! How systematically she put all this together! First she begins to doubt my orthodoxy——How could that occur to her? But it did occur to her; and then it grew to be a certainty. And then—yes, then of course it was easy for her to think all the rest possible. Oh, all these horrible imaginings! I shall never get rid of them. I feel it. I know it. At any moment they will come rushing in upon me, and bring back the thought of the dead!
#REBECCA WEST.
Like the White Horse of Rosmersholm.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, like that. Rushing forth in the darkness—in the silence.
#REBECCA WEST.
And because of this miserable figment of the brain, you will let slip the hold you were beginning to take upon the living world?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
You may well think it hard. Yes, hard, Rebecca. But I have no choice. How could I ever leave this behind me?
#REBECCA WEST.
By entering into new relations.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
New relations?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, new relations to the outside world. Live, work, act. Don’t sit here brooding and groping among insoluble enigmas.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
New relations? One question occurs to me. Has it not occurred to you too, Rebecca?
#REBECCA WEST.
Let me—hear—what it is?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What form do you think our relations will take after to - day?
#REBECCA WEST.
I believe our friendship will endure—come what may.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
That is not exactly what I meant. The thing that first brought us together, and that unites us so closely—our common faith in a pure comradeship between man and woman——
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, yes—what of that?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I mean, that such a relation—as this of ours—does it not presuppose a quiet, happy, peaceful life——?
#REBECCA WEST.
What then?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But the life I must now look forward too is one of struggle and unrest and strong agitations. For I will live my life, Rebecca! I will not be crushed to earth by horrible possibilities. I will not have my course of life forced upon me, either by the living or by—any one else.
#REBECCA WEST.
No, no—do not! Be an absolutely free man, Rosmer!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But can you not guess what is in my mind? Do you not know? Don’t you see how I can best shake off all gnawing memories—all the unhappy past?
#REBECCA WEST.
How?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
By opposing to it a new, a living reality.
#REBECCA WEST.
A living——What do you mean?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Rebecca—if I were to ask you—will you be my second wife?
#REBECCA WEST.
Your wife! Your——! I!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Come; let us try it. We two will be one. The place of the dead must stand empty no longer.
#REBECCA WEST.
I—in Beata’s place——!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Then she will be out of the saga—completely—for ever and ever.
#REBECCA WEST.
Do you believe that, Rosmer?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
It must be so! It must! I cannot—I will not go through life with a dead body on my back. Help me to cast it off, Rebecca. And let us stifle all memories in freedom, in joy, in passion. You shall be to me the only wife I have ever had.
#REBECCA WEST.
Never speak of this again. I will never be your wife.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What! Never! Do you not think you could come to love me? Is there not already a strain of love in our friendship?
#REBECCA WEST.
Don’t speak so, Rosmer! Don’t say such things!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, yes—there is a growing promise in our relation. Oh, I can see that you feel it too. Do you not, Rebecca?
#REBECCA WEST.
Listen to me. I tell you—if you persist in this, I will go away from Rosmersholm.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Go away! You! You cannot. It is impossible.
#REBECCA WEST.
It is still more impossible that I should be your wife. Never in this world can I marry you.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
You say “can”; and you say it so strangely. Why can you not?
#REBECCA WEST.
Dear friend—both for your own sake and for mine—do not ask why. Do not, Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Henceforth I can think of nothing but that one question—why?
#REBECCA WEST.
Then it is all over.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Between you and me?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
It will never be all over between us two. You will never leave Rosmersholm.
#REBECCA WEST.
No, perhaps I shall not. But if you ask me again—it is all over.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
All over? How———?
#REBECCA WEST.
For then I will go the way that Beata went. Now you know it, Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Rebecca——?
#REBECCA WEST.
Now you know it.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What—is—this?
#REBECCA WEST.
I can’t understand the Pastor remaining so long upstairs to - day.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Oh, he often does that. But he’ll soon be down now, I should think.
#REBECCA WEST.
Have you seen anything of him?
#MADAM HELSETH.
I caught a glimpse of him when I went upstairs with his coffee. He was in his bedroom, dressing.
#REBECCA WEST.
I asked because he was a little out of sorts yesterday.
#MADAM HELSETH.
He didn’t look well. I wonder if there isn’t something amiss between him and his brother - in - law.
#REBECCA WEST.
What do you think it can be?
#MADAM HELSETH.
I couldn’t say. Perhaps it’s that Mortensgård that has been setting them against each other.
#REBECCA WEST.
Likely enough.—Do you know anything of this Peter Mortensgård?
#MADAM HELSETH.
No indeed. How could you think so, Miss? A fellow like him.
#REBECCA WEST.
Do you mean because he edits such a low paper?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Oh, it’s not only that.—You must have heard, Miss, that he had a child by a married woman that had been deserted by her husband?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, I have heard of it. But it must have been long before I came here.
#MADAM HELSETH.
It’s true he was very young at the time; and she should have known better. He wanted to marry her too; but of course he couldn’t do that. And I don’t say he hasn’t paid dear for it.—But, good Lord, Mortensgård has got on in the world since those days. There’s a many people run after him now.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, most of the poor people bring their affairs to him when they’re in any trouble.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Ah, and others too, perhaps, besides the poor folk——
#REBECCA WEST.
Indeed.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Perhaps the last people you would think likely to, Miss.
#REBECCA WEST.
Come now, that’s only an idea of yours, Madam Helseth. You can’t be sure of what you’re saying.
#MADAM HELSETH.
You think I can’t, Miss? But I can tell you I am. Why—if you must know it—I once took a letter in to Mortensgård myself.
#REBECCA WEST.
No—did you?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Yes, indeed I did. And a letter that was written here at Rosmersholm too.
#REBECCA WEST.
Really, Madam Helseth?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Yes, that it was. And it was on fine paper, and there was a fine red seal on it too.
#REBECCA WEST.
And it was given to you to deliver? Then, my dear Madam Helseth, it’s not difficult to guess who wrote it.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Well?
#REBECCA WEST.
It must have been something that poor Mrs. Rosmer, in her morbid state——
#MADAM HELSETH.
It’s you that say that, Miss, not me.
#REBECCA WEST.
But what was in the letter? Oh, I forgot——you can’t know that.
#MADAM HELSETH.
H’m; what if I did know it, all the same?
#REBECCA WEST.
Did she tell you what she was writing about?
#MADAM HELSETH.
No, she didn’t exactly do that. But Mortensgård, when he’d read it, he began questioning me backwards and forwards and up and down, so that I soon guessed what was in it.
#REBECCA WEST.
Then what do you think it was? Oh my dear good Madam Helseth, do tell me.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Oh no, Miss. Not for the whole world.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh you can surely tell me. We two are such good friends.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Lord preserve me from telling you anything about that, Miss. I can only tell you that it was something horrible that they’d got the poor sick lady to believe.
#REBECCA WEST.
Who had got her to believe it?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Wicked people, Miss West. Wicked people.
#REBECCA WEST.
Wicked——?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Yes, I say it again. They must have been real wicked people.
#REBECCA WEST.
And who do you think it could have been?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Oh, I know well enough what to think. But Lord forbid I should say anything. To be sure there’s a certain lady in the town—h’m!
#REBECCA WEST.
I can see that you mean Mrs. Kroll.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Ah, she’s a fine one, she is. She has always been the great lady with me. And she’s never had any too much love for you neither.
#REBECCA WEST.
Do you think Mrs. Rosmer was in her right mind when she wrote that letter to Mortensgård?
#MADAM HELSETH.
It’s a queer thing a person’s mind, Miss. Clean out of her mind I don’t think she was.
#REBECCA WEST.
But she seemed to go distracted when she learned that she must always be childless. It was that that unsettled her reason.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Yes, poor lady, that was a dreadful blow to her.
#REBECCA WEST.
But after all—don’t you think it was a good thing for the Pastor, Madam Helseth?
#MADAM HELSETH.
What, Miss?
#REBECCA WEST.
That there were no children. Don’t you think so?
#MADAM HELSETH.
H’m, I’m sure I don’t know what to say about that.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh yes, believe me, it was fortunate for him. Pastor Rosmer is not the man to have crying children about his house.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Ah, Miss, little children don’t cry at Rosmersholm.
#REBECCA WEST.
Don’t cry?
#MADAM HELSETH.
No. As long as people can remember, children have never been known to cry in this house.
#REBECCA WEST.
That’s very strange.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Yes; isn’t it? But it runs in the family. And then there’s another strange thing. When they grow up, they never laugh. Never, as long as they live.
#REBECCA WEST.
Why, how extraordinary——
#MADAM HELSETH.
Have you ever once heard or seen the Pastor laugh, Miss?
#REBECCA WEST.
No—now that I think of it, I almost believe you are right. But I don’t think any one laughs much in this part of the country.
#MADAM HELSETH.
No, they don’t. They say it began at Rosmersholm. And then I suppose it spread round about, as if it was catching - like.
#REBECCA WEST.
You are a very wise woman, Madam Helseth.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Oh, Miss, you mustn’t sit there and make fun of me. Hush, hush—here’s the Pastor coming down. He doesn’t like to see dusting going on.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Good morning, Rebecca.
#REBECCA WEST.
Good morning, dear. Are you going out?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes.
#REBECCA WEST.
It’s a beautiful day.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
You didn’t look in on me this morning.
#REBECCA WEST.
No, I didn’t. Not to - day.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Do you not intend to in future?
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, I don’t know yet, dear.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Has anything come for me?
#REBECCA WEST.
The “County News” has come.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
The “County News”?
#REBECCA WEST.
There it is on the table.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Is there anything——?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And you didn’t send it up?
#REBECCA WEST.
You will read it soon enough.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh, indeed? —What!—“We cannot warn our readers too earnestly against unprincipled renegades.” They call me a renegade, Rebecca.
#REBECCA WEST.
They mention no names.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
That makes no difference. “Secret traitors to the good cause.”—“Judas - natures, who make brazen confession of their apostasy as soon as they think the most convenient and—profitable moment has arrived.” “Ruthless befouling of a name honoured through generations”—“in the confident hope of a suitable reward from the party in momentary power.” And they can say such things of me!—Men who have known me so long and so well! Things they themselves don’t believe. Things they know there is not a word of truth in—they print them all the same.
#REBECCA WEST.
That is not all.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
“Inexperience and lack of judgment the only excuse”—“pernicious influence—possibly extending to matters which, for the present, we do not wish to make subjects of public discussion or accusation.” What is this?
#REBECCA WEST.
It is aimed at me, plainly enough.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Rebecca,—this is the conduct of dishonourable men.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, they need scarcely be so contemptuous of Mortensgård.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Something must be done. All that is good in human nature will go to ruin, if this is allowed to go on. But it shall not go on! Oh, what a joy—what a joy it would be to me to let a little light into all this gloom and ugliness!
#REBECCA WEST.
Ah yes, Rosmer. In that you have a great and glorious object to live for.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Only think, if I could rouse them to see themselves as they are; teach them to repent and blush before their better natures; bring them together in mutual forbearance—in love, Rebecca!
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, put your whole strength into that, and you must succeed.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I think success must be possible. Oh, what a delight it would be then to live one’s life! No more malignant wrangling; only emulation. All eyes fixed on the same goal. Every mind, every will pressing forward—upward—each by the path its nature prescribes for it. Happiness for all—through all. Ah! Not through me.
#REBECCA WEST.
Not——? Not through you?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Nor for me.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh Rosmer, do not let such doubts take hold of you.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Happiness—dear Rebecca—happiness is above all things the calm, glad certainty of innocence.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, innocence——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh, you cannot know what guilt means. But I——
#REBECCA WEST.
You least of all!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
The mill race.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh Rosmer——! looks in at the door.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Miss West!
#REBECCA WEST.
Presently, presently. Not now.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Only a word, Miss.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Was it anything for me?
#REBECCA WEST.
No, only something about the house - work.—You ought to go out into the fresh air, dear Rosmer. You should take a good long walk.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, come. Let us go together.
#REBECCA WEST.
No, dear, I can’t just now. You must go alone. But shake off all these gloomy thoughts. Promise me.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I am afraid I shall never shake them off.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, that such baseless fancies should take so strong a hold of you——!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Not so baseless I am afraid, Rebecca. I lay awake all night thinking it over and over. Perhaps Beata saw clearly after all.
#REBECCA WEST.
In what?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
In her belief that I loved you, Rebecca.
#REBECCA WEST.
Right in that!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
The question that haunts me is this: were we two not deceiving ourselves all the time—when we called our relation friendship?
#REBECCA WEST.
You mean that it might as well have been called——?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
——love. Yes, Rebecca, that is what I mean. Even while Beata was alive, all my thoughts were for you. It was you alone I longed for. It was when you were by my side that I felt the calm gladness of utter content. If you think it over, Rebecca—did we not feel for each other from the first a sort of sweet, secret child - love—desireless, dreamless? Was it not so with you? Tell me.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh—I don’t know what to answer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And it was this close - linked life in and for each other that we took for friendship. No, Rebecca—our bond has been a spiritual marriage—perhaps from the very first. That is why there is guilt on my soul. I had no right to such happiness—it was a sin against Beata.
#REBECCA WEST.
No right to live happily? Do you believe that, Rosmer?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
She looked at our relation with the eyes of her love—judged it after the fashion of her love. Inevitably. Beata could not have judged otherwise than she did.
#REBECCA WEST.
But how can you accuse yourself because of Beata’s delusion?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
It was love for me—her kind of love—that drove her into the mill race. That is an immovable fact, Rebecca. And that is what I can never get over.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, think of nothing but the great, beautiful task you have devoted your life to.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
It can never be accomplished, dear. Not by me. Not after what I have come to know.
#REBECCA WEST.
Why not by you?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Because no cause ever triumphs that has its origin in sin.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, these are only ancestral doubts—ancestral fears—ancestral scruples. They say the dead come back to Rosmersholm in the shape of rushing white horses. I think this shows that it is true.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Be that as it may; what does it matter, so long as I cannot rid myself of the feeling? And believe me, Rebecca, it is as I tell you. The cause that is to win a lasting victory must have for its champion a happy, an innocent man.
#REBECCA WEST.
Is happiness so indispensable to you, Rosmer?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Happiness? Yes, dear,—it is.
#REBECCA WEST.
To you, who can never laugh?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, in spite of that. Believe me, I have a great capacity for happiness.
#REBECCA WEST.
Now go for your walk, dear. A good long walk. Do you hear?—See, here is your hat. And your stick too.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Thanks. And you won’t come with me?
#REBECCA WEST.
No, no; I can’t just now.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Very well, then. You are with me none the less.
#REBECCA WEST.
Now, Madam Helseth. You can show him in now.
#RECTOR KROLL.
He has gone out?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Does he usually stay out long?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, he does. But one cannot count on him to - day. So if you don’t care to meet him——
#RECTOR KROLL.
No, no. It is you I want to speak to,—quite alone.
#REBECCA WEST.
Then we had better not lose time. Sit down, Rector.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Miss West—you can scarcely imagine how deeply and painfully I have taken this to heart—this change in Johannes Rosmer.
#REBECCA WEST.
We expected it would be so—at first.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Only at first?
#REBECCA WEST.
Rosmer was confident that sooner or later you would join him.
#REBECCA WEST.
You and all his other friends.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Ah, there you see! That shows the infirmity of his judgment in all that concerns men and practical life.
#REBECCA WEST.
But after all—since he feels it a necessity to emancipate himself on all sides——
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, but wait—that is just what I do not believe.
#REBECCA WEST.
What do you believe then?
#RECTOR KROLL.
I believe that you are at the bottom of it all.
#REBECCA WEST.
It is your wife who has put that in your head, Rector Kroll.
#RECTOR KROLL.
No matter who has put it in my head. What is certain is that I feel a strong suspicion—an exceedingly strong suspicion—when I think things over, and piece together all I know of your behaviour ever since you came here.
#REBECCA WEST.
I seem to recollect a time when you felt an exceedingly strong faith in me, dear Rector. I might almost call it a warm faith.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Whom could you not bewitch—if you tried?
#REBECCA WEST.
Did I try——?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, you did. I am no longer such a fool as to believe that there was any feeling in the matter. You simply wanted to get a footing at Rosmersholm—to strike root here—and in that I was to serve you. Now I see it.
#REBECCA WEST.
You seem utterly to have forgotten that it was Beata who begged and implored me to come out here?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, when you had bewitched her to. Can the feeling she came to entertain for you be called friendship? It was adoration—almost idolatry. It developed into—what shall I call it?—a sort of desperate passion.—Yes, that is the right word for it.
#REBECCA WEST.
Be so good as to recollect the state your sister was in. So far as I am concerned, I don’t think any one can accuse me of being hysterical.
#RECTOR KROLL.
No; that you certainly are not. But that makes you all the more dangerous to the people you want to get into your power. It is easy for you to weigh your acts and calculate consequences—just because your heart is cold.
#REBECCA WEST.
Cold? Are you so sure of that?
#RECTOR KROLL.
I am quite certain of it now. Otherwise you could never have lived here year after year without faltering in the pursuit of your object. Well, well—you have gained your end. You have got him and everything into your power. But in order to do so, you have not scrupled to make him unhappy.
#REBECCA WEST.
That is not true. It is not I—it is you yourself that have made him unhappy.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, when you led him to imagine that he was responsible for Beata’s terrible end.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Does he feel that so deeply, then?
#REBECCA WEST.
How can you doubt it? A mind so sensitive as his——
#RECTOR KROLL.
I thought that an emancipated man, so called, was above all such scruples.—But there we have it! Oh yes—I admit I knew how it would be. The descendant of the men that look down on us from these walls—how could he hope to cut himself adrift from all that has been handed down without a break from generation to generation?
#REBECCA WEST.
Johannes Rosmer’s spirit is deeply rooted in his ancestry. That is very certain.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, and you should have taken that fact into consideration, if you had felt any affection for him. But that sort of consideration was no doubt beyond you. There is such an immeasurable difference between your antecedents and his.
#REBECCA WEST.
What antecedents do you mean?
#RECTOR KROLL.
I am speaking of your origin—your family antecedents, Miss West.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, indeed! Yes, it is quite true that I come of very humble folk. Nevertheless——
#RECTOR KROLL.
I am not thinking of rank and position. I allude to your moral antecedents.
#REBECCA WEST.
Moral——? In what sense?
#RECTOR KROLL.
The circumstances of your birth.
#REBECCA WEST.
What do you mean?
#RECTOR KROLL.
I only mention the matter because it accounts for your whole conduct.
#REBECCA WEST.
I do not understand this. You must explain.
#RECTOR KROLL.
I really did not suppose you could require an explanation. Otherwise it would have been very odd that you should have let Dr. West adopt you——
#REBECCA WEST.
Ah! Now I understand.
#RECTOR KROLL.
——and that you should have taken his name. Your mother’s name was Gamvik.
#REBECCA WEST.
My father’s name was Gamvik, Rector Kroll.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Your mother’s business must have brought her very frequently into contact with the parish doctor.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, it did.
#RECTOR KROLL.
And then he takes you into his house—as soon as your mother dies. He treats you harshly; and yet you stay with him. You know that he won’t leave you a halfpenny—as a matter of fact, you only got a case full of books—and yet you stay on; you bear with him; you nurse him to the last.
#REBECCA WEST.
And you account for all this by assuming that there was something immoral—something criminal about my birth?
#RECTOR KROLL.
I attribute your care for him to involuntary filial instinct. Indeed I believe your whole conduct is determined by your origin.
#REBECCA WEST.
But there is not a single word of truth in what you say! And I can prove it! Dr. West did not come to Finmark till after I was born.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Excuse me, Miss West. He settled there the year before. I have assured myself of that.
#REBECCA WEST.
You are mistaken, I say! You are utterly mistaken.
#RECTOR KROLL.
You told me the day before yesterday that you were nine - and - twenty—in your thirtieth year.
#REBECCA WEST.
Indeed! Did I say so?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, you did. And I can calculate from that——
#REBECCA WEST.
Stop! You needn’t calculate. I may as well tell you at once: I am a year older than I give myself out to be.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Really! I am surprised! What can be the reason of that?
#REBECCA WEST.
When I had passed twenty - five, it seemed to me I was getting altogether too old for an unmarried woman. And so I began to lie about my age.
#RECTOR KROLL.
You? An emancipated woman! Have you prejudices about the age for marriage?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, it was idiotic of me—idiotic and absurd. But some folly or other will always cling to us, not to be shaken off. We are made so.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Well, so be it; but my calculation may be right, none the less. For Dr. West was up there on a short visit the year before he got the appointment.
#REBECCA WEST.
It is not true!
#RECTOR KROLL.
Is it not true?
#REBECCA WEST.
No. My mother never spoke of any such visit.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Did she not?
#REBECCA WEST.
No, never. Nor Dr. West either; not a word about it.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Might not that be because they both had reasons for suppressing a year? Just as you have done, Miss West. Perhaps it is a family foible.
#REBECCA WEST.
It is impossible. You want to cheat me into believing it. This can never, never be true! It cannot! Never in this world——!
#RECTOR KROLL.
My dear Miss West—why in heaven’s name are you so terribly excited? You quite frighten me! What am I to think—to believe——?
#REBECCA WEST.
Nothing! You are to think and believe nothing.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Then you must really tell me how you can take this affair—this possibility—so terribly to heart.
#REBECCA WEST.
It is perfectly simple, Rector Kroll. I have no wish to be taken for an illegitimate child.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Indeed! Well well, let us be satisfied with that explanation—in the meantime. But in that case you must still have a certain—prejudice on that point too?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, I suppose I have.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Ah, I fancy it is much the same with most of what you call your “emancipation.” You have read yourself into a number of new ideas and opinions. You have got a sort of smattering of recent discoveries in various fields—discoveries that seem to overthrow certain principles which have hitherto been held impregnable and unassailable. But all this has only been a matter of the intellect, Miss West—a superficial acquisition. It has not passed into your blood.
#REBECCA WEST.
Perhaps you are right.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes, look into your own mind, and you will see! And if this is the case with you, one may easily guess how it must be with Johannes Rosmer. It is sheer, unmitigated madness—it is running blindfold to destruction—for him to think of coming openly forward and confessing himself an apostate! Only think—a man of his sensitive nature! Imagine him disowned and persecuted by the circle of which he has always formed a part—exposed to ruthless attacks from all the best people in the community! He is not—he never can be the man to endure all that.
#REBECCA WEST.
He must endure it! It is too late now for him to retreat.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Not at all too late. By no means. What has happened can be hushed up—or at least explained away as a mere temporary aberration, however deplorable. But—one measure is certainly indispensable.
#REBECCA WEST.
And what is that?
#RECTOR KROLL.
You must get him to legalise the position, Miss West.
#REBECCA WEST.
His position towards me?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes. You must make him do that.
#REBECCA WEST.
Then you absolutely cannot clear your mind of the idea that our position requires to be—legalised, as you call it?
#RECTOR KROLL.
I would rather not go into the matter too closely. But I believe I have noticed that it is nowhere easier to break through all so - called prejudices than in—h’m——
#REBECCA WEST.
In the relation between man and woman, you mean?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes,—to speak plainly—I think so.
#REBECCA WEST.
I could almost say—I wish you were right, Rector Kroll.
#RECTOR KROLL.
What do you mean by that? You say it so strangely.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, well—please let us drop the subject. Ah,—there he comes.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Already! Then I will go.
#REBECCA WEST.
No—please stay. There is something I want you to hear.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Not now. I don’t feel as if I could bear to see him.
#REBECCA WEST.
I beg you to stay. Do! If not, you will regret it by - and - by. It is the last time I shall ask you for anything.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Very well, Miss West—so be it, then.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What!—Are you here?
#REBECCA WEST.
He did not wish to meet you, dear.
#RECTOR KROLL.
“Dear!”
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, Rector Kroll, Rosmer and I say “dear” to each other. That is one result of our “position.”
#RECTOR KROLL.
Was that what you wanted me to hear?
#REBECCA WEST.
That—and a little more.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What is the object of this visit?
#RECTOR KROLL.
I wanted to try once more to stop you and win you back to us.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
After what appears in that paper?
#RECTOR KROLL.
I did not write it.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Did you make the slightest effort to prevent its appearance?
#RECTOR KROLL.
That would have been to betray the cause I serve. And, besides, it was not in my power.
#REBECCA WEST.
There! Now it is out of sight. And let it be out of mind too. For there will be nothing more of that sort, Rosmer.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Ah, if you could only make sure of that!
#REBECCA WEST.
Come, let us sit down, dear. All three of us. And then I will tell you everything.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What has come over you, Rebecca? This unnatural calmness—what is it?
#REBECCA WEST.
The calmness of resolution. Pray sit down too, Rector.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Resolution, you say? What resolution?
#REBECCA WEST.
I am going to give you back what you require in order to live your life. Dear friend, you shall have your happy innocence back again!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What can you mean?
#REBECCA WEST.
I have only to tell you something. That will be enough.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Well!
#REBECCA WEST.
When I came down here from Finmark—along with Dr. West—it seemed to me that a great, wide new world was opening up before me. The Doctor had taught me all sorts of things—all the fragmentary knowledge of life that I possessed in those days. And then——
#RECTOR KROLL.
And then?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But Rebecca—I know all this.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, yes—you are right. You know enough about this.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Perhaps I had better go.
#REBECCA WEST.
No, please stay where you are, my dear Rector. Well, you see, this was how it was—I wanted to take my share in the life of the new era that was dawning, with all its new ideas.—Rector Kroll told me one day that Ulric Brendel had had great influence over you while you were still a boy. I thought it must surely be possible for me to carry on his work.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
You came here with a secret design——?
#REBECCA WEST.
We two, I thought, should march onward in freedom, side by side. Ever onward. Ever farther and farther to the front. But between you and perfect emancipation there rose that dismal, insurmountable barrier.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What barrier do you mean?
#REBECCA WEST.
I mean this, Rosmer: You could grow into freedom only in the clear, fresh sunshine—and here you were pining, sickening in the gloom of such a marriage.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
You have never before spoken to me of my marriage in that tone.
#REBECCA WEST.
No, I did not dare to, for I should have frightened you.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Do you hear that?
#REBECCA WEST.
But I saw quite well where your deliverance lay—your only deliverance. And then I went to work.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Went to work? In what way?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Do you mean that——?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, Rosmer—— Sit still. You too, Rector Kroll. But now it must out. It was not you, Rosmer. You are innocent. It was I that lured—that ended in luring Beata out into the paths of delusion——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Rebecca!
#RECTOR KROLL.
The paths of delusion!
#REBECCA WEST.
The paths—that led to the mill race. Now you know it, both of you.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But I don’t understand——What is it she is saying? I don’t understand a word——!
#RECTOR KROLL.
Oh yes, Rosmer, I am beginning to understand.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But what did you do? What can you possibly have told her? There was nothing—absolutely nothing to tell!
#REBECCA WEST.
She came to know that you were working yourself free from all the old prejudices.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, but that was not the case at that time.
#REBECCA WEST.
I knew that it soon would be.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Aha!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And then? What more? I must know all now.
#REBECCA WEST.
Some time after—I begged and implored her to let me go away from Rosmersholm.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Why did you want to go—then?
#REBECCA WEST.
I did not want to go; I wanted to stay here, where I was. But I told her that it would be best for us all—that I should go away in time. I gave her to understand that if I stayed here any longer, I could not—I could not tell—what might happen.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Then this is what you said and did!
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
This is what you call “going to work.”
#REBECCA WEST.
I called it so, yes.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Have you confessed all now, Rebecca?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Not all.
#REBECCA WEST.
What more should there be?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Did you not at last give Beata to understand that it was necessary—not only that it would be wisest, but that it was necessary—both for your own sake and Rosmer’s, that you should go away somewhere—as soon as possible?—Well?
#REBECCA WEST.
Perhaps I did say something of the sort.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And this tissue of lies and deceit she—my unhappy, sick wife believed in! Believed in it so firmly! So immovably! And she never turned to me. Never said one word to me! Oh, Rebecca,—I can see it in your face—you dissuaded her from it!
#REBECCA WEST.
She had conceived a fixed idea that she, as a childless wife, had no right to be here. And then she imagined that it was her duty to you to efface herself.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And you—you did nothing to disabuse her of the idea?
#REBECCA WEST.
No.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Perhaps you confirmed her in it? Answer me! Did you not?
#REBECCA WEST.
I believe she may have understood me so.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, yes—and in everything she bowed before your will. And she did efface herself! How could you—how could you play this ghastly game!
#REBECCA WEST.
It seemed to me I had to choose between your life and hers, Rosmer.
#RECTOR KROLL.
That choice was not for you to make.
#REBECCA WEST.
You think then that I was cool and calculating and self - possessed all the time! I was not the same woman then that I am now, as I stand here telling it all. Besides, there are two sorts of will in us I believe! I wanted Beata away, by one means or another; but I never really believed that it would come to pass. As I felt my way forward, at each step I ventured, I seemed to hear something within me cry out: No farther! Not a step farther! And yet I could not stop. I had to venture the least little bit farther. Only one hair’s - breadth more. And then one more—and always one more.—And then it happened.—That is the way such things come about. What do you think lies before you now? After this?
#REBECCA WEST.
Things must go with me as they will. It doesn’t greatly matter.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Not a word of remorse! Is it possible you feel none?
#REBECCA WEST.
Excuse me, Rector Kroll—that is a matter which concerns no one but me. I must settle it with myself.
#RECTOR KROLL.
And this is the woman you are living under the same roof with—in the closest intimacy! Oh if those that are gone could see us now!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Are you going back to town?
#RECTOR KROLL.
Yes. The sooner the better.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Then I will go with you.
#RECTOR KROLL.
Will you! Ah yes, I was sure we had not lost you for good.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Come then, Kroll! Come!
#REBECCA WEST.
Not over the foot - bridge to - day either. He goes round. Never across the mill race. Never. Well, well, well!
#MADAM HELSETH.
What is it, Miss?
#REBECCA WEST.
Madam Helseth, would you be so good as to have my trunk brought down from the garret?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Your trunk?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes—the brown sealskin trunk, you know.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Yes, yes. But, Lord preserve us—are you going on a journey, Miss?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes—now I am going on a journey, Madam Helseth.
#MADAM HELSETH.
And immediately!
#REBECCA WEST.
As soon as I have packed up.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Well, I’ve never heard the like of that! But you’ll come back again soon, Miss, of course?
#REBECCA WEST.
I shall never come back again.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Never! Dear Lord, what will things be like at Rosmersholm when you’re gone, Miss? And the poor Pastor was just beginning to be so happy and comfortable.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, but I have taken fright to - day, Madam Helseth.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Taken fright! Dear, dear! how was that?
#REBECCA WEST.
I thought I saw something like a glimpse of white horses.
#MADAM HELSETH.
White horses! In broad daylight!
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, they are abroad early and late—the white horses of Rosmersholm. Well,—about the trunk, Madam Helseth.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Yes, yes. The trunk.
#MADAM HELSETH.
All your things have been taken down, Miss. They are in the kitchen passage.
#REBECCA WEST.
Very well. You have ordered the carriage?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Yes. The coachman wants to know what time he ought to be here.
#REBECCA WEST.
About eleven o’clock, I think. The steamer starts at midnight.
#MADAM HELSETH.
But the Pastor? If he shouldn’t be home by that time?
#REBECCA WEST.
I shall go all the same. If I don’t see him, you can tell him that I will write to him—a long letter. Tell him that.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Yes, writing—that may be all very well. But, poor Miss West—I do think you should try to speak to him once more.
#REBECCA WEST.
Perhaps so. And yet—perhaps not.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Well—that I should live to see this! I never thought of such a thing.
#REBECCA WEST.
What did you think then, Madam Helseth?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Well, I certainly thought Pastor Rosmer was a more dependable man than this.
#REBECCA WEST.
Dependable?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Yes, that’s what I say.
#REBECCA WEST.
Why, my dear Madam Helseth, what do you mean?
#MADAM HELSETH.
I mean what’s right and true, Miss. He shouldn’t get out of it in this way, that he shouldn’t.
#REBECCA WEST.
Come now, Madam Helseth, tell me plainly; what do you think is the reason I am going away?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Well, Heaven forgive us, I suppose it can’t be helped, Miss. Ah, well, well, well! But I certainly don’t think the Pastor’s behaving handsome - like. Mortensgård had some excuse; for her husband was alive, so that they two couldn’t marry, however much they wanted to. But as for the Pastor—h’m!
#REBECCA WEST.
Could you have believed such a thing of Pastor Rosmer and me?
#MADAM HELSETH.
No, never in this world. At least, I mean—not until to - day.
#REBECCA WEST.
But to - day, then——?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Well,—after all the horrible things that they tell me the papers are saying about the Pastor——
#REBECCA WEST.
Aha!
#MADAM HELSETH.
For the man that can go over to Mortensgård’s religion—good Lord, I can believe anything of him.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh yes, I suppose so. But what about me? What have you to say about me?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Lord preserve us, Miss—I don’t see that there’s much to be said against you. It’s not so easy for a lone woman to be always on her guard, that’s certain.—We’re all of us human, Miss West.
#REBECCA WEST.
That’s very true, Madam Helseth. We are all of us human.—What are you listening to?
#MADAM HELSETH.
Oh Lord,—if I don’t believe that’s him coming.
#REBECCA WEST.
After all then——? Well well; so be it. enters from the hall.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What does this mean?
#REBECCA WEST.
I am going.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
At once?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes. Eleven o’clock then.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Very well, Miss.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Where are you going to, Rebecca?
#REBECCA WEST.
North, by the steamer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
North? What takes you to the North?
#REBECCA WEST.
It was there I came from.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But you have no ties there now.
#REBECCA WEST.
I have none here either.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What do you think of doing?
#REBECCA WEST.
I don’t know. I only want to have done with it all.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
To have done with it?
#REBECCA WEST.
Rosmersholm has broken me.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Do you say that?
#REBECCA WEST.
Broken me utterly and hopelessly.—I had a free and fearless will when I came here. Now I have bent my neck under a strange law.—From this day forth, I feel as if I had no courage for anything in the world.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Why not? What is the law that you say you have——?
#REBECCA WEST.
Dear, don’t let us talk of that just now.—What happened between you and the Rector?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
We have made peace.
#REBECCA WEST.
Ah yes; so that was the end.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
He gathered all our old friends together at his house. They have made it clear to me that the work of ennobling the minds of men—is not for me.—And besides, it is hopeless in itself, Rebecca.—I shall let it alone.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, yes—perhaps it is best so.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Is that what you say now? Do you think so now?
#REBECCA WEST.
I have come to think so—in the last few days.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
You are lying, Rebecca.
#REBECCA WEST.
Lying——!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, you are lying. You have never believed in me. You have never believed that I was man enough to carry the cause through to victory.
#REBECCA WEST.
I believed that we two together could do it.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
That is not true. You thought that you yourself could do something great in life; and that you could use me to further your ends. I was to be a serviceable instrument to you—that is what you thought.
#REBECCA WEST.
Listen to me, Rosmer——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh, what is the use? I see through it all now—I have been like a glove in your hands.
#REBECCA WEST.
Listen, Rosmer. Hear what I have to say. It will be for the last time. I intended to write you all about it—when I was back in the North. But I daresay it is best that you should hear it at once.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Have you more confessions to make?
#REBECCA WEST.
The greatest of all is to come.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
The greatest?
#REBECCA WEST.
What you have never suspected. What gives light and shade to all the rest.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I don’t understand you at all.
#REBECCA WEST.
It is perfectly true that I once schemed to gain a footing at Rosmersholm. I thought I could not fail to turn things to good account here. In one way or the other—you understand.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Well, you accomplished your ends.
#REBECCA WEST.
I believe I could have accomplished anything, anything in the world—at that time. For I had still my fearless, free - born will. I knew no scruples—I stood in awe of no human tie.—But then began what has broken my will—and cowed me so pitiably for all my days.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What began? Do not speak in riddles.
#REBECCA WEST.
It came over me,—this wild, uncontrollable passion——. Oh, Rosmer——!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Passion? You——! For what?
#REBECCA WEST.
For you.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What is this?
#REBECCA WEST.
Sit still, dear; there is more to tell.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And you mean to say—that you have loved me—in that way!
#REBECCA WEST.
I thought that it should be called love—then. Yes, I thought it was love. But it was not. It was what I said. It was a wild, uncontrollable passion.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Rebecca, is it really you—you yourself—that you are speaking of?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, would you believe it, Rosmer?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Then it was because of this—under the influence of this—that you—that you “went to work,” as you call it?
#REBECCA WEST.
It came upon me like a storm on the sea. It was like one of the storms we sometimes have in the North in the winter - time. It seizes you—and whirls you along with it—wherever it will. There is no resisting it.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And so it swept the unhappy Beata into the mill race.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes; for it was a life - and - death struggle between Beata and me at that time.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Assuredly you were the strongest at Rosmersholm. Stronger than Beata and I together.
#REBECCA WEST.
I judged you rightly in so far that I was sure I could never reach you until you were a free man, both in circumstances—and in spirit.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But I don’t understand you, Rebecca. You—yourself—your whole conduct is an insoluble riddle to me. I am free now—both in spirit and in circumstances. You have reached the very goal you aimed at from the first. And yet——
#REBECCA WEST.
I have never stood farther from my goal than now.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
And yet I say—when I asked you yesterday—begged you to be my wife—you cried out, as if in fear, that it could never be.
#REBECCA WEST.
I cried out in despair, Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Why?
#REBECCA WEST.
Because Rosmersholm has sapped my strength. My old fearless will has had its wings clipped here. It is crippled! The time is past when I had courage for anything in the world. I have lost the power of action, Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Tell me how this has come about.
#REBECCA WEST.
It has come about through my life with you.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But how? How?
#REBECCA WEST.
When I was left alone with you here,—and when you had become yourself again——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, yes?
#REBECCA WEST.
——for you were never quite yourself so long as Beata lived——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I am afraid you are right there.
#REBECCA WEST.
But when I found myself sharing your life here,—in quiet—in solitude,—when you showed me all your thoughts without reserve—every tender and delicate feeling, just as it came to you—then the great change came over me. Little by little, you understand. Almost imperceptibly—but at last with such overwhelming force that it reached to the depths of my soul.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh, is this true, Rebecca?
#REBECCA WEST.
All the rest—the horrible sense - intoxicated desire—passed far, far away from me. All the whirling passions settled down into quiet and silence. Rest descended on my soul—a stillness as on one of our northern bird - cliffs under the midnight sun.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Tell me more of this. Tell me all you can.
#REBECCA WEST.
There is not much more, dear. Only this—it was love that was born in me. The great self - denying love, that is content with life, as we two have lived it together.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh, if I had only had the faintest suspicion of all this!
#REBECCA WEST.
It is best as it is. Yesterday—when you asked me if I would be your wife—I cried out with joy——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, did you not, Rebecca! I thought that was the meaning of your cry.
#REBECCA WEST.
For a moment, yes. I had forgotten myself. It was my old buoyant will that was struggling to be free. But it has no energy left now—no power of endurance.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
How do you account for what has happened to you?
#REBECCA WEST.
It is the Rosmer view of life—or your view of life, at any rate—that has infected my will.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Infected?
#REBECCA WEST.
And made it sick. Enslaved it to laws that had no power over me before. You—life with you—has ennobled my mind——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh that I could believe it!
#REBECCA WEST.
You may safely believe it! The Rosmer view of life ennobles. But—— But—but——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But——? Well?
#REBECCA WEST.
——but it kills happiness.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Do you think so, Rebecca?
#REBECCA WEST.
My happiness, at any rate.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, but are you so certain of that? If I were to ask you again now——? If I were to beg and entreat you——?
#REBECCA WEST.
Dear,—never speak of this again! It is impossible——! For you must know, Rosmer, I have a—a past behind me.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
More than what you have told me?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes. Something different and something more.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Is it not strange, Rebecca? Some such idea has crossed my mind now and then.
#REBECCA WEST.
It has? And yet——? Even so——?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I never believed it. I only played with it—in my thoughts, you understand.
#REBECCA WEST.
If you wish it, I will tell you all, at once.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
No, no! I will not hear a word. Whatever it may be—I can forget it.
#REBECCA WEST.
But I cannot.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh Rebecca——!
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, Rosmer—this is the terrible part of it: that now, when all life’s happiness is within my grasp—my heart is changed, and my own past cuts me off from it.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Your past is dead, Rebecca. It has no hold on you any more—it is no part of you—as you are now.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, you know that these are only phrases, dear. And innocence? Where am I to get that from?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Ah,—innocence.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, innocence. That is the source of peace and happiness. That was the vital truth you were to implant in the coming generation of happy noble - men——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh, don’t remind me of that. It was only an abortive dream, Rebecca—an immature idea, that I myself no longer believe in.—Ah no, we cannot be ennobled from without, Rebecca.
#REBECCA WEST.
Not even by tranquil love, Rosmer?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes—that would be the great thing—the most glorious in life, almost—if it were so. But how can I be certain of that? How convince myself?
#REBECCA WEST.
Do you not believe me, Rosmer?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh Rebecca—how can I believe in you, fully? You who have all this while been cloaking, concealing such a multitude of things!—Now you come forward with something new. If you have a secret purpose in all this, tell me plainly what it is. Is there anything you want to gain by it? You know that I will gladly do everything I can for you.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh this killing doubt——! Rosmer—Rosmer——!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, is it not terrible, Rebecca? But I cannot help it. I shall never be able to shake off the doubt. I can never be absolutely sure that you are mine in pure and perfect love.
#REBECCA WEST.
Is there nothing in the depths of your own heart that bears witness to the transformation in me? And tells you that it is due to you—and you alone?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh Rebecca—I no longer believe in my power of transforming any one. My faith in myself is utterly dead. I believe neither in myself nor in you.
#REBECCA WEST.
Then how will you be able to live your life?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
That I don’t know. I cannot imagine how. I don’t think I can live it.—And I know of nothing in the world that is worth living for.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, life—life will renew itself. Let us hold fast to it, Rosmer.—We shall leave it soon enough.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Then give me my faith again! My faith in you, Rebecca! My faith in your love! Proof! I must have proof!
#REBECCA WEST.
Proof? How can I give you proof——?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
You must! I cannot bear this desolation—this horrible emptiness—this—this——
#REBECCA WEST.
Ah—did you hear that? He has a white shirt on, a black coat and a good pair of boots, with his trousers tucked into them. Otherwise he is dressed as in the first Act. He looks excited.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Ah, is it you, Mr. Brendel?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Johannes, my boy—hail—and farewell!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Where are you going so late?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Downhill.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
How——?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
I am going homewards, my beloved pupil. I am home - sick for the mighty Nothingness.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Something has happened to you, Mr. Brendel! What is it?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
So you observe the transformation? Yes—well you may. When I last set foot in these halls—I stood before you as a man of substance, and slapped my breast - pocket.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Indeed! I don’t quite understand——
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
But as you see me this night, I am a deposed monarch on the ash - heap that was my palace.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
If there is anything I can do for you——
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
You have preserved your child - like heart, Johannes. Can you grant me a loan?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, yes, most willingly!
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Can you spare me an ideal or two?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What do you say?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
One or two cast - off ideals. It would be an act of charity. For I’m cleaned out, my boy. Ruined, beggared.
#REBECCA WEST.
Have you not delivered your lecture?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
No, seductive lady. What do you think? Just as I am standing ready to pour forth the horn of plenty, I make the painful discovery that I am bankrupt.
#REBECCA WEST.
But all your unwritten works——?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
For five - and - twenty years I have sat like a miser on his double - locked treasure - chest. And then yesterday—when I open it and want to display the treasure—there’s none there! The teeth of time had ground it into dust. There was nix and nothing in the whole concern.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But are you so sure of that?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
There’s no room for doubt, my dear fellow. The President has convinced me of it.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
The President?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Well well—His Excellency then. Ganz nach Belieben.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Whom do you mean?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Peter Mortensgård, of course.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
What?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Hush, hush, hush! Peter Mortensgård is the lord and leader of the future. Never have I stood in a more august presence. Peter Mortensgård has the secret of omnipotence. He can do whatever he will.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh, don’t believe that.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Yes, my boy! For Peter Mortensgård never wills more than he can do. Peter Mortensgård is capable of living his life without ideals. And that, do you see—that is just the mighty secret of action and of victory. It is the sum of the whole world’s wisdom. Basta!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Now I understand—why you leave here poorer than you came.
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Bien! Then take a Beispiel by your ancient teacher. Rub out all that he once imprinted on your mind. Build not thy house on shifting sand. And look ahead—and feel your way—before you build on this exquisite creature, who here lends sweetness to your life.
#REBECCA WEST.
Is it me you mean?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Yes, my fascinating mermaid.
#REBECCA WEST.
Why am I not to be built on?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
I gather that my former pupil has a great cause to carry forward to victory.
#REBECCA WEST.
What then——?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
Victory is assured. But—mark me well—on one indispensable condition.
#REBECCA WEST.
Which is——?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
That the woman who loves him shall gladly go out into the kitchen and hack off her tender, rosy - white little finger—here—just here at the middle joint. Item, that the aforesaid loving woman—again gladly—shall slice off her incomparably - moulded left ear. Farewell, my conquering Johannes.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Are you going now? In the dark night?
#ULRIC BRENDEL.
The dark night is best. Peace be with you.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, how close and sultry it is here!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
There is nothing else for it after all, Rebecca. I see it. You must go away.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, I see no choice.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Let us make the most of our last hour. Come here and sit by me.
#REBECCA WEST.
What do you want to say to me, Rosmer?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
First, I want to tell you that you need not feel any anxiety about your future.
#REBECCA WEST.
H’m, my future.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I have long ago arranged for everything. Whatever may happen, you are provided for.
#REBECCA WEST.
That too, my dear one?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
You might surely have known that.
#REBECCA WEST.
It is many a long day since I have given a thought to such things.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, yes—you thought things would always remain as they were between us.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, I thought so.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
So did I. But if I were to go——
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh, Rosmer—you will live longer than I.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Surely my worthless life lies in my own hands.
#REBECCA WEST.
What is this? You are never thinking of——!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Do you think it would be so strange? After this pitiful, lamentable defeat! I, who was to have borne a great cause on to victory—have I not fled from the battle before it was well begun?
#REBECCA WEST.
Take up the fight again, Rosmer! Only try—and you shall see, you will conquer. You will ennoble hundreds—thousands of minds. Only try!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh Rebecca—I, who no longer believe in my own mission!
#REBECCA WEST.
But your mission has stood the test already. You have ennobled one human being at least—me you have ennobled for the rest of my days.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh—if I dared believe you.
#REBECCA WEST.
Oh Rosmer,—do you know of nothing—nothing that could make you believe it?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Don’t speak of that! Keep away from that, Rebecca! Not a word more.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, this is precisely what we must speak about. Do you know of anything that would kill the doubt? For I know of nothing in the world.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
It is well for you that you do not know.—It is well for both of us.
#REBECCA WEST.
No, no, no.—I will not be put off in this way! If you know of anything that would absolve me in your eyes, I claim as my right to be told of it.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Then let us see. You say that a great love is in you; that through me your mind has been ennobled. Is it so? Is your reckoning just, Rebecca? Shall we try to prove the sum? Say?
#REBECCA WEST.
I am ready.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
At any time?
#REBECCA WEST.
Whenever you please. The sooner the better.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Then let me see, Rebecca,—if you for my sake—this very evening—— Oh, no, no, no!
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, Rosmer! Yes! Tell me, and you shall see.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Have you the courage—have you the will—gladly, as Ulric Brendel said—for my sake, to - night—gladly—to go the same way that Beata went?
#REBECCA WEST.
Rosmer——!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, Rebecca—that is the question that will for ever haunt me—when you are gone. Every hour in the day it will return upon me. Oh, I seem to see you before my very eyes. You are standing out on the foot - bridge—right in the middle. Now you are bending forward over the railing—drawn dizzily downwards, downwards towards the rushing water! No—you recoil. You have not the heart to do what she dared.
#REBECCA WEST.
But if I had the heart to do it? And the will to do it gladly? What then?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I should have to believe you then. I should recover my faith in my mission. Faith in my power to ennoble human souls. Faith in the human soul’s power to attain nobility.
#REBECCA WEST.
You shall have your faith again.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Have you the will and the courage—for this, Rebecca?
#REBECCA WEST.
That you shall see to - morrow—or afterwards—when they find my body.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
There is a horrible fascination in this——!
#REBECCA WEST.
For I don’t want to remain down there. Not longer than necessary. You must see that they find me.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
But all this—is nothing but madness. Go—or stay! I will take your bare word this time too.
#REBECCA WEST.
Phrases, Rosmer! Let us have no more cowardly subterfuges, dear! How can you believe me on my bare word after this day?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I shrink from seeing your defeat, Rebecca!
#REBECCA WEST.
It will be no defeat.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Yes, it will. You will never bring yourself to go Beata’s way.
#REBECCA WEST.
Do you think not?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Never. You are not like Beata. You are not under the dominion of a distorted view of life.
#REBECCA WEST.
But I am under the dominion of the Rosmersholm view of life—now. What I have sinned—it is fit that I should expiate.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Is that your point of view?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Well then, I stand firm in our emancipated view of life, Rebecca. There is no judge over us; and therefore we must do justice upon ourselves.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, that is true—that too. My going away will save what is best in you.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Oh, there is nothing left to save in me.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, there is. But I—after to - day, I should only be a sea - troll dragging down the ship that is to carry you forward. I must go overboard. Why should I remain here in the world, trailing after me my own crippled life? Why brood and brood over the happiness that my past has forfeited for ever? I must give up the game, Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
If you go—I go with you.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, come with me—and see——
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I go with you, I say.
#REBECCA WEST.
To the foot - bridge, yes. You know you never dare go out upon it.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Have you noticed that?
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes.—It was that that made my love hopeless.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Rebecca,—now I lay my hand on your head——and I wed you as my true wife.
#REBECCA WEST.
Thanks, Rosmer. And now I will go—gladly.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Man and wife should go together.
#REBECCA WEST.
Only to the bridge, Rosmer.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
Out on to it too. As far as you go—so far shall I go with you. For now I dare.
#REBECCA WEST.
Are you absolutely certain—that this way is the best for you?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
I am certain that it is the only way.
#REBECCA WEST.
If you were deceiving yourself? If it were only a delusion? One of those white horses of Rosmersholm.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
It may be so. For we can never escape from them—we of this house.
#REBECCA WEST.
Then stay, Rosmer!
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
The husband shall go with his wife, as the wife with her husband.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes, but first tell me this: Is it you who follow me? Or is it I who follow you?
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
We shall never think that question out.
#REBECCA WEST.
But I should like to know.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
We go with each other, Rebecca—I with you, and you with me.
#REBECCA WEST.
I almost think that is the truth.
#JOHANNES ROSMER.
For now we two are one.
#REBECCA WEST.
Yes. We are one. Come! We go gladly.
#MADAM HELSETH.
Miss West—the carriage is—— Not here? Out together at this time of night? Well—I must say——! H’m! Not on the garden seat. Ah, well well. Oh good God! that white thing there——! My soul! They’re both of them out on the bridge! God forgive the sinful creatures—if they’re not in each other’s arms! Oh—down—both of them! Out into the mill race! Help! Help! No. No help here.—The dead wife has taken them.
