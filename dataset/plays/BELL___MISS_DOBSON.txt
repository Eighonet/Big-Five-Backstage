#BERTHA.
Are we very late, Miss Dobson?
#DOROTHEA.
Why, there is nobody here!
#FANNY.
Where can she be?
#EVA.
Perhaps she is late.
#BOYLER.
Miss Dobson is never late.
#FANNY.
What is that letter on the table? Why, it's her writing! It's a letter from Miss Dobson!
#FANNY.
With our names written on it!
#DOROTHEA.
It must be to say why she has not come.
#BOYLER.
Quick! Let's open it.
#ELISE.
No, no, I'll open it.
#DOROTHEA.
Let us all open it together, and read it at the same time.
#ALL.
Capital!
#DOROTHEA.
Now, then, what shall we do?
#BOYLER.
We shall have so much less to read.
#ELISE.
Let us see what is on this piece.
#ALL.
"My dear children, I am obliged to go off to Clapham by the ten o'clock train, to see my mother who is ill."
#DOROTHEA.
Go to Clapham!
#FANNY.
By the ten o'clock train!
#BOYLER.
To see her mother who is ill!
#ELISE.
Oh, how delightful!
#BOYLER.
How delightful that her mother should be ill?
#ELISE.
No, of course not. I mean, how terrible!
#ALL.
Poor Miss Dobson's mother!
#DOROTHEA.
Come, let us see what else she says.
#ALL.
"I shall not be back until the evening."
#FANNY.
She won't be back until the evening!
#ELISE.
We shall have a holiday then! A holiday! A holiday!
#DOROTHEA.
Here's the other piece of the letter which we haven't read.
#DOROTHEA.
"I hope you will be good children, and work by yourselves."
#ALL.
Work by ourselves!
#DOROTHEA.
"You can prepare your German, history, and geography, and do some drawing and practising."
#FANNY.
I never heard such a thing.
#BOYLER.
I do call that a shame!
#DOROTHEA.
It's horrid doing one's lessons alone.
#ELISE.
But still, it's nice not being scolded when one makes mistakes.
#FANNY.
I am quite sure I can't do my geography alone, because I never can find the additional towns on the map.
#ELISE.
Besides, Mamma does not like us to bend over the atlas, she says it is bad for the eyes.
#DOROTHEA.
As for the drawing, we certainly can't do it, because Miss Dobson has got the key of the cupboard, where the soft pencils are.
#BOYLER.
And as for the German, I never can find the words in the dictionary.
#ELISE.
And I certainly can't practise alone, because I never know where to put my thumb in the scale of F sharp minor.
#FANNY.
And I never know where to put my little finger in the scale of B.
#DOROTHEA.
Then the only thing we can do alone is the history.
#BOYLER.
And there will be quite time enough for that this afternoon.
#FANNY.
Then, in that case, we have our whole morning free.
#BOYLER.
Oh, how delightful!
#ELISE.
Let's play at hide - and - seek.
#FANNY.
You all hide, and I'll come and look for you.
#FANNY.
A bell!
#ELISE.
Who can it be?
#ELISE.
Suppose it were Miss Dobson!
#BOYLER.
I'll go and see.
#FANNY.
What shall we say if it is Miss Dobson?
#DOROTHEA.
That we were going to play at hide - and - seek instead of doing our lessons!
#ELISE.
The point is, what will she say!
#DOROTHEA.
She'll say a good deal.
#BOYLER.
It is Miss Dobson! Her mother is much better. Her sister sent a telegram, and so she did not go to Clapham after all.
#FANNY.
What shall we do?
#DOROTHEA.
Let's go and tell her how glad we are she has such good news.
#BOYLER.
Yes, and let's ask for a holiday to celebrate her mother's recovery.
#FANNY.
Excellent! Let's go and meet her.
