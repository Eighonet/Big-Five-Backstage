#MARY.
Ain't got wood 'nough fer breakfast, Thad.
#THADDEUS.
I'm too tired to go out now; wait till mornin'. Did I tell ye that old man Reed saw three Southern troopers pass his house this mornin'?
#MARY.
I wish them soldiers would git out o' the neighborhood. Whenever I see 'em passin', I have t' steady myself 'gainst somethin' or I'd fall. I couldn't hardly breathe yesterday when the Southerners came after fodder. I'd die if they spoke t' me.
#THADDEUS.
Ye needn't be afraid of Northern soldiers.
#MARY.
I hate 'em all - Union or Southern. I can't make head or tail t' what all this fightin's 'bout. An' I don't care who wins, so long as they git through, an' them soldiers stop stealin' our corn an' potatoes.
#THADDEUS.
Ye can't hardly blame 'em if they're hungry, ken ye?
#MARY.
It ain't right that they should steal from us poor folk. We have hard 'nough times t' make things meet now. I ain't set down onct to - day, 'cept fer meals; an' when I think o' the work I got t' do t'morrow, I ought t' been in bed hours ago.
#THADDEUS.
I'd help if I could, but it ain't my fault if the Lord see'd fit t' lay me up, so I'm always ailin'. Ye better try an' take things easy t'morrow.
#MARY.
It's well 'nough t' say, but them apples got t' be picked an' the rest o' the potatoes sorted. If I could sleep at night it'd be all right, but with them soldiers 'bout, I can't.
#THADDEUS.
Jolly, wish I'd see a flock o' birds.
#MARY.
I'd rather go without than hear ye fire. I wish ye didn't keep it loaded.
#THADDEUS.
Ye know I ain't got time t' stop an' load when I see the birds. They don't wait fer ye. Them pigs has got to be butchered.
#MARY.
Wait till I git a chance t' go t' sister's. I can't stand it t' hear 'em squeal.
#THADDEUS.
Best go soon then, 'cause they's fat as they'll ever be, an' there ain't no use in wastin' feed on 'em. Ain't ye most ready fer bed?
#MARY.
Go on up. An', Thad, try not t' snore to - night.
#THADDEUS.
Hit me if I do.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Sorry, my friend, but you were so darn slow 'bout openin' the door, that we had to walk in. Has there been a Northern soldier round here to - day?
#THADDEUS.
I ain't seed one.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Have you been here all day?
#THADDEUS.
I ain't stirred from the place.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Call the rest of your family down.
#THADDEUS.
My wife's all there is. Mary! Mary! Come down right off.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
You better not lie to me or it'll go tough with you.
#THADDEUS.
I swear I ain't seed no one.
#THADDEUS.
Say, Mary, you was h -
#SERGEANT HEALY.
You keep still, man. I'll question her myself. You were here at the house all day? You didn't take a trip down to the store? Haven't you got a tongue?
#MARY.
Y - e - s.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Then use it. The Northern soldier who came here a while ago was pretty badly wounded, wasn't he?
#MARY.
I - I - no one's been here.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Come, come, woman, don't lie. He had a bad cut in his forehead, and you felt sorry for him, and gave him a bite to eat.
#MARY.
No one's been near the house to - day.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
We're not going to hurt him, woman. He's a friend of ours. We want to find him, and put him in a hospital, don't we, Dick?
#DICK.
He's sick and needs to go to bed for a while.
#MARY.
He ain't here.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
What do you want to lie for?
#MARY.
I ain't lyin'. I ain't seed no soldier.
#THADDEUS.
No one could 'a' come without her seein' 'em.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
I suppose you know what'll happen to you if you are hidin' the man?
#THADDEUS.
There ain't no one here. We both been here all day, an' there couldn't no one come without our knowin' it. What would they want round here anyway?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
We'll search the place.
#MARY.
Ye ain't got no -
#SERGEANT HEALY.
What's that, woman?
#MARY.
There ain't no one here, an' ye're keepin' us from our sleep.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Your sleep? This is an affair of life and death. Get us a lantern.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Ha! Tryin' to hide the door are you, by puttin' a table in front of it. You can't fool me.
#THADDEUS.
It's a cubby - hole an' ain't been opened in years.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
I said to open the door.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
We're goin' to tear this place to pieces till we find him. You might just as well hand him over now.
#MARY.
There ain't no one here.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
All right. Now we'll see. Dick, you stand guard at the door.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Come along, man. I'll have a look at the upstairs. You sit down in that chair Don't you stir or I'll - I'll set fire to your house. Go on ahead.
#DICK.
Woman!
#MARY.
Yes.
#DICK.
Have you got an apple handy? I'm starved.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Here, what'd I tell you I'd do if you moved from that chair?
#MARY.
Oh, I didn't - I only - he wanted -
#DICK.
It's all right, Sergeant. I asked her to get me an apple.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Dick, take this lantern and search the barn. Come in here with me. Sit down!
#SERGEANT HEALY.
If I find him now, after all the trouble you've given me, you know what'll happen. There's likely to be two dead men and a woman, instead of only the Yankee.
#DICK.
Sergeant!
#SERGEANT HEALY.
What is it?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Now my good people, how did that horse get here?
#THADDEUS.
What horse?
#DICK.
There's a horse in the barn with a saddle on his back. I swear he's been ridden lately.
#THADDEUS.
There is?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
You know it. Come, woman, who drove that horse here?
#MARY.
I don't know. I didn't hear nothin'.
#THADDEUS.
Let me go an' see.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
No, you don't. You two have done enough to justify the harshest measures. Show us the man's hiding - place.
#THADDEUS.
If there's anybody here, he's come in the night without our knowin' it. I tell ye I didn't see anybody, an' she didn't, an' -
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Where is he?
#MARY.
There ain't nobody in the house 'cept us two.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Did you search all the outbuildings?
#DICK.
Yes. There's not a trace of him except the horse.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
He didn't have much of a start of us, and I think he was wounded. A farmer down the road said he heard hoof - beats. The man the other side of you heard nothing, and the horse is in your barn. There are ways of making people confess.
#THADDEUS.
For God's sake, don't. I know that horse looks bad - but as I live I ain't heard a sound, or seen anybody. I'd give the man up in a minute if he was here.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Yes, I guess you would. You wouldn't want me to hand you and your wife over to our army to be shot down like dogs. Your wife knows where he's hid.
#MARY.
I'm sure I wish I did. An' I'd tell ye quick, an' git ye out of here. 'Tain't no fun fer me to have ye prowlin' all over my house. Ye ain't got no right t' torment me like this. Lord knows how I'll git my day's work done, if I can't have my sleep.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Good God, what a clod! Nothing but her own petty existence. I'll have to ask you to get us something to eat. We're famished.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Come, Dick, we better give our poor horses some water. They're all tired out. The man isn't here. If he were, he couldn't get away while we're in the yard. Get us a pail to give the horses some water.
#MARY.
That ain't the horses' pail.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Come along, you can help.
#MARY.
That's the drinkin' water pail.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
That's all right.
#MARY.
Ye git back! Them soldiers'll see ye.
#NORTHERNER.
Some water. Quick. It was so hot in there.
#MARY.
Don't ye faint here. If them soldiers git ye, they'll kill me an' Thad. Hustle an' git back in the cubby - hole.
#NORTHERNER.
Be still, or they'll hear you. How are you going to get me out of this?
#MARY.
Ye git out. Why did ye come here, a - bringin' me all this extra work, an' maybe death?
#NORTHERNER.
I couldn't go any farther. My horse and I were both near dropping. Won't you help me?
#MARY.
No, I won't. I don't know who ye are or nothin' 'bout ye, 'cept that them men want t' ketch ye. Did ye steal somethin' from 'em?
#NORTHERNER.
Don't you understand? Those men belong to the Confederacy, and I'm a Northerner. They've been chasing me all day. They want this paper. If they get it before to - morrow morning it will mean the greatest disaster that's ever come to the Union army.
#MARY.
Was it ye rode by yesterday?
#NORTHERNER.
Don't you see what you can do? Get me out of here and away from those men, and you'll have done more than any soldier could do for the country - for your country.
#MARY.
I ain't got no country. Me an' Thad's only got this farm. Thad's ailin', an' I do most the work, an' -
#NORTHERNER.
The lives of thirty thousand men hang by a thread. I must save them. And you must help me.
#MARY.
I don't know nothin' 'bout ye, an' I don't know what ye're talkin' 'bout.
#NORTHERNER.
Only help me get away.
#MARY.
No one ever helped me or Thad. I lift no finger in this business. Why ye come here in the first place is beyond me - sneakin' round our house, spoilin' our well - earned sleep. If them soldiers ketch ye, they'll kill me an' Thad. Maybe ye didn't know that.
#NORTHERNER.
What's your life and your husband's compared to thirty thousand! I haven't any money or I'd give it to you.
#MARY.
I don't want yer money.
#NORTHERNER.
What do you want?
#MARY.
I want ye t' git away. I don't care what happens t' ye. Only git out of here.
#NORTHERNER.
I can't with the Southerners in the yard. They'd shoot me like a dog. Besides, I've got to have my horse.
#MARY.
What kind o' lookin' horse is it?
#NORTHERNER.
O God! If I'd only turned in at the other farm. I might have found people with red blood.
#MARY.
What ye goin' t' do with that gun?
#NORTHERNER.
Don't be afraid. It's not load -
#MARY.
I'd call 'em in, if I wasn't -
#NORTHERNER.
Go call them in. Save your poor skin and your husband's if you can. Call them in. You can't save yourself. You can't save your miserable skin. Cause if they get me, and don't shoot you, I will.
#MARY.
Oh!
#NORTHERNER.
You see, you've got to help me whether you want to or not.
#MARY.
I ain't done nothin'. I don't see why ye an' them others come here a threatenin' t' shoot me. I don't want nothin'. I don't want t' do nothin'. I jest want ye all t' git out a here an' leave me an' Thad t' go t' sleep. Oh, I don't know what t' do. Ye got me in a corner where I can't move.
#NORTHERNER.
Now you've done it. They'll be here in a minute. You can't give me up. They'll shoot you if you do. They'll shoot.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
What did you yell for? Answer!
#MARY.
I knocked the dipper off the table. It scared me.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Well, don't drop our breakfast. Put it on the table. We're ready.
#MARY.
It ain't finished.
#SERGEANT.
You've had time to cook a dozen meals. You're as slow as a snail. What did you do all the time we were in the barn?
#MARY.
I didn't do nothin'.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
You lazy female. Now get a move on, and give us something fit to eat. Don't try to get rid of any left - overs on us. If you do, you'll suffer for it. Don't you know anything, you brainless farm - drudge? Hurry, I said.
#DICK.
What a night. My stomach's as hollow as these people's heads.
#MARY.
That's one of my best towels.
#DICK.
Can't help it.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
'Tend to the breakfast. That's enough for you to do at one time.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
I don't see how he gave us the slip.
#DICK.
He knew we were after him, and drove his horse in here, and went on afoot. Clever scheme, I must admit.
#THADDEUS.
Have ye rid far to - night, misters?
#DICK.
Far enough.
#THADDEUS.
Twenty miles or so?
#DICK.
Perhaps.
#THADDEUS.
How long ye been chasin' the critter?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Shut up, man! Don't you see we don't want to talk to you. Take hold and hurry, woman. My patience's at an end.
#MARY.
There! I hope ye're satisfied.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Is this all we get? Come, it won't do you any good to be stingy.
#MARY.
It's all I got.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
It isn't a mouthful for a chickadee! Give us some butter.
#MARY.
There ain't none.
#SERGEANT HEALY.
No butter on a farm? God, the way you lie!
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Shut up!
#DICK.
Have you got any cider?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Don't ask. She and the man probably drank themselves stupid on it. I never struck such a place in my life. Get me another fork. How do you expect me to eat with that bent thing?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Now give us some salt. Don't you know that folks eat it on eggs?
#SERGEANT HEALY.
I said salt, woman! S - A - L - T. Salt! Salt!
#SERGEANT HEALY.
Have you tried to poison us, you God damn hag?
#MARY.
Call my coffee poison, will ye? Call me a hag? I'll learn ye! I'm a woman, and ye're drivin' me crazy.
#THADDEUS.
Mary! Mary!
#MARY.
I ain't a hag, I'm a woman, but ye're killin' me.
#NORTHERNER.
Go get my horse, quick!
#NORTHERNER.
I'm ashamed of what I said. The whole country will hear of this, and you.
#MARY.
I'll have to drink out the tin cup now.
