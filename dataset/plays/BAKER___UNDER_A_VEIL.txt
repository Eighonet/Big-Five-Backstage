#PRI.
Beg pardon, sir.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
All right.
#PRI.
Beg pardon, sir, exceedingly sorry to disturb you; he’s asleep.
#PRI.
I’m really very sorry to wake you, sir.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
What! you don’t mean to say it’s twelve.
#PRI.
Twelve! ah, to be sure, the hour I was to wake him for the ball. No, sir, it’s only ten o’clock; but he’s asleep again—the devil! I’m really pained to awake you, sir—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
What on earth’s the matter? Oh, it’s you, Mr. Red Lion, is it?
#PRI.
Beg pardon, sir, I am not Red Lion: it is my neighbor of the next hotel I suppose you allude to. Here, sir, you are in the first and best hotel in the town,—the White Horse.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
All right, with all my heart, then, Mr. White Horse. What is it?
#PRI.
Well, sir, the fact is, I’m in a dreadful fix—a most awkward predicament, out of which I cannot extricate myself without your assistance. You see, sir, if you will only pardon it, but my daughter was only married to - day. Yes, sir, married; in fact, sir, she was married to make her happy—you know, sir,—you understand! And, sir, just as we are having a little dance in honor of this marriage, which takes up all our spare accommodation, a lady and her maid arrive, asking for rooms; and, as they require two beds in one room, I dared to hope that perhaps, sir, you would oblige me by changing this room for the next one. You see, sir, that the bedroom belonging to this sitting - room has two beds, whilst in here there is only one bed, though in all respects furnished in the same manner. If you, sir, would oblige me by just looking in —Confound it, he’s asleep again! An idea occurs to me; here, George, catch hold of one end of this sofa. There, I don’t believe he’ll find it out; here, George, his luggage. There, now, that’s all right, and now I can fetch the ladies up.
#PRI.
These are the rooms, madam. This door leads into the bedroom.
#LUCINDA.
Many thanks. Don’t forget the horses at six o’clock to - morrow morning.
#PRI.
To the moment, madam. If you can find time, join us downstairs. Don’t forget; I shall expect you.
#ELIZABETH
All right; as soon as missus has done with me.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Hullo! there’s somebody talking in the next room.
#LUCINDA.
You seem to know the landlord, Elizabeth?
#ELIZABETH
Oh, yes, ma’am, I’ve known him for some time: his wife was a friend of mine, and his daughter that married to - day is my godchild.
#LUCINDA.
Indeed! Then I suppose you’d like to join them downstairs. You can go, and I’ll open my things myself.
#ELIZABETH
Oh, thank you, mum!
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
By Jove! one hears every thing that is going on next door. Seems to be a lady and her maid—not very gentlemanly to listen, Master Charley, but it’s interesting. Ah, well! when I was young this might have led to an adventure. I should never have rested until I had made the acquaintance of my fair neighbor,—for I suppose she is fair,—whilst now there’s not the slightest danger. Confound it! I must see this woman, though. Hullo! I could have sworn the lock of the door was on the other side just now. That’s deuced funny. Why, where the mischief am I? and how on earth did I get here?
#LUCINDA.
Half - past ten.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Ah! I understand. I thought I had a terrible nightmare. A frightful monster held me by the feet, and another by the head; it appears, however, that these monsters must have been the Red Lion or the White Horse, and my room has been given to this lady, whoever she may be, to suit their convenience. Well, I don’t care very much about seeing her. All women are alike—just as cats are all alike. Why, there’s no lock! only a bolt. Well, I can’t help that; let’s see if we can’t get another nap until it’s time to go to the ball.
#LUCINDA.
This “Voyage round the World” is always a charming book to read.
#LUCINDA.
Why, here’s somebody’s letter! Not very ladylike to read it, I suppose; but all women are curious. Seems to be unfinished. Of course it’s very wrong to read this letter ,— This is really too bad of me,— What on earth does that mean? I should much like to see the author ,— That’s all; this gentleman has got no further, or else he has taken away the end of it.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Oh! I can’t lay here any longer. Morpheus won’t come to my aid. What shall I do? Well, I might just as well finish my letter to George. Why! what the deuce have I done with it? Why, it seems to me I left it on the table before I went to sleep.
#LUCINDA.
“In that case, the only thing I can see for me to do is to join my mother.”
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Confound it! I’ve left it in the next room.
#LUCINDA.
After all, I’m not George, and I’ve no right to read that letter.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
But then my letter must be in the power of this woman. It appears to me that I’ve a perfect right to—
#LUCINDA.
Good gracious! there’s some one knocking. Who is there? What do you want? thousand pardons, madam. I am the person who inhabited a few minutes ago the room you now occupy; and by accident in leaving the room I left an unfinished letter.
#LUCINDA.
Dear me! This is the young gentleman that’s too lazy for any thing.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Would you be kind enough to return me my letter?
#LUCINDA.
Sir, I’ll ring in order that your letter may be brought to you. thousand pardons, madam; but pray don’t trouble to ring. Can’t you slip it under the door?
#LUCINDA.
Oh, certainly! There it is.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Thanks. A charming voice,—soft as a bird’s; and, if the plumage only corresponds— Confound this bolt! Infamous hotel! By the way, I should like to know if she’s read this Well, there’s a very old method for ascertaining that: ask her. Madam, pardon me—
#LUCINDA.
What do you want, sir?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Madam, my letter was left open on the table; and in taking it up—without, of course, the slightest desire—your eye must naturally have fallen upon it, and—
#LUCINDA.
I understand. I don’t understand you, sir; and, inasmuch as I’ve done what you desire, I must beg that we have no further conversation, as I shall refuse to answer.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Why, may I ask? I was asleep just now, and dreaming charmingly. If you like, I’ll tell you the dream.
#LUCINDA.
Certainly not, sir.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Very good: it’ll keep for another time; but then, inasmuch as it was you that woke me up, permit me at least to converse with you as a compensation.
#LUCINDA.
He is not stupid.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
I beg pardon: did you speak?
#LUCINDA.
What have I to dread? He seems a gentleman. Well, sir, proceed, as you consider yourself aggrieved; only remember that I trust to your feelings as a gentleman, and your discretion.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Madam, you may depend upon it. Are you married?
#LUCINDA.
Upon my word! Do you call that discretion, sir?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Most certainly; as a subject of conversation I see nothing against it. Society prescribes certain forms of conversation; and, to ascertain what forms to use, one must know whether one is speaking to a widow or a young girl, to an old maid or a married woman.
#LUCINDA.
In—I—I am married.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
So much the worse. I, madam, am a bachelor, and I’m going to Baden. Where may you be going? long way off, sir.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
To—
#LUCINDA.
To rejoin my husband, naturally.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
By the way, madam, do you love your husband?
#LUCINDA.
Excuse me, sir, but, if you don’t mind, we’ll change the conversation.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Whatever pleases you, madam, pleases me. A charming hotel, madam, is this Golden Lion. So well furnished, so well decorated! My goodness me! it gives me the inclination to set fire to the place.
#LUCINDA.
If you’ve any such intentions, sir, pray remember that I’m in the hotel.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Very good; only just remember, that, in not setting fire to the hotel, I’m saving your life. By the way, madam, now I come to think of it, you do not love your husband.
#LUCINDA.
Sir!
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
When one is compelled to separate one’s self from a husband that one loves, one is not so light - hearted as you were just now, and—
#LUCINDA.
Really, sir!
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Madam, pardon me, but you do not evidently possess a husband who would make you cry out in the words of Sterne, “Oh, Love, king of gods and men!” Now, if it had been my fate to have crossed your path, I swear that—
#LUCINDA.
And I swear to you, sir, that I would never marry a man who was too lazy to do any thing.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Madam, you have read my letter.
#LUCINDA.
I, sir? oh, dear, no! I can assure you I only looked at it. By the way, would you mind informing me how it is that you came to inhabit this room?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Well, the fact is, I went to sleep on the sofa: I’ve some faint recollection of the landlord coming in and asking me something about moving out; but he was so long about it that I fell asleep again, and during that time I fancy he had me quietly carried, sofa and all, into the next room. By the way, I have a charming idea.
#LUCINDA.
May I venture to ask it? I should like to have a look at this man.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Madam, in the East, you are aware that a veil is a protecting wall between man and woman. If you would endeavor to put on such a veil, and would do me the honor of granting me an interview,—the landlord can supply us with refreshments,—we can converse more easily than through this partition; in fact, we shall be in the East; and, further, I pledge myself on my honor as a gentleman, that nothing shall in any way cause you to regret our interview.
#LUCINDA.
His letter announces that he intends to risk his fortune. What if I could dissuade him? it would at least be the act of a Christian, and—and a woman.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
What! not a word? must I then beseech you in song?—
#LUCINDA.
I consent, but upon one condition; and that is, that you explain to me how it is that a man can be too lazy to do any thing.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Very good; at least I will explain to you the meaning of this somewhat bad joke.
#LUCINDA.
Sir, upon these conditions in a few moments I shall be prepared to meet you—in China.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Madam, in a few minutes I shall have the honor of presenting myself. Mr. Red Lion, or Mr. White Horse!
#LUCINDA.
I suppose I’d better alter my dress a little for the occasion.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
He has absolutely condescended to hear me,—this landlord. Upon my word, I’m rather pleased with this little adventure; if I’d gone to the ball, at any rate, I should never have heard so sweet a voice.
#PRI.
For nobody else but you, sir, would I have disturbed myself upon the auspicious occasion. To - day! yesterday! did I tell you that my daughter was married? Yes, sir, to make—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
You couldn’t do better, my dear White Horse, if you intended giving your daughter a husband. Just listen to me for a moment; you will oblige me by going up—yourself, mind—into that lady’s room next door.
#PRI.
Marrying one’s daughter, sir, when one is a father, is a grave responsibility; my emotions—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Of course you feel as a father; you will be good enough to take up plenty of candles, some flowers—
#PRI.
So long as she’s happy, so long as——candles, sir, yes, sir, and flowers; yes, sir.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Afterwards you will bring up some refreshments; tea, for instance.
#PRI.
Tea, sir?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Yes; tea, tea, tea.
#PRI.
Senna tea?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
No, confound you, ordinary tea!
#PRI.
Ordin— ordmorary— onding —You’re not ill, I hope, sir?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Not in the least, thanks. Ah, by the way, landlord, that lady in the next room—what sort of a person is she?
#PRI.
Char—ming, sir; be - a - u - ti - ful. Oh! she’s much handsomer than her father; but if hereafter he should betray her, if he should—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Who the devil are you talking about?
#PRI.
My shon - in - law.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Confound your son - in - law!
#PRI.
Yes, sir, certainly, sir: that’s what I say, and—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Be off, and do what I told you.
#PRI.
Yes, sir, directly; but you’ll understand that on such an auspicious—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
There, there—be off; Red Lion—he’s gone.
#PRI.
White Horse Hotel, sir, please.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
I suppose he’ll do what I’ve told him. I ought to change my coat too. Upon my honor , I’m delighted with my evening; and somehow or another, oddly enough, I feel quite curious to see this woman; in fact, I begin to be interested. It’s so long since I’ve been in the least interested—yes, it’s six months since any thing of the kind has happened. And my heart is, after all, but human: it detests a void.
#PRI.
George, your conduct is schandalush: your master’s daughter is married to - day, and you take no more notish of the event than a cow, than a cow or calf; you’ve no heart, George, you’ve no shoul.
#GEORGE.
But, sir—
#PRI.
Hold your tongue; pray for her happiness, and go down and tell her I’m coming.
#LUCINDA.
Oh, what a charming change! I congratulate you, sir.
#PRI.
I’ll tell her, madam, she will be delighted; such a day, you understand, madam. If she’s only happy! May heaven—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
He’s having a reel in the next room now.
#LUCINDA.
Who are you talking about?
#PRI.
Eh, my daughter, madam; at this moment she’s so happy—may she be so all her life! and as to your maid, madam, she dances as if my daughter’s happiness depended on her legs, you understand. Madam, of course I mean—
#LUCINDA.
Perfectly; be good enough to open that door, and show the gentleman in, who is in there.
#PRI.
But, madam—
#LUCINDA.
Do what I tell you.
#PRI.
Sir!
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
All right, I’ve heard; you can announce me.
#PRI.
You wrote your name in my book; but you see, sir, my daughter’s—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
You’ve forgotten it; say Mr. Charleston King.
#PRI.
Mr. Charles, son of a king!
#LUCINDA.
Son of a king!
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Charleston King, at your service, madam.
#PRI.
A veiled woman in my house on such a day!
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
It is really too good of you, madam, to receive a man in your rooms who you never saw; and I scarcely know how to thank you.
#LUCINDA.
You will thank me, sir, by explaining how it is that one can be—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Too lazy for any thing.
#LUCINDA.
Precisely. If you will take the chair near you, you can be seated.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Well, you see, in this world men have all sorts of faces. Confound this fellow! Just as I was getting on so nicely!
#PRI.
Madam—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Talking of faces, let me draw your attention, madam, to this one There is a face that has committed faults—crimes.
#PRI.
Crimes! Faults! Me, madam! me, sir! Here is the best tea, which upon this auspicious day—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
That’ll do.
#PRI.
Crimes! Faults! Yes, madam, your maid has charmed us to such an extent with her dancing on this auspicious—
#LUCINDA.
Go on talking, sir, whilst I pour out the tea.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Well, madam, in consequence of my misfortune my lifetime has indeed been a miserable one,—sorrow upon sorrow, faults accumulating upon faults.
#PRI.
Crimes! Faults, indeed!
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
My friends always insisted on declaring that I was too lazy to do any thing; and the unlucky star that I was born under, gossiping tongues, and certain circumstances all combined, seemed to favor such a prediction.
#LUCINDA.
But, sir, was this merited? Will you have a cup of tea, Mr.—Mr.—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Apollo.
#LUCINDA.
Mr. Apollo.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Madam! Ah, a thousand pardons. I was absorbed in thinking of my miserable self.
#LUCINDA.
Have you no relations?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
I had an uncle, a well - known merchant, but he died two years ago.
#LUCINDA.
And didn’t he leave any thing?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Oh, dear, yes; he left a very nice fortune. In fact, he adopted this young lady on purpose to do that.
#LUCINDA.
Oh, that wasn’t right.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
I don’t know that it’s wrong; but it is not on account of this that I owe him a grudge. I heard that the only way in which he could discharge an obligation to a friend of his was by adopting this friend’s daughter, who was left an orphan, a very charming person, I heard; at least, so I was told, for I refused to put my foot inside his house.
#LUCINDA.
Curious determination!
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Pardon me: not at all. The fact is, he insulted me,—he made me a present. present! what could it be?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
“A very handsome dressing - case” , with my name engraved upon it, and below my name the following compliment: “Too lazy to do any thing.” I was furious, but I wanted a dressing - case: so, as I wanted a dressing - case, I kept it. I’ll trouble you for another cup of tea, at least if you don’t find me too lazy for that?
#LUCINDA.
With pleasure.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Thanks; don’t let’s talk of my unfortunate self any more; a little more sugar, please.
#LUCINDA.
This country band really plays that waltz charmingly.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Yes, oh, yes; how often have I heard that air, and how happy have I been!
#LUCINDA.
That waltz?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
My mother used to play it to me when I was a little child!
#LUCINDA.
Have you any control over yourself?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Most certainly, a good deal even; ask me to prove it.
#LUCINDA.
You would not grant what I ask.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
I wouldn’t. Ah, madam! you want to send me away.
#LUCINDA.
Not at all: only I wished to explain to you, that, never having worn a thick veil in a room, I’m simply stifling.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
I can quite believe you. Nothing, nothing is so dangerous as a thick veil: you must take it off at once,—you must.
#LUCINDA.
If you can sufficiently control yourself to sit in a chair here without turning your head, I will sit behind you, and we can finish our conversation without my being stifled.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
What, madam!
#LUCINDA.
Well, you must choose; for, as I don’t want to die of suffocation, I shall be forced to give you your congé.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Madam, this is the second time it is my good fortune to save your life to - night, in return for which—
#LUCINDA.
Then, sir, I am to understand that, notwithstanding all the misfortunes connected with your nickname, you have still hope.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Yes,—hope, that poor little creature that nothing can kill.
#LUCINDA.
It is, then, this hope that takes you to Baden?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Baden is, as far as I’m concerned at this moment, my last hope in this world; then, if my luck is once more against me, if fortune fails to help me, if that poor little creature, hope, succumbs to bad luck, why, then—
#LUCINDA.
You’ll go and join your mother.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Yes, madam, I shall go.
#LUCINDA.
If you do that, I shall have to tie you with my handkerchief. Don’t you think now, joking apart, that it would be wiser, without tempting fortune at Baden, to go to your “mother at once”? She’d play to you again. Come, do you hear that waltz? and when you hear it once more by her side,—that dear mother,—you’ll be happy, and—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Ah! then, in reading my letter, you evidently did not understand, did not comprehend.
#LUCINDA.
Comprehend what?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
The country that my mother is gone to.
#LUCINDA.
No.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
It is the Country of Peace, of Repose,—the only land from which the mother cannot return to console her child.
#LUCINDA.
Then, sir, am I to understand that if you lost—you would——he has no mother!
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
It would not interest you, madam, to learn all these details; but please to remember that you are not my friend George, and that I’ve not absolutely gone on my knees to you to read my letter.
#LUCINDA.
Just imagine if it were him! Well, sir, I don’t repent of having read your letter: in fact, I congratulate myself on having done so; and I am also glad to see you here, for now I can implore you, beseech you, to renounce such fatal plans; to beg of you with clasped hands to do so, in the name of your mother.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Madam!
#LUCINDA.
Listen, sir. I cannot explain to you my object in being so curious; but what is your name?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Charleston King.
#LUCINDA.
Sir!
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
That is my veil. If you want to take it off, remove your own.
#LUCINDA.
No, sir: that is impossible; but—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
In that case, madam, I am Charleston King, too lazy to do any thing, but quite at your service.
#LUCINDA.
What shall I do? Ah! Sir, we are about to part, probably never to meet again; would it be repugnant to your feelings to accept a souvenir?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Pardon, madam, but you don’t propose giving me a dressing - case?
#LUCINDA.
Don’t be alarmed. The souvenir I give you, do you promise to keep it?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
For ever, madam, I swear it. What can it be?
#LUCINDA.
Take it.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
A sprig of May!
#LUCINDA.
Upon which I have just left a kiss. You have sworn never to part with it. Good! Should you persist in your fatal project, at the moment when you are about to commit this frightful act, perhaps my poor little sprig may catch your eye; perhaps it will remind you of the days of your childhood, those happy days that have fled away; those Sundays when your mother’s smile was upon you as you filled your little arms with flowers, and brought your childish offering to her knees.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Keep still, my heart!
#LUCINDA.
If you should have such thoughts, your courage will be tried; for, in speaking to you of me, my little sprig will also remind you of your mother; and if you should still desire—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
No, no! I have no longer any such desire I swear it to you on my knees. But I must see the angel who—. Ah, cruel! This hand at least I hold.
#LUCINDA.
Give me my hand, sir, or else—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Or else—
#LUCINDA.
Tell me your name.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Shall I see your face?
#LUCINDA.
No, no! I cannot possibly—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Madam, I implore you! I beseech you!
#ELIZABETH
It’s me, mam. There’s no key.
#LUCINDA.
Elizabeth!—Get up at once, and return to your room, I implore you!
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Madam, I obey you; but—
#LUCINDA.
Thanks, sir, and don’t forget my lecture.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
In thinking of you, madam, I shall always remember it.
#ELIZABETH
Why, the key’s fallen out. She’s been up to something, I know.
#LUCINDA.
You must be tired, Elizabeth. Go to bed, my good girl, go.
#ELIZABETH
I tired! Oh, no, mum! Surely thirty waltzes or quadrilles wouldn’t tire me much; and there’s only two hours to sleep. It’s not worth while going to bed: so, if you please, mum, I’ll sit up with you.
#LUCINDA.
It must, then, be that nephew, the son of his sister, of whom Mr. Mortimer always avoided speaking to me.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
What on earth made her so anxious to know my name?
#LUCINDA.
At any rate, I have his promise: that’s some consolation. By the way, Elizabeth, did you know Mr. Mortimer’s nephew?
#ELIZABETH
Well, yes,—little Charley Devereux. Oh, yes! I recollect; and I—I— thank you, sir: I don’t dance any more.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
And to think she’ll leave without my seeing her face! It’s abominable!
#LUCINDA.
She’s asleep, poor thing! She’ll catch cold.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Ah, this window! Perhaps there’s a veranda.
#LUCINDA.
How can I ascertain for certain that he is Mr. Mortimer’s nephew? I must know it somehow.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
No road here; perhaps by the other staircase. I shall just go in without knocking, as if I had forgotten; that’s it: here goes.
#LUCINDA.
That noise was in his room. I think he’s gone out. If I was certain that dressing - case he spoke of would tell me! Sir, Mr. King! No answer. What have I to fear?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Yes, this is the room. She sleeps; my handkerchief too. Now, my charming girl, let me see your face. Confound it! Well, there’s the end of my dream.
#ELIZABETH
There’s somebody in the room. I knew she was up to something: I’ll find it out, see if I don’t.
#LUCINDA.
Ah, here it is at last,—Charles Devereux. It’s he, it’s he! Ah, how my heart beats! what shall I do now? The fact is, he’s very nice, notwithstanding his nickname.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Another dream, that takes itself off to the land of dreams. No, it’s always the same. If you were to go to a masked ball where there was only one woman—oh, love! oh, frenzy! the mask falls, ugh! no more love, no more frenzy. The woman’s ninety, and ugly as—heaven knows what.
#LUCINDA.
He’s come in. Mr. King!
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
And such a voice!
#LUCINDA.
Sir.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Woke her up, I suppose. Madam—
#LUCINDA.
Sir, I should like to have a few words of explanation with you.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Oh, by jingo!
#LUCINDA.
He’s locked himself in. Pardon me, sir, for troubling you; but—but—if I mistake not, you are Mr. Charles Devereux, the nephew of Mr. Mortimer.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
I suppose you mean, madam, that that gentleman was my uncle. I don’t dispute the fact. How the mischief did she find that out? Ah! it’s that confounded landlord told her.
#LUCINDA.
Well, sir, I’ve a most important communication to make to you from his adopted child.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
But I don’t want to hear what she’s got to say, madam. You know her?
#LUCINDA.
Yes, sir, I know her; and I also know that she has been seeking you for a long time, in order to give you up a fortune which by right belongs to you.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
What you propose, madam, is ridiculous. I could never accept a farthing.
#LUCINDA.
But suppose in seeing her you happen to like her, and that—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
I shall never like her.
#LUCINDA.
Perhaps you might. If she were like me, for instance?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Never, madam. I’m sworn celibacy,—a knight of Malta, in fact.
#LUCINDA.
What an extraordinary change! Mr. King, I’m in the greatest danger, and you alone can save me.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Madam, I’ve saved you twice to - night, and I distinctly refuse to do it any more.
#LUCINDA.
He’s absolutely getting impertinent. Sir, I have something to return to you that belongs to you,—a pocket - handkerchief.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Thanks: I’ve got it,—one with a monogram. I really believe I must barricade my door.
#LUCINDA.
He’s got it! Why, he must have come in here, then; and—and—of course he saw Elizabeth with my cloak round her. I see. Ha, ha, ha!
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Confound her, she’s laughing! She laughs too as if she was only twenty.
#LUCINDA.
So, sir, you refuse to open the door?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Quite impossible, madam. I’m gone, I’m a long way off, I’m on my road to Baden.
#LUCINDA.
Pleasant journey, sir. It can’t be helped, I must have recourse to more violent means.

I verily believe she’s going to burst the door in: I’d better bolt. The devil! this is becoming serious. It almost reminds me of my adventure amongst the savages in Africa, where the daughter of a king, with rings in her nose, took a violent fancy to me. The king favored the marriage, and told me quietly that I had the choice, if I didn’t marry his daughter he’d eat me. I at once answered, “Your Majesty, I prefer to enter your family to your mouth; I’ll marry your daughter to - morrow.” And during the night I escaped to the coast. Let us do the same, and escape to the coast.
#PRI.
Miss Lucy Mortimer wishes to have the honor of seeing you, sir.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Miss who, did you say?
#PRI.
Well, sir, beg pardon, it’s your cousin’s uncle or your uncle’s cousin.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Ask the lady to walk in, wretched man.
#PRI.
Miss Lucy Mortimer.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Madam, I thought I—
#LUCINDA.
Well, sir, what do you think of me?
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Ah, madam! Even the most confused man in the world could but confess that you are charming. If my neighbor were only half as pretty! Charming is not the word; but, excuse me, you come here at five in the morning, and ask me what I think of you. Well, that’s all right, I suppose; but pardon me if I go further, and venture to ask in the most humble manner in the world a little question.
#LUCINDA.
I’m listening.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
I scarcely know how to put it, but by what curious coincidence do you come to know my name?
#LUCINDA.
Because, sir, I found out. Because it’s the name of a kind, frank, brave young fellow, whom I really don’t find too lazy for any thing, and whom I’ve also learned to know as too honorable to misinterpret.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
That voice! impossible. It can’t be you. Who could I have seen there just now?
#LUCINDA.
My maid, who was asleep whilst I was here, reading your name.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Why, it’s like a dream. But your husband, madam—
#LUCINDA.
He too has gone to that land of rest.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
You are then—
#LUCINDA.
Miss Lucy Mortimer, your cousin, who can no longer retain the fortune that so justly belongs to you.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
But I absolutely refuse to—
#LUCINDA.
Ah, if you refuse me, I shall ask you to give me back my sprig of May.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Never. I will keep it to the last moment of my life, and with it the hand I now hold.
#LUCINDA.
Get up: here’s some one coming.
#PRI.
Madam, sir, the postilions are harnessed: I mean the horses.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Confound that landlord!—Come here, landlord. Did you ever hear that this hotel of yours was infected with a malady of the most infectious character?
#PRI.
Sir, I beg most distinctly to state that—
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Landlord, you’re very drunk.
#LUCINDA.
Oh, Charles, dear! I hope we sha’n’t catch it.
#CHARLES DEVEREAUX
Don’t be afraid, dear: the malady which I allude to is one from which we are both of us suffering, and it is one that has but one remedy for its cure. Dear friends, the malady is love: the remedy is marriage. If any of you are suffering from some of the premonitory symptoms of this insidious disease, you will, I feel sure, accord us your utmost sympathy. But if there should be any here who have not yet been attacked, and who wish to avoid contagion, let me strongly recommend them to avoid, upon any pretence whatever, a conversation with a lady which is to be carried on
