#EGÓRUSHKA.
"My sovereign father, glorious and brave king, Kiribít Verzoúlovich, I do not possess the courage to marry him now. Because when I was young I was wooed by King Gvidón."
#MÍTYA.
Well, Egórushka, is any one at home?
#EGÓRUSHKA.
Nobody; they've all gone driving. There's only Gordéy Kárpych at home. "Whereupon Kiribít Verzoúlovich said to his daughter" - only he's in such a rage, it's awful! I cleared out - he keeps on cursing. "Then the beautiful Militrísa Kirbítyevna called her servant Licharda to her."
#MÍTYA.
With whom was he angry?
#EGÓRUSHKA.
With my uncle, with Lyubím KÁRPYCH. On the second day of the holidays Uncle Lyubím KÁRPYCH dined with us; at dinner he got drunk and began to play the fool; it was awfully funny. I always get the giggles. I couldn't stand it, and then I burst out laughing, and they were all looking at me. Uncle Gordéy KÁRPYCH took it as a great insult to himself and very bad manners, and he was furious with him and turned him out. Uncle Lyubím Kárpych made a great row, and out of revenge went and stood with the beggars by the church door. Uncle Gordéy Kárpych said: "He has put me to shame," he said, "in the eyes of the whole town." And now he gets angry with everybody who comes near him, no matter who they are. "With the intention of advancing toward our town."
#MÍTYA.
Here they come, I think. Yes, it's so. Pelagéya Egórovna, Lyubóv Gordéyevna, and guests with them.
#EGÓRUSHKA.
I'll run up - stairs.
#MÍTYA.
Oh, Lord, what misery! Everybody in the streets is having a holiday, and everybody in the houses too, and you have to sit between four walls! I am a stranger to all, no relations, no friends! - And then besides! - O well! I'd better get to work; perhaps this wretchedness will pass off.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Mítya, Mítya dear!
#MÍTYA.
What do you want?
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Come up to us later on in the evening, my dear, and play with the girls. We're going to sing songs.
#MÍTYA.
Thank you exceedingly, I shall make it my first duty.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Why are you always sitting alone in the office? It's not very cheerful! You'll come, won't you? Gordéy Kárpych won't be at home.
#MÍTYA.
Good, I shall come without fail.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
He's going off again, you see; he's going off there to that friend of his - what's his name?
#MÍTYA.
To Afrikán Savvich?
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Yes, yes! He's quite gone on him! Lord forgive him!
#MÍTYA.
Take a seat, Pelagéya Egórovna.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Oh, I have no time. Well, yes, I'll sit down a bit. Now just think, what a misfortune! Really, they've become such friends that it beats everything! Yes, that's what it's come to! And why? What's the use of it all? Tell me that, pray. Isn't Afrikán Savvich a coarse, drunken fellow? Isn't he?
#MÍTYA.
Perhaps Gordéy Kárpych has some business with Afrikán Savvich.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
What sort of business! He has no business at all. You see Afrikán Savvich is always drinking with that Englishman. He has an Englishman as director of his factory, and they drink together! But he's no fit company for my husband. But can you reason with him? Just think how proud he is! He says to me: "There isn't a soul here to speak to; all," he says, "are rabble, all, you see, are just so many peasants, and they live like peasants. But that man, you see, is from Moscow - lives mostly in Moscow - and he's rich." And whatever has happened to him? Well, you see, it was all of a sudden, my dear boy, all of a sudden! He used to have so much sense. Well, we lived, of course not luxuriously, but all the same pretty fairly decently; and then last year he went for a trip, and he caught it from some one. He caught it, he caught it, they have told me so - caught all these tricks. Now he doesn't care for any of our Russian ways. He keeps harping on this: "I want to be up to date, I want to be in the fashion. Yes, yes! Put on a cap," he says! What an idea to get! Am I going to try to charm any one in my old age and make myself look lovely? Bah! You just try to do anything with him. He never drank before - really he didn't - but now he drinks with this Afrikán. It must be that drink has turned his brain and muddled him.... I think now that the devil has got hold of him! Why can't he have some sense! If he were a young fellow! For a young fellow to dress up and all that is all right; but you see he's nearly sixty, my dear, nearly sixty! Really! "Your fashionable up - to - date things," says I, "change every day; our Russian things have lived from time immemorial! The old folks weren't any stupider than we." But can you reason with him, my dear, with his violent character?
#MÍTYA.
What is there to say? He's a harsh man.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Lyubóv is just at the right age now; we ought to be settling her, but he keeps dinning it in: "There's no one her equal, no! no!" But there is! But he says there isn't. How hard all this is for a mother's heart.
#MÍTYA.
Perhaps Gordéy Kárpych wishes to marry Lyubóv Gordéyevna in Moscow.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Who knows what he has in his mind? He looks like a wild beast, and never says a word, as if I were not a mother. Yes, truly, I never say anything to him; I don't dare; all you can do is to speak with some outsider about your grief, and weep, and relieve your heart; that's all. You'll come, Mítya?
#MÍTYA.
I'll come, ma'am.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Here's another fine lad! Come up - stairs to us, Yasha, and sing songs with the girls; you're good at that; and bring along your guitar.
#GÚSLIN.
Thank you, ma'am: I don't think of that as work; I must say it's a pleasure.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Well, good - by! I'm going to take a nap for half an hour. and MÍTYA. Good - by. goes out; MÍTYA seats himself dejectedly at the table; GÚSLIN seats himself on the bed and takes up the guitar.
#GÚSLIN.
What a crowd there was at the fair! Your people were there. Why weren't you?
#MÍTYA.
Because I felt so awfully miserable.
#GÚSLIN.
What's the matter? What are you unhappy about?
#MÍTYA.
How can I help being unhappy? Thoughts like these keep coming into my head: what sort of man am I in the world? My mother is old and poor now, and I must keep her - and how? My salary is small; I get nothing but abuse and insults from Gordéy Kárpych; he keeps reproaching me with my poverty, as if I were to blame - and he doesn't increase my salary. I'd look for another place, but where can one find one without friends? And, yes, I will confess to you that I won't go to another place.
#GOSLIN.
Why won't you go? There at the Razlyulyáyevs' it's very nice - the people are rich and kind.
#MÍTYA.
No, Yasha, that doesn't suit me! I'll bear anything from Gordéy Kárpych, I'll stand poverty, but I won't go away. That's my destiny!
#GÚSLIN.
Why so?
#MÍTYA.
Well, I have a reason for this. It is, Yasha, because I have another sorrow - but nobody knows about it. I haven't spoken to any one about my sorrow.
#GÚSLIN.
Tell me about it.
#MÍTYA.
What for?
#GÚSLIN.
Yes, tell me; don't put on airs!
#MÍTYA.
Whether I tell you or not, you can't help me!
#GÚSLIN.
How do you know?
#MÍTYA.
Nobody can help me - I am a lost man! I've fallen wildly in love with Lyubóv Gordéyevna.
#GÚSLIN.
What's the matter with you, Mítya? Whatever do you mean?
#MÍTYA.
Well, anyhow, it's a fact.
#GÚSLIN.
You'd better put it out of your head, Mítya. Nothing can ever come of that, so there's no use thinking about it.
#MÍTYA.
Though I know all this, one cannot control one's heart. "To love is most easy, one cannot forget." "I love the beautiful girl more than family, more than race; but evil people forbid me, and they bid me cease."
#GÚSLIN.
Yes, indeed; but you must stop it! Now Anna Ivánovna is my equal; she has no money, and I haven't a kopek - and even so uncle forbids me to marry. It's no use for you to think of doing so. You'll get it into your head and then it'll be still harder for you.
#MÍTYA.
"What of all things is most cruel? The most cruel thing is love." Yasha, have you read Koltsóv?
#GÚSLIN.
Yes, why?
#MÍTYA.
How he describes all these feelings!
#GÚSLIN.
He does describe them exactly.
#MÍTYA.
Exactly, to perfection. Yasha!
#GÚSLIN.
What?
#MÍTYA.
I myself have composed a song.
#GÚSLIN.
You?
#MÍTYA.
Yes.
#GÚSLIN.
Let's make up a tune for it, and we'll sing it.
#MÍTYA.
Good! Here, take this and I'll write a little - I have some work: most likely Gordéy Kárpych will be asking me about it.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Hello, boys!
#GÚSLIN.
What a fool! What did you buy that accordion for?
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Why, I bought it to play on, of course - this way.
#GÚSLIN.
Well, that's fine music, I must say! Stop, I tell you!
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
What! Do you think I'll stop? I'll stop when I want to. - What airs! Haven't I got any money? It chinks! If we go on a spree - then it's some spree! Mítya! Mítya, why are you sitting still?
#MÍTYA.
I have some work to do.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Mítya! Say, Mítya, I'm on a spree, my boy! Really, I am. Oh, come on! Mítya! Say, Mítya, I'm going on a spree for the whole holiday season - then I'll set to work, upon my word I will! Haven't I got any money? There it is! And I'm not drunk. - Oh, no, such a spree! - so jolly!
#MÍTYA.
Well, go on a spree as much as you like.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
And after the holidays I shall marry! - Upon my word I shall marry! I'll get a rich girl.
#GÚSLIN.
Now, then, listen; how does this sound?
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Sing it, sing it! I'll listen.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Good! Very good! It's awfully sad; it takes hold of one's heart. Ah, Yasha! play something cheerful; that's enough of this stuff - to - day's a holiday. Play the tune, Yasha.
#MÍTYA.
That's enough of your fooling. Come, now, let's sit down in a circle and sing in a low tone.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
All right.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
What's all this screeching! Bawling like so many peasants! And you here! You're not living here in a peasant's hut! What a dram - shop! See that this sort of thing doesn't go on in the future! Why are these papers all scattered about?
#MÍTYA.
I was looking over the accounts, sir. GORDÉY KÁRPYCH. And this, too, what's this rubbish?
#MÍTYA.
I was copying these poems of Koltsóv's to pass the time away, since it's a holiday. GORDÉY KÁRPYCH. You are sentimental for a poor lad!
#MÍTYA.
I just study for my own education, in order to understand things.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Education! Do you know what education is? - And yet you keep on talking! You ought to get yourself a new coat! For when you come up - stairs to us and there are guests, it's a disgrace! What do you do with your money?
#MÍTYA.
I send it to my mother because she is old and has nowhere to get any.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Send it to your mother! You ought to educate yourself first; God knows what your mother needs! She wasn't brought up in luxury; most likely she used to look after the cows herself.
#MÍTYA.
It's better that I should suffer than that my mother should be in any want at all.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
This is simply disgusting! If you don't know yourself how to observe decency, then sit in your hovel! If you haven't anything to wear, then don't have any fancies! You write verses, you wish to educate yourself - and you go about looking like a factory hand! Does education consist in this, in singing idiotic songs? You idiot! Fool! Don't you dare to show yourself in that suit up - stairs. Listen, I tell you! And you too! Your father, to all appearances, rakes up money with a shovel, and you go about in this Russian smock.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
What do you say! It's new - French goods - I ordered it from Moscow - from an acquaintance - twenty rubles a yard! Do you think I ought to go about in a bob - tailed coat, like Franz Fédorych at the apothecary's! Why, they all tease him there! - the deuce of a coat! What's the use of making people laugh! GORDÉY KÁRPYCH. Much you know! It's hopeless to expect anything of you! You yourself are an idiot, and your father hasn't much more sense - he always goes about in dirty old clothes. You live like ignorant fools, and like fools you will die.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
That's enough!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
What?
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
That's enough, I say!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Clown! You don't even know how to talk straight! It's simply waste of words to speak to you - like shooting peas against a wall - to waste words on such as you, fools!
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Just look! How savage! What a rage he's in! Oh, we're awfully scared of you - you bet we are!
#MÍTYA.
There, that's the sort of life I lead! That's the sort of thing I have to put up with!
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
It'll drive you to drink - upon my word, it'll drive you to drink! But you'd better stop thinking about it.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Peace, honest company!
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
I welcome you to our shanty.
#MÍTYA.
Our respects! Please come in! What good wind brings you here?
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
No wind - we just took it into our heads and came. Gordéy Kárpych has gone out, and Pelagéya Egórovna has gone to lie down, so now we are free! Be as jolly as you please!
#MÍTYA.
I humbly beg you to sit down.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
It grew dull sitting silent cracking nuts. "Come on, girls," said I, "and see the boys," and that suited the girls.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
What stories you do make up! We never thought of coming here - that was your idea.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Much you didn't! You were the first! Everybody knows, if a person wants a thing, then he thinks about it; the boys of the girls, and the girls of the boys.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Ha, ha, ha! Anna Ivánovna, you have said it exactly.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Not a bit of it!
#MÁSHA.
Oh, how embarrassing!
#LÍZA.
Anna Ivánovna, you are just saying what isn't true.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Oh, you modest thing! I'd like to say a word - but it wouldn't be nice before the boys! - I've been a girl myself. I know all about it.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
There are girls and girls!
#MÁSHA.
Oh, how embarrassing!
#LÍZA.
What you say sounds very strange to us, and, I must say, it's disconcerting.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Ha, ha, ha!
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
What were we talking about just now up - stairs? Do you want me to tell? Shall I tell them? Well, have you calmed down now?
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Ha, ha, ha!
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
What are you opening your mouth for? It wasn't about you - don't you worry.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Even if it wasn't about me, still it may be there is some one who thinks about me. I know what I know!
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Well, guitar player, when will you marry me?
#GÚSLIN.
When I can get permission from Gordéy Kárpych. What's the use of hurrying! It isn't raining on us! Come along here, Anna Ivánovna; I've got something to say to you.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
What do you say! - Really?
#GÚSLIN.
It's really true.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Well, then, all right; keep quiet!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
You, Mítya, will you come to us later on in the evening?
#MÍTYA.
I will.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
And I'm coming; I'm good at dancing. Girls! do fall in love with me, one of you!
#MÁSHA.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself! What's that you're saying?
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Why such airs! I say, fall in love with me, somebody - yes - for my simplicity.
#LÍZA.
People don't talk like that to girls. You ought to wait till they do fall in love with you.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Yes, much I'll get from you by waiting!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
It may be somebody loves somebody and won't tell! He must guess himself.
#LÍZA.
How can any girl in the world say that!
#MÁSHA.
I know it!
#MÍTYA.
Who does that apply to?
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
We know to whom.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Stay, girls, I'll sing you a song.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Sing, sing!
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
"A bear was flying through the sky."
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Don't you know anything worse than that!
#LÍZA.
We might think you were making fun of us.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
If this isn't good enough I'll sing you another, for I'm a jolly fellow.
#MÁSHA.
This doesn't concern us.
#LÍZA.
We don't trade in flour.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
What are you interrupting for! Just guess this riddle. What's this: round - but not a girl; with a tail - but not a mouse?
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
That's a hard one!
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Indeed it is! - You just think it over! Now, girls, come along! Come along, boys!
#MÍTYA.
But I'll come later. I'll put things to rights here first.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Stop, don't be silly! They won't let me out! Oh, what girls! They're always up to something.
#MÍTYA.
Be seated, Lyubóv Gordéyevna, and talk to me for just a moment. I'm very glad to see you in my room.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Why are you glad? I don't understand.
#MÍTYA.
Oh, why! - It is very pleasant for me to see on your side such consideration; it is above my deserts to receive it from you. This is the second time I have had the good fortune -
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
There's nothing in that! I came here, sat awhile, and went away again. That means nothing. Maybe I'll go away again at once.
#MÍTYA.
Oh, no! Don't go! - Why should you! Permit me to present to you my work, the best I can do - from my heart.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
What is this?
#MÍTYA.
I made these verses just for you.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Still, it may be just some sort of foolishness - not worth reading.
#MÍTYA.
That I cannot judge, because I wrote it myself, and without studying besides.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Read it.
#MÍTYA.
Directly.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Give it here. Now I will write something for you.
#MÍTYA.
You!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Only I don't know how to do it in verse, but - just plain Russian.
#MÍTYA.
I shall regard such a kindness from you as a great happiness to myself. Here they are.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
It's a great pity that I write so abominably. Only don't you look, or I'll stop writing and tear it up.
#MÍTYA.
I won't look. But kindly condescend to permit me to reply, in so far as I am able, and to write some verses for you on a second occasion.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Write if you wish - only I've inked all my fingers; if I'd only known, I'd better not have written.
#MÍTYA.
May I have it?
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Well, take it; only don't dare to read it while I'm here, but after, when I've gone.
#MÍTYA.
It shall be as you wish.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Will you come up - stairs to us?
#MÍTYA.
I will - this minute.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Good - by.
#MÍTYA.
To our pleasant meeting!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Ah!
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Wait! What sort of a creature is this? On what pretext? On what business? We must consider this matter.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Is it you, uncle!
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Oh, it's I, niece! What? You got a fright? Clear out, never mind! I'm not the man to tell tales. I'll put it in a box, and think it over after, all in my spare time.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Good - by.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Mítya, receive unto thyself Lyubím Kárpych TORTSÓV, the brother of a wealthy merchant.
#MÍTYA.
You are welcome.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
My brother turned me out! And in the street, in a coat like this - one has to dance about a bit! The frost - at Christmas time - brrr! - My hands are frozen, and my feet nipped - brrr!
#MÍTYA.
Warm yourself up, Lyubím Kárpych.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
You will not drive me away, Mítya? If you do, I'll freeze in the yard - I'll freeze like a dog.
#MÍTYA.
How could I? What are you saying?
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
You see, Mítya, my brother turned me out. As long as I had a little money, I strolled about in warm places; now I have no money, and they won't let me come in anywhere. All I had was two francs and some - odd centimes! Not a great capital! It wouldn't build a stone house! It wouldn't buy a village! What could one do with such a capital? Where put it? Not take it to a bank! So then I took this capital and drank it up! - squandered it! - That's the way of it!
#MÍTYA.
Why do you drink, Lyubím Kárpych? That makes you your own enemy.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Why do I drink? From stupidity! Yes, from my own stupidity. Why did you think I drank?
#MÍTYA.
You'd better stop it.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
It's impossible to stop; I've got started on this track.
#MÍTYA.
What track?
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Ah, well, listen - you're a kind soul - what this track was. Only, you listen, take note of it. I was left when my father died, just a kid, tall as a bean pole, a little fool of twenty. The wind whistled through my head like an empty garret! My brother and I divided up things: he took the factory himself, and gave me my share in money, drafts and promissory notes. Well, now, how he divided with me is not our business - God be his judge! Well, then I went to Moscow to get money on the drafts. I had to go! One must see people and show oneself, and learn good manners. Then again, I was such a handsome young man, and I'd never seen the world, or spent the night in a private house. I felt I must try everything! First thing, I got myself dressed like a dandy. "Know our people!" says I. That is, I played the fool to a rarity! Of course, I started to visit all the taverns: "Schpeelen sie polka! Give us a bottle off the ice!" I got together enough friends to fill a pond! I went to the theatres -
#MÍTYA.
Well, Lyubím Kárpych, it must be very nice in the theatre.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
I kept going to see the tragedies; I liked them very much, only I didn't see anything decently, and I didn't understand anything because I was nearly always drunk. "Drink beneath the dagger of Prokóp Lyapunóv." By this sort of life I soon squandered all my money; what was left I intrusted to my friend Afrikán Kórshunov, on his oath and word of honor; with him I had drunk and gone on sprees, he was responsible for all my folly, he was the chief mixer of the mash! He fooled me and showed me up, and I was stuck like a crab on a sand bank. I had nothing to drink, and I was thirsty - what was to be done? Where could I go to drown my misery? I sold my clothes, all my fashionable things; got pay in bank - notes, and changed them for silver, the silver for copper, and then everything went and all was over.
#MÍTYA.
How did you live, Lyubím Kárpych?
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
How did I live? May God never give such a life to a Tatar! I lived in roomy lodgings, between heaven and earth, with no walls and no ceiling. I was ashamed to see people. I hid from the world; and yet you have to go out into God's world, for you have nothing to eat. You go along the street, and everybody looks at you. - Every one had seen what a life I used to lead, how I rattled through the town in a first - class cab, and now went about tattered and torn and unshaven. They shook their heads and away they went. Shame, shame, shame! There is a good business - a trade which pays - to steal. But this business didn't suit me - I had a conscience, and again I was afraid: no one approves of this business.
#MÍTYA.
That's a last resort.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
They say in other countries they pay you thalers and thalers for this, but in our country good people punch your head for it. No, my boy, to steal is abominable! That's an old trick, we'll have to give it up! But, you see, hunger isn't a kind old aunty, and you have to do something! I began to go about the town as a buffoon, to get money, a kopek at a time, to make a fool of myself, to tell funny stories, and play all sorts of tricks. Often you shiver from early morn till night in the town streets; you hide somewhere behind the corner away from people, and wait for merchants. When one comes - especially if he is rather rich - you jump out and do some trick, and one gives you five kopeks, and another ten: with that you take breath for a day and so exist.
#MÍTYA.
It would have been better, Lyubím Kárpych, to go to your brother, than to live like that.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
It was impossible; I'd been drawn in. Oh, Mítya, you get into this groove, and it isn't easy to get out again. Don't interrupt! You'll have a chance later. Well, then, listen! I caught cold in the town - it was winter; I stood in the cold, smartly dressed, in this coat! I was blowing on my fingers and jumping from foot to foot. Good people carried me to the hospital. When I began to get better and come to my senses, my drunken spell was over. Dread came over me! Horror seized me! How had I lived? What had I done? I began to feel melancholy; yes, such melancholy that it seemed better to die. And so I decided that when I got quite well, I would go on a pilgrimage, then go to my brother, and let him take me as a porter. This I did. I threw myself plump at his feet! "Be a father to me!" says I, "I have lived abominably - now I wish to reform." And do you know how my brother received me! He was ashamed, you see, that he had such a brother. "But you help me out," I said to him, "correct me, be kind to me, and I will be a man." "Not at all," says he, "where can I put you when important guests, rich merchants, and gentry come to see me? You'll be the death of me," says he! "With my feelings and intellect," says he, "I ought not to have been born in this family at all. See how I live," says he; "who'd ever guess that our father was a peasant! For me," says he, "this disgrace is enough, and then you must come and obtrude yourself again." He overwhelmed me as with thunder! After these words I went from bad to worse. "Oh, well," I thought, "deuce take him! He is very thick here. He needs a lesson, the fool. Riches are no use to fools like us; they spoil us. You need to know how to manage money." Mítya, I'll lie down here; I want to take a nap.
#MÍTYA.
Do lie down, Lyubím Kárpych.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Mítya, don't give me any money - that is, don't give me much; just give me a little. I'll take a nap here, and then go and warm myself a little, you understand! I only need a little - no, no! Don't be foolish!
#MÍTYA.
Here, take as much as you need.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
I need ten kopeks. This is all silver; I don't need silver. Give me two kopeks more, that will be just right. That's enough. You have a good heart, Mítya! My brother doesn't know how to appreciate you. Yes, I'll play a joke on him! For fools riches are an evil! Give money to a sensible man, and he'll do something with it. I walked about Moscow, I saw everything, everything! - I've been through a long course of study! You'd better not give money to a fool; he'll only go smash! Foh, foh, foh, brr! just like brother and like me, the brute! Mítya, I will come and spend the night with you.
#MÍTYA.
Come on. The office is empty now - it's a holiday.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Oh, but I'll play a funny joke on brother.
#MÍTYA.
What can she have written? I'm frightened! - My hands tremble! - Well, what is to be will be! I'll read it. "And I love you. Lyubóv Tortsóv."
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Why don't they come, our fine lads? Shall we go and fetch them?
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
No, you'd better not. Well, yes, if you like, fetch them. Fetch them, Annushka.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Well, evidently you aren't happy without him!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Oh, Annushka, if you only knew how I love him!
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Love him, then, my dear, but don't lose your wits. Don't let him go too far, or you may be sorry for it. Be sure you find out first what sort of a fellow he is.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
He's a good lad! - I love him very much; he's so quiet, and he's an orphan.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Well, if he's good, then love him; you ought to know best. I just said that! Many a girl comes to grief because of them. It's easy to get into trouble, if you don't use your sense.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
What is our love? Like a blade of grass in the field; it blooms out of season - and it fades.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Wait a moment! Some one's coming, I think. Isn't it he? I'll go and you wait, perhaps it's he! Have a good talk with him.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Who's there?
#MÍTYA.
It's I, Mítya.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Why were you so long in coming?
#MÍTYA.
I was detained. Lyubóv Gordéyevna, are you alone?
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Yes, what of it?
#MÍTYA.
Lyubóv Gordéyevna, how do you wish me to understand your letter? Do you mean it, or is it a joke? Tell me, Lyubóv Gordéyevna! I am now in such perplexity that I cannot express it to you. My position in your house is known to you; subordinate to everybody, and I may say utterly despised by Gordéy Kárpych. I've had only one feeling, that for you, and if I receive ridicule from you, then it would have been better for me never to have lived in this world. You may trust me! I am telling you the truth.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
No, Mítya dear, what I wrote to you was the truth, and not a joke. And you, do you love me?
#MÍTYA.
Indeed, Lyubóv Gordéyevna, I do not know how to express to you what I feel. But at least let me assure you that I have a heart in my breast, and not a stone. You can see my love from everything.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
But I thought that you loved Anna Ivánovna.
#MÍTYA.
That is not true!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Really, they told me so.
#MÍTYA.
If this were true, then what sort of a man should I be after acting as I have? Could I declare with words what my heart does not feel! I think such a thing would be dishonorable! I may not be worth your regard, but I'm not the man to deceive you.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
It is impossible to believe you men; all men in the world are deceivers.
#MÍTYA.
Let them be deceivers, but I am not.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
How can one know! Perhaps you also are deceiving me and want to play a joke on me!
#MÍTYA.
It would be easier for me to die in this place than to hear such words from you!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
No, Mítya, I didn't mean it. I know that you love me. I only wanted to tease you. Mítya dear! Mítya! Why are you silent? Are you angry with me? I tell you I was only joking! Mítya! Yes! Now, then, say something.
#MÍTYA.
Oh, Lyubóv Gordéyevna, I'm not in a joking humor! I'm not that sort of man.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Don't be angry.
#MÍTYA.
If you love me, then stop these jokes! They are not in place. Oh, it's all the same to me now! Maybe they can take you from me by force, but I won't give you up of my free will. I love you more than my life!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Mítya dear, what shall we do now?
#MÍTYA.
What shall we do? We didn't fall in love with each other just to say good - by!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Well, but what if they promise me to some one else?
#MÍTYA.
Look here, Lyubóv, one word! To - morrow we must go together to Gordéy Kárpych, and throw ourselves at his feet. We'll say so and so - whatever you please, but we can't live without each other. Yes, if you love me, then forget your pride!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
What pride, Mítya? Is this a time for pride! Mítya dear, don't be angry with me; don't remember my past words. It was only girlish foolishness; I'm sorry that I did it! I shouldn't have joked with you; I should have caressed you, my poor boy. Oh, but, if father doesn't consent to our happiness - what then?
#MÍTYA.
Who can tell beforehand? It will be as God wills. I don't know how it is with you, but for me life is not life without you!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Some one's coming! Go away quietly, dearest, and I'll come later.
#ARÍNA.
Well, you! You frightened me enough! What are you doing here? Your mother is looking for you there, and here you are! Why are you wandering about in the dark! Oh, you modest maiden! Fairy princess. Well, really, wasn't some one there with her? But I'm a silly old woman, I suspected some one! Oh, deary me, some trouble will be sure to come in my old age. Go along, Egórushka, and call the girls in from the neighbors; tell them Pelagéya Egórovna told you to invite them to come and sing songs.
#EGÓRUSHKA.
Oh! how are you, Arína, my dear?
#ARÍNA.
What are you so happy about, silly?
#EGÓRUSHKA.
Why shouldn't I be happy? It's such fun! Ha, ha, ha!
#ARÍNA.
And maybe the mummers are coming; the young people wanted to dress up.
#EGÓRUSHKA.
Oh, I shall die! Oh, Lord, I shall die!
#ARÍNA.
What's the matter with you, you scamp?
#EGÓRUSHKA.
Oh, I shall die of laughing! Oh, granny, I've got such giggles!
#ARÍNA.
Dress up yourself.
#EGÓRUSHKA.
I will, I will! Oh, Lord! Oh, Oh, Oh.
#ARÍNA.
Now you run along quickly and fetch the girls.
#EGÓRUSHKA.
In a second!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Arinushka, did you send for the girls?
#ARÍNA.
I did, my dear.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
That's right. Let them have a song with our folks, and cheer up Lyubóv and the guests. This is the time for them to enjoy themselves - while they're young. You know what a girl's life is - behind bolts and bars, never seeing the world! Now's their holiday! - Yes, let 'em have a good time!
#ARÍNA.
Yes, to be sure, to be sure! Why shouldn't they?
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Bring in some Madeira, Arinushka, the oldest we have; and gingerbread for the young people, and sweets - whatever you choose! Attend to it yourself, but don't forget the Madeira.
#ARÍNA.
I understand, I understand; there'll be enough of everything. Directly, my dear, directly!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
And a snack for the young men.
#ARÍNA.
Everything, everything will be all right. Don't you worry yourself; you join the guests. I'll do everything with pleasure.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Girls, boys, come here! There's more room here and it's lighter.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
We'll sit here. We'll watch them while they play.
#LÍZA.
"Just imagine, mother!" I said, "he doesn't know how to talk properly, and he even uses such words that it's absolutely impolite."
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Do you mean me?
#LÍZA.
We aren't talking about you; it's no business of yours. "But why, mother, must I love him?"
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Yes, my friend, I love the good old ways. Yes, our good old Russian ways. But there! my husband doesn't care for them! What can you do about it? That's his character. But I love them, I'm naturally jolly; yes, I love to give a person a bite and to get them to sing songs to me! Yes, I take after my family. Our family are all jolly, and love singing.
#FIRST GUEST.
When I look round, my dear Pelagéya Egórovna, there isn't the gayety that there used to be when we were young.
#SECOND GUEST.
No, no.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
In my young days I was the merriest sort of girl - always singing and dancing - indeed I was. Yes, what songs I knew! They don't sing such songs now.
#FIRST GUEST.
No, they don't sing them; new songs have come in now.
#SECOND GUEST.
Yes, yes, one remembers the old times.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Yasha dear! Sing us some good old songs.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
So it's no use for me to wait; evidently I shan't get any sense out of you.
#LÍZA.
What do you mean by sense? I don't understand.
#MÁSHA.
It's ridiculous to listen to you.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Yes, it's funny for you; but how is it for me? Really, why don't you love me?
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Let's sit down.
#ARÍNA.
Here, I've brought them!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Pass it to the young ladies. Arína! Bring us some wine. Yes, pour it out, pour out the Madeira, the Madeira; it will cheer us up. That's all right! Let's have a glass; they won't condemn us - we're old folks! Annushka! Come along and drink some wine. Won't you have some?
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Well, why shouldn't I drink some! They say, don't drink when there's no one round, but when there's company, it's all right.
#ARÍNA.
Have you had a drop too much, my boys?
#MÍTYA.
I don't drink.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
With pleasure! Now, then, let's start an old song.
#ARÍNA.
Stop, saucy; you've crumpled me all up!
#ARÍNA.
Let me go, I say! Now that's enough!
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
What are you teasing the old woman for? Come and dance with me.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Come on, then! Play for us, Yasha!
#FIRST GUEST.
That's a lively little woman.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Yes, very lively, very lively.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
That's the way we do it.
#EGÓRUSHKA.
The girls have come.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Ask them in. Sit down and sing the dish songs; I'm so fond of them. GORDÉYEVNA, MÁSHA, LÍZA, and ANNA IVÁNOVNA take off their rings and put them into the dish; the girls sing.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
High time, high time!
#ARÍNA.
The mummers have come; shall I let them in?
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Yes, let them in; let them have a dance. And you girls can sing afterwards.
#OLD MAN.
To all this honest company, greeting!
#TRAINER.
Make a bow, Mishka!
#OLD MAN.
Do you wish me to sing and dance and amuse you, and to limber up my old bones?
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
That's all right; yes, dance! Give them some wine, Arinushka.
#OLD MAN.
Thank you humbly for your kind words, and for the entertainment.
#FIRST GUEST.
Oh, what a fine boy! Ah!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Why, yes, my friend, he's still a child; but he does the best he can. He's young yet. Come here, Egórushka. Here's some gingerbread for you. Yes, he's still a child; you can't expect much from him!
#TRAINER.
Ask for wine, in honor of the goat.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Arinushka, bring some refreshments for the mummers.
#TRAINER.
Now, then, amuse the honorable company. Show how the fair young darlings, the fair young girls, pale and rosy ones, glance at the young men, and watch their suitors. And how the old woman goes to work, bending, shrivelled; old age has overcome her, the years have broken her down. Well, now bow to the honorable company.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
What are you doing?
#MÍTYA.
What's that to you?
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
I'll tell Pelagéya Egórovna; just see if I don't!
#MÍTYA.
You just dare to tell!
#GÚSLIN.
Look out for me! You see we'll go away from here together; it'll be dark and the alley is lonely - just remember that!
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
What are you meddling with me for? What's the use? I want to marry her, and I'm going to make proposals. What are you up to! Yes, I mean to marry her!
#MÍTYA.
We'll see about that.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Do you think they'll marry her to you? Not much! Not if I know it - I've got lots of money!
#ARÍNA.
What a racket! Stop! Some one seems to be knocking. That's true! They are knocking.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Go and open the door.
#ARÍNA.
He's come back himself! All rise.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
What's this rabble! - Get out! Wife! Pelagéya Egórovna! Greet my guest. You've ruined me!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
You are welcome, Afrikán Savvich, you are welcome.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Good evening, Pelagéya Egórovna. He, he, he! It's very cheerful here! We've struck it just at the right time.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Yes, here I am with the girls. Yes, I'm always with the girls. It's holiday time; I want to give my daughter some fun.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
You are welcome, Afrikán Savvich; make yourself at home. Turn the hussies out.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Why turn them out! Who's going to turn the girls out. He, he, he! They'll sing a song, and we'll listen and watch them, and we'll give them some money, but not turn them out.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
As you wish, Afrikán Savvich! Only I am abashed before you! But don't conclude from this that we are all uneducated - this is all the wife; nothing can knock anything into her head. How many times have I told you: if you want to have a party in the evening, call in the musicians, and have things in good form. You can't say I deny you anything.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Well, what's the use of musicians - for us old women? You can amuse yourself with them!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
There, that's the idea of life she has! It makes you laugh to hear her.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
What do you mean? Idea, idea! It would be better for you to give your guest something to eat. Would you like something, Afrikán Savvich? Some wine with us old women?
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Wife! Have you really gone out of your mind! Hasn't Afrikán Savvich ever seen Madeira before! Order champagne - a half dozen - and be quick about it! Then order lighted candles in the reception - room where the new furniture is. That will give quite another effect.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
I will do it myself at once.
#FIRST GUEST.
We will come with you, my dear; it's time we were going home.
#SECOND GUEST.
It's time, it's time! The nights are dark, and the dogs in the lanes are fierce.
#FIRST GUEST.
Yes, fierce; very fierce!
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Let's join the young ladies. Where did you pick up such beauties - he, he! Good evening, Lyubóv Gordéyevna, my beauty. May I join your company?
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
We don't drive any one away.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Be seated; you'll be our guest.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
You're pretty chilly to the old man! It's Christmas time now, and I suppose we may exchange kisses.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Why be so affectionate?
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Gordéy Kárpych, may I kiss your daughter? And I must confess - he, he - I'm fond of this sort of thing. Yes, well, who doesn't like it! He, he!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
You're welcome to do so; don't stand on ceremony.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Will you give me a kiss, young lady?
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
If my father wants me to.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Well now, every one of them, right down the line.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
I suppose so! I'm not proud.
#MÁSHA.
Oh, how embarrassing!
#LÍZA.
Well, there's nothing to be said; I must say it's a treat!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Why are you here? Is this your place? "The crow has flown into the lofty palace!"
#KÓRSHUNOV.
I'm not like you, Lyubóv Gordéyevna; you didn't even want to kiss me, he, he, he! And I've brought you a little present.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
You needn't have taken the trouble.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Here I've brought you some diamonds, he, he!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Oh, they're earrings! I thank you humbly.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Show them to us.
#MÁSHA.
But they are charming!
#LÍZA.
And in such good taste!
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Give me your hand. You see, I like you very much, he, he, he! I like you very much; well, but you don't like me, I suppose?
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Why shouldn't I like you?
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Why? You like some one else, that's why. But you will come to love me! I'm a good man - a jolly man, he, he, he!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
I don't know what you are talking about.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
I say, you will come to love me. Why not? I'm not old yet. Am I an old man? He, he, he! Well, well, there's no harm in that. To make up for it you shall wear cloth of gold. I haven't any money! I'm a poor man. I've only got about five hundred thousand, he, he, he! In silver!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
I don't need your money.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Lyubóv, where are you going?
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
To mother!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Wait! She'll come here.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
You don't want to sit by the old man? Give me your hand, young lady; I will kiss it.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Oh, good heavens!
#KÓRSHUNOV.
What a hand! He, he, he! Like velvet!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Oh, let me go! I don't want it; I don't want it!
#KÓRSHUNOV.
That's all right; it's no loss to me - it won't ruin me.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
But I don't want it. Give it to whomever you like.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
I gave it to you, and I won't take it back! He, he, he!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Come now and have a drink.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
All right, Gordéy Kárpych, give me something to drink. And you girls, sing a song in my honor - I love to have respect shown me.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Girls, sing a song for him.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
To our dear friend Afrikán Savvich! Make a bow, wife!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
If you please, Afrikán Savvich, I humbly beg you.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Wife, drink!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Oh, somehow I don't like this kind of wine! Well, yes! I'll take just a glass.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
That's nice. I like that. Now, then, come here some one. Oh, you little bright eyes! You girls, I suppose, need a lot to set off your fair faces and rosy blushes; he, he, he! But I haven't any money! It will be on me, he, he, he! Hold out your apron! Now, then, Gordéy Kárpych, tell your wife why we came.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
I told you, wife, long ago, that living in this town bored me, because you can't take a step here without seeing that the people are absolutely ignorant and uneducated. And so I want to move from this place to Moscow. But there will be a man there who is no stranger to us - our dear son - in - law, Afrikán Savvich.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Oh! Oh! What are you saying!
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Yes, we've shaken hands on it, Pelagéya Egórovna. What are you afraid of? I'm not going to eat her!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Oh, Lord! She's my daughter! I won't give her up!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Wife!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
My dear Gordéy Kárpych! Don't trifle with a mother's heart! Stop! You've fairly staggered me!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Wife, you know me! And you, Afrikán Savvich, don't be uneasy: with me saying is doing!
#KÓRSHUNOV.
You have promised - then keep your word.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Father, I will never take a step against your will. But have pity on me, poor girl that I am! Don't ruin my young life!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
You're a fool, and don't understand your own happiness! You'll live in Moscow like a lady; you'll ride in a coach. In the first place, you'll live in the city - and not in a wilderness like this! In the second place, these are my orders!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
I dare not disobey your command. Father! Don't make me unhappy for my whole life! Relent, father! Make me do whatever you like, only don't compel me to marry a man I don't love!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
I never take back my word.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
As you wish, father!
#KÓRSHUNOV.
There, that business is over! Now, then, girls - a marriage song!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Not that, not that! Sing another!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Let's go into the reception - room, Afrikán Savvich. Wife, all of you, come there!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Where can I hide myself!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Arína, bring along the wine!
#ARÍNA.
Oh, wait, I can't attend to you now! My darling child! Girls, my dearies! Here's the song we'll sing.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
For the last time.
#ARÍNA.
I didn't expect this, my dear friends! I never thought to see it! He fell upon us like a hawk - like snow on the head; he seized our darling swan from the flock of her dear ones, from father, from mother, from kinsfolk, and from friends. We didn't realize what was happening. What things happen in this world of ours! Nowadays people are double - faced and sly, crafty, and cunning. He fairly befogged Gordéy Kárpych with this and that in his old age, and he began to hanker after his wealth. They have engaged our lovely beauty to a disgusting old man. Now she is sitting there, my darling, broken - hearted! Oh, I'm ready to die! After I have brought you up and nursed you, and carried you in my arms! I cared for you like a little bird - in cotton wool! Just now she and I were talking it over together. "We won't give you up, my child," I said, "to a common man! Only if some prince comes from foreign lands, and blows his trumpet at our door." But things didn't turn out our way. Now there he sits - the man who is going to tear her away - fat and flabby! Staring and smirking at her! He likes it! Oh, confound you! Well, now they've finished eating and are getting up; I must set to work.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Come along, Arinushka, and help me to get the table ready. Yes, I'll sit down and rest - I'm tired.
#ARÍNA.
Of course you are tired, my dear! Day in, day out, on your feet! You aren't as young as you were once!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Oh! Tell them to send the big samovar to the maids' room - the very biggest; and find Annushka and send her to me.
#ARÍNA.
Certainly, certainly.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Yes, go along! Go along! Oh, I can't stand it! My head's fairly splitting! Nothing but sorrow - and here comes more trouble! Yes, yes, I'm worried to death! Oh, oh, oh! I'm tired out, absolutely tired out! I've a lot to do, and my head's just spinning. I'm needed here, and I'm needed there, and I don't know what to begin on! Really - yes - What a husband for her! What a husband! Oh, oh, oh! How can you expect her to love him! Do you think she is hankering after his money? She is a girl now - in the bloom of youth - and I suppose her heart beats now and then! What she ought to have now is a man she can love - even if he's poor - that would be life! That would be paradise!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Here are the keys of the tea cupboard. Go along and pour it out for the guests, and do everything that is necessary - you know yourself! I've walked my legs off! But you don't mind it; you're young yet - yes, go and serve them.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
I'd just as soon as not. It's no great work; my hands won't wear out!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
There - there's the tea in the cupboard, in the little red caddy.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
What do you want, Mítya dear?
#MÍTYA.
I - I - Pelagéya Egórovna, for all your kindness, and for all your consideration - even though it may be I am not worth it - seeing that while I was an orphan - you never deserted me - and like a mother - I will be thankful to you all my life, and will always pray to God for you.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
But what are you doing, Mítya?
#MÍTYA.
I thank you for everything. And now good - by, Pelagéya Egórovna.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Where are you going?
#MÍTYA.
I plan to go to my mother's.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Are you going for long?
#MÍTYA.
Yes, I asked the master for a vacation, and it's most likely that I'll stay there for good.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
But why do you wish to leave us, Mítya?
#MÍTYA.
Why, I just! - You see - I've already decided.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
But when are you going?
#MÍTYA.
To - night. I thought to myself that I shouldn't see you before to - night, and so I came to say good - by.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Very well, Mítya, if you are needed there - we won't keep you; God be with you! Good - by!
#MÍTYA.
Might I be allowed to say good - by to Lyubóv Gordéyevna? You see we have lived in the same house - maybe I shall die before I see her again!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Yes, you must, you must. Say good - by to her, of course! Annushka, go and fetch Lyubóv.
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
"One man leads her by one hand, another by the other, a third stands and sheds tears; he loved her, but did not get her."
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Oh, Mítya, my dear! What trouble we are in! How can we drive it away - get rid of it - I cannot think. It's as if a thunderbolt had struck me! I can't recover myself.
#MÍTYA.
You have no one to blame but yourself for your unhappiness, Pelagéya Egórovna; you are marrying her off yourself, ma'am.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Yes, we are doing it ourselves; we are marrying her off ourselves! Only it's not with my consent, Mítya! If I had my way, do you think I'd give her up? Do you think I'm her enemy?
#MÍTYA.
He's a man - from what I hear - not a very great catch! There's nothing good to be heard of him - except what's bad.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
I know, Mítya dear, I know.
#MÍTYA.
Well, from all accounts, I must say this, that most likely Lyubóv Gordéyevna, married to such a man, and living far away from you, will absolutely perish - no doubt of it.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Oh, don't speak of it to me, don't speak of it! I'm distracted enough about it without your saying anything. I've worn my eyes out with gazing at her! If I could only look at her enough to last me forever! It's as if I were getting ready to bury her.
#MÍTYA.
How can such things happen? How can people do such things? She's your own daughter, I suppose!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
If she weren't my own, then I shouldn't be weeping and wailing, and my heart wouldn't be breaking over her tears.
#MÍTYA.
Why weep? It would be better not to marry her. Why are you ruining the girl's life, and giving her into slavery? Isn't this a sin? You will have to answer for it to God.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
I know, I know it all, but I tell you, Mítya, it's not my doing. Why do you keep on blaming me? It's horrible enough for me without your talking about it, and you stir me up still more. Mítya, you should pity me!
#MÍTYA.
It's true, Pelagéya Egórovna, but I can't endure this sorrow. Maybe it's worse for me than for you! I trust you so much, Pelagéya Egórovna, that I will open my heart to you as if you were my own mother. Yesterday evening, when you were having the evening party.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Well, well, tell me, tell me!
#MÍTYA.
Well, then, she and I made a compact in the dark, that we would go together to you and to Gordéy Kárpych, and beg you humbly; we were going to say: "Give us your blessing; we cannot live without each other any longer." And now suddenly, this morning, I heard - and my arms just dropped by my side!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
What are you saying?
#MÍTYA.
I swear it, Pelagéya Egórovna, in the name of the Lord!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Oh, my dear boy! What a luck - less lad you are, now that I know all!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Here, Lyubóv dear! Mítya has come to say good - by; he is going away from here to his mother's.
#MÍTYA.
Good - by, Lyubóv Gordéyevna! Don't bear me any ill will!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Good - by, Mítya!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Kiss each other good - by; it may be that God will not let you see each other again. Well, never mind! Stop, stop your weeping! you will drive me wild!
#MÍTYA.
Oh, I'll risk everything now; everything in the world! Pelagéya Egórovna, are you sorry to marry your daughter to an old man, or not?
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
If I weren't sorry, I shouldn't be crying.
#MÍTYA.
Will you permit me to speak, Pelagéya Egórovna?
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Speak!
#MÍTYA.
This is what I have to say: Get her ready and put on her warm clothes. Let her slip out quietly; I'll seat her in my fairy sleigh, and that's the last of us. Then the old man will never see her any more than his own ears! And no matter if I do go to ruin! I will take her to my mother and there we will get married. Oh, just give us a chance! I want some joy in life! At any rate, if I have to pay the price, at least I shall know that I've really lived.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
What do you mean? What do you mean, you scamp?
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
What an idea, Mítya!
#MÍTYA.
So you don't love me? Or have you ceased to love me?
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
What you say is dreadful!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
What an idea, you scamp! Who would dare to take such a sin on his soul? Yes, come to your senses! What are you thinking of?
#MÍTYA.
Why, I said if you're sorry! But if you're not sorry - then give her to Afrikán Savvich; sell her into slavery forever and ever. You'll be miserable yourselves when you see her wretched life; you'll come to your senses, you and Gordéy Kárpych, but then it will be too late.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
But how could you, without her father's blessing? How could you? Judge for yourself!
#MÍTYA.
Certainly, how could we live without a blessing! Then you bless us, Pelagéya Egórovna. and Gordéy Kárpych, it may be - himself, in time - somehow -
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
What can I say to you? I feel altogether distracted. - Yes, I'm going out of my mind! I don't know anything! I don't remember anything! Yes, yes, my head spins. Oh, my darlings, my heart is torn!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Goes to MÍTYA] No, Mítya, this can't be! Don't torture yourself for nothing; stop! Don't tear my soul! Already my heart is all withered away within me! God be with you; good - by!
#MÍTYA.
Why did you deceive me and mock at me?
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Don't, Mítya! Why should I deceive you? Why? I fell in love with you; so I told you, myself. But now we must not go against the will of our parents. For it is the will of my father that I should marry; I must submit to him - that is a girl's lot. It must be that that's the right thing since it was so ordained of old. I don't want to go against my father; I don't wish people to talk about me and make an example of me. Although it may be I have broken my heart because of this - at any rate I know that I am acting according to law; no one will dare to look me in the face and jeer. Good - by!
#MÍTYA.
Well, now I know my fate! Good - by! Good - by, Pelagéya Egórovna, you have been my benefactress! So long as I live I shall not forget your goodness and kindness to me; you did not forget the orphan in a strange land.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Good - by, my dear; do not blame us in any way - that would be a sin for you. God grant that you may live happily; we shall not forget you. MÍTYA bows and goes out.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
How I pity that boy, Lyubóv dear! Oh, my child, oh, dear! It never entered my head that you loved him. How could I guess it, poor old woman that I am! What do I amount to? There, crying is our business, and I haven't any authority over my daughter! But it would be a good idea! I'd enjoy the sight of you in my old age. The boy is such an honest fellow, with such a tender heart, and he would be fond of me in my old age. And as I look at you, my child, how can you help being sad? And I have no way to help you, my darling!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Well, mother, what's the use of thinking about what's impossible, and only torturing ourselves? "May I come in?"
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Come in, sir. KÓRSHUNOV. Ah, there she is, my bride! Where were you hiding yourself? He, he! I'll find you, I'll find you anywhere. If you please, Pelagéya Egórovna, permit me to talk confidentially with your daughter about our own affairs.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Certainly. Oh, well, I know what it's about! I suppose you want to marry a young fellow? Now, this, my pretty one is just girlish folly. Now, just listen to what I'm going to tell you; I'll tell you the truth straight out. I don't like to deceive any one, and have no need to. Will you listen, eh?
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Yes.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Good! Now, we'll begin with this point. Will a young man appreciate your love? Any girl will love a young man; that is nothing unusual for him; but to an old man it is precious. An old man will reward you for your love with some little gift, this and that - with gold, and with velvet - and there's nothing he won't give you. And in Moscow there are lots of nice things in the shops; there are things worth giving! So it's nice to fall in love with an old man. That's number one for you! And then this is what happens with a young and good - looking husband. You see they are a fickle lot! Before you know it he will be running after some one else, or some young lady will fall in love with him, and then his wife may pine away. Then come reproaches and jealousy. And what is this jealousy, eh? He, he, he! Do you know, young lady, what this jealousy is?
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
No, I don't know.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
But I know! It isn't like a needle prick in the finger; it's far more painful than that. You see the cursed thing consumes a man. From jealousy people stab one another, and poison one another with arsenic! But when any one falls in love with an old man, then all is peaceful for his wife. And here's something else I will tell you, my dear young lady: Young men like to go on sprees; they like gayety and distraction, and all sorts of dissipations, and their wives may sit at home and wait for them till midnight. And they come home drunk, and bully their wives, and swagger. But an old man will just sit near his wife; he'll die before he'll leave her. And he would like to look into her eyes all the time and to caress her and to kiss her hands. Just like that.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Did your deceased wife love you?
#KÓRSHUNOV.
And why do you ask this, young lady?
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
I just wanted to know.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
You wanted to know? No, she didn't love me, and I didn't love her either. She wasn't worth loving - I took her, poor, a beggar, just for her beauty; I took care of her whole family; I saved her father from prison; she went about in gold.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Love cannot be bought with gold.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Whether you love a man or not, you ought to show him some regard. They needed money, they had nothing to live on; I gave it to them, I didn't refuse. And I needed their love. Had I a right to exact this or not? You see I paid money for it! It's a sin to make complaints about me. Whoever I love has a good living in the world, and if I don't love any one, then he need not reproach me. Yes, I'm that man's enemy; he'd better keep out of my sight! My words and looks, more than my deeds, shall pursue him! I won't give the man room to breathe! I - And you really thought that I was such a cross man? He, he! I said it in fun, for a joke! I'm a simple, kind old man! I'll dandle you in my arms ; I'll rock you in a little cradle; I'll sing you to sleep.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Ah, so that's where my son - in - law is! We've been looking for you. We've already started in on the champagne. Come along to the guests; at our house a feast isn't a feast without you.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
I like it here.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Then we'll order it to be served here, and we'll drink it with you. Hey, boy, serve the wine here! On a silver tray! Now, son - in - law, what do you say?
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Nothing.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
How, nothing?
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Just nothing.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
But don't you really? Can you understand me now?
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Why shouldn't I understand you?
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Now we've had this little spree! So now you tell me, what sort of a man I am. Can they appreciate me here?
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Why should they appreciate you?
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
No, tell me this: Isn't everything well done here? In other houses a young fellow waits at table in a Russian smock, or there's a peasant girl; but in my house there's a butler in cotton gloves. This butler is a trained man, from Moscow; he knows all the ways of society - where each man should be seated, and what's to be done. But how is it at other people's houses? They collect in one room, they sit down in a ring, and sing peasant songs. Of course it's jolly, but I consider it's vulgar; there's no style about it. And what do they drink in their boorishness? Home - made cordials, all sorts of cherry water! And they don't even know that champagne is the proper thing! Oh, if I could live in Moscow, or in Petersburg, I'd make a point of following every fashion.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
You don't mean every fashion?
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Every one. As long as my money held out, I wouldn't stint myself. You just look out, Lyubóv; you toe the mark! Or else your bridegroom - you see he's from Moscow - may be ashamed of you. I suppose you don't even know how to walk gracefully, and you don't understand how to talk as is proper in company.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
I say what I feel, father; I wasn't brought up in a boarding - school.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
That's it, son - in - law! Just let them know what sort of man Gordéy Kárpych Tortsóv is!
#EGÓRUSHKA.
Uncle Gordéy Kárpych, come here, if you please.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
What's the matter with you?
#EGÓRUSHKA.
Come, please: there's such a scene!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
What's the matter?
#EGÓRUSHKA.
Uncle Lyubím Kárpych has come in.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Why did they let him in?
#EGÓRUSHKA.
It must be that he just took it into his head; we can't stop him, anyhow.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
What's he doing?
#EGÓRUSHKA.
He's turning out the guests. "You're glad to eat another man's bread," says he. "I'm also the host," says he. "I," says he -
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Sh - he's ruined me!
#KÓRSHUNOV.
What's all this about?
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
I don't know. It must be that uncle is - Sometimes he takes a notion.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Where is your brother? Where is Lyubím Kárpych? What has he done? Oh, misery!
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
He isn't here, mother.
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
There you are! Lyubím Kárpych is playing some famous tricks! Ha, ha, ha! He's cutting up such capers, it beats all!
#LÍZA.
It isn't at all funny, it's just rude!
#MÁSHA.
I simply didn't know what to do from embarrassment.
#LÍZA.
Oh, good heavens, again!
#MÁSHA.
This is terrible!
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Ha, ha, ha!
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Gurr, gurr, gurr; bul, bul, bul! With the finger nine! With the cucumber fifteen! How do, friend! My respects! I haven't seen you for a thousand years and a day! How are you?
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Oh, is this you, Lyubím?
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
I'm not I, and the horse is not mine, and I'm not a coachman.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
I remember you, brother! You used to roam the town and pick up kopeks.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
You remember how I used to pick up kopeks, but do you remember how you and I used to go on sprees together? How we sat through the dark autumn nights, and how we skipped back and forth, from the tavern to the wine - shop? And don't you know who ruined me, and who turned me out with a beggar's wallet?
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Why didn't you look out for yourself? Nobody dragged you in by the collar, my dear fellow. It's your own fault.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
I was a fool! But, well, you haven't much to be proud of! You raised me to such heights, you promoted me to such a place - I've stolen nothing, and yet I'm ashamed to look men in the eyes!
#KÓRSHUNOV.
You're the same old joker as ever!
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Sh! It's not a question of rubles here! Pay up your old debts, and for my niece here a million three hundred thousand! I won't sell her cheaper.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Won't you come down?
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Not a kopek!
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Aha, Lyubím Kárpych! Don't you take any less!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
So you are here! What are you doing in my house? Clear out!
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Wait a bit, Gordéy Kárpych; don't turn him out! Why turn him out? Let him show off and make jokes. He, he, he!
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
It's my brother that's joking, in giving his daughter to you, but I'll play such a joke on you as won't suit your stomach!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
This isn't the place for him. Get out!
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Wait, brother, don't turn me out! Do you think Lyubím Tortsóv has come to make jokes? Do you think Lyubím Tortsóv is drunk? I have come to you to ask riddles. Why has an ass long ears? Now, then, give us an answer?
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
That's a hard one!
#KÓRSHUNOV.
How do I know?
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
So that all may know that he is an ass. Here's a riddle for you! To whom are you marrying your daughter?
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
That's not your affair! You've no business to ask me.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
And here's another question for you. Are you an honest merchant, or not? If you are honest, don't associate with a dishonest one. You can't touch soot and not be defiled.
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Joke away - but don't forget yourself, my dear fellow! Turn him out, or make him keep quiet.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
That meant you! One can see you are as clean as a chimney - sweep!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Brother, go away quietly, or it will be the worse for you.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Uncle, stop!
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
I won't be quiet! Now blood has begun to talk! All the domestics and guests enter.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Listen, good people! They are insulting Lyubím Tortsóv, they are driving him away. But am I not a guest too? Why should they drive me away? My clothes are not clean, but I have a clean conscience! I'm not Kórshunov; I didn't rob the poor, I didn't ruin another's life, I didn't torment my wife with jealousy. Me they drive away, but he's their most esteemed guest, and he's put in the place of honor. Well, never mind! They'll give him another wife. My brother is marrying his daughter to him! Ha, ha, ha!
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Don't believe him; he lies! He says this out of spite to me. He's drunk!
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
How out of spite? I pardoned you long ago. I'm a man of small account, a crawling worm, the lowest of the low! But don't you do evil to others.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Take him away!
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Sh, don't touch me! It's an easy life in this world for a man whose eyes are shameless! Oh, men, men! Lyubím Tortsóv is a drunkard, but he's better than you! Here, now, I'll go away of my own accord. Make way - Lyubím Tortsóv is going! Unnatural monster!
#KÓRSHUNOV.
So that's the way you keep order in your house! That's how you follow the fashions! At your house drunkards insult the guests! He, he, he! "I," says he, "shall go to Moscow; here they don't understand me!" Such fools are almost extinct in Moscow! They laugh at 'em there! "Son - in - law, son - in - law!" He, he, he! "Dear father - in - law!" No, humbug, I won't let myself be insulted for nothing. No, you come along and bow down to me! Beg me to take your daughter!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
You think I'll bow down to you?
#KÓRSHUNOV.
Yes, you will; I know you! You want a fine wedding. You'd hang yourself if only to astonish the town! But nobody wants her! How unlucky for you! He, he he!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
After you've said such words as these I won't have anything more to do with you! I never bowed down to any one in my life! If it comes to this, I'll marry her to any man I choose. With the money that I shall give as her dowry any man will - MÍTYA comes in, and stops in the doorway.
#MÍTYA.
What's all this noise?
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Here, I'll marry her to Mítya!
#MÍTYA.
What, sir?
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Silence! Yes - I'll marry her to Mítya - to - morrow! And I'll give her such a wedding as you never saw! I'll get musicians from Moscow! I'll ride alone in four coaches!
#KÓRSHUNOV.
We'll see, we'll see! You'll come to ask my pardon, you will!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
To whom, Gordéy Kárpych, did you say?
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
To Mítya - Yes! What airs he put on! As if I were worse than he! "You'll come and bow down!" He lies! I won't go and bow down! Just to spite him I'll marry her to Dmitry. Why out of spite, Gordéy Kárpych? One does not do such things out of spite. I don't want you to do it out of spite. I'd rather suffer torment all my life. If you are kind enough, then give us your blessing as is proper, in a fatherly fashion, with love. Because we love each other, and even before this happened, we wanted to confess our guilt to you. And now I'll be a true son to you forever, with all my heart.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
What, what, "with all your heart"? You're glad of the chance! But how did you ever dare to think of it? Is she your equal? Remember to whom you're talking.
#MÍTYA.
I know very well that you are my master, and that I, because of my poverty, cannot be her equal; but however, think as you please. Here I am; I've fallen in love with your daughter with all my heart and soul.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
Well, how could you help loving her? Your taste isn't bad! And you'll get plenty of money with her, which is fine for a penniless fellow like you - without a rag to your back!
#MÍTYA.
It is so insulting for me to hear this from you, that I have no words. Better keep silent. If you please, Lyubóv Gordéyevna, you speak.
#LYUBÓV GORDÉYEVNA.
Father, I have never gone against your will! If you wish for my happiness, then give me to Mítya.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Why, why, really, Gordéy Kárpych, why do you keep changing your mind so? Why do you? I was beginning to feel happy; my heart was just beginning to feel easy, and now you begin again. Do stick to something; otherwise what does all this mean? Really! First you say to one man, and then to the other! Was she born your daughter just to be a martyr?
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Brother, give Lyubóv to Mítya!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
You here again! Do you understand what you've done to me to - day? You've put me to shame before the whole town! If you felt this you wouldn't dare to show yourself in my sight - and then you slink in and give me advice! If it were only a man talking and not you.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
You'd better bow down to Lyubím Tortsóv's feet, just because he has put you to shame.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
That's it, dear Lyubím! We ought to bow down to your feet; that's just it! You have taken a great sin from our souls; all our prayers could never have freed us from this sin.
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
What, am I a monster to my own family?
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
You're no monster, but you would have ruined your daughter through your own folly; I tell you this straight out! They marry girls to old men who are a lot better than Afrikán Savvich, and even so they live miserable lives.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Permit me! Tum - ty - tum, tum - ty - tum! Look at me, here's an example for you! Lyubím Kárpych stands before you large as life! He went along that road, he knows what it is! And I was rich and respected, I drove about in coaches, I played such pranks as would never come into your head; and then head over heels down. Just see what a dandy I am!
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
No matter what you say to me, I don't want to listen; you are my enemy for the rest of my life.
#LYUBÍM KÁRPYCH.
Are you a man, or a wild beast? Have pity on Lyubím Tortsóv! Brother, give Lyubóv to Mítya - he will give me a corner. I was chilled and hungry. I was growing old, and it was hard for me to play the fool in the cold for a piece of bread; at least in one's old age one wants to live decently. You see I've been cheating people, I've been begging alms, and have spent it in drink. They'll give me work, and then I'll have my kettle of soup. Then I'll thank God, brother; even my tears will reach to heaven. What if he is poor, eh? If I had been poor, I should have been a man. Poverty is no crime.
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Gordéy Kárpych, haven't you any feelings?
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
And you really thought that I hadn't? Well, brother, thank you for bringing me back to reason; I almost went out of my mind completely. I don't know how such a rotten notion got into my head.
#GÚSLIN.
Uncle, may I speak now?
#GORDÉY KÁRPYCH.
You may, you may! Ask for whatever you want, every one of you! Now I have become another man.
#GÚSLIN.
Well, Annushka, it's our turn now!
#ANNA IVÁNOVNA.
Well, now, we'll have a dance; only hold your hat on!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Yes, let's dance, let's dance!
#RAZLYULYÁYEV.
Mítya! For a friend I give up everything! I loved her myself, but for you - I give her up. Give me your hand. That's all - take her; I give her up to you! For a friend I don't regret anything! That's the way we do it when it comes to the point! He told the truth then; drunkenness is no crime - well, I mean - poverty is no crime. I always make slips!
#PELAGÉYA EGÓROVNA.
Oh, yes, here they all are! Now, then, girls, a jolly song! Yes, a jolly one! Now we'll celebrate the wedding with all our hearts! With all our hearts!
