#NED.
We shall have to give it up, Polly. No May - party to - day.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Oh! don’t you think the clouds will blow over?
#NED.
The whole sky will have to blow over. It’s all lead - color.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Oh, dear, dear, dear!
#GEORGE.
Here we come!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Yes, here we come, pell - mell! It’s going to pour!
#CAROLINE.
Oh, how we have hurried! I felt a great drop fall on my nose.
#ANNA.
And think of our dresses!—span - clean white dresses!
#KATE.
No procession to - day!—no dancing around the May - pole!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
They got all that evergreen to trim the May - pole; and George brought his flag.
#NED.
If it had only been pleasant to - day, I’d have let it rain a week afterward.
#GEORGE.
There!—it pours! It’s lucky we hurried.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Now all of you stay here and keep May - day with us Do, do!
#CAROLINE.
Will your mother like it?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
I’ll go ask her.
#NED.
Anyway, you can’t go till it holds up.
#ARTHUR.
That may not be for a week.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
She says we may do any thing but make ’lasses - candy.
#NED.
The last time we made it, father said he found some in his slipper - toes.
#ARTHUR.
Now what shall we do with ourselves?
#NED.
Let’s get up an entertainment. Tickets ten cents; grown folks, double price.
#KATE.
So I say; and call ourselves a “troupe,” or a “family,” or something.
#GEORGE.
Something that has a foreign sound.
#ARTHUR.
How would “Yotopski” do? CAROLINE, LUCY, and ANNA. Splendid!
#ANNA.
Let’s call ourselves “The Yotopski Family.”
#LUCY PILLENGER.
But what shall we have for our entertainment?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
I think tableaux are perfectly splendid.
#ANNA.
Oh, I’ll tell you! Have the kind that winds up.
#GEORGE.
Why, all entertainments wind up when they are done.
#ANNA.
I mean, have each one wound up with a key, and then they move.
#ARTHUR.
She means Mrs. Jarley’s Wax - works.
#NED.
All right. We’ll have the winding kind.
#CAROLINE.
What wax - works shall we have?
#NED.
We might have William Tell shooting the apple, for one.
#TOMMY.
I’ve seen that! ’Twill take three to do that,—Mr. Tell, and his son, and the cross tyrant.
#GEORGE.
And the apple makes four.
#ANNA.
Who’ll be Mr. Tell?—you, Ned?
#NED.
No; I’d rather be the cross tyrant: I feel just right for that. Arthur’ll be Mr. Tell.
#ARTHUR.
Oh, yes! I’ll be Mr. Tell; and Tommy can be the boy. Where are you going, Tommy?
#TOMMY.
After my bow’n’arrow.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Here’s the apple.
#CAROLINE.
What shall we do for a feather? Mr. Tell’s hat must have a feather.
#KATE.
Twist up a piece of newspaper. There you have it! And Polly’s sack, turned wrong side out, will do for a tunic.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
He ought to have a wide sash.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Here, take mine!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Not that kind of a sash!
#ANNA.
Oh, that won’t do!
#CAROLINE.
It should be a scarf.
#NED.
Oh! never mind, we’re only rehearsing.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
How must the cross tyrant be dressed? Who knows?
#ANNA.
The tyrant I saw had a cape hung on one shoulder. A shawl will do for that. Now, what must he wear on his head?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I should think a tyrant ought to wear a tall hat.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
I’ll get father’s.
#ANNA.
And something bright to put on it. I remember that part plainly.
#GEORGE.
And something long, for a sword.
#CAROLINE.
If the boys do that, can’t we girls make ourselves into wax - works?
#ANNA.
Let’s be a May - day wax - work, singing and dancing round a May - pole.
#GEORGE.
I’ll be the pole.
#CAROLINE.
But you’re not long enough.
#GEORGE.
Now I am!
#GIRLS.
Oh, yes; oh, yes! He’ll do! Trim him up; trim him up!
#NED.
Yes. Come down and be trimmed up.
#KATE.
Shall we hoist the flag?
#NED.
Oh, yes! bring the flag. And here’s a string to fasten it on with. Three cheers for the flag! Now,—One, two, three!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Won’t this hat do? Mother can’t have father’s good one banged about.
#GEORGE.
Oh! that’s good enough. We’re only rehearsing. Did you get something bright?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Mother said this was quite bright.
#ANNA.
Why, I meant something shiny, like a clasp, or a buckle.
#KATE.
No matter: we’re only rehearsing.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Here’s your sword. That’s the longest thing I could find.
#TOMMY.
Where shall I stand up?
#ARTHUR.
Come this way Ned, you must scowl and look fierce. Tommy, fold your arms, and stand still as a post.
#TOMMY.
Oh, I’m afraid! Look out for my eyes! The arrow might go off!
#ARTHUR.
I’ll put the apple in the chair.
#KATE.
Now, we girls must stand around the May - pole Who’ll wind?
#GIRLS.
You, you, you!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
What a little circle! I wish we had more girls.
#KATE.
So do I. How shall I wind up the wax - works?
#ANNA.
The ones I saw all stood on a string, and the string led to a box; and, when the box was wound up, the wax - works began to act their parts. A door - key will do to wind with.
#KATE.
We’ll manage in the same way.
#ARTHUR.
Don’t you think you girls ought to be holding your posies, and your flags, and your flower - baskets, and wearing your wreaths? They’ll make your wax - work look handsomer.
#CAROLINE.
So they will.
#ANNA.
You must take a key, and pretend to wind up the machinery. What song shall we sing?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
“The merry month of May” is perfectly splendid.
#CAROLINE.
I wonder if we know the words. Let’s try.
#KATE.
That’s a good song. Now then! All ready! Stand in your places Arms folded, Tommy! When I’ve done winding up, Arthur will begin to take aim, Ned will begin to scowl and to hold up his sword, and you girls will begin to sing and dance around. Can’t you hold your hands high, so the flowers and flags will show? That’s prettier. Now all stand just as still as real wax - works till the machinery is wound up; then begin. We’ll play, that, when I throw up my handkerchief, the curtain falls. Now!
