#LADY CARLYON.
How beautiful, Margery! Did little Flora help you gather them?
#MARGERY.
Yes, my lady. Miss Flora—why, Miss Flora, she do frisk about so, pulls Elsie here, and then there,—“Now this flower, Elsie!” and “Now this nice one, Elsie!” That be a most wonderful child, my lady: she be playful like a kitten, and gentle, too, like a pet lamb.
#LADY CARLYON.
Ah! already I regret having given her permission to go with Elsie to the green. But she longed so to see the May - dances!
#MARGERY.
Oh, never fear, my lady! There isn’t anywhere a faithfuller little maid than Elsie: she will not let Miss Flora out of her sight. But nobody could wish Miss Flora out of sight, she is such a little angel. Indeed and in truth, my lady, in all the world can’t be found a child sweet - tempered like her.
#LADY CARLYON.
Oh, do not call her an angel, good Margery! call her a lamb or a kitten, if you will, or even a squirrel, but never an angel.
#FLORA.
O mamma! see her wreaths and garlands, and the white dress she has on for the May - day dances! Doesn’t she look lovely, mamma?—oh, just as lovely as—oh, I don’t know!
#LADY CARLYON.
Indeed she does, my dear. Elsie, do all the lassies wear white?
#ELSIE.
Yes, my lady, white, with right gay garlands.
#FLORA.
Good - by, mamma: it is time to go now.
#LADY CARLYON.
O Elsie! will you take good care? She never went far from me before. I shall be very anxious!
#ELSIE.
Yes, indeed, my lady, I will take great care.
#FLORA.
And I will stay with Elsie, and be so good!—oh, just as good as—oh, you can’t think!
#FLORA.
Oh, hark, mamma! do hark to the May - songs! Come, Elsie, quick! Good - by, mamma!
#LADY CARLYON.
Good - by, darling! good - by!
#MARGERY.
I must see to their lunch - baskets.
#FATHER.
Wal, old Beauty Spot, how many d’ye count?
#MOTHER.
Eight spoons, six forks, five thimbles, one cup.
#FATHER.
Is that all we’ve took on this beat?
#MOTHER.
Not by somethin’! Look ye here, dad!
#FATHER.
Now you be the beater! Let’s take a look. Real, is’t? But where’s Peg?
#MOTHER.
Off on her tramps about the grand house yonder. Owner’s away: nobody left but my lady and servants. Never a better time, daddy.
#FATHER.
Nor a better day. Tompkins will set up his show tent. Everybody stirring. Pockets to pick, fortunes to tell!
#MOTHER.
Lads and lassies dancing on the green, old uns looking on, nobody taking care of the spoons’n the house.
#FATHER.
We’re in luck, old woman,—in luck! Here comes Peg, now. Wal, my Nimble Fingers, any game to - day?
#PEG.
Not much now, dad, but some a - coming, if you an’ her be up to it.
#FATHER.
What’s that?
#PEG.
Oh! a nice little job. and WOMAN. Speak out, gal.
#PEG.
Wal, you see I walked in through the park, and along by the hedge - row, and into the kitchen - garden, thinkin’ to go boldly in at the back - door, as you told me, to ask for cold bits.
#BOTH.
Yes.
#PEG.
But jest when I got my mouth open to say, “Charity for my poor sick mother”—
#BOTH.
Wal?
#PEG.
Why, a servant ordered me off.
#FATHER.
An’ what then?
#PEG.
Why, then I turned to come away. But next I sees—
#MOTHER.
Sees what?
#PEG.
Somethin’ in our line.
#BOTH.
Tell away, can’t yer?
#PEG.
Sees my lady’s child a - walkin’ out with her maid.
#MOTHER.
Wal, what o’ that?
#PEG.
You keep quiet, an’ I’ll tell; jest you keep on a - interruptin’, an’ I’m mum’s a fish.
#FATHER.
Hush up, now, can’t yer? Sees what?
#PEG.
I seed as how little miss was a - dressed out in all her finery,—her velvet, an’ her silks, an’ gold beads an’ bracelets. Very good things to have.
#FATHER.
Mebby they be ; but how be they a - goin’ to jump in this ’ere?
#PEG.
There ye go agin a - interruptin’.
#MOTHER.
Hush up, dad! Let the gal speak, can’t yer?
#PEG.
Then I watches to find out where wud they be a - goin’ ter , an’ I sees ’em take the path down by the hedge - row. So I creeps along softly, a - tiptoe, on t’other side, just like this , a - peepin’ through.
#MOTHER.
Sharp gal you be, Peg.
#FATHER.
Keep still; don’t bother her.
#PEG.
When they goes down on the grass to rest, I goes down too, on t’other side, ye know, to rest,—so.
#FATHER.
Yes, yes: so ye did. Poor little gal, wasn’t used to trampin’!
#MOTHER.
Gabble, gabble, gabble! The gal’ll never git done.
#FATHER.
Tell away, Peg.
#PEG.
I listens, an’ I finds little miss is a - goin’ with her maid to see the dances. There, I’ve started the game: let’s see ye foller it up.
#FATHER.
’Tis deep water; but I sees through.
#PEG.
Let’s hear.
#FATHER.
Tomkins’s show draws all the crowd, missy among ’em.
#PEG.
Go on, dad.
#FATHER.
They two, missy and maid, stands agapin’ at it,—so. You creeps in between,—so. I stays outside.
#PEG.
Yes, yes!
#FATHER.
In the middle of it I gets myself knocked down outside, and groans and roars, “Help, help! thieves! murder!”
#MOTHER.
Then everybody’ll run.
#FATHER.
Then everybody’ll run. Peg catches hold o’ little miss, runs her off. I say, “I’ll take care of yer.” Neat job, hey?
#PEG.
Then I’ll lend her some of my clothes, ’cause they’s better for her, you know, an’ help her eat what’s in the buful basket; an’ she’ll be my little sister, an’ she’ll tramp with us an’ our merry, merry crew.
#FLORA.
What pretty flowers there were in that meadow! Why, I wanted every one!
#ELSIE.
Then we’d have to fetch a wagon to carry them home in, I guess. wagonful of flowers! What would mamma say to that, I wonder?
#ELSIE.
All the vases together wouldn’t half hold ’em.
#FLORA.
Then I’d put them in my little crib, and have them for my bed.
#ELSIE.
Margery wouldn’t spread her white sheets on such a bed as that.
#FLORA.
But I could take flowers for bed - clothes, and smell them all night. Oh! what a—. I hear music. Hark! O Elsie! they’re coming, they’re coming! Hark! don’t you hear the singing?
#ELSIE.
Yes : they’re marching this way.
#MARY.
Oh, come! do come and see the show! ’Tis the funniest show!
#ALL TOGETHER.
Where? where?
#MARY.
Over yonder by the wood. Only a penny. Come!
#ALL TOGETHER.
Yes: let’s go! Come! Only a penny? We’ll all go!
#TOMKINS.
Stan’ reg’lar, ladies and gentlemen, stan’ reg’lar, and let the tall ones look over the short ones; for if the tall ones don’t git behind the short ones, and the short ones gits behind the tall ones, then how’s the short ones a - goin’ to look over the tall ones? Ladies and gentlemen, I have the honor to show you the only ’xhibition of the kind on record. On this ’casion ’tis not a talkin’ ’xhibition. Six talkin’ ’xhibitions they’ve done to - day. Do I want ’em to die on my ’ands? Do I want to close their ’xpiring eyes, an’ say—an’ say—farewell, my dears? No. Let ’em live to d’light the world, an’ to ’dorn—to ’dorn—my ’xhibition. Sh—sh—! your time’ll come when the Thumbs is all done. Ladies and gentlemen, you see before you the descendants of the real Tom Thumb, who lived in story - books a thousand years ago. Their grandfather far removed was carried in his master’s waistcoat - pocket, and swallowed by a cow. Sh—sh! They would speak to the audyence: but six talkin’ ’xhibitions they’ve done to - day; an’ their healths must be looked to, as their constitootions compares with their sizes, and ’tis very nat’ral they’d be short - breath’d. The old lady, as you see, is knittin’ a stockin’ for her grandchild that lives in Siam. The old gentleman takes his pinch of snuff, an’ would smoke his pipe, but—ladies present. The maiden aunt is neat about her dress; and that’s why she’s smoothin’ out the wrinkles, and rubbin’ off mud - spots. Tom Thumb is very fond of his bride; an’ you won’t think strange of his strokin’ her curls, an’ lookin’ at her face in admiration. But my an’mals is uneasy, and I must also proceed to uncover the statuarys. Thumb family may march round and take their leave. I will now proceed to uncover the famous, unheard - of, wonderful animal called— Don’t be uneasy!
#LADY CARLYON.
You may bring that round table nearer to me, Margery: Miss Flora and I will take our tea together. What a treat it will be for her!
#MARGERY.
Yes, my lady.
#LADY CARLYON.
She will be eager to tell all that has happened, and I shall be just as eager to hear. Bring her small china mug, Margery ; and bring her low rocking - chair.
#MARGERY.
Yes, my lady. The little dear will be so tired!
#LADY CARLYON.
Place the chair near me. Is the supper all ready? What an appetite the little traveller will have to - night!
#MARGERY.
Every thing is ready, my lady.
#LADY CARLYON.
And fetch her slippers lined with down. They will be soft to her tired feet. Ah, how many steps those feet have taken since she kissed me good - by! So. That is right. Now that all is ready, how long seems every moment! Margery, go stand by the upper window, and bring me word when you catch the first sight of them coming along by the hedge - row.
#MARGERY.
I will, my lady. I’ll watch, and not leave the window,—not for one single moment.
#MOTHER.
Wal, ole man, here we bees agin. ’Tis a year ago this blessed day since Peg ’ticed the little gal from Tomkins’s show.
#FATHER.
’Twouldn’t ha’ been a year, mammy, only we got no news o’ the reward. Fifty guineas, an’ no questions asked. Wal - a - day! Many’s the weary tramp we’s had that we needn’t a’.
#MOTHER.
An’ many’s the trinket I’ll buy.
#FATHER.
Now, ole Beauty Spot, you don’t git the spendin’ o’ that gold!
#MOTHER.
I don’t! Wal, we’ll see! I don’t, do I?—humph!
#FATHER.
But where’s Peg? Meet us by this wood, she said. An’ ’tis past the time set. She must a’ reached the hall two days agone.
#MOTHER.
If I’d a’ had my say, the child should ha’ been sent by some other body; but Peg she would go along.
#FATHER.
’Tis a marcy an’ she don’t git fast under lock an’ key.
#MOTHER.
Wal, the child’s back to where she belongs; an’ lucky she be; for our Peg, that be a great deal too smart for us, will go to mind every crook o’ that young un’s finger, an’ worse’n that. Now I’ll tell ye. I harked one night, late it was, with the stars all so bright, we inside the tent, they two out, nobody stirring, no noise, only corn rustlin’ a - near us, an’ a little matter of a breeze in the trees; an’ what does I hear? Why, that young ’un a - tellin’ our Peg about the angels, an’ more besides, an’ what good was, an’ what wicked was. Does I want a gal o’ mine to hear the like? No, I doesn’t. Peg ain’t the gal she was No, no! She ain’t up to half the smart tricks.
#FATHER.
The money! The gold, the gold! Where’s the gold?
#MOTHER.
The money! The gold, the gold! Where’s the gold?
#PEG.
The lady wants to see you at the hall.
#BOTH.
Ha!
#MOTHER.
Be we fools?
#FATHER.
She wants, does she?—ha, ha! She wants!—he, he, he!
#PEG.
I want, then. And the gold is ready for you there.
#MOTHER.
What be we a - goin’ to the hall for?
#PEG.
She has a favor to ask.
#MOTHER.
Yes: the favor o’ shuttin’ us up.
#PEG.
The favor o’ lettin’ me be servant to Miss Flora.
#FATHER.
Have more sense, gal.
#MOTHER.
O Peg! an’ would ye go from us, an’ to be a slave?
#FATHER.
’Tis all a trap to nab us.
#PEG.
No, there be no trap.
#MOTHER.
An’ what use of our seein’ the lady?
#PEG.
She be loath to keep anybody’s child without consent. The little un begs me stay; an’ I must.
#MOTHER.
Don’t, Peg! Let her go. She ben’t one o’ our sort.
#PEG.
I can’t; an’ the truth must be spoken to ye. I’m tired o’ trampin’, tired o’ beggin’ an’ thievin’, an’ skulkin’ about; an’, what’s more, I can’t lose sight o’ her.
#MOTHER.
O Peg! An’ how could the little un bewitch ye so?
#PEG.
I can’t tell that. How can I tell what makes me pine for a sight o’ her sweet face, an’ why ’tis that the sound o’ her sweet voice touches me here , an’ why ’tis I weep when she tells me of the angels and holy things? Will ye go, or no? to WOMAN. Between you an’ me, I’d sooner have Peg there. Don’t ye see? Many’s the nice bit she’ll help us to, or a silver penny, or a spoon.
#MOTHER.
That she won’t. An’, if she’d do’t, ain’t we got money enough wi’ all that gold? I’d sooner keep my gal. But ’twon’t be for long. Peg’ll come back to us. She’ll soon pine for the sweet woods agin’.
#FATHER.
Enough!—enough gold! What can the old gal mean? Enough money?—ha, ha, ha! Enough!—he, he, he!
#MARGERY.
Stand back, stand back! Don’t ye see my lady almost faints at sight of ye?
#LADY CARLYON.
What music do I hear, Margery?
#MARGERY.
’Tis the May - party, my lady. They come to welcome Miss Flora back with a cheerful song.
#LADY CARLYON.
Bid them enter, Margery.
