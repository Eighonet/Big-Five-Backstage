#LETITIA.
Here they are, my dear. Help me with the hasps.
#SUSAN.
What does E. R. really stand for, Mis' Letitia?
#LETITIA.
E R ... That's a secret, Susan, that little girls aren't supposed to know.
#SUSAN.
I won't tell.
#LETITIA.
But what good would that do, my sweet? Please open the windows.
#SUSAN.
No one would know you told me.
#LETITIA.
I would know. Yes, I would know that I had told somebody else's secret.
#SUSAN.
Whose secret is it? Please.
#LETITIA.
I've been living in this house for thirty - five years, Susan, and I've known the secrets of all the boys and girls from time to time.
#SUSAN.
You know mine, too.
#LETITIA.
And I've never told one of them, either.
#SUSAN.
Does old Mr. John ever have secrets?
#LETITIA.
Old Mr. John! For shame!... Of course he has secrets.
#SUSAN.
I wish I knew some of his, Mis' Letitia.
#LETITIA.
My dear, you never will know them. John is very quiet.
#SUSAN.
Who in the family didn't have any secrets at all?
#LETITIA.
Oh, they all had secrets when they were young. Nathaniel had fewer than any of them and...
#SUSAN.
Why hasn't he ever come back home?
#LETITIA.
That is his secret, Susan, and we mustn't ask too many questions. Nathaniel is coming today. I won't ask any questions... He was a fine young man. Yes, he's coming back today, my dear. He was the baby of the family.
#SUSAN.
How old is he now?
#LETITIA.
You little chatterbox! Between you and Jonathan I have to fight to keep anybody's secrets.
#SUSAN.
Does Jonathan ask many questions?
#LETITIA.
When we're alone he does. He's just like his Uncle Nathaniel. God bless him!
#SUSAN.
Oh, isn't that just wonderful!
#SUSAN.
Oh! Oh! Oh!... I wish I knew whose it was.
#LETITIA.
Would that make it any prettier?
#SUSAN.
No, but I'd like to know just the same... Was it E. R.'s? , "Aunt Letty! Aunt Letty!"
#LETITIA.
Oh, Susan, it's Nathaniel! It's my boy. Here I am, dear.
#SUSAN.
Mis' Letitia, I believe you love him best of all!
#LETITIA.
No, I don't, but I always understood him, I think. , "Where are you?" Come up here, my boy. Come up to the lumber room.
#NATHANIEL.
Aunt Letty! Not a day older... But oh, so wise.
#LETITIA.
Nathaniel, my boy, my darling, darling boy.
#NATHANIEL.
Now, now. Don't cry.
#LETITIA.
My boy, my boy. My splendid boy.
#NATHANIEL.
And this is -
#LETITIA.
This is Susan Sample.
#NATHANIEL.
Not -
#LETITIA.
Yes, time has been flying, Nathaniel. This young lady is Mary Sample's daughter.
#NATHANIEL.
How do you do? I can't believe it. You were only a little pink cherub up there in the sky when I ran -
#LETITIA.
Yes, Susan was born three years after you went away.
#NATHANIEL.
Oh!... And, Aunt Letitia, you've opened Emily's trunk!
#LETITIA.
Yes, Susan is going to be in a pageant.
#SUSAN.
Who was Emily?
#NATHANIEL.
She was -
#LETITIA.
Nathaniel dear, you must not satisfy her curiosity. You go find Jonathan, dear, and tell him that his uncle is here. I'll put these things away, and we'll go into the house.
#SUSAN.
Good - bye, Mr. Clay.
#NATHANIEL.
Good - bye, Susan. You'll come back, won't you?
#SUSAN.
Oh, yes. Good - bye.
#NATHANIEL.
Good - bye.
#LETITIA.
She hates to go. She's never seen anyone just like you: and I have only seen one.
#NATHANIEL.
Who's Jonathan?
#LETITIA.
He's the one... He's Emily's boy.
#NATHANIEL.
You mean Emily -
#LETITIA.
No, no, my dear. Emily was married, left the stage. She wasn't happy. The boy was her only comfort.
#NATHANIEL.
He's my nephew. Why, I'm Uncle Nathaniel. Oh, Aunt Letty, I'm getting to be an old man!
#LETITIA.
Nathaniel, Jonathan doesn't know about his mother. I sent Susan away because I didn't want her to associate these things with Jonathan's mother.
#NATHANIEL.
My God, Emily didn't do anything wrong.
#LETITIA.
Well, she was an actress.
#NATHANIEL.
And a good one, too.
#LETITIA.
Yes, yes, dear. All that has been talked over many times, but John is the head of the family and he doesn't approve of the stage.
#NATHANIEL.
So! John is still himself.
#LETITIA.
John is austere, Nathaniel. He is a Clay through and through and he holds to the traditions of the family.
#NATHANIEL.
I remember the traditions, Aunt Letitia.
#LETITIA.
I never oppose John. He feels that he is right. But it is very hard sometimes to live up to his rules.
#NATHANIEL.
Has he rules?
#LETITIA.
Well, he has ideas, dear - much like your father's. We might call them rules.
#NATHANIEL.
Where is Emily?
#LETITIA.
Two years ago, Nathaniel.
#NATHANIEL.
Did she ever go back to the stage?
#LETITIA.
No. John forbade it.
#NATHANIEL.
And John is still forbidding.
#LETITIA.
John is the head of the family.
#NATHANIEL.
So... The Clay family is still an absolute monarchy.
#LETITIA.
Nathaniel, dear, will you promise me -
#NATHANIEL.
I'll try.
#LETITIA.
Will you promise not to antagonize John?
#NATHANIEL.
Will John antagonize me? I came back to see my home - to see you, my dear aunt. But I am a grown man now.
#LETITIA.
Won't you try to be patient? It will be pleasanter for me. And I have waited so long to see you, Nathaniel. There are seventeen very, very long years for us to talk about. Let John have his way.
#NATHANIEL.
Well, I'll try for a few days. But I give you warning, my ideas have been settling during the past few years, too.
#LETITIA.
Remember, he is used to being obeyed just as your father was.
#NATHANIEL.
Yes, I remember that, dear Aunt; but John isn't my father. He is just a brother to whom fate gave a fifteen years' start by birth. Nathaniel looks at Letitia.]
#NATHANIEL.
His voice is just the same. Yes, John, I am up here.
#JOHN GALE.
How do you do, Nathaniel?
#NATHANIEL.
I am very well, I thank you, John. How are you?
#JOHN GALE.
You arrived ahead of time.
#NATHANIEL.
Yes.
#JOHN GALE.
We haven't met for seventeen years.
#NATHANIEL.
No. I've been away, John.
#JOHN GALE.
Where have you been?
#NATHANIEL.
I shall be here for two weeks, John, and if I should tell you all about myself today, I should have nothing to talk about tomorrow.
#JOHN GALE.
You haven't changed, Nathaniel. You are still frivolous.
#NATHANIEL.
I shall be serious when I am your age, brother.
#JOHN GALE.
I came out here to ask you to be very careful of your conversation before the children.
#NATHANIEL.
The children?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, my two grandchildren. -
#NATHANIEL.
Grandchildren! My, that makes me a great uncle. I am getting old, Aunt Letitia!
#JOHN GALE.
I do not care to have them or Jonathan hear about any revolutionary or other unusual ideas.
#NATHANIEL.
I shall try not to contaminate the children and Jonathan. How old are the children?
#JOHN GALE.
Mary is four and John 3rd is two.
#NATHANIEL.
I shall try to spare their sensibilities.
#JOHN GALE.
They may not understand you but they will hear.
#NATHANIEL.
How old is Jonathan?
#LETITIA.
Fourteen.
#NATHANIEL.
The impressionable age.
#JOHN GALE.
The silly age.
#NATHANIEL.
Brother John, no age is the silly age. Fourteen is the age of visions and enchantments and fears. What a boy of fourteen sees and hears takes on a value that we cannot underestimate. Most men are defeated in life between fourteen and twenty. At fourteen a boy begins to make a lens through which he sees life. He thinks about everything. Ambition is beginning to stir in him and he begins to know why he likes things, why he wants to do certain things. He formulates lasting plans for the future and he takes in impressions that are indelible. Things that seem nothing to old people become memories to him that affect his whole life. The memory of a smile may encourage him to surmount all obstacles and the memory of a bitterness may act as an eternal barrier.
#JOHN GALE.
Nathaniel, are you a father?
#NATHANIEL.
No, John, I am only a bachelor who is very much in love with life in general and one lady in particular.
#JOHN GALE.
You can know nothing of children, then.
#NATHANIEL.
I remember myself. Most men forget their younger selves and that is fatal.
#JOHN GALE.
One would think to hear you talk that the most important things in life were a boy of fourteen and his moorings.
#NATHANIEL.
One might know it.
#JOHN GALE.
You are still the same impractical theorist.
#NATHANIEL.
I am the same theorist - a little older, a little more travelled. The trouble with you, John, is that you think no age is important except your own. You always thought that, even when you were fourteen. Oh, I know I wasn't born then, but I know you.
#JOHN GALE.
Did you come back to your home in order to lecture me?
#NATHANIEL.
No, no, I beg your pardon. I came back to see my home and Aunt Letitia and the children - and you, and I - I think - Jonathan.
#JOHN GALE.
Nathaniel, when your letter came telling me that you had decided to come back to see us, I was going to ask you not to come -
#NATHANIEL.
I gave no address.
#JOHN GALE.
But on second thought, I made up my mind to forgive you -
#NATHANIEL.
Thank you.
#JOHN GALE.
To let bygones be bygones.
#NATHANIEL.
That is the better way, brother: let the dead past bury its dead.
#JOHN GALE.
Why did you run away from home?
#NATHANIEL.
Because we couldn't agree, John.
#JOHN GALE.
I was older than you; my judgment was mature; I was the head of the family, in my father's place.
#NATHANIEL.
We didn't speak the same language. I wanted something out of life that you couldn't understand; that my father couldn't understand. I determined to get it by myself.
#JOHN GALE.
Well?
#NATHANIEL.
And so, I ran away.
#JOHN GALE.
Leaving no trace, no word.
#NATHANIEL.
Oh, yes, I left a very important word - "Good - bye."
#JOHN GALE.
You were willing to leave all the work of our father's business on my shoulders.
#NATHANIEL.
You were willing to take it all. And I wanted my freedom.
#JOHN GALE.
You were selfish and heartless.
#NATHANIEL.
Selfish? Because I had my life to live and meant to live it?
#JOHN GALE.
You should have told us where you were living.
#NATHANIEL.
I preferred to work out my salvation alone, without interference. My going away gave you a free hand. John, don't tell me that you were not overjoyed that my flight gave you all my father's fortune.
#JOHN GALE.
It was my duty as head of the family to protect you.
#NATHANIEL.
I didn't ask for protection. I wanted understanding. boy of eighteen must not be allowed freedom.
#NATHANIEL.
Perhaps not, John, but he must be allowed to grow toward his goal. Eighteen is not too young for a man to fly through the air in defense of his country, or you. The burden of the world today is on the shoulders of men from eighteen to eighty, share and share alike... I wanted to be a writer -
#JOHN GALE.
And our brother Henry wanted to be a musical composer and our sister Emily wanted to be an actress! A fine putout for the leading commercial family of this state!
#NATHANIEL.
Well, John, our brother and our sister have paid the final penalty. They have died. Henry left a handful of worthless little tunes and Emily left a trunkful of costumes as monuments to their folly. And now Emily's boy is here under your wing.
#JOHN GALE.
He's a dreamer like all the rest of you.
#NATHANIEL.
Yes?
#JOHN GALE.
He spends all his leisure time playing with that fool toy there.
#NATHANIEL.
"Zenobia." " Alexander Jefferson, Sr."
#JOHN GALE.
He pretends that's his name - Alexander Jefferson, Sr!
#NATHANIEL.
People like to have other names. Look at all artists - like writers, pugilists, and actors, and base ball players. And the Sr. Is an effort to appear older.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, I'm breaking him of all that nonsense. I allow him only a certain number of hours for play. Emily used to spoil him and it's been a task to conquer him.
#NATHANIEL.
Jonathan is fourteen. When I was fourteen - What are Jonathan's tastes?
#JOHN GALE.
He reads all the time and he wants to write plays and poetry; but I am conquering that silliness.
#NATHANIEL.
I think I am going to like my nephew. John, I'll come into the house shortly. I think I'll look at this toy a moment and I'll get Aunt Letitia to show me some of Emily's things. A mere matter of sentiment.
#JOHN GALE.
Now don't put any foolishness into the boy's head.
#NATHANIEL.
I promise you I sha'n't try to change the boy's head, brother.
#JOHN GALE.
I play golf from five to six.
#NATHANIEL.
Oh, you've taken up athletics?
#JOHN GALE.
The doctor's advice. Will you join me?
#NATHANIEL.
Thank you, no.
#JOHN GALE.
Very well. I'll see you at dinner.
#NATHANIEL.
Thank you. Does John always talk to you so much, little church mouse?
#LETITIA.
I have been a poor relation for thirty - five years, my boy, and to be a successful poor relation, one must learn the art of silence.
#NATHANIEL.
No wonder I ran away!
#LETITIA.
But you should have written to me.
#NATHANIEL.
Perhaps - I should - yes - I should have written, but I didn't. You see, Aunt Letty, I was a sensitive boy. All my life I had dreamed of doing my own work. I saw Henry disappointed in life, I saw Emily made miserable enough through the traditions of the family. John couldn't understand me and I couldn't understand him. There was no common meeting - ground. John was the head of the family and so deeply was the idea of submission to rule ingrained in me that I could think of only one way out of my restraint. I wouldn't study engineering, and I wouldn't continue at Somerset School. Well, I ran away from my ancestral castle to find my way in a new world. I think I have found it.
#LETITIA.
Jonathan doesn't want to study engineering, either.
#NATHANIEL.
As Ibsen would say - Ghosts! Poor John!
#LETITIA.
Poor Jonathan!
#NATHANIEL.
Poor Jonathan!
#LETITIA.
Jonathan, this is your Uncle Nathaniel. Nathaniel, this is Emily's boy.
#NATHANIEL.
Jonathan!
#JONATHAN.
How do you do, sir?
#NATHANIEL.
How tall you are!
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir.
#NATHANIEL.
I didn't take you away from any studies, did I?
#JONATHAN.
No, sir... I was just writing something when Susan called me.
#NATHANIEL.
May I ask what you were writing?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir... ... A play. play! Zenobia?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir.
#NATHANIEL.
It's a tragedy, isn't it?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir.
#NATHANIEL.
In ten acts.
#JONATHAN.
There may be only eight.
#NATHANIEL.
Then I know who you are! You are the celebrated dramatist, Alexander Jefferson, Sr.
#JONATHAN.
Did Aunt Letitia tell you?
#NATHANIEL.
No, sir. I read it on the billboards. And I should like to attend a performance, Mr. Jefferson.
#JONATHAN.
It isn't finished yet.
#NATHANIEL.
Well, when am I to see this theatre?
#LETITIA.
Your Uncle Nathaniel and I shall come together.
#JONATHAN.
You've seen all the plays.
#LETITIA.
That doesn't make any difference. I'd like to see them again.
#JONATHAN.
I'll finish Zenobia for tomorrow.
#NATHANIEL.
Agreed! Can you get the scenery ready?
#JONATHAN.
I painted it last week.
#LETITIA.
You must have the orchestra, too, Jonathan.
#JONATHAN.
Yes, ma'am. Susan has some new pieces.
#NATHANIEL.
Is Susan the orchestra?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir.
#NATHANIEL.
What else have you written? lot of plays, sir. Mother and I used to write little plays. I don't write many any more.
#NATHANIEL.
Why not?
#JONATHAN.
I'm getting too big.
#NATHANIEL.
Do you ever write anything beside plays?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir.
#NATHANIEL.
That's splendid. Stories?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir... And I've written some po - poetry.
#NATHANIEL.
Excellent!
#JONATHAN.
They're not very good, but Susan always wants me to write the poetry for the music.
#LETITIA.
I'll go to the house now and you can talk to Jonathan, Nathaniel.
#NATHANIEL.
May I see some of your plays?
#JONATHAN.
Do you really want to see them?
#NATHANIEL.
Yes.
#JONATHAN.
Here is one that mother and I wrote. She loved the theatre.
#NATHANIEL.
"Robin Hood and His Merry Men."
#JONATHAN.
We used to make all those old stories into plays.
#NATHANIEL.
Do you like to write?
#JONATHAN.
Oh, yes. I wish I could write real plays, but there's no one to help me now. My mother used to correct them and tell me what was wrong. She knew a lot about the theatre and she used to tell me all sorts of things. But now Aunt Letitia doesn't say anything. Sometimes she comes to a show, but she can't help me. And Uncle John doesn't like the theatre. He thinks I'm too old to give shows, but I can't help it. There's nothing I like so much.
#NATHANIEL.
May I read this some time?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir... Would you like to see it played?
#NATHANIEL.
I want to see them all.
#JONATHAN.
Forty - one of them?
#NATHANIEL.
Forty - one of them! Where do you keep them all?
#JONATHAN.
Here in this box.
#NATHANIEL.
What are the pink ones?
#JONATHAN.
Those are the ones mother liked best and these - are the ones I liked best... I like them all now, but it used to be lots of fun to choose our favorites.
#NATHANIEL.
What is this one that's different from all the rest?
#JONATHAN.
That's one that mother wrote all by herself. It's best of all.
#NATHANIEL.
You must save these carefully, Jonathan - all your life.
#JONATHAN.
Oh, yes, sir.
#NATHANIEL.
Some day you may be proud of them.
#JONATHAN.
See - she wrote this, and I wrote this. I was a bad writer, wasn't I?
#NATHANIEL.
What do you want to do, Jonathan?
#JONATHAN.
You mean what do I want to be?
#NATHANIEL.
Yes.
#JONATHAN.
I want to write plays.
#NATHANIEL.
Is that all?
#JONATHAN.
Well, I'd like to run a theatre.
#NATHANIEL.
What else?
#JONATHAN.
I'd - you won't tell anyone, will you?
#NATHANIEL.
Of course not.
#JONATHAN.
You see, Uncle John wants me to go to Somerset School to study engineering and learn the business.
#NATHANIEL.
And you don't want to - Is that it?
#JONATHAN.
I'd rather be a writer.
#NATHANIEL.
They say you can't make any money at writing.
#JONATHAN.
That's what Uncle John says, but I want to just the same.
#NATHANIEL.
If you follow John's advice, you'll be a rich man.
#JONATHAN.
I'd rather be poor. What would you do, Uncle Nathaniel?
#NATHANIEL.
I - why I'd - Oh, come now, Jonathan - you know John is the head of the Clay family and you and he must decide this question.
#JONATHAN.
Wouldn't you want to be what you want to be?
#NATHANIEL.
Perhaps I should.
#JONATHAN.
I don't see how anyone can decide what you want to be - no matter how old he is.
#NATHANIEL.
Have you ever talked to John?
#JONATHAN.
Oh, yes, sir.
#NATHANIEL.
What did he say?
#JONATHAN.
He said I had to study engineering or go to work in the factory next fall for good.
#NATHANIEL.
What do you want to do?
#JONATHAN.
I want to go to a fine prep school and then to college and then -
#NATHANIEL.
Then what?
#JONATHAN.
I want to be an actor!!
#NATHANIEL.
I see.
#JONATHAN.
Don't tell anybody.
#NATHANIEL.
I won't. That's pretty far from engineering, isn't it?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir. But everybody can't be alike. You and Uncle John aren't anything alike.
#NATHANIEL.
And we're brothers, too.
#JONATHAN.
Do you ever get all mixed up and don't know what to do?
#NATHANIEL.
Oh, yes. I think everybody does.
#JONATHAN.
What do you do then?
#NATHANIEL.
I do something very silly.
#JONATHAN.
Do you do silly things, too?
#NATHANIEL.
Yes. I'm afraid I do.
#JONATHAN.
What do you do when you get all mixed up?
#NATHANIEL.
I'll tell you - it might not work with everybody, you know - but it works with me.
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir!
#NATHANIEL.
My mother used to sing me a song called - "There is a green hill far away." I always liked that song because it gave me a feeling of contentment and happiness. I imagined that I could see that hill with its pleasant green slopes and at its foot lay a little cottage all cool and pleasant and open to the winds. There were no locks and bolts to keep one out or to keep one in. I used to imagine that I was climbing that hill to the top of the world and when I reached the summit I could see -
#JONATHAN.
I know - the whole wide world.
#NATHANIEL.
Its very bigness made me happy in my imagination... Then when I grew up and heavy troubles came to me I remembered the Green Hill Far Away and one day I found such a hill and I climbed it - clear to the top - and there below me lay the world - the whole wide world - and I told the world something then and felt the better for it... Jonathan, there is nothing like a hilltop to make a man feel worth while.
#JONATHAN.
I know what you mean... But I always want to jump when I look down from any place, do you?
#NATHANIEL.
I suppose everybody does.
#JONATHAN.
Uncle John thinks every boy ought to be alike.
#NATHANIEL.
Many schools used to think that way.
#JONATHAN.
But boys don't all think the same. They're different just like men, only they don't know so much.
#NATHANIEL.
Perhaps not.
#JONATHAN.
Uncle John won't let me put on long pants until I'm fifteen.
#NATHANIEL.
He let me put them on when I was fifteen, too.
#JONATHAN.
Were you as tall as I am?
#NATHANIEL.
Just about the same height, but my legs were like pipe stems and I was very much ashamed.
#JONATHAN.
So am I.
#NATHANIEL.
You'll forget all about it after you're fifteen.
#JONATHAN.
I can talk to you like I used to talk to my mother.
#NATHANIEL.
Thank you. We're going to be fine friends, aren't we?
#JONATHAN.
You bet. Is it silly for me to like to write plays?
#NATHANIEL.
Why do you ask that?
#JONATHAN.
Because Uncle John says it's silly.
#NATHANIEL.
Well, it all depends upon the way you look at it, Jonathan. The world has never been able to agree as to what is and what is not silly. Mr. Browning, the poet, might have considered hooks and eyes the silliest things in the world; but to Mr. de Long, they were, no doubt, the most important things in the world. Many men agree with Mr. Browning and many ladies agree with Mr. de Long.
#JONATHAN.
That's what I think.
#NATHANIEL.
You and I probably have many thoughts in common.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Ah, there you are, Mr. Nathaniel Clay. I met la belle Susanne in the roadway and she told me you were in the lumber room in the carriage house and I say to her, "We shall track him to his lair." Besides, I want to see what a lumber room is.
#NATHANIEL.
I was hiding from you.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Villain! And this is Jonathan. How do you do? Susanne tells me you write poetry and she writes music and she promise me that you will sing for me.
#JONATHAN.
I can't sing.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Ah! Susanne tell me you have a theatre and you write plays and paint scenery and write poetry and sing songs and she say if I come here to the lumber room in the carriage house you will play me a tragedy and sing me a song.
#JONATHAN.
Yes, ma'am.
#NATHANIEL.
Having introduced yourself to everybody, will you tell me, Susan, how Mlle. Perrault learned so much in such a little time?
#SUSAN.
Well, I was waiting for Jonathan to call me.
#JONATHAN.
Oh, I forgot.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
She was sitting like a little fairy in the grass by the roadway, and I stop my car and ask for Mr. Nathaniel Clay and she say you are here in the lumber room in the carriage house and she tell me many things - because we like each other very, very much and we walk very, very slowly.
#NATHANIEL.
Now! Now that you know all about Miss Susan Sample and Mr. Jonathan - I think I shall introduce you by your pen name, Jonathan - Mr. Alexander Jefferson, Sr. I am going to let them know about you. This, lady and gentleman, is Mlle. Marthe Perrault of Paris, France. Mlle. Perrault, may I present my friend Susan and my nephew Jonathan?
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
I am very, very pleased to see you again, Miss Sample. It is a great pleasure to have the honor of meeting you, Mr. Alexander Jefferson, Sr. I am looking forward to the première of your great tragedy, Zenobia, of which Miss Sample has been telling me.
#SUSAN.
He wrote lots of others, too.
#JONATHAN.
Forty - one.
#NATHANIEL.
I think I'll tell you two a secret. Do you like secrets?
#SUSAN.
Yes, sir.
#NATHANIEL.
And can you keep them?
#SUSAN.
Oh, yes, sir.
#NATHANIEL.
Well, some day Mlle. Perrault is going to be my wife.
#SUSAN.
When?
#NATHANIEL.
Very soon. She is here on some war work and when she and her father go back to France I shall follow and we shall be married.
#SUSAN.
Ooh -
#NATHANIEL.
Now you mustn't tell.
#SUSAN.
Honest.
#JONATHAN.
No, sir!
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Now, we have a secret. And you are going to sing me a little song.
#SUSAN.
Come on, Jonathan. Let's do the new one.
#JONATHAN.
Well, I'll try.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Oh, that is just like a little French peasant song! How does it go? La - la - la - la - la - la. So - when one is very happy or very sad, he makes a song and when he's very, very happy, he dances. And when he is very, very, very unhappy he dies. You see, I am very, very happy. When do you play Zenobia, Mr. Jefferson, Sr.?
#JONATHAN.
I'll have it ready tomorrow, maybe tonight.
#NATHANIEL.
We shall have a season ticket. But now, I want you to meet my blessed Aunt Letitia. She hasn't changed one bit in all these years.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
To Aunt Letitia then. Good - bye, Jonathan. Tomorrow is the day of the great première.
#JONATHAN.
Thanks.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
And la belle petite Susanne, au revoir.
#SUSAN.
I'll walk with you part of the way.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Very well. Marchons, marchons...
#NATHANIEL.
Good - bye, Mr. Manager. "Marthe."
#JONATHAN.
Who is it?
#HANK.
It's me.
#JONATHAN.
What do you want?
#HANK.
Say -
#JONATHAN.
How'd you get in here?
#HANK.
Well, it's this way, you see. The gate was open out there and this looked pretty fine to me so I come in.
#JONATHAN.
You'd better go away before my uncle sees you.
#HANK.
Look here, young feller, I ain't goin' a - do no harm.
#JONATHAN.
Well, he doesn't allow strangers on the place.
#HANK.
I jus' come in to ask if I could sleep somewhere around here if I worked for my sleep and grub.
#JONATHAN.
No, he won't let you.
#HANK.
How do you know he won't?
#JONATHAN.
'Cause it's a rule.
#HANK.
Where's your pa?
#JONATHAN.
He's dead.
#HANK.
Long?
#JONATHAN.
Ten years ago.
#HANK.
How old are you?
#JONATHAN.
Fourteen.
#HANK.
Your pa died when you were four. So did mine.
#JONATHAN.
Did you ever have an uncle?
#HANK.
How many you got?
#JONATHAN.
I got two living and one dead.
#HANK.
All three of mine's dead. Where's your ma?
#JONATHAN.
She died when I was twelve.
#HANK.
So did mine. We're alike in lots of ways, ain't we?
#JONATHAN.
What did you do when your mother died?
#HANK.
I felt pretty sorry.
#JONATHAN.
Did your brothers and sisters help you any?
#HANK.
Have you any brothers and sisters?
#JONATHAN.
No -
#HANK.
Me neither. No one took no notice of me.
#JONATHAN.
What'd you do?
#HANK.
I went away.
#JONATHAN.
Why didn't you try to work?
#HANK.
Couldn't find nothing suitable. 'T first I felt sort o' worried an' then I kep' walkin' on and I seen so much trouble where I went I says to myself, "Hank, you're lucky," I says. "You ain't got no fam'ly to bother you an' you ain't got nothing to worry you an' you don't have to get no place in partic'lar and you don't have to stay no place." A man wot's got a wife's all the time worrying about her health or her money spendin' or her gaddin' or her naggin'. An' a man w'ots got a fam'ly's always wondering where they'll end. An' a man's wot's got a home's all time worrying about keepin' it locked up. I bet the poor nut wot owns this place can't breathe easy for bein' scared things'll be took or burnt up. W'y you - look at you - You're wishin' I'd go 'cause you're 'fraid I'll take somethin'. I won't take nothin', young feller, 'cause I don't need nothin' now and I won't need nothin' till it's cold again - and then I'll git an overcoat maybe. It's too much trouble takin' things - 'cause you have to carry 'em. You goin' to let me sleep here some place?
#JONATHAN.
I can't. My uncle would drive you away. Maybe he'd have you arrested.
#HANK.
I ain't done nothin'. I ain't hurtin' nobody.
#JONATHAN.
Well, he doesn't allow strangers around.
#HANK.
That's where I went by jus' now.
#JONATHAN.
I heard you whistling.
#HANK.
That's a tune I made up once.
#JONATHAN.
Do you make up tunes?
#HANK.
That's the only one I ever done. It comes in handy and it don't hurt no one.
#HANK.
No, that ain't it. It's this way. No. Here.
#HANK.
That's it. Say, what you got these bars for? It's like jail. Are they afraid you'll jump out on them rocks?
#JONATHAN.
No, I guess not. There isn't much danger of my wanting to jump out.
#HANK.
You never can tell for sure, young feller.
#JONATHAN.
It's to keep people from climbing in.
#HANK.
There ain't no bars over that one.
#JONATHAN.
That's too high.
#HANK.
It'd be like fallin' off the top of a house, wouldn't it?
#HANK.
What you got there?
#JONATHAN.
That's my theatre. show?
#JONATHAN.
Yes.
#HANK.
How does it work?
#JONATHAN.
These are the actors.
#HANK.
What's the string fer?
#JONATHAN.
You put him in a groove and pull him.
#HANK.
Lemme see it.
#JONATHAN.
All right. I'll show you a scene from the play I'm going to play for my Uncle Nathaniel tomorrow.
#HANK.
Fire away.
#HANK.
I wouldn't have all this junk if you'd give it to me. No, sir, when I move I carry my house with me and there ain't much o' that now.
#JONATHAN.
All ready. Now you sit there.
#HANK.
What's that fer?
#JONATHAN.
That's to get ready.
#HANK.
Well, I'm ready. That's beautiful. It's just like real. Hello, old man. That's the one I jus' seen. Where's the string?
#JONATHAN.
Here it is.
#HANK.
Now where's that feller goin' to?
#JONATHAN.
Well, you see, Zenobia -
#HANK.
Zenob - God, what a name!
#JONATHAN.
They used to have names like that.
#HANK.
How d' you do it?
#JONATHAN.
Look, I'll show you a little.
#HANK.
What you doin' that for? I like to see that picture.
#JONATHAN.
I'm going to show you how I do it.
#HANK.
All right. I'm ready. Let her go.
#HANK.
Say, are they talkin' to each other?
#JONATHAN.
Yes.
#HANK.
Which is the noble duke?
#JONATHAN.
This one.
#HANK.
And the other one's name is Iween, ain't it?
#JONATHAN.
No, his name is Rollo.
#HANK.
All right, fire ahead. I guess you know what you're doing.
#JONATHAN.
"Hail, noble duke." "All is well, I ween." "Not very well, noble duke." "What is wrong?" "Queen Zenobia is very mad, noble duke." "What is she mad about, Rollo?"
#JOHN GALE.
Jonathan - What does this mean?
#HANK.
I'm seein' a show.
#JOHN GALE.
You get out of here this instant.
#HANK.
I ain't hurtin' nothin', mister, but I'll git out if you say so.
#JOHN GALE.
What do you mean by this, Jonathan?
#HANK.
I'll git out. Thank you fer the show, boy.
#JOHN GALE.
Come on, get out of here quickly.
#HANK.
I'm out, mister.
#JOHN GALE.
Now, Jonathan, what do you mean by bringing such people into this place?
#JONATHAN.
I didn't bring him in. He came up while I was working.
#JOHN GALE.
Do you call that silly stuff working?
#JONATHAN.
I was getting it ready for Uncle Nathaniel.
#JOHN GALE.
He's been putting that nonsense in your head, has he?
#JONATHAN.
He asked me to let him see all my plays.
#JOHN GALE.
I suppose he told you to ask that dirty tramp in here.
#JONATHAN.
No, sir. He didn't see the tramp.
#JOHN GALE.
You get away from there. Move on. I guess the roadside's free, mister.
#JOHN GALE.
We'll see about that.
#JOHN GALE.
Jonathan, I won't have you waste your time on this stuff. I've been pretty lenient with you and I've allowed you to keep your toys because Emily spoiled you; but you're too big for such things and I'm going to put my foot down right now. I'm not going to have this silly stuff around.
#JONATHAN.
Uncle Nathaniel doesn't think it's silly.
#JOHN GALE.
I'll decide what is and is not good for you.
#JONATHAN.
The same thing isn't good for everybody.
#JOHN GALE.
Don't talk back to me, young man.
#JONATHAN.
I've got a right to think.
#JOHN GALE.
Jonathan!
#JONATHAN.
If my mother was living, she wouldn't call everything I like to do silly.
#JOHN GALE.
Your mother didn't know what was good for you.
#JONATHAN.
My mother was the best woman in the world.
#JOHN GALE.
That will do, Jonathan. Your mother was my sister and I am not saying anything against her. But I do say that stuff must go.
#JONATHAN.
If this theatre goes, I go, too. I'm not -
#JOHN GALE.
Now.
#JONATHAN.
You dirty coward, you -
#JOHN GALE.
I'll let you think about it. I'll leave you here with your toys like a girl - baby.
#JONATHAN.
You let me out of here! You let me out of here!
#JOHN GALE.
Jonathan!
#NATHANIEL.
He's hiding.
#JOHN GALE.
Jonathan!
#NATHANIEL.
What's this?
#JOHN GALE.
What does it say?
#NATHANIEL.
"Good - bye!... Jonathan."
#JOHN GALE.
Did you tell the silly boy about your running away?
#NATHANIEL.
I told Jonathan nothing about myself. You are the head of the Clay family and out of custom I respected your position; but, by God, John, you're a failure with this boy.
#JOHN GALE.
He -
#HANK.
He fell on the rocks out there.
#NATHANIEL.
Put him over here.
#JOHN GALE.
What was he doing?
#HANK.
He was -
#NATHANIEL.
This is no time for questions, John. Call a doctor.
#JONATHAN.
Good - bye... Jonathan.
#JOHN GALE.
We'd better take him in the house.
#JONATHAN.
My mother was the best woman -
#NATHANIEL.
He'd better stay here until the doctor comes.
#JONATHAN.
All on a summer's day -
#HANK.
He's out of his head, ain't he?
#NATHANIEL.
Perhaps, but sometimes one's heart speaks in a delirium.
#HANK.
He acts like his back's broke.
#NATHANIEL.
My God - his back!
#JONATHAN.
My back's broken, Hank.
#HANK.
Listen, he's saying my name. We wuz pals, sure nuff.
#JONATHAN.
My back's broken, Hank.
#HANK.
He fell on the rocks out there.
#NATHANIEL.
Put him over here.
#JOHN GALE.
What was he doing?
#HANK.
He was -
#NATHANIEL.
This is no time for questions, John. Call a doctor.
#JONATHAN.
Good - bye... Jonathan.
#JOHN GALE.
We'd better take him in the house.
#JONATHAN.
My mother was the best woman -
#NATHANIEL.
He'd better stay here until the doctor comes.
#JONATHAN.
All on a summer's day -
#HANK.
He's out of his head, ain't he?
#NATHANIEL.
Perhaps, but sometimes one's heart speaks in a delirium.
#HANK.
He acts like his back's broke.
#NATHANIEL.
My God - his back!
#JONATHAN.
My back's broken, Hank.
#HANK.
Listen, he's saying my name. We wuz pals, sure nuff.
#JONATHAN.
My back's broken, Hank.
#JONATHAN.
My back's broken, Hank. Tired?
#HANK.
Sure...
#JONATHAN.
I think Uncle Nathaniel would help me if he saw me.
#HANK.
He couldn't do nothin' for you. You can't straighten a crooked back...
#JONATHAN.
Hank, I'm tired of this and I'm going back.
#HANK.
Going back where?
#JONATHAN.
I'm going back home.
#HANK.
Your Uncle John won't let you in.
#JONATHAN.
Uncle Nathaniel will take me in.
#HANK.
He ain't there no more and besides he won't know you.
#JONATHAN.
Honest - don't you think he would?
#HANK.
Sure, he wouldn't.
#JONATHAN.
I wish I hadn't run away.
#HANK.
If you don't quit wishing I'll run away from you.
#JONATHAN.
You wouldn't leave me, would you, Hank?
#HANK.
Sure, I'd leave you... What do you think I am - a wishing stone?... I want peace, I do... An' your wishing's disturbing my peace... Every day fer six years you squeal about what you done... Your Uncle John swatted you and you burned your theatre things and jumped out o' the window and broke your back and I saved you...
#JONATHAN.
I can't do anything with a broken back!
#HANK.
What do you want to do anything for?
#JONATHAN.
Sometimes I'd like to write a little.
#HANK.
Go ahead... I'll wait for you.
#JONATHAN.
And I'd like to give a show. You know, Hank, I used to want to be an actor...
#HANK.
Sure, all kids want to be actors or go in a circus or do something where a lot o' people are lookin' on.
#JONATHAN.
But I can't be an actor now, because nobody'd want to look at me.
#HANK.
You act like that hump's ruined your life, when all you got to do's crouch over a little more and look sad and you can get anything you want. Why, it's money in your pocket, that's what that hump is; it's money in your pocket. Say, go on over to that house and get us something to eat.
#JONATHAN.
Hank said you'd turn me away if I came back.
#JOHN GALE.
Were you talking to me, boy?
#JONATHAN.
I'm so sorry I ran away, Uncle John.
#JOHN GALE.
Uncle John?
#JONATHAN.
Don't you know me, Sir?
#JOHN GALE.
Indeed I do not.
#JONATHAN.
I'm Jonathan -
#JOHN GALE.
Jonathan! My nephew Jonathan? - Ha! Ha!
#JONATHAN.
Don't you remember I didn't want to study engineering - I didn't want to go to Somerset School?
#JOHN GALE.
Where is Jonathan?
#JONATHAN.
I'm Jonathan, sir. You remember I jumped out of the window and I tried to run away.
#JOHN GALE.
You seem to know a lot about it. Where is Jonathan?
#JONATHAN.
I tell you I am Jonathan... Don't you remember you struck me - You struck me across the face - that's what made me run away.
#JOHN GALE.
I should have whipped him and put him to bed.
#JONATHAN.
I would have run away just the same, Uncle John.
#JOHN GALE.
Don't call me Uncle John!
#JONATHAN.
But you are my Uncle John.
#JOHN GALE.
I ask you where is Jonathan.
#JONATHAN.
Would you like to see him?
#JOHN GALE.
I should like to know what has become of him.
#JONATHAN.
Would you let him come back home?
#JOHN GALE.
No. When he ran away, I cast him out forever.
#JONATHAN.
Couldn't you forgive him if he was very, very sorry for what he had done?... Couldn't you forgive me, sir?... I am Jonathan. Honest I am Jonathan.
#JOHN GALE.
Don't try to deceive me. Jonathan was impudent as you are; but he was a Clay: he was straight and fine.
#JONATHAN.
But I broke my back.
#JOHN GALE.
Tell me where Jonathan is, you imposter. Tell me... Tell me.
#JONATHAN.
I don't know... Let me go... I'm not Jonathan.
#JOHN GALE.
Tell me...
#JONATHAN.
He's dead.
#JOHN GALE.
What!
#JONATHAN.
He's dead. He died somewhere.
#JOHN GALE.
And so you tried to palm yourself off as Jonathan.
#JONATHAN.
I'm sorry.
#JOHN GALE.
Don't you know you can't make your way with lies?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir.
#JOHN GALE.
You ought to be whipped, but I suppose you don't know any better. I should have you arrested for vagrancy. But I won't. I pity you, you dirty little beggar. You ought to wash your hands and face at least.
#JONATHAN.
Please, sir - one minute... How are Mary and John third?
#JOHN GALE.
Mary is ten - a big girl - and John third is eight - a strapping boy who will be a great help to me.
#JONATHAN.
And - how is Aunt Letitia?
#JOHN GALE.
My aunt died of a broken heart. broken heart?
#JOHN GALE.
Because Jonathan ran away. There! Don't cry for someone you've never seen... Here, here, take this -
#JONATHAN.
Here, Hank.
#HANK.
What'd he say?
#JONATHAN.
He didn't know me.
#HANK.
I guess you're not going back home now!
#JONATHAN.
No, I haven't any home.
#HANK.
Then quit your snifflin' an' go on over to that house.
#JONATHAN.
All right, Hank.
#JONATHAN.
Please, Miss - why -
#SUSAN.
What do you want?
#JONATHAN.
I - don't you know me?
#SUSAN.
No, I don't know you, little boy. What do you want?
#JONATHAN.
I - don't you really know me?
#SUSAN.
I've never seen you before.
#JONATHAN.
I know you... You're Susan Sample.
#SUSAN.
Who told you?
#JONATHAN.
I'm - Why Jonathan told me.
#SUSAN.
Have you seen Jonathan?
#JONATHAN.
Yes.
#SUSAN.
Where is he?
#JONATHAN.
I don't know.
#SUSAN.
He ran away. Why doesn't he come home?
#JONATHAN.
Because - oh, I don't know.
#SUSAN.
Who are you?
#JONATHAN.
I'm a vagrant.
#SUSAN.
Are you hungry?
#JONATHAN.
No. I'm not... I'm not begging... But will you do something for me?
#SUSAN.
Yes, if I can.
#JONATHAN.
Will you play for me?
#SUSAN.
Oh, yes... What shall I play?
#JONATHAN.
Anything. Excuse me a moment.
#JONATHAN.
Do you remember this?
#SUSAN.
Oh, yes.
#SUSAN.
You don't like it?
#JONATHAN.
That isn't exactly the way it goes.
#SUSAN.
Oh, yes, it is.
#JONATHAN.
No - no - no. It ought to go this way.
#SUSAN.
You sing that just as Jonathan used to sing it.
#JONATHAN.
I like it that way.
#SUSAN.
Did Jonathan teach it to you?
#JONATHAN.
Yes... A long time ago.
#SUSAN.
Did he tell you -
#JONATHAN.
About the lovely lady who danced to the tune? Oh, she was wonderful!
#SUSAN.
Jonathan ran away - and he never wrote to me or thought of me.
#JONATHAN.
He thought of you and he talked of you and he sang of you.
#SUSAN.
No... I can't believe that.
#JONATHAN.
Jonathan loves you very much.
#SUSAN.
If a man loves a woman very much he can't go away from her for years and years.
#JONATHAN.
Suppose Jonathan had pride and was ashamed to let you know that he had failed.
#SUSAN.
Jonathan wouldn't fail. I know Jonathan.
#JONATHAN.
He - Susan Sample!
#SUSAN.
Will you tell me where Jonathan was when you last saw him?
#JONATHAN.
I don't know - The last time I saw Jonathan - he was tall and straight - and making his way.
#SUSAN.
Oh, well.
#ALBERT.
Ah, Susan.
#SUSAN.
Albert, you are late.
#ALBERT.
Who is this?
#SUSAN.
This is a friend of Jonathan's.
#ALBERT.
Jonathan who?
#SUSAN.
Don't you remember Jonathan who had the toy theatre? He ran away from home.
#ALBERT.
Oh... and this is his friend? How do you do?
#SUSAN.
Do you remember this? I used to play it for you. Jonathan and I made it up.
#ALBERT.
Oh, yes.
#SUSAN.
Come on and sing it.
#ALBERT.
Well, all this is very pleasant indeed, but we'll have to go, Susan dear.
#JONATHAN.
I think I'd better say good - bye.
#SUSAN.
Good - bye. If you see Jonathan, tell him I'm going to marry Albert Peet. He'll know.
#ALBERT.
Good - bye.
#MARY.
John, look - he's a hunchback.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
'Sh! Children. How do you do, little man.
#JONATHAN.
I am well, I thank you.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
What are you doing here?
#JONATHAN.
I am with Hank.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Hank?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, Hank's my pal. There he is - asleep.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Oh, what a dreadful person... Children, don't go near him.
#JONATHAN.
He's not so bad.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
But he is a vagrant - a tramp. Why does he do nothing?
#JONATHAN.
He's happier that way.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Are you his son?
#JONATHAN.
Oh, no.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Where is your mother?
#JONATHAN.
My mother's dead.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Where did she live?
#JONATHAN.
I'd better not tell you.
#MARY.
Oh, please tell us.
#JONATHAN.
I'd better not.
#MARY.
You ask him, John.
#JOHN III.
Uh - uh!
#MARY.
Why not?
#JOHN III.
I don't want to know.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Why don't you want to tell us? We won't tell anybody.
#JONATHAN.
Nobody'll believe me.
#MARY.
Why?
#JONATHAN.
You see, I ran away from home -
#JOHN III.
When you run away from home, you're no good.
#MARY.
Now, John, that isn't always so.
#JOHN III.
It is.
#MARY.
It isn't. Goldilocks and the Babes in the Wood and the Marquis of Carabas were all good, and they ran away from home.
#JOHN III.
But they had bad homes.
#MARY.
Was your home bad?
#JONATHAN.
I thought it was.
#JOHN III.
You thought it was. But was it?
#JONATHAN.
No.
#JOHN III.
Then you're no good.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Oh, John.
#JOHN III.
No, he isn't. Grandfather said nobody who ran away from home was any good!
#MARY.
Why did you run away from home?
#JONATHAN.
I mustn't tell.
#MARY.
Oh, you won't tell anything!
#JOHN III.
What did you say he was, Ma'mselle?
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
He is a vagrant -
#MARY AND JOHN III.
What's a vagrant?
#MARY.
Ooh -
#JOHN III.
Aw, I'm not going to make a wish. Grandfather'll get it for me anyway if I want it.
#MARY.
Now, John Clay III - You always spoil things.
#JONATHAN.
Is that Mary Clay and John Clay?
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Yes.
#JONATHAN.
They don't remember Jonathan, do they?
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
You mean Jonathan who ran away?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, ma'am.
#MARY.
Who's Jonathan?
#JOHN III.
He's David's friend. I know that. And he was very good.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
What do you know about Jonathan?
#JONATHAN.
I knew him once -
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
He was a splendid little man! He could make such lovely songs.
#JONATHAN.
Do you remember the one he and Susan Sample made up?
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Let's see - how did it go?
#JONATHAN.
No, it went this way.
#JOHN III.
Oh, look at your shadow! I can make a bigger one than that.
#MARY.
Oh, come on, ma'mselle, let's all make shadows.
#JOHN III.
Boy, you come, too.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Come, boy. Now, let's dance - Give me your hand - so.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Now, let's make everybody's shadow dance by itself.
#MARY.
Oh, come on.
#JOHN III.
You first, Mlle.
#MARY.
It's your turn, Mlle. John, you do it now.
#JOHN III.
I won't. I'm going to be next to last... He's going to be last.
#MARY.
Now, John -
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
You little Jackanapes! You!
#JOHN III.
You can't do that.
#JONATHAN.
You just wait.
#JOHN III.
Oh, look!
#MARY.
Ooh -
#JOHN III.
That's funnier than mine.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
John! Mary! Tell the little boy good - bye. We must go.
#SUSAN.
Albert, come - let's go!
#JOHN III.
Wasn't he funniest of all!
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Now, run along, children. Run along.
#MARY.
Look, I can make a hump - back.
#JOHN III.
So can I.
#MARY.
Not a good one!
#JOHN III.
You can't touch mine.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Little man, I'm very sorry. You mustn't let them hurt you. They are only children.
#JONATHAN.
Yes, ma'am... Thank you.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
May I do something for you?
#JONATHAN.
No, ma'am... if you please... I must go to Hank.
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
Here, take this -
#JONATHAN.
Oh, no, ma'am...
#MLLE. PERRAULT.
I am sorry... Very, very sorry.
#JONATHAN.
Yes, ma'am. "Marie" - "John," and a distant answer is heard].
#SUSAN.
They didn't mean to hurt you.
#JONATHAN.
Yes, I know.
#HANK.
What you got?
#JONATHAN.
Nothing.
#HANK.
Come across, Humpy.
#JONATHAN.
Don't you call me that!
#HANK.
So - ho! What you yelling at me for?
#JONATHAN.
Nothing... I didn't mean to yell.
#HANK.
What you got there?
#JONATHAN.
I tell you I haven't got anything, Hank.
#HANK.
Come on. Come across.
#JONATHAN.
It's not for you.
#HANK.
Come on.
#JONATHAN.
No.
#HANK.
Gimme it here...
#JONATHAN.
Stop that!
#HANK.
Great God! Say, what's the matter with you?
#JONATHAN.
I tell you, I'm going back... I'm going back to my home... I'm going to find my Uncle Nathaniel. I know he'll take me in. He won't blame me because I'm a cripple... I know... I know... Didn't he say, "Poor Jonathan"?...
#JONATHAN.
Uncle Nathaniel.
#NATHANIEL.
What did you say, my boy?
#JONATHAN.
Uncle Nathaniel.
#NATHANIEL.
I can't hear you.
#JONATHAN.
You - are - my - Uncle Nathaniel.
#NATHANIEL.
Come, come, my boy. I can't hear you.
#JONATHAN.
Aren't you - Mr. - Nathaniel - Clay?
#NATHANIEL.
Yes, I am Mr. Nathaniel Clay.
#JONATHAN.
My name's - Jonathan.
#NATHANIEL.
Jonathan!... I had a nephew whose name was Jonathan.
#JONATHAN.
Don't you know me?
#NATHANIEL.
You must forgive me, little man - but I do not remember you. Boys grow so quickly.
#JONATHAN.
Don't you remember Zenobia?
#NATHANIEL.
Zenobia? Who was she?
#JONATHAN.
Don't you remember the little theatre?
#NATHANIEL.
Oh, yes, my nephew Jonathan had a little toy theatre, and he wrote a play called Zenobia... He burnt them.
#JONATHAN.
Was it wrong to burn them?
#NATHANIEL.
I don't know. You see Jonathan ran away, and I have never seen him since.
#JONATHAN.
Do you blame him?
#NATHANIEL.
Well, I can't say. When a fine boy like Jonathan runs away from home, he may have what he considers a good reason.
#JONATHAN.
Don't you know why he ran away?
#NATHANIEL.
I think I know.
#JONATHAN.
Would you tell me why?
#NATHANIEL.
That wouldn't do any good, my boy... If you had an uncle who liked you very much, would you run away?
#JONATHAN.
No, sir - not if I had another chance...
#NATHANIEL.
What do you mean?
#JONATHAN.
Don't you really know me?
#NATHANIEL.
I'm sorry - no!
#JONATHAN.
Do you know him?
#NATHANIEL.
That tramp?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir... That's Hank.
#NATHANIEL.
Hank?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, the one I ran away with.
#NATHANIEL.
Did you run away, too?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir; I jumped out the window, and I fell and broke my back. Hank said -
#NATHANIEL.
What a dirty man!
#JONATHAN.
He's my pal.
#NATHANIEL.
You're evidently a fine young man inside.
#JONATHAN.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir, that I ran away.
#NATHANIEL.
You can't undo the past, my boy, but you can make the future.
#JONATHAN.
I can't straighten my back.
#NATHANIEL.
Perhaps not, but you can straighten your life.
#JONATHAN.
I'm only a beggar, sir.
#NATHANIEL.
There is something everybody can do.
#JONATHAN.
There isn't any place for me...
#NATHANIEL.
My boy, there is a place for everybody who wants a place.
#JONATHAN.
Do you remember what your nephew wanted to do?
#NATHANIEL.
Yes, he wanted to write plays and run a theatre and be an actor.
#JONATHAN.
I couldn't ever be an actor, could I?
#NATHANIEL.
No, my boy.
#JONATHAN.
Supposing you had your heart set on something and couldn't do it, what would you do?
#NATHANIEL.
I'd not give up... I'd try something else.
#JONATHAN.
Supposing I were your nephew, what would you do?
#NATHANIEL.
I'd find out what you wanted to be.
#JONATHAN.
Don't I look like Jonathan?
#NATHANIEL.
Jonathan must be very tall now.
#JONATHAN.
If Jonathan weren't tall?
#NATHANIEL.
But he is tall and splendid. I know Jonathan! And he's doing what he set out to do.
#JONATHAN.
I hope you'll find him, sir, and I hope he'll make you proud.
#NATHANIEL.
My boy, how old are you?
#JONATHAN.
I'm twenty.
#NATHANIEL.
Twenty... Will you try to pull yourself out of the rut?
#JONATHAN.
What do you mean, sir?
#NATHANIEL.
Look at that man. What is he to you?
#JONATHAN.
He's my pal.
#NATHANIEL.
You mustn't waste your life on such emptiness as his.
#JONATHAN.
I'm going to try, sir... And if I make good, will you believe I'm Jonathan?
#NATHANIEL.
I'll believe you are you... Here...
#JONATHAN.
Oh, no, sir... I can't - from you -
#NATHANIEL.
Well, you are a strange beggar -
#JONATHAN.
I'm not a beggar at heart... I don't want to be what I am. But I don't know which way to turn. I'm all mixed up.
#NATHANIEL.
All mixed up? Boy, there is a green hill far away. Climb to the top of it, look about and you will see -
#JONATHAN.
I know: the whole wide world!
#NATHANIEL.
Exactly.
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir.
#NATHANIEL.
Go to the hilltop alone - and cry out to your heart's content. - There's nothing like a hilltop to make a man feel worth while!
#JONATHAN.
I knew that, sir; but I forgot it. I'm going -
#NATHANIEL.
Good - bye, boy; God bless you.
#JONATHAN.
He believes in me... Hank! Hank!
#HANK.
What you want?
#JONATHAN.
He didn't know me!
#HANK.
Who didn't know you?
#JONATHAN.
Uncle Nathaniel... He just passed by... But, Hank, he believed in me! He believed I'd make good.
#HANK.
Say, what's the matter with you today?
#JONATHAN.
I'm goin' to leave you, Hank.
#HANK.
Huh?
#JONATHAN.
Old pal, I'm going to leave you forever. You've stuck by me -
#HANK.
Sure, I've stuck by you. Ain't you saved me a heap o' trouble?
#JONATHAN.
But I'm going now, Hank. Good - bye. I'm going to the green hill far away.
#NATHANIEL.
Nine ninety - nine - one thousand. You're nearly there, Boy.
#JONATHAN.
Nine hundred and ninety - nine - one thousand - I'm almost there.
#NATHANIEL.
thousand and one - a thousand and two - thousand and one, a thousand and two - I am here!
#NATHANIEL.
The world is here.
#JONATHAN.
Listen... I ran away. I ran away. I was fourteen. I saw visions of great things. I heard voices of the past and the future. I wanted to tell what I saw and heard... Oh, you who made sport of my dreams, I am here at the top of the world! Uncle John, I have heard things you will never hear, and I have seen things you will never see.
#JOHN GALE.
But your back's broken.
#JONATHAN.
Oh, Susan - Susan Sample - see - see. I told you I wasn't a beggar. See - see - Jonathan stands at the top of the world!
#SUSAN.
But your back's broken.
#JONATHAN.
Oh, people of all the world, I am a boy who asks you to hear me and to understand. I only wanted to work out my way... I planned my way because I couldn't help it - I wanted to build my own world - alone... I climbed clear to the top - Jonathan stands before you -
#VOICES.
Jonathan's dead.
#JONATHAN.
Dead?... Oh, see the wreck of everything... Jonathan is dead!
#NATHANIEL.
Boy - boy - Jonathan! - I believe you are you.
#JONATHAN.
Uncle Nathaniel! Oh, people of all the world, my Uncle Nathaniel understands. - I speak for all the boys of all times. Have patience - patience and understanding. Don't you remember when you were young? We come to you with hopes and dreams and wishes and fears, - and these are the things that life is made of -
#NATHANIEL.
I am here, Jonathan.
#JONATHAN.
I'm coming to you. I'm coming back to you with all my hopes and dreams.
#NATHANIEL.
We're waiting for you, Jonathan.
#JONATHAN.
I've made my wish that's coming true!!
#NATHANIEL.
Well, my boy -
#JONATHAN.
Uncle Nathaniel, did you know that Caproni was an artist?
#NATHANIEL.
You mean the Caproni who makes the wonderful aeroplanes?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir.
#NATHANIEL.
No, I didn't know it; but I'm not surprised.
#JONATHAN.
Aren't these pictures fine?
#NATHANIEL.
Excellent.
#JONATHAN.
He made them... They're like great dragon - flies, aren't they? whole swarm of them.
#JONATHAN.
It must feel funny to fly through air.
#NATHANIEL.
Would you like to try it some time?
#JONATHAN.
Yes... but I'd have to get used to it... It must be like diving.
#NATHANIEL.
When you were very ill you seemed to imagine you were falling.
#JONATHAN.
Did I talk much when I was unconscious?
#NATHANIEL.
You talked almost continuously.
#JONATHAN.
Did I?... You said you'd tell me what I said - when I was strong enough... I'm pretty strong now.
#NATHANIEL.
Do you know what I did?
#JONATHAN.
I don't know.
#NATHANIEL.
Can you guess?
#JONATHAN.
"Jonathan Builds a Fear." What does that mean?
#NATHANIEL.
When you were delirious I listened to what you said and then I made a story out of it.
#JONATHAN.
You mean this is all about me?
#NATHANIEL.
It's about a little hunchback who thought he was you.
#JONATHAN.
I know. I was always trying to make somebody know me, and finally I thought I jumped from the top of a hill and I seemed to be falling for years and years...
#NATHANIEL.
Those were terrible days, my boy, and do you know, we were afraid you wouldn't live.
#JONATHAN.
It was a terrible feeling.
#NATHANIEL.
I know, but all that's over now; and there's the whole story about the little hunchback you never were.
#NATHANIEL.
He comes every now and then to ask about you and to get something to eat.
#HANK.
Hi!
#NATHANIEL.
Come in, Hank. -
#HANK.
Is the old man here?
#NATHANIEL.
No.
#HANK.
Hello, boy.
#JONATHAN.
I'm well now. How are you?
#HANK.
I'm beginning to get cold, so I think I'll go south tomorrow and I thought I'd drop in to say good - bye.
#NATHANIEL.
I'll give you an overcoat, Hank.
#HANK.
No, thanks. It's too hot to carry it. I'll get one when I really need it, maybe.
#NATHANIEL.
Well, here's something for you. Five dollars! No, thanks. If I had that much money I'd lose it maybe. Give me two bits and call it square. Thanks... Well... good - bye... I'm glad your back wasn't broke.
#JONATHAN.
Good - bye, Hank.
#HANK.
Good - bye, Mister... I'll see you next year maybe, when it's warm. - Say, kid, I'd like to see that Zenobia show again: - "Hail, noble duke," "All's well, Irene." "Not very well, noble duke."
#LETITIA.
I thought you were out with John.
#NATHANIEL.
No.
#LETITIA.
How do you feel, dear?
#JONATHAN.
Fine;... I think I'll go in the house and read this. I'm glad it isn't true.
#NATHANIEL.
It's the story of his delirium. I thought it would interest him - and relieve him.
#LETITIA.
Has John gone?
#NATHANIEL.
Only for a stroll - the doctor's orders.
#LETITIA.
Well?
#NATHANIEL.
Well?
#LETITIA.
Sit down.
#NATHANIEL.
In John's chair?
#LETITIA.
If you wish.
#NATHANIEL.
John's chair! The throne of the head of the family! Well?
#LETITIA.
Nathaniel dear, you are making John very unhappy.
#NATHANIEL.
And John has made me very unhappy, dearest Aunt Letty.
#LETITIA.
The feeling at the dinner table was almost unbearable tonight. There we sat strained and silent.
#NATHANIEL.
I am sorry. I try to avoid meals with John as much as possible.
#LETITIA.
You've been here eight weeks and John and I know nothing of you. For me it is enough that you are here; but John is the head of the family and he feels that you ought to treat him with greater deference.
#NATHANIEL.
It is revolting to me to have a tsar in the family.
#LETITIA.
Your father and your father's father and grandfather were rulers of the Clay family.
#NATHANIEL.
I don't question that.
#LETITIA.
You can't change John.
#NATHANIEL.
I don't want to change John.
#LETITIA.
Then why not tell him something about yourself?
#NATHANIEL.
It is none of John's affairs how or why I live. It is none of his affair how or why or when I shall marry Mlle. Perrault.
#LETITIA.
Perhaps not.
#NATHANIEL.
When I tell him anything, Aunt Letty, it will be one thing - I have stayed here because I love Jonathan, because he needs me. And I have listened to the boy's fears and to his hopes as they came out of his poor tortured little soul in his delirium. I have watched him during his convalescence, and I see in him a growing man in prison. John sees in him only the potential head of the family; but he is my flesh and blood as much as he is John's and I intend to set him free.
#LETITIA.
My beloved Nathaniel, John will not give Jonathan up to you.
#NATHANIEL.
I don't want Jonathan unless he wants to come to me, but I do want Jonathan's freedom.
#LETITIA.
Isn't he a bit young to have freedom.
#NATHANIEL.
Aunt Letitia, I don't mean a silly license. - I mean freedom. If you are cultivating a peach - tree you don't expect oranges on it even if it could wish to be an orange tree, but you can help to make it bear better peaches. Jonathan isn't a mechanical business person. His bent is in another direction.
#LETITIA.
What are you going to do?
#NATHANIEL.
Frankly, I do not know. All I know now is that I shall stay here until I find a plan.
#JONATHAN.
Where is Uncle John?
#NATHANIEL.
He has gone for a stroll.
#LETITIA.
What do you want, my dear?
#JONATHAN.
Uncle John sent word that he wanted to see me here at 7:30. It's 7:29 now.
#NATHANIEL.
John will be on time - count sixty slowly -
#LETITIA.
Did you have a pleasant stroll?
#JOHN GALE.
I wasn't walking.
#LETITIA.
I shall go into the house, I think.
#JOHN GALE.
No, Aunt Letitia, I would rather you'd wait, if you please. Nathaniel, will you sit down?
#NATHANIEL.
Certainly. - Where?
#JOHN GALE.
Would you like my chair?
#NATHANIEL.
Thank you.
#JOHN GALE.
Jonathan, sit down. Jonathan, I've sent for you because I want to talk to you seriously.
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir.
#NATHANIEL.
Do you think the boy is strong enough?
#JOHN GALE.
The doctor told me today that he would be quite equal to it... Eight weeks ago, Jonathan, you made an effort to run away from your home, because I punished you. In your foolish defiance of all family authority you suffered a fall that might have resulted in a lasting and serious injury. Fortunately you have recovered fully from the result of your fall.
#NATHANIEL.
Excuse me, John, but all of us know this.
#JOHN GALE.
One moment, please, Nathaniel... I have now arranged that you begin your preparation for your life work immediately. You will leave for Somerset School the day after tomorrow.
#JONATHAN.
Uncle John, I don't want to go to Somerset School.
#JOHN GALE.
You will leave for Somerset day after tomorrow. Good night, Jonathan.
#NATHANIEL.
Why Somerset?
#JOHN GALE.
Good night, Jonathan.
#NATHANIEL.
Jonathan will never go to Somerset School.
#JOHN GALE.
Nathaniel, you forfeited your rights in the family councils when you ran away from home seventeen years ago.
#NATHANIEL.
This boy will run away again and again and I mean to save him from what I have suffered, if I can.
#JOHN GALE.
Nathaniel, by what right do you attempt to interfere with my decisions?
#NATHANIEL.
By the right of blood and understanding.
#JOHN GALE.
Blood and understanding? Where were you when Emily had to leave her husband and brought her boy into my home? Where were you when Emily died? I took Emily in and I took her boy in. As head of the family it was my duty to do so and as head of the family it is my duty to see that the boy is brought up in the best traditions of the family.
#NATHANIEL.
John, you can't force this boy into a mold. boy of fourteen doesn't know his mind... Do you know what Jonathan wants to be?
#NATHANIEL.
Yes, a writer of plays, a theatre director, and an actor.
#JOHN GALE.
Imagine!... And I suppose you encouraged him.
#NATHANIEL.
No, but I didn't discourage him. The selection was wide enough for him to find some lasting life work.
#JOHN GALE.
He never told me he wanted to be an actor.
#NATHANIEL.
Oh, my brother, every growing boy has a deep secret wish that he cannot bring himself to disclose! As you know, I always wanted to be a writer, but most of all I wanted to be a left - handed base ball pitcher. And although I'm irretrievably right handed I used to practice - religiously - pitching with my left hand.
#JOHN GALE.
That was juvenile foolishness.
#NATHANIEL.
Yes, but it was genuine. What am I now? I am going to tell you, John - by and by. First, we must dispose of the boy.
#JOHN GALE.
I shall decide about the boy.
#NATHANIEL.
No, John; the boy must decide for himself.
#JOHN GALE.
He'd decide to be an actor.
#NATHANIEL.
If he did, what of it?
#JOHN GALE.
I want members of my family to do useful work.
#NATHANIEL.
What is useful work? An actor serves his purpose just as a plumber or lawyer serves his... The only difference is that all of us are not plumbers or lawyers while all of us are actors. Yes, John, we're all playing something - you are playing at head of the family, I'm -
#JOHN GALE.
Still I do not regard acting as a worth - while or lucrative profession.
#NATHANIEL.
You never know, John... Five generations ago the Clays were respectable carpenters. They weren't wealthy and they gave no promise of becoming wealthy. Then suddenly our revered ancestor became a successful maker of cypress drain pipes - sewer pipes, I think we used to call them! The family fortunes were founded!! Our ancestor bought a high hat and the esteem of his neighbors. Cypress was in time replaced by pottery. Conduits for wires and terra cotta building materials were added to our achievements and then in your régime superfine sewers became a specialty.
#JOHN GALE.
Every kind of concrete work!
#NATHANIEL.
I beg your pardon! Concrete sewers and other concrete things. - Such is the foundation of the family.
#JOHN GALE.
You are evidently ashamed of our business.
#NATHANIEL.
Not at all, but I cannot consider the manufacturing of sewers a greater achievement than acting.
#JOHN GALE.
Nathaniel, are you an actor?
#NATHANIEL.
No.
#JOHN GALE.
What are you?
#NATHANIEL.
For the present I am Jonathan's uncle.
#JOHN GALE.
You have nothing to do with Jonathan.
#NATHANIEL.
The boy is not going to Somerset School.
#JOHN GALE.
Nathaniel, I shall not tolerate your interference. Now I must ask you to leave this house.
#NATHANIEL.
What?
#LETITIA.
John... Nathaniel... my boys, it isn't my way to interfere; but please for my sake, for your mother's sake - think what you're doing.
#JOHN GALE.
I have thought, Aunt Letitia. I can not allow this boy's life to be ruined as Emily's and Henry's and Nathaniel's were.
#NATHANIEL.
Ruined? John, I'll tell you how ruined my life has been and I'll tell you in terms you'll understand. My income last year was over $350,000!
#JOHN GALE.
Are you acting now?
#NATHANIEL.
Yes, I'm acting - I'm acting in terms that you will understand... You know that I'm your brother Nathaniel. Do you know who else I am? I am a writer and a playwright and a director in the United Baking Company and a stockholder in the National Munitions Company - munitions, John; think of it, millions, millions in them - and I'm willing and eager to take Emily's boy and educate him in the way he wants to live his life.
#JOHN GALE.
What are these heroics?
#NATHANIEL.
I mean what I say. If need be I shall use brute force, financial force or any kind of force to free Jonathan from the misery that I endured in this house.
#JOHN GALE.
You had everything you wanted.
#NATHANIEL.
Everything except freedom to think my own thoughts. John, some people are like reinforced concrete. Someone builds the iron frame and the wooden molds, then pours the cement and when it has hardened, the molds are removed and lo, you have a monolith - a solid unchangeable stone.
#JOHN GALE.
You talk very well, Nathaniel, but I shall insist upon bringing up my sister's child in my way.
#NATHANIEL.
Would you have him run away as I did?
#JOHN GALE.
He will never run away again. He has had his lesson.
#JONATHAN.
May I speak to you, Uncle John?
#JOHN GALE.
What are you doing with that suit case?
#JONATHAN.
I'm going away.
#JOHN GALE.
Who gave you permission?
#JONATHAN.
Nobody... I've been thinking since a little while ago and at first I thought I'd run away again; but that wouldn't be quite fair - so I came to tell you.
#JOHN GALE.
Take that suit case back into the house.
#JONATHAN.
No, sir! I'm going and nobody can keep me here unless they tie me.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, I'll tell you one thing - if you leave this house without my permission I'll cut you off without a penny and you'll never be allowed to come back again.
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir. I know that; but I'm going and I came to tell you good - bye.
#JOHN GALE.
Very well. You've made your choice - and I never want to see you again as long as you live. Good - bye, Jonathan. Good - bye, Nathaniel.
#LETITIA.
John, don't say things you'll regret. Jonathan doesn't mean what he's saying.
#JONATHAN.
Yes'm, I do mean what I say.
#JOHN GALE.
Good night.
#LETITIA.
Boys, you are so hot - headed - so much alike...
#NATHANIEL.
You dear, you have always been content to compromise while we two must go our own ways or not at all. You go to John. Help him as you can. He's not a bad man - he's just a structure of reinforced concrete. You love John and he in his way loves you. Go to John and comfort his outraged authority.
#LETITIA.
I'm sorry things have turned out this way. Good night, my dears. Wait until morning if you can, my darling Nathaniel.
#NATHANIEL.
Now you've done it!
#JONATHAN.
I couldn't help it.
#NATHANIEL.
What are you going to do?
#JONATHAN.
I don't know... They say there's plenty of work on farms.
#NATHANIEL.
You can't write if you work on a farm.
#JONATHAN.
I can earn some more money and save. Other boys have worked their way through school and college. I can do that.
#NATHANIEL.
Of course - that is a way out of it. Yes... of course... The new moon... They say if you make a wish on the new moon it will come true.
#JONATHAN.
You have to see it over your right shoulder.
#NATHANIEL.
You saw it over your right shoulder.
#JONATHAN.
I don't believe that, do you?
#NATHANIEL.
Well, suppose it were true, what would you wish?
#JONATHAN.
You mean for right away?
#NATHANIEL.
Yes.
#JONATHAN.
I'd wish to be with you.
#NATHANIEL.
More than anything?
#JONATHAN.
Yes, sir.
#NATHANIEL.
More than being a writer or a theatre director or an actor?
#JONATHAN.
Oh, yes, I'm too young to start right away. I have to have an education first.
#NATHANIEL.
Suppose that wish couldn't be, then what would you wish?
#JONATHAN.
That you'd write me long letters and let me write you long letters. I'd better be going now.
#NATHANIEL.
Aren't you going to tell John and Aunt Letitia good - bye?
#JONATHAN.
No, sir. I don't think I'd better. Uncle John doesn't care and Aunt Letitia will understand.
#NATHANIEL.
Yes, she always understands somehow.
#JONATHAN.
Good - bye, sir.
#NATHANIEL.
Jonathan, suppose we go away together. I'm not wanted and you're not wanted.
#JONATHAN.
You're going to Paris to marry Mlle. Perrault!
#NATHANIEL.
Would you let me be your father, Jonathan?
#JONATHAN.
Sir?
#NATHANIEL.
You shall go to the schools where you will find the work you want... Will you be my son?
#JONATHAN.
Do you like me that much?
#NATHANIEL.
I like you more than that much. You'll get some long trousers and we'll plan and plan. Suppose we run away together.
#JONATHAN.
Do you think we ought to leave some word, Uncle Nathaniel?
#NATHANIEL.
Of course. How stupid of me.
#JONATHAN.
You write it.
#NATHANIEL.
No, we'll both write it.
#JONATHAN.
I don't know what to say. I've only run away once.
#NATHANIEL.
So have I.
#JONATHAN.
Did you ever run away?
#NATHANIEL.
Yes - when I was eighteen.
#JONATHAN.
Oh!
#NATHANIEL.
The message ought to be short.
#JONATHAN.
Why did you run away?
#NATHANIEL.
I wanted to write.
#JONATHAN.
You did!
#NATHANIEL.
Didn't you know I ran away?
#JONATHAN.
No, sir; they never would tell me what became of you.
#NATHANIEL.
They didn't know.
#JONATHAN.
How could you keep it from them?
#NATHANIEL.
I changed my name - Mr. Alexander Jefferson, Sr! What shall I say?
#JONATHAN.
I can't think... Did Uncle John lock you in?
#NATHANIEL.
No, I just ran away.
#JONATHAN.
How long did it take you to make up your mind to go?
#NATHANIEL.
I thought about it first when I was twelve. My father was still living then.
#JONATHAN.
Did you go to Somerset School?
#NATHANIEL.
Yes - for three years.
#JONATHAN.
What did you do after you ran away?
#NATHANIEL.
I had a very hard time, my boy - at first. I worked at anything I could get, then I got into a newspaper office, then I wrote "autobiographies" of famous men.
#JONATHAN.
I thought you had to write your own autobiography -
#NATHANIEL.
Not nowadays. Then I wrote some successful short stories, then some very successful long ones - and now I am independent; but it took me ten bitter years to make my first success... What shall I write here?
#JONATHAN.
I never could think of things to say when I was going away.
#NATHANIEL.
Neither could I.
#JONATHAN.
Don't you think "good - bye" would be enough?
#NATHANIEL.
Capital... "Good - Bye - Nathaniel." Now you sign it.
#JONATHAN.
"Jonathan."... Maybe we ought to put a line under it so Aunt Letitia won't feel so bad.
#NATHANIEL.
Dear Aunt Letitia will understand. She is the blessed kind who always does. Now, where shall we put it?... On John's chair, and maybe he'll understand too.
#JONATHAN.
Don't you want to pack your things?
#NATHANIEL.
I'll wire for them. On second thought, I'll ask Aunt Letitia to send them.
#JONATHAN.
Hello, Susan.
#SUSAN.
Jonathan, I just saw Miss Letitia and she was crying... What's the matter?
#JONATHAN.
I'm going away, Susan.
#SUSAN.
Where are you going?
#JONATHAN.
I'm going with Uncle Nathaniel. I'm going to be his son. And I'm going to a fine prep. school and learn to write and do what I like.
#SUSAN.
When are you coming back?
#JONATHAN.
I don't know. When I'm older maybe.
#SUSAN.
Can't we write any more songs?
#JONATHAN.
I'll send some words to you in letters.
#SUSAN.
Will you write every week?
#JONATHAN.
Yes... Will you?
#SUSAN.
Yes. I wish I was going, too.
#JONATHAN.
So do I.
#SUSAN.
Maybe I'll come to see you graduate.
#JONATHAN.
That will be fine!
#SUSAN.
Good - bye, Jonathan.
#JONATHAN.
Good - bye, Susan.
#SUSAN.
I can hardly wait until you graduate.
#JONATHAN.
Neither can I... Good - bye.
#NATHANIEL.
On third thought, I decided to wire for my things.
#SUSAN.
Good - bye, Mr. Nathaniel. I hope you'll have a nice time.
#NATHANIEL.
Good - bye, Susan.
#JONATHAN.
Good - bye, Susan.
#SUSAN.
Send me some picture postcards, Jonathan.
#JONATHAN.
I will.
#NATHANIEL.
Don't you want to make your wish on the new moon, Jonathan?
#JONATHAN.
I don't know what to wish now. The only one I could think of has come true.
#NATHANIEL.
Good... come, my boy.
#JONATHAN.
I'll write a long letter to Susan Sample every week.
#NATHANIEL.
You can write her a long letter from New York.
#JONATHAN.
And I can send her picture postcards from every place we go to.
