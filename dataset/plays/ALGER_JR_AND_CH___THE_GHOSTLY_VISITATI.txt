#FLORA.
Oh, yes, mother believes in ghosts, and haunted houses, and all those things, and I suppose that, as a dutiful daughter, I ought to do the same; but I haven’t very much faith in them.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
Perhaps, if you had had any experience in that direction, you might feel differently about the matter. I never believed in haunted houses till I visited Charlie Baldwin, my former chum, last summer.
#FANNY.
Do tell us all about it. I should like to hear a real nice ghost story.
#MRS. LAWRENCE.
I think we’d better wait till daylight before listening to a story of that character.
#FANNY.
No, it’s just the time for it; it is cold and dark outside. We can more easily imagine the events real. So go on, please, Mr. Percival.
#MR.
P.—But my story is not a ghost story at all, and there is really very little to tell. But we heard strange noises for which we could not account. For instance, a door, which led from the house into the shed, had swollen so that it was difficult to shut it, and whenever it was opened and shut it creaked most musically, so that it could be heard in all the lower rooms. One evening we were seated at the tea - table, when we heard the door creaking. “Who is that coming in?” asked Mrs. Baldwin. “It is very strange,” answered Charlie; “I am sure I closed and locked that door not ten minutes ago.”—“Suppose we go out and see what it is,” said Mr. Baldwin. “It certainly had a natural sound.” We all went out in a body, and behold! the door was shut and fastened and everything all right.
#FANNY.
Did you hear any other noises while you were there?
#MR. PERCIVAL.
Oh, yes, we frequently heard footsteps going up and down stairs after we had gone to bed. Sometimes we could hear the chairs moved about in the rooms below. And once, I remember, we heard a terrific noise, as if the side of the house had fallen in. But the next morning everything seemed as usual, and we laughed about the matter.
#FANNY.
But were you not startled?
#MR. PERCIVAL.
Well, I cannot say I should like to live in that house long.
#MRS. LEMMY.
If you had heard all these things, Flora, don’t you think you would have faith to believe that there are some strange things which one cannot account for?
#FANNY.
Oh, yes; “seeing is believing,” as the old saying is, and I suppose hearing is believing also. But I must ask you to excuse me now, Mr. Percival, as I have a letter to write, which must go out by the next mail.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
Though we are sorry to lose your company, we will grant you leave of absence for a short time.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
The turn which the conversation took just now suggested a plan to me, which, with your permission, I should like to carry out.
#MRS. LEMMY.
What is it?
#MR. PERCIVAL.
You are, of course, aware that I love your daughter, and would gladly marry her. She has rejected me, but still I think she likes me as well or better than any one else. Now, cannot I, by stratagem, bring her to consent to a marriage with me?
#MRS. LEMMY.
I wish you might do so, and will gladly assist you in any way I can. But what is your plan?
#MR. PERCIVAL.
I thought I might, with your assistance, personate the spirit of her former husband, and appear to her to - night while this conversation is fresh in her mind, and warn her, if she wishes him to rest in peace, that she must marry a certain Alfred Percival, who will make her a good husband.
#MRS. LEMMY.
It is a capital idea. I think the conversation seemed to affect her considerably. Suppose you come here at ten o’clock to - night. I will remain up, and arrange your ghostship.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
Very well, I will do so. And I believe I will go now, as I have some preparations to make.
#FANNY.
There’s something going on, I’m sure, but what it can be isn’t quite clear to me. Mother has asked me half - a - dozen times if it wasn’t bed - time; and yet she, herself, hasn’t made any preparation toward retiring. I shall lie down, with my clothes on, ready for any emergency. There’s no danger of sleep overtaking me. I feel as if I shouldn’t sleep any at all to - night.
#FANNY.
Hark! what noise is that?
#MRS. LEMMY.
I am glad you are so punctual. Everything is in readiness. I just looked into Flora’s room and found she was fast asleep.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
Where shall I go to arrange my costume?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Hush! you mustn’t speak so loud, as her door is ajar. Come with me, and we’ll soon have you fitted out.
#MRS. LEMMY.
It will never do to allow your features to show so plainly. You are only Alfred Percival, after all. Flora would recognize you at once.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
Suppose I put the sheet over my head? Is that any improvement?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Yes; but still I think your features would betray you. Let me think a moment. I have it. I will get Mr. Willis’s wig; that will be just the thing.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
So it will. That’s a good idea.
#MRS. LEMMY.
That’s capital. Now stoop a little, and no one would be likely to recognize you, particularly if they had just waked.
#FANNY.
Who are you?
#MR. PERCIVAL.
Flora Willis, I am the spirit of your dead husband.
#FANNY.
But why do you appear to me in this way? If you are really he, why should you come to me at the dead of night?
#MR. PERCIVAL.
We, who are tenants of another sphere, mingle not with mortals; and it is only when all eyes are closed in slumber that we are permitted to walk the earth.
#FANNY.
But what is your object in coming?
#MR. PERCIVAL.
I come to warn and advise you. You are young, and, I know, cherish my memory fondly; but I feel sure that you would be happier and enjoy life more, if you should marry again.
#FANNY.
But who is there I should be happy with?
#MR. PERCIVAL.
You have many suitors; choose among them.
#FANNY.
I’m afraid they want my money more than myself, and such a union would cause a lifetime of misery.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
You are mistaken. There is Alfred Percival. He would be a kind husband. It is my wish that you marry him. Promise me that you will do so.
#FANNY.
I cannot promise; it is too sudden.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
Think of it, then. One week from to - night I will visit you again.
#FANNY.
Well, that’s curious. I’ve heard ghost stories of almost every description, but never before did I hear of a ghost making love. For, though he intended to personate a spirit, he certainly spoke of himself. And I suppose he is congratulating himself on having completely deceived me. I’d like to know what he and mother are saying about it. And why can’t I? They are only in the next room.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Then you think she did not suspect you?
#MR. PERCIVAL.
Apparently not. She appeared quite startled at first, but soon regained her composure.
#MRS. LEMMY.
I suppose it would be better not to allude to the subject to - morrow.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
Not on any account. That would tend to arouse her suspicions. I wouldn’t have her know that I took part in the stratagem.
#MRS. LEMMY.
And what do you expect will come of it? Of course she would not be likely to come forward and tell you that she was willing to marry you, even if she felt favorably inclined toward you.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
I think I shall call upon her to - morrow, and then I shall be governed entirely by circumstances.
#FANNY.
So Mr. Percival is going to call on me to - day. It is quite fortunate I happened to overhear his plans. I suppose he will repeat that momentous question again, and I’ve about made up my mind to accept him. Then the matter will be settled, and I shan’t be worried any more by his importunities. Besides, he is a person of good standing, and I don’t know as I love any one else more; and I don’t think he is after my money.
#FANNY.
Ah, Mr. Percival, I was just thinking of you, and you know the old saying, “If you think of the angels, you’ll soon hear the rustling of their wings.”
#MR. PERCIVAL.
Excuse me, but I never heard it expressed in that way before. It has been told me in this wise: His Satanic Majesty is always near when you’re talking of him.
#FANNY.
I must say my version is more complimentary than yours.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
So do I, and I draw encouragement from that fact. If you were thinking of me, I take it as a favorable omen, and shall consider that I am not so disagreeable to you as I feared I was.
#FANNY.
Oh, by the way, Mr. Percival, I had quite an adventure last night. I saw a real, bona fide ghost.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
Did you really?
#FANNY.
Yes; as I was quietly dozing, a tall figure, clad in white, stalked into my room, and when I opened my eyes I beheld him close beside me, and looking down upon my face.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
And what did he say?
#FANNY.
Oh, he pretended to be the spirit of my former husband, and said I must marry again.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
Why will you not heed his advice? Let me, too, add my solicitations. Marry me, Flora, and you shall never have cause to regret it.
#FANNY.
Why, Mr. Percival, how much you remind me of my last night’s visitor! The expression of your face, and the lines about your mouth—all but the white sheet and wig.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
I see that you know all; but grant me a favorable answer, and I shall be well satisfied.
#FANNY.
I suppose I ought to, since it is decided on high authority that it is right and proper I should do so. In that way, if in no other, I shall convince you that I am not afraid of ghosts, if I promise to marry one.
#MR. PERCIVAL.
And I shall feel well repaid for personating one by the promised reward. Henceforth I shall look with kindness on shadowy apparitions, feeling that, in other cases as well as my own, even ghosts may be of some practical use.
