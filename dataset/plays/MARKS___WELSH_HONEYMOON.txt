#VAVASOUR.
Kats, Kats, mind ye come home soon from Pally Hughes's!
#CATHERINE.
Aye, I'm no wantin' to go, but I must. Good - by!
#VAVASOUR.
Good - by! Kats, ye mind about comin' home? Kats, Kats darlin', I cannot let you go without tellin' ye that - Kats, do ye hear?
#VAVASOUR.
Dear, dear, she's gone, an' I may never see her again, an' I'm to blame, an' she didn't know whatever that in the night - The devil, it can't be comin' for her already?
#HANK.
Catherine, Vavasour, are ye in?
#VAVASOUR.
Aye, come in, whoever ye are.
#MRS. MORGAN.
Where's Catherine?
#VAVASOUR.
She's gone, Mrs. Morgan.
#MRS. MORGAN.
Gone? Are ye no goin'? Not goin' to Pally Hughes's on Allhallows' Eve?
#VAVASOUR.
Nay, I'm no feelin' well.
#MRS. MORGAN.
Aye, I see ye're ill?
#VAVASOUR.
Well, I'm not ill, but I'm not well. Not well at all, Mrs. Morgan.
#MRS. MORGAN.
We'll miss ye, but I must hurryin' on whatever; I'm late now. Good - night!
#VAVASOUR.
Good - night! Ye've no cause to come here! Ye old death's head, get away!
#HOWELL HOWELL.
Well, man, what ails ye; did ye think I was a ghost? Well, man, are ye crazy, keepin' me out in the rain that way? Where's Catherine?
#VAVASOUR.
She's at P - p - p - ally Hughes's.
#HOWELL HOWELL.
Are ye no goin'?
#VAVASOUR.
Nay, Howell Howell, I'm no goin'.
#HOWELL HOWELL.
An' dressed in your best? What's the matter? Have ye been drinkin' whatever?
#VAVASOUR.
Drinkin'! I'd better be drinkin' when neighbors go walkin' round the village on Allhallows' Eve with their heads done up in white.
#HOWELL HOWELL.
Aye, well, I can't be spoilin' the new hat I have, that I cannot. A finer beaver there has never been in my shop.
#VAVASOUR.
Aye, grand, grand, man!
#HOWELL HOWELL.
What are ye gazin' at the clock for?
#VAVASOUR.
I'm no lookin' at anything.
#HOWELL HOWELL.
Well, indeed, I must be goin', or I shall be late at Pally Hughes's. Good - night.
#VAVASOUR.
Good - night. 'Tis ten now. Ten, eleven, twelve; that's three hours left, 'tis; nay, nay, 'tis only two hours left, after all, an' then -
#EILIR MORRIS.
Boo! Whoo - o - o!
#VAVASOUR.
The devil!
#EILIR MORRIS.
Uch, the pity, Uncle! I didn't think, an' ye're ill!
#VAVASOUR.
Tut, tut, 'tis no matter, an' I'm not ill - not ill at all, but Eilir, lad, ye're kin, an' - could ye promise never to tell?
#EILIR MORRIS.
Aye, Uncle, I'm kin, an' I promise. Tell on. What is it? Are ye sick?
#VAVASOUR.
Uch, lad, I'm not sick!
#EILIR MORRIS.
Well, what ails ye?
#VAVASOUR.
'Tis Allhallows' Eve an' -
#EILIR MORRIS.
Aren't ye goin' to Pally Hughes's?
#VAVASOUR.
Ow, the devil, goin' to Pally Hughes's while 'tis drawin' nearer an' nearer an' - Ow! 'Tis the night when Catherine must go.
#EILIR MORRIS.
When Aunt Kats must go! What do you mean?
#VAVASOUR.
She'll be dead to - night at twelve.
#EILIR MORRIS.
Dead at twelve? But she's at Pally Hughes's. Does she know it?
#VAVASOUR.
No, but I do, an' to think I've been unkind to her! I've tried this year to make up for it, but 'tis no use, lad; one year'll never make up for ten of harsh words, whatever. Ow!
#EILIR MORRIS.
Well, ye've not been good to her, Uncle, that's certain; but ye've been different the past year.
#VAVASOUR.
Aye, but a year'll not do any good, an' she'll be dyin' at twelve to - night. Ow! I've turned to the scriptures to see what it says about a man an' his wife, but it'll no do, no do, no do!
#EILIR MORRIS.
Have ye been drinkin', Uncle?
#VAVASOUR.
Drinkin'!
#EILIR MORRIS.
Well, indeed, no harm, but, Uncle, I cannot understand why Aunt Kats's goin' an' where.
#VAVASOUR.
She's goin' to leave me, lad; 'tis Allhallows' Eve whatever! An' she'll be dyin' at twelve. Aye, a year ago things were so bad between us, on Allhallows' Eve I went down to the church porch shortly before midnight to see whether the spirit of your Aunt Kats would be called an' -
#EILIR MORRIS.
Uncle, 'twas fair killin' her!
#VAVASOUR.
I wanted to see whether she would live the twelve months out. An' as I was leanin' against the church wall, hopin', aye, lad, prayin' to see her spirit there, an' know she'd die, I saw somethin' comin' 'round the corner with white over its head.
#EILIR MORRIS.
Ow - w!
#VAVASOUR.
It drew nearer an' nearer, an' when it came in full view of the church porch, it paused, it whirled around like that, an' sped away with the shroud flappin' about its feet, an' the rain beatin' down on its white hood.
#EILIR MORRIS.
Ow - w!
#VAVASOUR.
But there was time to see that it was the spirit of Catherine, an' I was glad because my wicked prayer had been answered, an' because with Catherine dyin' the next Allhallows', we'd have to live together only the year out.
#EILIR MORRIS.
Hush, what's that?
#VAVASOUR.
'Tis voices whatever.
#EILIR MORRIS.
They're singin' a song at Pally Hughes's. Ni awn adre bawb dan ganu, Saif ein hiaith safo Cymru, Bydded undeb a brawdgarwch Ini'n gwlwm diogelwch, Felly canwn er hyfrydwch, Sweetly sang beside a fountain, Mona's maiden on that mountain, When wilt thou, from war returning, In whose breast true love is burning, Come and change to joy my mourning,
#VAVASOUR.
Aye, they're happy, an' Kats does not know. I went home that night, lad, thinkin' 'twas the last year we'd have to live together, an', considerin' as 'twas the last year, I might just as well try to be decent an' kind. An' when I reached home, Catherine was up waitin' for me an' spoke so pleasantly, an' we sat down an' had a long talk - just like the days when we were courtin'.
#EILIR MORRIS.
Did she know, Uncle?
#VAVASOUR.
Nay, how could she know. But she seems queer, - as if she felt the evil comin'. Well, indeed, each day was sweeter than the one before, an' we were man an' wife in love an' kindness at last, but all the while I was thinkin' of that figure by the churchyard. Lad, lad, ye'll be marryin' before long, - be good to her, lad, be good to her!
#VAVASOUR.
An' here 'tis Allhallows' Eve again, an' the best year of my life is past, an' she must die in an hour an' a half. Ow, ow! It has all come from my own evil heart an' evil wish. Think, lad, prayin' for her callin'; aye, goin' there, hopin' ye'd see her spirit, an' countin' on her death!
#EILIR MORRIS.
Aye, Uncle, 'tis bad, an' I've no word to say to ye for comfort. I recollect well the story Granny used to tell about Christmas Pryce; 'twas somethin' the same whatever. An' there was Betty Williams was called a year ago, an' is dead now; an' there was Silvan Griffith, an' Geffery, his friend, an' Silvan had just time to dig Geffery's grave an' then his own, too, by its side, an' they was buried the same day an' hour.
#VAVASOUR.
Ow - w - w!
#EILIR MORRIS.
Uch, she'll be taken there!
#VAVASOUR.
Aye, an', Eilir, she was loath to go to Pally's, but I could not tell her the truth.
#EILIR MORRIS.
Are ye not goin', Uncle?
#VAVASOUR.
Nay, lad, I cannot go. I'm fair crazy. I'll just be stayin' home, waitin' for them to bring her back. Ow - w - w!
#EILIR MORRIS.
Tut, tut, Uncle, I'm sorry. I'll just see for ye what they're doin'.
#VAVASOUR.
Can ye see her, lad?
#EILIR MORRIS.
Dear, they've a grand display, raisins an' buns, an' spices an' biscuits -
#VAVASOUR.
But your Aunt Kats?
#EILIR MORRIS.
Aye, an' a grand fire, an' a tub with apples in it an' -
#VAVASOUR.
But Catherine?
#EILIR MORRIS.
Aye, she was there near the fire, an' just as I turned, they blew the lights out.
#VAVASOUR.
Blew the lights out! Uch, she'll be taken there whatever!
#EILIR MORRIS.
They're tellin' stories in the dark.
#VAVASOUR.
Go back again an' tell what ye can see of your Aunt Kats, lad.
#EILIR MORRIS.
Aye.
#VAVASOUR.
Find where she's sittin', lad - make certain of that.
#EILIR MORRIS.
They're throwin' nuts on the fire -
#VAVASOUR.
Is she there?
#EILIR MORRIS.
I'm thinkin' she is, but old Pally Hughes was just throwin' a nut on the fire an' -
#VAVASOUR.
'Tis no matter about Pally Hughes whatever, but your Aunt Kats, did -
#EILIR MORRIS.
There was only the light of the fire; I did not see her, but I'll go again.
#VAVASOUR.
Watch for her nut an' see does it burn brightly.
#EILIR MORRIS.
Aye.
#VAVASOUR.
Mind, I'm wantin' to know what she's doin'.
#VAVASOUR.
Catherine, is it really ye!
#CATHERINE.
Yiss, yiss, 'twas dull at Pally's - very dull. My nut didn't burn very brightly, an' - an' - well, indeed, my feet was wet, an' I feared takin' a cold.
#VAVASOUR.
Yiss, yiss, 'tis better for ye here, dearie.
#VAVASOUR.
Did ye have a fine time at Pally's?
#CATHERINE.
Aye, 'twas gay an' fine an' - an' - yiss, yiss, so 'twas an' so 'twasn't.
#VAVASOUR.
A quarter past eleven, uch! Katy, do ye recall Pastor Evan's sermon, the one he preached last New Year?
#CATHERINE.
Sixteen minutes after eleven - yiss - yiss -
#VAVASOUR.
Well, Catherine, do -
#CATHERINE.
Yiss, yiss, I said I did whatever. 'Twas about inheritin' the grace of life together.
#VAVASOUR.
Kats, dear, wasn't he sayin' that love is eternal, an' that - a man - an' - an' - his wife was lovin' for - for -
#CATHERINE.
Aye, lad, for ever - lastin' life! Uch, what have I done?
#VAVASOUR.
Half after eleven! Yiss, yiss, dear, didn't he say that the Lord was mindful of us - of our difficulties, an' our temptations an' our mistakes?
#CATHERINE.
Aye, an' our mistakes. Ow, ow, ow, but a half hour's left!
#VAVASOUR.
Do ye think, dearie, that if a man were to - to - uch! - be unkind to his wife - an' was sorry an' his wife - his wife dies, that he'd be - be -
#CATHERINE.
Aye, I'm thinkin' so. An', lad dear, do ye think if anythin' was to happen to ye to - night, - yiss, this night, - that ye'd take any grudge against me away with ye?
#VAVASOUR.
Happen to me, Catherine?
#CATHERINE.
Uch, dearie, what is it, what is it, what ails ye?
#VAVASOUR.
Nothin', nothin' at all. Ow, the devil, 'tis twenty minutes before twelve whatever!
#CATHERINE.
Lad, lad, what is it?
#VAVASOUR.
'Tis nothin', nothin' at all - 'tis - ow! - 'tis just a little pain across me.
#CATHERINE.
Vavasour, lad dear, is that the wind in the chimney? Put your arm about me an' hold fast.
#VAVASOUR.
Ow - ten minutes!
#CATHERINE.
Is that a step at the door?
#VAVASOUR.
'Tis goin' to strike now in a minute.
#CATHERINE.
Five minutes before twelve!
#VAVASOUR.
Uch, the toad, the serpent!
#CATHERINE.
Dear God, he's goin' now!
#VAVASOUR.
Uch, the devil! Uch, the gates of hell!
#CATHERINE.
Uch!
#VAVASOUR.
The devil!
#CATHERINE.
Lad, dear!
#VAVASOUR.
Kats, are ye here, really here?
#CATHERINE.
Am I here? Tut, lad, are ye here?
#VAVASOUR.
Yiss, that is are we both here?
#CATHERINE.
Did ye think I wasn't goin' to be?
#VAVASOUR.
No - o, not that, only I thought, I thought ye was goin' to - to - faint, Kats. I thought ye looked like it, Kats.
#CATHERINE.
Uch, I'm a bad, bad woman, aye, Vavasour Jones, a bad woman!
#VAVASOUR.
Nay, Kats, nay!
#CATHERINE.
Ye cannot believe what I must tell ye. Lad, a year ago this night I went to the church porch, hopin', aye, prayin', ye'd be called, that I'd see your spirit walkin'.
#VAVASOUR.
Catherine, ye did that!
#CATHERINE.
Aye, lad, I did, I'd been so unhappy with the quarrelin' an' hard words. I could think of nothin' but gettin' rid of them.
#VAVASOUR.
That was bad, very bad indeed!
#CATHERINE.
An' then, lad, when I reached the church corner an' saw your spirit was really there, really called, an' I knew ye'd not live the year out, I was frightened, but uch! lad, I was glad, I was indeed.
#VAVASOUR.
Catherine, 'twas a terrible thing to do!
#CATHERINE.
Yiss, I know it now, but I didn't then. I was hard - hearted, an' I was weak with longin' to escape from it all. An' when I ran home I was frightened, but uch! lad, I was glad, too, an' now it hurts me so to think of it. Can you no comfort me?
#VAVASOUR.
Aye, well, I could, but, Kats, 'twas such a terrible thing to do!
#CATHERINE.
Yiss, yiss, ye'll never be able to forgive me, I'm thinkin'. An' then when ye came in from the lodge, ye spoke so pleasantly to me that I was troubled. An' now the year through it has grown better an' better, an' I could think of nothin' but lovin' ye, an' wishing' ye to live, an' knowin' I was the cause of your bein' called. Uch, lad, can ye forgive me?
#VAVASOUR.
Aye, I can, none of us is without sin; but, Catherine, it was wrong, aye, aye, 'twas a wicked thing for a woman to do.
#CATHERINE.
An' then to - night, lad, I was expectin' ye to go, knowin' ye couldn't live after twelve, an' ye sittin' there so innocent an' mournful. An' when the time came, I wanted to die myself. Uch!
#VAVASOUR.
No matter, dearie, now. It was wrong in ye, but we're still here, an' it's been a sweet year, yiss, better nor a honeymoon, an' all the years after we'll make better nor this. There, there, Kats, let's have a bit of a wassail to celebrate our Allhallows' honeymoon, shall we?
#CATHERINE.
Yiss, lad, 'twould be fine, but, Vavasour, can ye forgive me, think, lad, for hopin', aye, an' prayin' to see your spirit called, just wishin' that ye'd not live the year out?
#VAVASOUR.
Kats, I can, an' I'm not layin' it up against ye, though 'twas a wicked thing for ye to do - for anyone to do. Now, darlin', fetch the bowl.
#CATHERINE.
Vavasour, how does it happen that the callin' is set aside, an' that ye're really here? Such a thing has not been in Beddgelert in the memory of man.
#VAVASOUR.
I'm not sayin' how it's happened, Kats, but I'm thinkin' 'tis modern times whatever, an' things have changed - aye, indeed, 'tis modern times.
#CATHERINE.
Good! 'Tis lucky 'tis modern times whatever!
