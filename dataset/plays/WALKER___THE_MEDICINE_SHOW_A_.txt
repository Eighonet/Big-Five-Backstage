#GIZ.
'Tis warm as fresh milk.
#GIZ.
'S Hattie Brown came in? She's a mighty good little steam - boat.
#LUT'ER.
She's water - logged.
#GIZ.
She ain't water - logged.
#LUT'ER.
She is.
#GIZ.
She ain't.
#LUT'ER.
She is.
#GIZ.
She ain't.
#GIZ.
'S river raisin'?
#LUT'ER.

#LUT'ER.

#GIZ.
Standin' still?
#LUT'ER.
Uh!
#GIZ.
Gosh! A galler - nipper at noonday!
#GIZ.
An' look at the whelp!
#DR. BEVAN.
What gits me is how they done it.
#DR. BEVAN.
I traded a two - pound catfish for a box of that salve: an' I don't see how they done it.
#GIZ.
Kickapoo?
#DR. BEVAN.
Ye'. Kickapoo Indian Salve. I don't think no Indian never seen it.
#GIZ.
Y'ain't never sure about nothin' these days.
#DR. BEVAN.
I smelled it an' it smelled like ker'sene. I biled it an' it biled over an' burnt up like ker'sene.... I don't think it was nothin' but ker'sene an' lard.
#GIZ.
Reckon 't wuz common ker'sene?
#DR. BEVAN.
I don't know whether 't wuz common ker'sene but I know 't wuz ker'sene.... An' I bet ker'sene'll cure heaps o' troubles if yer use it right.
#GIZ.
That air doctor said the salve ud cure most anything.
#LUT'ER.
Which doctor?
#GIZ.
The man doctor - him with the p'inted musstash.
#LUT'ER.
I seen him take a egg outer Jimmie Weldon's ear - an' Jimmie swore he didn't have no hen in his head.
#DR. BEVAN.
But the lady doctor said it warn't so good - effie - cacious she called it - withouten you took two bottles o' the buildin' up medicine, a box o' the liver pills an' a bottle o' the hair fluid.
#GIZ.
She knowed a lot. She told me just how I felt an' she said she hated to trouble me but I had a internal ailment. An' she said I needed all their medicine jus' like the Indians used it. But I told her I didn't have no money so she said maybe the box o' liver pills would do if I'd bring 'em some corn for their supper. got the liver pills?
#GIZ.
Uh - huh.
#LUT'ER.
Took any?
#GIZ.
Nup, I'm savin' 'em.
#LUT'ER.
What fur?
#GIZ.
Till I'm feelin' sicker'n I am now.
#DR. BEVAN.
Where are they?
#GIZ.
In m' pocket.
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes, sir! It smelled like ker'sene ter me - and ker'sene 't wuz.... Ker'sene'll cure heaps o' things if you use it right.
#DR. BEVAN.
Which pocket yer pills in, Giz?
#GIZ.
M' hip pocket.
#DR. BEVAN.
The Family Medicine Book where I learned ter be a doctor said camphor an' ker'sene an' lard rubbed on flannel an' put on the chest 'ud cure tizic, maybe.
#DR. BEVAN.
An' what ud cure tizic ought ter cure anything, I think.... I'd 'a' cured m' second wife if the winder hadn't blowed out an' she got kivered with snow. Atter that she jus' wheezed until she couldn't wheeze no longer. An' so when I went courtin' m' third wife, I took a stitch in time an' told her about the camphor an' ker'sene an' lard. She's a tur'ble healthy woman. Giz, why'n th' hell don't yer show us yer pills!
#GIZ.
Well - if yer wanner see 'em - here they air.
#DR. BEVAN.
Ker'sene.... Smell 'em, Lut'er.
#LUT'ER.
Uh!
#DR. BEVAN.
Ker'sene!... Well, I guess it's good for the liver, too.... Gimme one, Giz?
#GIZ.
I ain't got so many I can be givin' 'em ter everybody.
#DR. BEVAN.
Jus' one, Giz.
#GIZ.
She said I ought ter take 'em all fer a cure.
#LUT'ER.
What yer got, Giz?
#GIZ.
Mostly a tired feelin' an' sometimes a crick in th' back.
#LUT'ER.
Gimme one, Giz.
#GIZ.
Gosh! You want th' whole box, don't yer?
#LUT'ER.
Keep yer pills.
#DR. BEVAN.
What's ailin' you, Lut'er?
#LUT'ER.
Oh, a tired feelin'. An' a crick in m' back.
#DR. BEVAN.
I'll cure yer, Lut'er. If that Kickapoo doctor with the p'inted muss - tash kin cure yer, I guess I can.
#GIZ.
Got any terbaccer, Doc?
#DR. BEVAN.
Yep.
#GIZ.
Well, here's a pill fer a chaw.
#DR. BEVAN.
Ker'sene! Ker'sene! Now I been thinkin' things over, Lut'er and Giz.... Ker'sene, sure! I got a business proposition to make.
#DR. BEVAN.
There ain't enough home industry here in Rock Springs. We got a canning fact'ry and a stea'mill; but here comes a medicine show from Ioway - a Kickapoo Indian Medicine Show from Ioway! Now - what we need in Rock Springs is a medicine show!
#LUT'ER.
How yer goin' ter git it?
#DR. BEVAN.
Well, here's my proposition. Ain't we got as much horse sense as them Ioway Indians? damn sight more. We got the country from the Indians.
#GIZ.
By Golly, Lut'er, yer right.
#DR. BEVAN.
Now, I got some medicine science. I'd 'a' cured my second wife if it hadn't been for that busted winder.
#GIZ.
Yeh, but what come o' yer first wife?
#DR. BEVAN.
I could 'a' cured her, too, only I hadn't found the Family Medicine Book then.
#LUT'ER.
Well, what I wanter know is - what's yer proposition.... I'm in a hurry.... Here comes the Hattie Brown.
#DR. BEVAN.
Well, I'll make the salve an' do the talkin'; Giz'll sort o' whoop things up a bit and Lut'er'll git cured.
#LUT'ER.
What'll I get cured of?
#DR. BEVAN.
Oh, lumbago an' tired feelin' ... crick in the back and tizic.
#LUT'ER.
But who'll take a egg out o' somebody's ear?
#DR. BEVAN.
Giz'll learn that.
#LUT'ER.
An' who'll play the pianny?
#DR. BEVAN.
Besteena, my daughter.
#LUT'ER.
Where we goin'?
#DR. BEVAN.
We'll go ter Lavanny first.
#LUT'ER.
How'll we git there?
#DR. BEVAN.
Walk - unless somebody give us a tote.
#GIZ.
We kin go in my John - boat.
#LUT'ER.
Who'll row?
#GIZ.
We'll take turns.
#LUT'ER.
How fur is it?
#DR. BEVAN.
Three an' a half mile.... Will you go, Lut'er?
#LUT'ER.
How fur is it?
#GIZ.
Three an' a half mile.
#DR. BEVAN.
Will yer go, Lut'er?
#LUT'ER.
Uh - h.
#DR. BEVAN.
Huh?
#GIZ.
He said, uh - huh.
#DR. BEVAN.
I thought he said uh - uh.
#GIZ.
He said uh - huh.
#DR. BEVAN.
He didn't say nothin' o' the sort - he said uh - uh.
#LUT'ER.
How fur did yer say it wuz?
#DR. BEVAN.
Three an' a half mile.
#GIZ.
We'll each take a oar.
#DR. BEVAN.
What d'yer say, Lut'er?
#LUT'ER.
It's three an' a half mile ter Lavanny - an' three an' a half mile back.... Pretty fur.
#DR. BEVAN.
We kin come back on the current.
#LUT'ER.
Three an' a half mile air three an' a half mile - current or no current.
#LUT'ER.
I'll think it over ... but I ain't givin' yuh no hope.... Three an' a half mile one way air pretty fur ... but two ways - it's turruble.
#DR. BEVAN.
Come on, Giz. We'll talk it over.
#LUT'ER.
Three an' a half mile.... ... two ways.... Rock Springs is fur enough fur me!
