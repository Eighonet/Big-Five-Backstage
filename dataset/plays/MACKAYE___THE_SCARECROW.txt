#GOODY RICKBY.
On the anvil she is shaping a piece of iron. Beside her stands a framework of iron formed like the ribs and backbone of a man. For a few moments she continues to ply her hammer, amid a shower of sparks, till suddenly the flame on the forge dies down.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Dickon! More flame.
#A VOICE.
Yea, Goody.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Nay, not so fierce.
#VALSIN.
Votre pardon, madame. Is that better?
#GOODY RICKBY.
That will do. Quick work; nothing like brimstone for the smithy trade. There, my beauty! We’ll make a stout set of ribs for you. I’ll see to it this year that I have a scarecrow can outstand all the nor’easters that blow. I’ve no notion to lose my corn - crop this summer. So ye’re up before me and the sun, are ye? There’s one! Nay, two. Aha! One for sorrow, Two for mirth— Good! This time we’ll have the laugh on our side. Dickon! Fire! Come, come, where be thy wits?
#VALSIN.
’Tis early, dame.
#GOODY RICKBY.
The more need—
#VALSIN.
Ow!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Ha! Have I got thee? Now, Dickon!
#DICKON.
Deus! I haven’t been nabbed like that since St. Dunstan tweaked my nose. Well, sweet Goody?
#GOODY RICKBY.
The bellows!
#DICKON.
Why, ’tis hardly dawn yet. Honest folks are still abed. It makes a long day.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Aye, for your black pets, the crows, to work in. That’s why I’m at it early. You heard ’em. We must have this scarecrow of ours out in the field at his post before sunrise. So, there! Now, Dickon boy, I want that you should—
#DICKON.
Wait! Another one! “I want that you should—”
#GOODY RICKBY.
What’s that you’re writing?
#DICKON.
The phrase, Goody dear; the construction. Your New England dialect is hard for a poor cosmopolitan devil. What with ut clauses in English and Latinized subjunctives—You want that I should—Well?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Make a masterpiece. I’ve made the frame strong, so as to stand the weather; you must make the body lifelike so as to fool the crows. Last year I stuck up a poor sham and after a day they saw through it. This time, we must make ’em think it’s a real human crittur.
#DICKON.
To fool the philosophers is my specialty, but the crows—hm!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Pooh! That staggers thee!
#DICKON.
Madame Rickby, prod not the quick of my genius. I am Phidias, I am Raphael, I am the Lord God!— You shall see— Yonder broomstick.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Good boy!
#DICKON.
Haha! gee up! my Salem mare. broomstick—that’s for imagination! We are all pretty artists, to be sure, Bessie. Phidias, he sculptures the gods; Raphael, he paints the angels; the Lord God, he creates Adam; and Dickon—fetch me the poker—aha! Dickon! What doth Dickon? He nullifies ’em all; he endows the Scarecrow!—A poker: here’s his conscience. There’s two fine legs to walk on,—imagination and conscience. Yonder flails now! The ideal—the beau idéal, dame—that’s what we artists seek. The apotheosis of scarecrows! And pray, what’s a scarecrow? Why, the antithesis of Adam.—“Let there be candles!” quoth the Lord God, sitting in the dark. “Let there be candle - extinguishers,” saith Dickon. “I am made in the image of my maker,” quoth Adam. “Look at yourself in the glass,” saith Goodman Scarecrow. Fine! fine! here are flails—one for wit, t’other for satire. Sapristi! I with two such arms, my lad, how thou wilt work thy way in the world!
#GOODY RICKBY.
You talk as if you were making a real mortal, Dickon.
#DICKON.
To fool a crow, Goody, I must fashion a crittur that will first deceive a man.
#GOODY RICKBY.
He’ll scarce do that without a head. What think ye of yonder Jack - o’ - lantern? ’Twas made last Hallowe’en.
#DICKON.
Rare, my Psyche! We shall collaborate. Here! Whist! the anatomy.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Look!
#DICKON.
O Johannes Baptista! What wouldst thou have given for such a head! I helped Salome to cut his off, dame, and it looked not half so appetizing on her charger. Tut! Copernicus wore once such a pumpkin, but it is rotten. Look at his golden smile! Hail, Phœbus Apollo!
#GOODY RICKBY.
’Tis the finest scarecrow in town.
#DICKON.
Nay, poor soul, ’tis but a skeleton yet. He must have a man’s heart in him. Hush! Dost thou hear it beat?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Thou merry rogue!
#DICKON.
Now for the lungs of him. That’s for eloquence! He’ll preach the black knaves a sermon on theft. And now— here goes for digestion and inherited instincts! More corn, Goody. Now he’ll fight for his own flesh and blood!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Dickon, I am proud of thee.
#DICKON.
Wait till you see his peruke. Voici! Scalps of the enemy! rare conqueror!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Oh, you beauty!
#DICKON.
And now a bit of comfort for dark days and stormy nights. So! There, Goody! I tell thee, with yonder brand - new coat and breeches of mine—those there in my cupboard!—we’ll make him a lad to be proud of. Why, dame, he’ll be a son to thee. son? Ay, if I had but a son!
#DICKON.
Why, here you have him. Thou wilt scare the crows off thy mother’s corn - field— won’t my pretty? And send ’em all over t’other side the wall—to her dear neighbour’s, the Justice Gilead Merton’s.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Justice Merton! Nay, if they’d only peck his eyes out, instead of his corn.
#DICKON.
Yet the Justice was a dear friend of “Blacksmith Bess.”
#GOODY RICKBY.
Ay, “Blacksmith Bess!” If I hadn’t had a good stout arm when he cast me off with the babe, I might have starved for all his worship cared.
#DICKON.
True, Bessie; ’twas a scurvy trick he played on thee—and on me, that took such pains to bring you together—to steal a young maid’s heart—
#GOODY RICKBY.
And then toss it away like a bad penny to the gutter! And the child—to die! Ha! if I could get the worshipful Justice Gilead into my power again— But no! I shall beat my life away on this anvil, whilst my justice clinks his gold, and drinks his port to a fat old age. Justice! Ha—justice of God!
#DICKON.
Whist, dame! Talk of angels and hear the rustle of their relatives.
#GOODY RICKBY.
His niece—Rachel Merton! What can she want so early? Nay, I mind me; ’tis the mirror. She’s a maid after our own hearts, boy,—no Sabbath - go - to - meeting airs about her! She hath read the books of the magi from cover to cover, and paid me good guineas for ’em, though her uncle knows naught on’t. Besides, she’s in love, Dickon.
#DICKON.
Ah? With him? Is it a rendezvous?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Pff! Begone!
#DICKON.
Thou naughty rogue!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Mistress Rachel Merton—so early! I hope your uncle, our worshipful Justice, is not ill?
#RACHEL.
No, my uncle is quite well. The early morning suits me best for a walk. You are—quite alone?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Quite alone, mistress. Oh, folks don’t call on Goody Rickby—except on business.
#RACHEL.
Yes—you must be busy. Is it—is it here?
#GOODY RICKBY.
You mean the—
#RACHEL.
Ah! who’s that?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Fear not, mistress; ’tis nothing but a scarecrow. I’m going to put him in my corn - field yonder. The crows are so pesky this year.
#RACHEL.
How loathsome!
#GOODY RICKBY.
He’ll do!
#RACHEL.
Ah, here!—This is the mirror?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Yea, mistress, and a wonderful glass it is, as I told you. I wouldn’t sell it to most comers, but seeing how you and Master Talbot—
#RACHEL.
Yes; that will do.
#GOODY RICKBY.
You see, if the town folks guessed what it was, well—You’ve heard tell of the gibbets on Salem hill? There’s not many in New England like you, Mistress Rachel. You know enough to approve some miracles—outside the Scriptures.
#RACHEL.
You are quite sure the glass will do all you say? It—never fails?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Ay, now, mistress, how could it? ’Tis the glass of truth— the glass of true lovers. It shows folks just as they are; no shams, no varnish. If your sweetheart be false, the glass will reveal it. If a wolf should dress himself in a white sheep’s wool, this glass would reflect the black beast inside it.
#RACHEL.
But what of the sins of the soul, Goody? Vanity, hypocrisy, and—and inconstancy? Will it surely reveal them?
#GOODY RICKBY.
I have told you, my young lady. If it doth not as I say, bring it back and get your money again. Trust me, sweeting, ’tis your only mouse - trap for a man. Why, an old dame hath eyes in her heart yet. If your lover be false, this glass shall pluck his fine feathers!
#RACHEL.
’Tis no question of that. I wish the glass to—to amuse me.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Why, then, it shall amuse you. Try it on some of your neighbours.
#RACHEL.
You ask a large price for it.
#GOODY RICKBY.
I run risks. Besides, where will you get another?
#RACHEL.
That is true. Here, I will buy it. That is the sum you mentioned, I believe?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Let see; let see.
#RACHEL.
Well?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Good: ’tis good. Folks call me a witch, mistress. Well—harkee—a witch’s word is as good as a justice’s gold. The glass is yours—with my blessing.
#RACHEL.
Spare yourself that, dame. But the glass: how am I to get it? How will you send it to me—quietly?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Trust me for that. I’ve a willing lad that helps me with such errands; a neighbour o’ mine. Ebenezer!
#RACHEL.
What! is he here?
#GOODY RICKBY.
In the hay - loft. The boy’s an orphan; he sleeps there o’ times. Ebenezer!
#THE BOY.
Evenin’.
#RACHEL.
You understand; I desire no comment about this purchase.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Nor I, mistress, be sure.
#RACHEL.
Is he—?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Trust his wits who hath no wit; he’s mum.
#RACHEL.
Oh!
#THE BOY.
Job?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Yea, rumple - head! His job this morning is to bear yonder glass to the house of Justice Merton—the big one on the hill; to the side door. Mind, no gabbing. Doth he catch?
#THE BOY.
’E swallows.
#RACHEL.
But is the boy strong enough?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Him? Ebenezer!
#RACHEL.
Gracious!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Trust him. He’ll carry the glass for you.
#RACHEL.
I will return home at once, then. Let him go quietly to the side door, and wait for me. Good morning.
#RICHARD.
Good morning.
#RACHEL.
Richard!—Squire Talbot, you—you are abroad early.
#RICHARD.
As early as Mistress Rachel. Is it pardonable? I caught sight of you walking in this direction, so I thought it wise to follow, lest—
#RACHEL.
Very kind. Thanks. I’ve done my errand. Well; we can return together. You will make sure that I receive the—the article.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Trust me, mistress. Squire Talbot! the honour, sir!
#RICHARD.
What article?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Begging your pardon, sir?
#RICHARD.
What article? I said. Well?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Oh, the article! Yonder old glass, to be sure, sir. quaint piece, your honour.
#RICHARD.
Rachel, you haven’t come here at sunrise to buy—that thing?
#RACHEL.
Verily, “that thing” and at sunrise. A pretty time for a pretty purchase. Are you coming?
#RICHARD.
More witchcraft nonsense? Do you realize this is serious?
#RACHEL.
Oh, of course. You know I am desperately mystical, so pray let us not discuss it. Good - by.
#RICHARD.
Rachel, just a moment. If you want a mirror, you shall have the prettiest one in New England. Or I will import you one from London. Only—I beg of you—don’t buy stolen goods.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Stolen goods?
#RACHEL.
Don’t! don’t!
#RICHARD.
At least, articles under suspicion. Can you account for this mirror—how you came by it?
#GOODY RICKBY.
I’ll show ye! I’ll show ye! Stolen—ha!
#RICHARD.
Come, old swindler, keep your mirror, and give this lady back her money.
#GOODY RICKBY.
I’ll damn ye both, I will!—Stolen!
#RACHEL.
Will you come?
#RICHARD.
Look you, old Rickby; this is not the first time. Charm all the broomsticks in town, if you like; bewitch all the tables and saucepans and mirrors you please; but gull no more money out of young girls. Mind you! We’re not so enterprising in this town as at Salem; but—it may come to it! So look sharp! I’m not blind to what’s going on here.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Not blind, Master Puritan? Oho! You can see through all my counterfeits, can ye? So! you would scrape all the wonder out’n the world, as I’ve scraped all the meat out’n my punkin - head yonder! Aha! wait and see! Afore sundown, I’ll send ye a nut to crack, shall make your orthodox jaws ache. Your servant, Master Deuteronomy!
#RICHARD.
We’ll go.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Trot away, pretty team; toss your heads. I’ll unhitch ye and take off your blinders.
#THE SLOUCHING BOY.
Ohoho!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Yes, yes, my fine lover! I’ll pay thee for “stolen goods”—I’ll pay thee. Dickon! Stop laughing.
#THE BOY.
O Lord! O Lord!
#GOODY RICKBY.
What tickles thy mirth now?
#THE BOY.
For to think as the soul of an orphan innocent, what lives in a hay - loft, should wear horns.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Yea; ’tis a wise devil that knows his own face in the glass. But hark now! Thou must find me a rival for this cock - squire,—dost hear? A rival, that shall steal away the heart of his Mistress Rachel.
#DICKON.
And take her to church?
#GOODY RICKBY.
To church or to Hell. All’s one. rival! How would he serve—in there? Dear Ebenezer! Fancy the deacons in the vestry, Goody, and her uncle, the Justice, when they saw him escorting the bride to the altar, with his tail round her waist!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Tut, tut! Think it over in earnest, and meantime take her the glass. Wait, we’d best fold it up small, so as not to attract notice on the road. Now! So! Be off! And mind, a rival for Richard!
#DICKON.
For Richard a rival, Dear Goody Rickby Wants Dickon’s connival: Lord! What can the trick be? By - by, Sonny; take care of thy mother.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Mother! Yea, if only I had a son—the Justice Merton’s and mine! If the brat had but lived now to remind him of those merry days, which he has forgotten. Zooks, wouldn’t I put a spoke in his wheel! But no such luck for me! No such luck!
#THE MAN.
Permit me, Madam.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Ah, him!—Justice Merton!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Permit me, dame.
#GOODY RICKBY.
You!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
I have had the honour—permit me—to entertain suspicions; to rise early, to follow my niece, to meet just now Squire Talbot, an excellent young gentleman of wealth, if not of fashion; to hear his remarks concerning—hem!—you, dame! to call here—permit me—to express myself and inquire—
#GOODY RICKBY.
Concerning your waistcoat?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Woman!
#GOODY RICKBY.
You left it behind—the last time.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
I have not the honour to remember—
#GOODY RICKBY.
The one I embroidered?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
’Tis a matter—
#GOODY RICKBY.
Of some two and twenty years. Will you try it on now, dearie?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Unconscionable! Un - un - unconscionable witch!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Witchling—thou used to say.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Pah! pah! I forget myself. Pride, permit me, goeth before a fall. As a magistrate, Rickby, I have already borne with you long! The last straw, however, breaks the camel’s back.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Poor camel!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
You have soiled, you have smirched, the virgin reputation of my niece. You have inveigled her into notions of witchcraft; already the neighbours are beginning to talk. ’Tis a long lane which hath no turning, saith the Lord. Permit me—as a witch, thou art judged. Thou shalt hang.
#A VOICE.
And me too?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
I beg pardon.
#VALSIN.
Not at all.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Did—did somebody speak?
#VALSIN.
Don’t you recognize my voice? Still and small, you know. If you will kindly let me out, we can chat.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
These are thy sorceries. But I fear them not. The righteous man walketh with God. Satan, I ban thee! I will read from the Holy Scriptures!
#DICKON.
Thanks; it was stuffy in there.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Dickon!
#DICKON.
Hillo, Gilly! Hillo, Bess!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Dickon! No! No!
#DICKON.
Do ye mind Auld Lang Syne—the chorus that night, Gilly? Gil - ead, Gil - ead, Gil - ead Merton, He was a silly head, silly head, Certain, When he forgot to steal a bed - Curtain! Encore, now!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
No, no, be merciful! I will not harm her; she shall not hang: I swear, I swear it! I swear—ah! Is he gone? Witchcraft! Witchcraft! I have witnessed it. ’Tis proved on thee, slut. I swear it: thou shalt hang.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Ay, Gilead! I shall hang on! Ahaha! Dickon, thou angel! Ah, Satan! Satan! For a son now!
#DICKON.
Videlicet, in law—a bastard. N’est ce pas?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Yea, in law and in justice, I should - a had one now. Worse luck that he died.
#DICKON.
One and twenty years ago? Good; he should be of age now. One and twenty—a pretty age, too, for a rival. Haha!—For arrival?—Marry, he shall arrive, then; arrive and marry and inherit his patrimony—all on his birthday! Come, to work!
#GOODY RICKBY.
What rant is this?
#DICKON.
Yet, Dickon, it pains me to perform such an anachronism. All this Mediævalism in Massachusetts!—These old - fashioned flames and alchemic accompaniments, when I’ve tried so hard to be a native American product; it jars. But che vuole! I’m naturally middle - aged. I haven’t been really myself, let me think,—since 1492!
#GOODY RICKBY.
What art thou mooning about?
#DICKON.
There was my old friend in Germany, Dr. Johann Faustus; he was nigh such a bag of old rubbish when I made him over. Ain’t it trite! No, you can’t teach an old dog like me new tricks. Still, a scarecrow! that’s decidedly local color. Come then; a Yankee masterpiece! Behold, madam, your son—illegitimate; the future affianced of Mistress Rachel Merton, the heir - elect, through matrimony, of Merton House,—Gilead Merton second; Lord Ravensbane! Your lordship—your mother.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Dickon! Can you do it?
#DICKON.
I can—try.
#GOODY RICKBY.
You will create him for me?— and for Gilead!
#DICKON.
I will—for a kiss.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Dickon!
#DICKON.
Later. Now, the waistcoat.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Rare! rare! He shall go wooing in’t—like his father.
#DICKON.
Stand still, Jack! So, my macaroni. Perfecto! Stay—a walking - stick!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Here: the spoke for Gilead. He used to take me to drive in the chaise it came out of.
#DICKON.
Sic! There, Jacky! Filius fit non nascitur.—Sam Hill! My Latin is stale. “In the beginning, was the—gourd!” Of these thy modest ingredients may thy spirit smack! Flail, flip; Broom, sweep; Sic itur! Cornstalk And turnip, talk! Turn crittur! Pulse, beet; Gourd, eat; Ave Hellas! Poker and punkin, Stir the old junk in: Breathe, bellows! Corn - cob, And crow’s feather, End the job: Jumble the rest o’ the rubbish together; Dovetail and tune ’em. E pluribus unum! The devil! Have I lost the hang of it? Ah! Hullo! He’s dropped his pipe. What’s a dandy without his ’baccy! ’Tis the life and breath of him. So; hand me yon hazel switch, Goody. Presto! Brighten, coal, the dusk between us! Whiten, soul! Propinquit Venus! Sic! Sic! Jacobus! Bravo!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Puff! puff, manny, for thy life!
#DICKON.
Fiat, fœtus!—Huzza! Noch einmal! Go it!
#GOODY RICKBY.
See! See his eyes!
#DICKON.
Veni, fili! Veni! Take ’ee first step, bambino!— Toddle!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Have a care! He’s fallen.
#DICKON.
Well done, Punkin Jack! Thou shalt be knighted for that! Rise, Lord Ravensbane!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Look! He bows.—He flaps his flails at thee. He smiles like a tik - doo - loo - roo!
#DICKON.
Will his lordship deign to follow his tutor?
#GOODY RICKBY.
O Lord! Lord! the style o’ the broomstick!
#DICKON.
Will his lordship be seated and rest himself? Puff! Puff, puer; ’tis thy life. Is his lordship’s tobacco refreshing?
#GOODY RICKBY.
Look now! The red colour in his cheeks. The beet - juice is pumping, oho!
#DICKON.
Your lordship will deign to receive an audience? The Marchioness of Rickby, your lady mother, entreats leave to present herself.
#GOODY RICKBY.
My son!
#DICKON.
Dicite! Speak! In principio erat verbum! Accost thy mother!
#THE SCARECROW.
Mother!
#GOODY RICKBY.
O Beelzebub! I shall die!
#DICKON.
Thou hast thy son.
#GOODY RICKBY.
He called me “mother.” Again, boy, again.
#THE SCARECROW.
From the bottom of my heart—mother.
#GOODY RICKBY.
“The bottom of his heart”—Nay, thou killest me.
#THE SCARECROW.
Permit me, madam!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Gilead! Gilead himself! Waistcoat, “permit me,” and all: thy father over again, I tell thee.
#THE SCARECROW.
It gives me—I assure you—lady—the deepest happiness.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Just so the old hypocrite spoke when I said I’d have him. But thou hast a sweeter deference, my son.
#DICKON.
Now, my lord, your tutor is ready.
#THE SCARECROW.
I have the honour—permit me—to wish you—good morning.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Whoa! Whoa, Jack! Whither away?
#DICKON.
Deign to reply, sir.
#THE SCARECROW.
I go—with my tutor—Master Dickonson—to pay my respects—to his worship—the Justice—Merton—to solicit—the hand—of his daughter—the fair Mistress—Rachel. Permit me.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Permit ye? God speed ye! Thou must teach him his tricks, Dickon.
#DICKON.
Trust me, Goody. Between here and Justice Merton’s, I will play the mother - hen, and I promise thee, our bantling shall be as stuffed with compliments as a callow chick with caterpillars. Hark! your lordship’s retainers acclaim you on your birthday. They bid you welcome to your majority. Listen! “Long live Lord Ravensbane! Caw!”
#GOODY RICKBY.
Look! Count ’em, Dickon. One for sorrow, Two for mirth, Three for a wedding, Four for a birth— Four on ’em! So! Good luck on thy birthday! And see! There’s three on ’em flying into the Justice’s field. —Flight o’ the crows Tells how the wind blows!— wedding! Get ye gone. Wed the girl, and sting the Justice. Bless ye, my son!
#THE SCARECROW.
Mother—believe me—to be—your ladyship’s— most devoted—and obedient—son.
#DICKON.
Ravensbane.
#THE SCARECROW.
Hm! Ravensbane! Here the living actor, through a trap, concealed by the smoke, will substitute himself for the elegantly clad effigy. His make - up, of course, will approximate to the latter, but the grotesque contours of his expression gradually, throughout the remainder of the act, become refined and sublimated till, at the finale, they are of a lordly and distinguished caste.
#RACHEL.
Now! Are you willing?
#RICHARD.
So you suspect me of dark, villainous practices?
#RACHEL.
No, no, foolish Dick.
#RICHARD.
Still, I am to be tested; is that it?
#RACHEL.
That’s it.
#RICHARD.
As your true lover.
#RACHEL.
Well, yes.
#RICHARD.
Why, of course, then, I consent. A true lover always consents to the follies of his lady - love.
#RACHEL.
Thank you, Dick; I trust the glass will sustain your character. Now; when I draw the curtain—
#RICHARD.
What if I be false?
#RACHEL.
Then, sir, the glass will reflect you as the subtle fox that you are.
#RICHARD.
And you—as the goose?
#RACHEL.
Very likely. Ah! but, Richard dear, we mustn’t laugh. It may prove very serious. You do not guess—you do not dream all the mysteries—
#RICHARD.
You pluck at too many mysteries; sometime they may burn your fingers. Remember our first mother Eve!
#RACHEL.
But this is the glass of truth; and Goody Rickby told me—
#RICHARD.
Rickby, forsooth!
#RACHEL.
Nay, come; let’s have it over. Ah! there you are, dear! There we are, both of us—just as we have always seemed to each other, true. ’Tis proved. Isn’t it wonderful?
#RICHARD.
Miraculous! That a mirror bought in a blacksmith shop, before sunrise, for twenty pounds, should prove to be actually—a mirror!
#RACHEL.
Richard, I’m so happy.
#RICHARD.
Happy, art thou, sweet goose? Why, then, God bless Goody Rickby.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Strange words from you, Squire Talbot.
#RICHARD.
Justice Merton! Why, sir, the old witch is more innocent, perhaps, than I represented her. witch, believe me, is never innocent. Permit me, young lovers. I was once young myself, young and amorous.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Verily!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
My fair niece, my worthy young man, beware of witchcraft.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
And Goody Rickby, too, brother?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
That woman shall answer for her deeds. She is proscribed.
#RACHEL.
Proscribed? What is that?
#MISTRESS MERTON.
What is this?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
She shall hang.
#RACHEL.
Uncle, no! Not merely because of my purchase this morning.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Your purchase?
#MISTRESS MERTON.
That, I suppose.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
What! you purchased that mirror of her? You brought it here?
#RACHEL.
No, the boy brought it; I found it here when I returned.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
What! From her! You purchased it? From her shop? From her infamous den, into my parlour! Call the servant. Micah! This instant, this instant—away with it! Micah!
#RACHEL.
Uncle Gilead, I bought—
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Micah, I say! Where is the man?
#RACHEL.
Listen, Uncle. I bought it with my own money.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Thine own money! Wilt have the neighbours gossip? Wilt have me, thyself, my house, suspected of complicity with witches? Micah, take this away.
#MICAH.
Yes, sir; but, sir—
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Out of my house!
#MICAH.
There be visitors.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Away with—
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Gilead!
#MICAH.
Visitors, sir; gentry.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Ah!
#MICAH.
Shall I show them in, sir?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Visitors! In the morning? Who are they?
#MICAH.
Strangers, sir. I should judge they be very high gentry; lords, sir.
#ALL.
Lords!
#MICAH.
At least, one on ’em, sir. The other—the dark gentleman—told me they left their horses at the inn, sir.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Hark! Where is that unearthly sound?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Is it in the cellar?
#MICAH.
’Tis just the dog howling, madam. When he spied the gentry he turned tail and run below.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Oh, the dog!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Show the gentlemen here, Micah. Don’t keep them waiting. lord! We shall talk of this matter later.—A lord!
#RACHEL.
What a fortunate interruption! But, dear Dick! I wish we needn’t meet these strangers now.
#RICHARD.
Would you really rather we were alone together?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Think of it, Cynthia, a lord!
#MISTRESS MERTON.
And such dust!
#RACHEL.
You know, dear, we need only be introduced, and then we can steal away together.
#MICAH.
Lord Ravensbane: Marquis of Oxford, Baron of Wittenberg, Elector of Worms, and Count of Cordova; Master Dickonson.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Gentlemen, permit me, you are excessively welcome. I am deeply gratified to meet—
#DICKON.
Lord Ravensbane, of the Rookeries, Somersetshire.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Lord Ravensbane—his lordship’s most truly honoured.
#RAVENSBANE.
Truly honoured.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
His lordship’s—?
#DICKON.
Tutor.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Ah, so!
#DICKON.
Justice Merton, I believe.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Of Merton House.—May I present—permit me, your lordship—my sister, Mistress Merton.
#RAVENSBANE.
Mistress Merton.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
And my—and my— Rachel! —my young neighbour, Squire Talbot, Squire Richard Talbot of—of—
#RICHARD.
Of nowhere, sir.
#RAVENSBANE.
Nowhere.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
And permit me, Lord Ravensbane, my niece—Mistress Rachel Merton.
#RAVENSBANE.
Mistress Rachel Merton.
#RACHEL.
Lord Ravensbane.
#RAVENSBANE.
Mistress Rachel!
#RACHEL.
Your lordship! pipe! Gilead!—in the parlour!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Your lordship—ahem!—has just arrived in town?
#DICKON.
From London, via New Amsterdam.
#RICHARD.
Is he staring at you? Are you ill, Rachel?
#RACHEL.
What?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Lord Ravensbane honours my humble roof.
#DICKON.
Your lordship—“roof.”
#RAVENSBANE.
Nay, sir, the roof of my father’s oldest friend bestows generous hospitality upon his only son.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Only son—ah, yes! Your father—
#RAVENSBANE.
My father, I trust, sir, has never forgotten the intimate companionship, the touching devotion, the unceasing solicitude for his happiness which you, sir, manifested to him in the days of his youth.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Really, your lordship, the—the slight favours which—hem! some years ago, I was privileged to show your illustrious father—
#RAVENSBANE.
Permit me!—Because, however, of his present infirmities—for I regret to say that my father is suffering a temporary aberration of mind—
#JUSTICE MERTON.
You distress me!
#RAVENSBANE.
My lady mother has charged me with a double mission here in New England. On my quitting my home, sir, to explore the wideness and the mystery of this world, my mother bade me be sure to call upon his worship, the Justice Merton; and deliver to him, first, my father’s remembrances; and secondly, my mother’s epistle.
#DICKON.
Her ladyship’s letter, sir.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Cynthia!—a crested seal!
#DICKON.
His lordship’s crest, sir: rooks rampant.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Permit me.
#RACHEL.
Have you noticed his bearing, Richard: what personal distinction! what inbred nobility! Every inch a true lord!
#RICHARD.
He may be a lord, my dear, but he walks like a broomstick.
#RACHEL.
How dare you!
#DICKON.
word, sir.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
I am astonished—overpowered!
#RAVENSBANE.
Mistress Rachel—permit me.
#RACHEL.
Oh, thank you.
#RICHARD.
So Lord Ravensbane and his family are old friends of yours?
#MISTRESS MERTON.
I never heard the name before, Richard.
#RICHARD.
Why! but I thought that your brother, the Justice—
#MISTRESS MERTON.
The Justice is reticent.
#RICHARD.
Ah!
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Especially concerning his youth.
#RICHARD.
Ah!
#RAVENSBANE.
Believe me, sweet lady, it will give me the deepest pleasure.
#RACHEL.
Can you really tell fortunes?
#RAVENSBANE.
More than that; I can bestow them.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
But is her ladyship really serious? An offer of marriage!
#DICKON.
Pray read it again, sir.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
“To the Worshipful, the Justice Gilead Merton, “Merton House. “My Honourable Friend and Benefactor: “With these brief lines I commend to you our son”—our son!
#DICKON.
She speaks likewise for his young lordship’s father, sir.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Ah! of course. “In a strange land, I intrust him to you as to a father.” Honoured, believe me! “I have only to add my earnest hope that the natural gifts, graces, and inherited fortune”—ah—!
#DICKON.
Twenty thousand pounds—on his father’s demise.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Ah!—“fortune of this young scion of nobility will so propitiate the heart of your niece, Mistress Rachel Merton, as to cause her to accept his proffered hand in matrimony;” —but—but—but Squire Talbot is betrothed to—well, well, we shall see;—“in matrimony, and thus cement the early bonds of interest and affection between your honoured self and his lordship’s father; not to mention, dear sir, your worship’s ever grateful and obedient admirer, “ELIZABETH, “Marchioness of R.” Of R.! of R.! Will you believe me, my dear sir, so long is it since my travels in England—I visited at so many—hem! noble estates—permit me, it is so awkward, but—
#DICKON.
Not at all.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
confess, sir, my youthful memory fails me. Will you be so very obliging; this—this Marchioness of R.—?
#DICKON.
Yes?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
The R, I presume, stands for—
#DICKON.
Rickby.
#RAVENSBANE.
Dickon, my pipe!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Great God!—Thou inexorable Judge!
#RICHARD.
Are these court manners, in London?
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Don’t ask me, Richard.
#RAVENSBANE.
Alas! Mistress Rachel is cruel.
#RACHEL.
I?—cruel, your lordship?
#RAVENSBANE.
Your own white hand has written it. See, these lines: Rejection! you will reject one who loves you dearly.
#RACHEL.
Fie, your lordship! Be not cast down at fortune - telling. Let me tell yours, may I?
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah! Permit me.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Dickon! Can it be Dickon?
#RACHEL.
Why, Lord Ravensbane, your pulse. Really, if I am cruel, you are quite heartless. I declare I can’t feel your heart beat at all.
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah! mistress, that is because I have just lost it.
#RACHEL.
Where?
#RAVENSBANE.
Dickon, my pipe!
#RACHEL.
Alas! my lord, are you ill?
#DICKON.
Pardon me, sweet young lady, I must confide to you that his lordship’s heart is peculiarly responsive to his emotions. When he feels very ardently, it quite stops. Hence the use of his pipe.
#RACHEL.
Oh! Is smoking, then, necessary for his heart?
#DICKON.
Absolutely—to equilibrate the valvular palpitations. Without his pipe—should his lordship experience, for instance, the emotion of love—he might die.
#RACHEL.
You alarm me!
#DICKON.
But this is for you only, Mistress Rachel. We may confide in you?
#RACHEL.
Oh, utterly, sir.
#DICKON.
His lordship, you know, is so sensitive.
#RAVENSBANE.
You have given it back to me. Why did not you keep it?
#RACHEL.
What, my lord?
#RAVENSBANE.
My heart.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Permit me, one moment; I did not catch your name.
#DICKON.
My name? Dickonson.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Ah, Dickonson! Thank you. I mistook the word. compound, your worship. Dickon - son! Both at your service.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
If—if you can show pity—speak low.
#DICKON.
As hell, your worship?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Is he—he there?
#DICKON.
Bessie’s brat; yes; it didn’t die, after all, poor suckling! Dickon weaned it. Saved it for balm of Gilead. Raised it for joyful home - coming. Prodigal’s return! Twenty - first birthday! Happy son! Happy father!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
My—son!
#DICKON.
Felicitations!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
I will not believe it.
#DICKON.
Truth is hard fare.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
What—what do you want?
#DICKON.
Only the happiness of your dear ones. The union of these young hearts and hands.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
What! he will dare—an illegitimate—
#DICKON.
Fie, fie, Gilly! Why, the brat is a lord now.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Oh, the disgrace! Spare me that, Dickon.
#RICHARD.
Are you mad?
#RACHEL.
What is the matter? Oh, your lordship is too witty!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
After all, I was young then.
#DICKON.
Quite so.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
And she is innocent; she is already betrothed.
#DICKON.
Twiddle - twaddle! Look at her eyes now! ’Tis a brilliant match; besides, her ladyship’s heart is set upon it.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Her ladyship—?
#DICKON.
The Marchioness of Rickby.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
I had forgotten.
#DICKON.
Her ladyship has never forgotten. So, you see, your worship’s alternatives are most simple. Alternative one: advance his lordship’s suit with your niece as speedily as possible, and save all scandal. Alternative two: impede his lordship’s suit, and—
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Don’t, Dickon! don’t reveal the truth; not disgrace now!
#DICKON.
Good; we are agreed, then?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
I have no choice.
#DICKON.
Why, true; we ignored that, didn’t we?
#MISTRESS MERTON.
This young lord—Why, Gilead, are you ill?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Not in the least.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Rachel’s deportment, my dear brother—
#RACHEL.
I am really at a loss. Your lordship’s hand is so very peculiar.
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah! Peculiar.
#RACHEL.
This, now, is the line of life.
#RAVENSBANE.
Of life, yes?
#RACHEL.
But it begins so abruptly, and see! it breaks off and ends nowhere. And just so here with this line—the line of—of love.
#RAVENSBANE.
Of love. So; it breaks?
#RACHEL.
Yes.
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah, then, that must be the heart line.
#RACHEL.
I am afraid your lordship is very fickle.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
I tell you, Gilead, they are fortune - telling!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Tush! Tush!
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Tush? “Tush” to me? Tush!
#RICHARD.
Intolerable! Do you approve of this, sir? Are Lord Ravensbane’s credentials satisfactory?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Eminently, eminently.
#RICHARD.
Ah! So her ladyship’s letter is—
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Charming; charming.
#RICHARD.
To be sure; old friends, when they are lords, it makes such a difference.
#DICKON.
True friends—old friends; New friends—cold friends. N’est ce pas, your worship?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Indeed, Master Dickonson; indeed! What happiness to encounter the manners of the nobility!
#RICHARD.
If you approve them, sir, it is sufficient. This is your house.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Your lordship will, I trust, make my house your home.
#RAVENSBANE.
My home, sir.
#RACHEL.
Really? Why, uncle, what is this Master Dickonson tells us?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
What! What! he has revealed—
#RACHEL.
Yes, indeed. Why did you never tell us?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Rachel! Rachel!
#MISTRESS MERTON.
You are moved, brother.
#RACHEL.
My uncle is doubtless astonished to find you so grown.
#RAVENSBANE.
I am doubtless astonished, sir, to be so grown.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
You have—
#DICKON.
Remarked, sir, that your worship had often dandled his lordship—as an infant.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Quite so—as an infant merely.
#RACHEL.
How interesting! Then you must have seen his lordship’s home in England.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
As you say.
#RACHEL.
Do describe it to us. We are so isolated here from the grand world. Do you know, I always imagine England to be an enchanted isle, like one of the old Hesperides, teeming with fruits of solid gold.
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah, yes! my mother raises them.
#RACHEL.
Fruits of gold?
#RAVENSBANE.
Round like the rising sun. She calls them—ah! punkins.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
“Punkins!”
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Scoundrel! Scoundrel!
#RACHEL.
Your lordship pokes fun at us.
#DICKON.
His lordship is an artist in words, mistress. I have noticed that in whatever country he is travelling, he tinges his vocabulary with the local idiom. His lordship means, of course, not pumpkins, but pomegranates.
#RACHEL.
We forgive him. But, your lordship, please be serious and describe to us your hall.
#RAVENSBANE.
Quite serious: the hall. Yes, yes; in the middle burns a great fire—on a black—ah!—black altar. Druidical heirloom. His lordship’s mother collects antiques.
#RACHEL.
How fascinating!
#RAVENSBANE.
Quite fascinating! On the walls hang pieces of iron.
#DICKON.
Trophies of Saxon warfare.
#RAVENSBANE.
And rusty horseshoes.
#GENERAL MURMURS.
Horseshoes!
#DICKON.
Presents from the German emperor. They were worn by the steeds of Charlemagne.
#RAVENSBANE.
Quite so; and broken cart - wheels.
#DICKON.
Reliques of British chariots.
#RACHEL.
How mediæval it must be! And to think you never described it to us!
#MISTRESS MERTON.
True, brother; you have been singularly reticent.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Permit me; it is impossible to report all one sees on one’s travels.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Evidently.
#RACHEL.
But surely your lordship’s mother has other diversions besides collecting antiques. I have heard that in England ladies followed the hounds; and sometimes— they even dance.
#RAVENSBANE.
Dance—ah, yes; my lady mother dances about the—the altar; she swings high a hammer.
#DICKON.
Your lordship, your lordship! Pray, sir, check this vein of poetry. Lord Ravensbane symbolizes as a hammer and altar a golf - stick and tee—a Scottish game, which her ladyship plays on her Highland estates.
#RICHARD.
What do you think of this?
#MISTRESS MERTON.
He said to me “tush.”
#RICHARD.
Who is this magpie?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Satan!
#RICHARD.
I beg pardon!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Satan, sir—makes you jealous.
#RICHARD.
Good morning. Lord Ravensbane, I have a rustic colonial question to ask. Is it the latest fashion to smoke incessantly in ladies’ parlours, or is it—mediæval?
#DICKON.
His lordship’s health, sir, necessitates—
#RICHARD.
I addressed his lordship.
#RAVENSBANE.
In the matter of fashions, sir— My pipe, Dickon!
#DICKON.
Pardon me. The fact is, my young pupil is sensitive; the wound from his latest duel is not quite healed; you observe a slight lameness, an occasional absence of mind. wound—in a real duel?
#RICHARD.
Necessitates his smoking! A valid reason!
#DICKON.
You, mistress, know the true reason—his lordship’s heart.
#RACHEL.
Believe me, sir—
#RICHARD.
Well, well, your lordship. You were saying—? in the matter of fashions, sir—?
#RAVENSBANE.
Permit me! I am the fashions.
#RICHARD.
Insufferable!
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Well—what do you think of that?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Spoken like King Charles himself.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Brother! brother! is there nothing wrong here?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Wrong, Cynthia! Manifestly you are quite ignorant of the manners of the great.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Oh, Gilead!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Where are you going?
#MISTRESS MERTON.
To my room. Dear! dear! if it should be that again!
#RACHEL.
I—object to the smoke? Why, I think it is charming.
#RICHARD.
Rachel!
#RACHEL.
Oh!—you?
#RICHARD.
You take quickly to European fashions.
#RACHEL.
Yes? To what one in particular?
#RICHARD.
Two; smoking and flirtation.
#RACHEL.
Jealous?
#RICHARD.
Of an idiot? I hope not. Manners differ, however. Your confidences to his lordship have evidently not included—your relation to me.
#RACHEL.
Oh, our relations!
#RICHARD.
Of course, since you wish him to continue in ignorance—
#RACHEL.
Not at all. He shall know at once. Lord Ravensbane!
#RAVENSBANE.
Fair mistress!
#RICHARD.
Rachel, stop! I did not mean—
#RACHEL.
My uncle did not introduce to you with sufficient elaboration this gentleman. Will you allow me to do so now?
#RAVENSBANE.
I adore Mistress Rachel’s elaborations.
#RACHEL.
Lord Ravensbane, I beg to present Squire Talbot, my betrothed.
#RAVENSBANE.
Betrothed! Is it— is it pleasant?
#RACHEL.
Are you satisfied?
#RICHARD.
More than satisfied.
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah! Betrothed is not pleasant.
#RACHEL.
Not always.
#RAVENSBANE.
Mistress Rachel is not pleased?
#RACHEL.
With him.
#RAVENSBANE.
Mistress Rachel will smile again?
#RACHEL.
Soon.
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah! if she would only smile once more! What can Lord Ravensbane do to make her smile? See! will you puff my pipe? It is very pleasant.
#RACHEL.
Shall I try?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Rachel!
#RACHEL.
Why, uncle!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Permit me, your lordship—Rachel, you will kindly withdraw for a few moments; I desire to confer with Lord Ravensbane concerning his mother’s—her ladyship’s letter; —that is, if you think, sir, that your noble pupil is not too fatigued.
#DICKON.
Not at all; I think his lordship will listen to you with much pleasure.
#RAVENSBANE.
With much pleasure.
#DICKON.
And in the meantime, if Mistress Rachel will allow me, I will assist her in writing those invitations which your worship desires to send in her name.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Invitations—from my niece?
#DICKON.
To his Excellency, the Lieutenant Governor; to your friends, the Reverend Masters at Harvard College, etc., etc.; in brief, to all your worship’s select social acquaintance in the vicinity—to meet his lordship. It was so thoughtful in you to suggest it, sir, and believe me, his lordship appreciates your courtesy in arranging the reception in his honour for this afternoon.
#RACHEL.
This afternoon! Are we really to give his lordship a reception this afternoon?
#DICKON.
Your uncle has already given me the list of guests; so considerate! Permit me to act as your scribe, Mistress Rachel.
#RACHEL.
With pleasure. And will it be here, uncle?
#DICKON.
Your worship said here, I believe?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Quite so, sir; quite so, quite so.
#DICKON.
I advise nothing rash, Gilly; the brat has a weak heart.
#RACHEL.
This way, Master Dickonson, to the study.
#DICKON.
I will write and you sign?
#RACHEL.
Thank you.
#DICKON.
Remember, Jack! Puff, puff!
#RACHEL.
Your lordship is to be my guest. Till we meet again!
#DICKON.
May I sharpen your quill?
#RAVENSBANE.
Till—we—meet—again!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Impostor!
#RAVENSBANE.
She is gone.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
You at least shall not play the lord and master to my face.
#RAVENSBANE.
Quite—gone!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
I know with whom I have to deal. If I be any judge of my own flesh and blood—permit me—you shall quail before me.
#RAVENSBANE.
She did not smile— She smiled!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Affected rogue! I know thee. I know thy feigned pauses, thy assumed vagaries. Speak; how much do you want?
#RAVENSBANE.
Betrothed,—he went away. That was good. And then—she did not smile: that was not good. But then—she smiled! Ah! that was good.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Come back, coward, and face me.
#RAVENSBANE.
First, the great sun shone over the corn - fields, the grass was green; the black wings rose and flew before me; then the door opened—and she looked at me.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Speak, I say! What sum? What treasure do you hope to bleed from me?
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah! Mistress Rachel!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Her! Scoundrel, if thou dost name her again, my innocent—my sweet maid! If thou dost—thou godless spawn of temptation—mark you, I will put an end—
#DICKON.
I beg pardon; I forgot something.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
God is just.
#RAVENSBANE.
Permit me, sir, are you ill?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
What art thou?
#RAVENSBANE.
I am Lord Ravensbane: Marquis of Oxford, Baron of Wittenberg, Elector of Worms, and—
#JUSTICE MERTON.
And my son!
#RAVENSBANE.
Shall I call Dickon?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Yea, for thou art my son. The deed once done is never done, the past is the present.
#RAVENSBANE.
Dickon!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
No, do not call him. Stay, and be merciful. Tell me: I hate thee not; thou wast innocent. Tell me!—I thought thou hadst died as a babe.—Where has Dickon, our tyrant, kept thee these twenty years?
#RAVENSBANE.
Master Dickonson is my tutor.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
And why has thy mother— Ah, I know well; I deserve all. But yet, it must not be published now! I am a justice now, an honoured citizen—and my young niece— Thy mother will not demand so much; she will be considerate; she will ask some gold, of course, but she will show pity!
#RAVENSBANE.
My mother is the Marchioness of Rickby.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Yes, yes; ’twas well planned, a clever trick. ’Twas skilful of her. But surely thy mother gave thee commands to—
#RAVENSBANE.
My mother gave me her blessing.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Ah, ’tis well then. Young man, my son, I too will give thee my blessing, if thou wilt but go—go instantly—go with half my fortune, go away forever, and leave my reputation unstained.
#RAVENSBANE.
Go away? Ah, sir, with much pleasure.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
You will go? You will leave me my honour—and my Rachel?
#RAVENSBANE.
Rachel? Rachel is yours? No, no, Mistress Rachel is mine. We are ours.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Consider the disgrace.
#RAVENSBANE.
No, no; I have seen her eyes, they are mine; I have seen her smiles, they are mine; she is mine!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Consider, one moment consider—you, an illegitimate—and she—oh, think what thou art!
#RAVENSBANE.
I am Lord Ravensbane: Marquis of Oxford, Baron of Wittenberg, Elector of Worms, and Count—
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Devil’s child! Boor! Buffoon! I will stand thy insults no longer. If thou hast no heart—
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah! my heart!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Hypocrite! Thou canst not fool me. I am thy father.
#RAVENSBANE.
Father!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Stand away. Thou mayst break thy heart and mine and the devil’s, but thou shalt not break Rachel’s.
#RAVENSBANE.
Mistress Rachel is mine—
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Good God! Can it be—his heart?
#RAVENSBANE.
Her eyes are mine; her smiles are mine.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Not a motion; not a sound! Yea, God, Thou art good! ’Tis his heart. He is—ah! he is my son. Judge Almighty, if he should die now; may I not be still a moment more and make sure. No, no, my son—he is changing. Help! Help! Rachel! Master Dickonson! Help! Richard! Cynthia! Come hither!
#RACHEL.
Uncle!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Bring wine. Lord Ravensbane has fainted.
#RACHEL.
Oh! Micah, wine.
#DICKON.
Stay! His pipe! Where is his lordship’s pipe?
#RACHEL.
Oh, terrible!
#MISTRESS MERTON.
What’s the matter?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
He threw it away. He is worse. Bring the wine.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Look! How strange he appears
#RACHEL.
The pipe! His lordship’s pipe! It is lost, Master Dickonson.
#DICKON.
It must be found. This is a heart attack, my friends; his lordship’s life depends on the nicotine.
#RACHEL.
Thank God! Here it is. Shall I—shall I put it in?
#RICHARD.
No! not you.
#RACHEL.
Sir!
#RICHARD.
Let his tutor perform that office.
#RACHEL.
Here, my lord.
#RICHARD AND JUSTICE MERTON.
Rachel!
#RACHEL.
You, too, uncle?
#DICKON.
Pardon me, Mistress Rachel; give the pipe at once. Only a token of true affection can revive his lordship now.
#RICHARD.
I forbid it, Rachel.
#RACHEL.
My lord—my lord!
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Give him air; unbutton his coat. Ah, heavens! What do I see?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Cynthia!
#DICKON.
See! He puffs—he revives. He is coming to himself.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
That waistcoat! that waistcoat! Brother, hast thou never seen it before?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Never, my sister.
#RACHEL.
At last!
#DICKON.
Look! he is restored.
#RACHEL.
God be thanked!
#DICKON.
My lord, Mistress Rachel has saved your life.
#RAVENSBANE.
Mistress Rachel is mine; we are ours.
#RICHARD.
Dare to repeat that.
#RAVENSBANE.
Her eyes are mine.
#RICHARD.
And that, sir, is yours. I believe such is the proper fashion in England. If your lordship’s last duelling wound is sufficiently healed, perhaps you will deign a reply.
#RACHEL.
Richard! Your lordship!
#RAVENSBANE.
Permit me!
#RAVENSBANE.
Believe me, ladies, with the true sincerity of the heart.
#DICKON.
Inflection a little more lachrymose, please: “The true sincerity of the heart.”
#RAVENSBANE.
Believe me, ladies, with the true sincerity of the heart.
#DICKON.
Prettily, prettily! Next!
#RAVENSBANE.
Verily, sir, as that prince of poets, the immortal Virgil, has remarked: “Adeo in teneris consuescere multum est.”
#DICKON.
Hm! Act up to the sentiment.
#RAVENSBANE.
Verily, sir, as that prince—
#DICKON.
No, no; basta! The next.
#RAVENSBANE.
Trust me, your Excellency, I will inform his Majesty of your courtesy.
#DICKON.
His Majesty more emphatic. Remember! You must impress all of the guests this afternoon.
#RAVENSBANE.
His Majesty of your courtesy.
#DICKON.
Delicious! O thou exquisite flower of love! How thy natal composites have burst in bloom: The pumpkin in thee to a golden collarette; thy mop of crow’s wings to these raven locks; thy broomstick to a lordly limp; thy corn - silk to these pale - tinted tassels. Verily in the gallery of scarecrows, thou art the Apollo Belvedere! But continue, Cobby dear: the retort now to the challenge.
#RAVENSBANE.
The second, I believe.
#DICKON.
Quite so, my lord.
#RAVENSBANE.
Sir! The local person whom you represent has done himself the honour of submitting to me a challenge to mortal combat. Sir! Since the remotest times of my feudal ancestors, in such affairs of honour, choice of weapons has ever been the prerogative of the challenged. Sir! This right of etiquette must be observed. Nevertheless, believe me, I have no selfish desire that my superior attainments in this art should assume advantage over my challenger’s ignorance. I have, therefore, chosen those combative utensils most appropriate both to his own humble origin and to local tradition. Permit me, sir, to reveal my choice. There are my weapons
#DICKON.
My darling homunculus! Thou shouldst have acted in Beaumont and Fletcher!
#RAVENSBANE.
There are my weapons!
#DICKON.
I could watch thy histrionics till midnight. But thou art tired, poor Jacky; two hours’ rehearsal is fatiguing to your lordship.
#RAVENSBANE.
Mistress Rachel—I may see her now?
#DICKON.
Romeo! Romeo! Was ever such an amorous puppet show!
#RAVENSBANE.
Mistress Rachel!
#DICKON.
Wait; let me think! Thou art wound up now, my pretty apparatus, for at least six and thirty hours. The wooden angel Gabriel that trumpets the hours on the big clock in Venice is not a more punctual manikin than thou with my speeches. Thou shouldst run, therefore,—
#RAVENSBANE.
Stop talking; permit me! A tutor should know his place.
#DICKON.
Nay, your lordship is beyond comparison.
#RAVENSBANE.
She will come? I shall see her?
#MICAH.
Pardon, my lord.
#RAVENSBANE.
Is it she?
#MICAH.
Captain Bugby, my lord, the Governor’s secretary.
#DICKON.
Good. Squire Talbot’s second. Show him in.
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah! ah
#MICAH.
Beg pardon, sir; shall I remove—
#DICKON.
Drop them; go.
#MICAH.
But, sir—
#DICKON.
Go, thou slave!
#RAVENSBANE.
She will not come! I shall not see her!
#DICKON.
Here, my lord; read. You must be found reading.
#RAVENSBANE.
She does not come!
#DICKON.
Fie, fie, Jack; thou must not be breaking thy Dickon’s apron - strings with a will of thine own. Come!
#RAVENSBANE.
Mistress Rachel
#DICKON.
Be good, boy, and thou shalt see her soon.
#RAVENSBANE.
I shall see her?
#DICKON.
Your lordship was saying—Oh! Captain Bugby?
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Captain Bugby, sir, ah! at Lord Ravensbane’s service—ah!
#DICKON.
I am Master Dickonson, his lordship’s tutor.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Happy, sir.
#DICKON.
My lord, this gentleman waits upon you from Squire Talbot. In regard to the challenge of this morning, I presume?
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
The affair, ah! the affair of this morning, sir.
#RAVENSBANE.
The second, I believe?
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Quite so, my lord.
#RAVENSBANE.
Sir! the local person whom you represent has done himself the honour of submitting to me a challenge to mortal combat. Sir! Since the remotest times of my feudal ancestors, in such affairs of honour, choice of weapons has ever been the prerogative of the challenged. Sir! this right of etiquette must be observed.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Indeed, yes, my lord.
#DICKON.
Pray do not interrupt. Your lordship: “observed.”
#RAVENSBANE.
—observed. Nevertheless, believe me, I have no selfish desire that my superior attainments in this art should assume advantage over my challenger’s ignorance. I have, therefore, chosen those combative utensils most appropriate both to his own humble origin and to local tradition. Permit me, sir, to reveal my choice. There are my weapons!
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
These, my lord?
#RAVENSBANE.
Those.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
But these are—are flails.
#RAVENSBANE.
Flails.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Flails, my lord?
#RAVENSBANE.
There are my weapons.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Lord Ravensbane—I—ah! express myself ill—Do I understand that your lordship and Squire Talbot—
#RAVENSBANE.
Exactly.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
But your lordship—flails!
#RAVENSBANE.
My adversary should be deft in their use. He has doubtless wielded them frequently on his barn floor.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Ahaha! I understand now. Your lordship—ah! is a wit. Haha! Flails!
#DICKON.
His lordship’s satire is poignant.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Indeed, sir, so keen that I must apologize for laughing at my principal’s expense. My lord, if you will deign to speak one moment seriously—
#RAVENSBANE.
Seriously?
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
I will take pleasure in informing Squire Talbot—ah! as to your real preference for—
#RAVENSBANE.
For flails, sir. I have, permit me, nothing further to say. Flails are final.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Must I really report to Squire Talbot—ah!—flails?
#DICKON.
Lord Ravensbane’s will is inflexible.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
And his wit, sir, incomparable. I am sorry for the Squire, but ’twill be the greatest joke in years. Ah! will you tell me—is it— is it the latest fashion?
#DICKON.
Lord Ravensbane is always the latest.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Obliged servant, sir. Aha! Such a joke as—O lord! flails!
#DICKON.
Bravo, my pumpky dear! That squelches the jealous betrothed. Now nothing remains but for you to continue to dazzle the enamoured Rachel, and so present yourself to the Justice as a pseudo - son - nephew - in - law.
#RAVENSBANE.
I may go to Mistress Rachel?
#DICKON.
She will come to you. She is reading now a poem from you, which I left on her dressing - table.
#RAVENSBANE.
She is reading a poem from me?
#DICKON.
With your pardon, my lord, I penned it for you. I am something of a poetaster. Indeed, I flatter myself that I have dictated some of the finest lines in literature.
#RAVENSBANE.
Dickon! She will come?
#DICKON.
She comes! Hush! Step aside; step aside first. Let her read it.
#RACHEL.
Once more, “To Mistress R——, enchantress: If faith in witchcraft be a sin, Alas! what peril he is in Who plights his faith and love in thee, Sweetest maid of sorcery. If witchcraft be a whirling brain, roving eye, a heart of pain, Whose wound no thread of fate can stitch, How hast thou conjured, cruel witch, With the brain, eye, heart, and total mortal residue of thine enamoured LANTHORNE,.
#DICKON.
Now to leave the turtles alone.
#RACHEL.
“To Mistress R——, enchantress: If faith in witchcraft be—” “To Mistress R——.” R! It must be. R—— must mean—
#RAVENSBANE.
Rachel!
#RACHEL.
Ah! How you surprised me, my lord.
#RAVENSBANE.
You are come again; you are come again.
#RACHEL.
Has anything happened? Tell me, my lord. Has Squire Talbot been here?
#RAVENSBANE.
No, Mistress Rachel; not here.
#RACHEL.
And you have not—Oh, my lord, I have been in such terror. But you are safe.—You have not fought?
#RAVENSBANE.
No, Mistress Rachel; not fought.
#RACHEL.
Thank God for that! But you will promise me—promise me that there shall be—no—duel!
#RAVENSBANE.
I promise Mistress Rachel there shall be no duel.
#RACHEL.
Your lordship is so good. You do not know how gratefully happy I am.
#RAVENSBANE.
I know I am only a thing to make Mistress Rachel happy. Ah! look at me once more. When you look at me, I live.
#RACHEL.
It is strange indeed, my lord, how the familiar world, the daylight the heavens themselves have changed since your arrival.
#RAVENSBANE.
This is the world; this is the light; this is the heavens themselves. Mistress Rachel is looking at me.
#RACHEL.
For me, it is less strange perhaps. I never saw a real lord before. But you, my lord, must have seen so many, many girls in the great world.
#RAVENSBANE.
No, no; never.
#RACHEL.
No other girls before to - day, my lord!
#RAVENSBANE.
Before to - day? I do not know; I do not care. I was not here. To - day I was born—in your eyes. Ah! my brain whirls!
#RACHEL.
“If witchcraft be a whirling brain, roving eye, a heart of pain,—” My lord, do you really believe in witchcraft?
#RAVENSBANE.
With all my heart.
#RACHEL.
And approve of it?
#RAVENSBANE.
With all my soul.
#RACHEL.
So do I—that is, innocent witchcraft; not to harm anybody, you know, but just to feel all the dark mystery and the trembling excitement—the way you feel when you blow out your candle all alone in your bedroom and watch the little smoke fade away in the moonshine.
#RAVENSBANE.
Fade away in the moonshine!
#RACHEL.
Oh, but we mustn’t speak of it. In a town like this, all such mysticism is considered damnable. But your lordship understands and approves? I am so glad! Have you read the “Philosophical Considerations” of Glanville, the “Saducismus Triumphatus,” and the “Presignifications of Dreams”? What kind of witchcraft, my lord, do you believe in?
#RAVENSBANE.
In all yours.
#RACHEL.
Nay, your lordship must not take me for a real witch. I can only tell fortunes, you know—like this morning.
#RAVENSBANE.
I know; you told how my heart would break.
#RACHEL.
Oh, that’s palmistry, and that isn’t always certain. But the surest way to prophesy—do you know what it is?
#RAVENSBANE.
Tell me.
#RACHEL.
To count the crows. Do you know how? One for sorrow—
#RAVENSBANE.
Ha, yes!—Two for mirth!
#RACHEL.
Three for a wedding—
#RAVENSBANE.
Four for a birth—
#RACHEL.
And five for the happiest thing on earth!
#RAVENSBANE.
Mistress Rachel, come! Let us go and count five crows.
#RACHEL.
Why, my lord, how did you ever learn it? I got it from an old goody here in town—a real witch - wife. If you will promise not to tell a secret, I will show you.—But you must promise!
#RAVENSBANE.
I promise.
#RACHEL.
Come, then. I will show you a real piece of witchcraft that I bought from her this morning—the glass of truth. There! Behind that curtain. If you look in, you will see—But come; I will show you. Just pull that string, and—ah!
#DICKON.
Your pipe, my lord?
#RACHEL.
Master Dickonson, how you frightened me!
#DICKON.
So excessively sorry! I was observing the portrait of your uncle. I believe you were showing his lordship—
#RACHEL.
Oh, nothing; nothing at all.
#RAVENSBANE.
Why do you come?
#DICKON.
Allow me. ’Tis high time you came to the point, Jack; ’tis near your lordship’s reception. Woo and win, boy; woo and win.
#RAVENSBANE.
Leave me.
#DICKON.
Your lordship’s humble, very humble.
#RACHEL.
Oh! he is gone. My dear lord, why do you keep this man?
#RAVENSBANE.
I—keep this man?
#RACHEL.
I cannot—pardon my rudeness—I cannot endure him.
#RAVENSBANE.
You do not like him? Ah, then, I do not like him also. We will send him away—you and I.
#RACHEL.
You, my lord, of course; but I—
#RAVENSBANE.
You will be Dickon! You will be with me always and light my pipe. And I will live for you, and fight for you, and kill your betrothed.
#RACHEL.
No, no!
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah! but your eyes say “yes.” Mistress Rachel leaves me; but Rachel in her eyes remains. Is it not so?
#RACHEL.
What can I say, my lord! It is true that since my eyes met yours, a new passion has entered into my soul. I have felt—your lordship will laugh at me—I have felt an inexpressible longing—but ’tis so impertinent, my lord, so absurd in me, a mere girl, and you a nobleman of power—yet I have felt it irresistibly, my dear lord,—a longing to help you. I am so sorry for you—so sorry for you! I pity you deeply.—Forgive me; forgive me, my lord!
#RAVENSBANE.
It is enough.
#RACHEL.
Indeed, indeed, ’tis so rude of me,—’tis so unreasonable.
#RAVENSBANE.
It is enough. I grow—I grow—I grow! I am a plant; you give it rain and sun. I am a flower; you give it light and dew; I am a soul, you give it love and speech. I grow. Towards you—towards you I grow!
#RACHEL.
My lord, I do not understand it, how so poor and mere a girl as I can have helped you. Yet I do believe it is so; for I feel it so. What can I do for you?
#RAVENSBANE.
Do not leave me. Be mine. Let me be yours.
#RACHEL.
Ah! but, my lord—do I love you?
#RAVENSBANE.
What is “I love you”? Is it a kiss, a sigh, an embrace? Ah! then, you do not love me.—“I love you”: is it to nourish, to nestle, to lift up, to smile upon, to make greater—a worm? Ah! then, you love me.
#RACHEL.
Do not speak so of yourself, my lord; nor exalt me so falsely.
#RAVENSBANE.
Be mine. great glory has descended upon this day.
#RAVENSBANE.
Be mine.
#RACHEL.
Could I but be sure that this glory is love—Oh, then!
#RICHARD.
It is not love; it is witchcraft.
#RACHEL.
Who are you?—Richard?
#RICHARD.
You have indeed forgotten me? Would to God, Rachel, I could forget you.
#RAVENSBANE.
Sir, permit me—
#RICHARD.
Silence! Against my will, I am a convert to your own mysticism; for nothing less than damnable illusion could so instantly wean your heart from me to—this. I do not pretend to understand it; but that it is witchcraft I am convinced; and I will save you from it.
#RACHEL.
Go; please go.
#RAVENSBANE.
Permit me, sir; you have not replied yet to flails!
#RICHARD.
Permit me, sir. My answer is—bare cob! Thresh this, sir, for your antagonist. ’Tis the only one worthy your lordship.
#RAVENSBANE.
Upon my honour, as a man—
#RICHARD.
As a man forsooth! Were you indeed a man, Lord Ravensbane, I would have accepted your weapons, and flailed you out of New England. But it is not my custom to chastise runagates from asylums, or to banter further words with a natural and a ninny.
#RACHEL.
Squire Talbot! Will you leave my uncle’s house?
#RAVENSBANE.
One moment, mistress:—I did not wholly catch the import of this gentleman’s speech, but I fancy I have insulted him by my reply to his challenge. One insult may perhaps be remedied by another. Sir, permit me to call you a ninny, and to offer you— swords.
#RICHARD.
Thanks; I reject the offer.
#RAVENSBANE.
He rejects it. Well!
#RACHEL.
And now will you leave?
#RICHARD.
At once. But one word more. Rachel—Rachel, have you forgotten this morning and the glass of truth?
#RACHEL.
No.
#RICHARD.
Call it a fancy now if you will. I scoffed at it; yes. Yet you believed it. I loved you truly, you said. Well, have I changed?
#RACHEL.
Yes.
#RICHARD.
Will you test me again—in the glass?
#RACHEL.
No. Go; leave us.
#RICHARD.
I will go. I have still a word with your aunt.
#RAVENSBANE.
I beg your pardon, sir. You said just now that had I been a man—
#RICHARD.
I say, Lord Ravensbane, that the straight fibre of a true man never warps the love of a woman. As for yourself, you have my contempt and pity. Pray to God, sir, pray to God to make you a man.
#RACHEL.
Oh! it is intolerable! My dear lord, I do believe in my heart that I love you, and if so, I will with gratitude be your wife. But, my lord, strange glamours, strange darknesses reel, and bewilder my mind. I must be alone; I must think and decide. Will you give me this tassel?
#RAVENSBANE.
Oh, take it.
#RACHEL.
If I decide that I love you, that I will be your wife—I will wear it this afternoon at the reception. Good - by.
#RAVENSBANE.
Mistress Rachel!— God, are you here? Dear God, I pray to you—make me to be a man!
#DICKON.
Poor Jacky! Thou shouldst ’a’ prayed to t’other one.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
That is the portrait.
#RICHARD.
Indeed! The design is very like.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
’Tis more than like, Richard; ’tis the very same. Two and twenty years ago she embroidered it for him, and he would insist on wearing it for the portrait he was then sitting for.
#RICHARD.
That same Goody Rickby! pretty girl!—and a wild young man was my brother. The truth comes hard to tell thee, Richard; but he was wild, Gilead was wild. He told me the babe had died. But God worketh His own righteousness. Only—he must be saved now; Rachel must be saved; we must all be saved.
#RICHARD.
You feel sure—very sure, Mistress Merton?
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Yea, that waistcoat; ’tis the very one, I know it too well. And you see it accounts for all,—this silly impostor lord; my brother’s strange patronage of him; the blackmail of this Master Dickonson—
#RICHARD.
But who is he?
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Nay, heaven knows! Some old crony perchance of Gilead’s youth; some confederate of this woman Rickby.
#RICHARD.
O God!—And Rachel sacrificed to these impostors; to an illegitimate—your brother would allow it!
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Ah! but think of his own reputation, Richard. He a justice—the family honour!
#RICHARD.
’Tis enough. Well, and I must see this Goody Rickby, you think?
#MISTRESS MERTON.
At once—at once. My brother has invited guests for this afternoon to meet “his lordship”! Return, if possible, before they come. She dwells at the blacksmith shop—you must buy her off. Oh, gold will buy her; ’tis the gold they’re after—all of them; have her recall both these persons. Take her that, Richard, and promise her more.
#RICHARD.
Keep it, Mistress Merton. I have enough gold, methinks, for my future wife’s honour; or if not, I will earn it.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Richard! Ah, the dear lad, he should have taken it.
#MICAH.
The minister and his wife have turned into the gate, madam.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
The guests! Is it so late?
#MICAH.
Four o’clock, madam. Shall I remove these?
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Flails! Flails in the parlour? Of course, remove them.
#MICAH.
Madam, in all my past years of service at Merton House, I never waited upon a lord till to - day. Madam, in all my future years of service at Merton House, I trust I may never wait upon a lord again.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Micah, mind the knocker.
#MICAH.
Yes, madam.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Rachel! Rachel!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
So you are contented with nothing less than the sacrifice of my niece?
#DICKON.
Such a delightful room!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Are you merciless?
#DICKON.
And such a living portrait of your worship! The waistcoat is so beautifully executed.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
If I pay him ten thousand pounds—
#MICAH.
Minister Dodge, your worship; and Mistress Dodge.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Believe me, this is a great privilege.—Madam!
#MINISTER DODGE.
The privilege is ours, Justice; to enter a righteous man’s house is to stand, as it were, on God’s threshold.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Amen, amen. Permit me—ah! Lord Ravensbane, my young guest of honour, will be here directly—permit me to present his lordship’s tutor, Master Dickonson; The Reverend Master Dodge, Mistress Dodge.
#MINISTER DODGE.
Master Dickonson, sir—
#DICKON.
Madam, of all professions in the world, your husband’s most allures me.
#MISTRESS DODGE.
’Tis a worthy one, sir.
#DICKON.
Ah! Mistress Dodge, and so arduous—especially for a minister’s wife.
#MISTRESS DODGE.
Thank you.
#MINISTER DODGE.
Lord Ravensbane comes from abroad?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
From London.
#MINISTER DODGE.
An old friend of yours, I understand.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
From London, yes. Did I say from London? Quite so; from London.
#MICAH.
Captain Bugby, the Governor’s secretary.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Justice Merton, your very humble servant.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Believe me, Captain Bugby.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Ah, Master Dickonson! my dear friend Master Dickonson—this is indeed—ah! How is his lordship since—aha! but discretion! Mistress Dodge—her servant! Ah! yes, the latest, I assure you; the very latest from London. Ask Master Dickonson.
#MINISTER DODGE.
These will hatch out in the springtime.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
But really, my good friend, may not I venture to inquire how his lordship—ah! has been in health since the—ah! since—
#DICKON.
Oh! quite, quite!
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
You know, I informed Squire Talbot of his lordship’s epigrammatic retort—his retort of—shh! ha haha! Oh, that reply was a stiletto; ’twas sharper than a sword - thrust, I assure you. To have conceived it—’twas inspiration; but to have expressed it—oh! ’twas genius. Hush! “Flails!” Oh! It sticks me now in the ribs. I shall die with concealing it.
#MINISTER DODGE.
’Tis true, mistress; but if there were more like your brother in the parish, the conscience of the community would be clearer.
#MICAH.
The Reverend Master Rand of Harvard College; the Reverend Master Todd of Harvard College.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Permit me, gentlemen; this is fortunate—before your return to Cambridge.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Really, I cannot understand what keeps his Excellency, the Lieutenant Governor, so long. He has two such charming daughters, Master Dickonson—
#DICKON.
Yes, yes; such suspicious women with their charms are an insult to the virtuous ladies of the parish.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
How, sir!
#MISTRESS DODGE.
And to think that she should actually shoe horses herself!
#DICKON.
It is too hard, dear Mistress Dodge; too hard!
#MISTRESS DODGE.
You are so appreciative, Master Dickonson.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Well! It would not be countenanced in the college yard, sir. pipe! Nay, mores inhibitae!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
’Tis most unfortunate, gentlemen; but I understand ’tis the new vogue in London.
#MICAH.
His Excellency, Sir Charles Reddington, Lieutenant Governor; the Mistress Reddingtons.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
At last!
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Micah.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Your Excellency, this is indeed a distinguished honour.
#SIR CHARLES.
Fine weather, Merton. Where’s your young lord?
#THE TWO GIRLS.
Justice Merton, Mistress Merton.
#MICAH.
I will speak to them, madam.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Oh, my dear Mistress Reddington! Charming Mistress Amelia! You are so very late, but you shall hear—hush!
#MISTRESS REDDINGTON.
Why, what is this, Captain?
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Oh, the latest, I assure you, the very latest. Wait till you see his lordship.
#AMELIA.
What! isn’t he here? La, Captain! Do look at the man!
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Oh, he’s coming directly. Quite the mode—what? Ah! but, ladies, you shall hear.
#SIR CHARLES.
What say? Travelling for his health?
#DICKON.
Partially, your Excellency; but my young pupil and master is a singularly affectionate nature.
#THE TWO GIRLS.
What! flails—really!
#DICKON.
He has journeyed here to Massachusetts peculiarly to pay this visit to Justice Merton—his father’s dearest friend.
#SIR CHARLES.
Ah! knew him abroad, eh?
#DICKON.
In Rome, your Excellency.
#MISTRESS DODGE.
Why, I thought it was in London.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
London, true, quite so; we made a trip together to Lisbon—ah! Rome.
#DICKON.
Paris, was it not, sir?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Paris, Paris, very true; I am—I am—sometimes I am—
#MICAH.
Lord Ravensbane.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Ah! his lordship is arrived.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Look!—Now!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Welcome, my lord! Permit me, your Excellency, to introduce—
#RAVENSBANE.
Permit me; Mistress Rachel will introduce—
#RACHEL.
Sir Charles, allow me to present my friend, Lord Ravensbane.
#MISTRESS REDDINGTON.
Her friend—did you hear?
#SIR CHARLES.
Mistress Rachel, I see you are as pretty as ever. Lord Ravensbane, your hand, sir.
#RAVENSBANE.
Trust me, your Excellency, I will inform his Majesty of your courtesy.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
On my life! he’s lost his limp.
#RAVENSBANE.
“A great glory has descended upon this day.”
#RACHEL.
My lord!
#RAVENSBANE.
Be sure—O mistress, be sure—that this glory is love.
#SIR CHARLES.
Hoho! is it congratulations for your niece?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Not—not precisely.
#DICKON.
Why so, Gilly?
#SIR CHARLES.
My daughters, Fanny and Amelia—Lord Ravensbane.
#THE TWO GIRLS.
Your lordship!
#SIR CHARLES.
Good girls, but silly.
#THE TWO GIRLS.
Papa!
#RAVENSBANE.
Believe me, ladies, with the true sincerity of the heart.
#MISTRESS REDDINGTON.
Isn’t he perfection!
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
What said I?
#AMELIA.
I can’t help thinking of flails.
#MISTRESS REDDINGTON.
Poor Squire Talbot! We must be nice to him now.
#AMELIA.
Oh, especially now!
#RAVENSBANE.
Verily, sir, as that prince of poets, the immortal Virgil, has remarked: “Adeo in teneris consuescere multum est.”
#DICKON.
Just a word, your worship.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Intolerable! His lordship is evidently a university man. Evidently most accomplished.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
song! Why, it is beyond all bounds of custom and decorum.
#DICKON.
Believe me, there is no such flatterer to win the maiden heart as music.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
And here; in this presence! Never!
#DICKON.
Nevertheless, it will amuse me vastly, and you will announce it.
#RAVENSBANE.
My opinion is simple: In such matters of church government, I am inclined toward the leniency of that excellent master, the Rev. John Wise, rather than the righteous obduracy of the Rev. Cotton Mather.
#MINISTER DODGE.
Why, there, sir, I agree with you. How extremely well informed!
#MISTRESS DODGE.
And so young, too!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Your Excellency and friends, I have great pleasure in announcing his lordship’s condescension in consenting to regale our present company—with a song.
#SEVERAL VOICES.
song!
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Gilead! What is this?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
The selection is a German ballad—a particular favourite at the court of Prussia, where his lordship last rendered it. His tutor has made a translation which is entitled: “The Prognostication of the Crows,” and I am requested to remind you that in the ancient heathen mythology of Germany, the crow or raven, was the fateful bird of the God Woden.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
How prodigiously novel!
#MINISTER DODGE.
Unparalleled! ballad! Come now, that sounds like old England again. Let’s have it. Will his lordship sing without music?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Master Dickonson, hem! has been—persuaded—to accompany his lordship on the virginals.
#AMELIA.
How delightful! Shall we remain? We must.
#RAVENSBANE.
My tassel, dear mistress; you do not wear it?
#RACHEL.
My heart still wavers, my lord. But whilst you sing, I will decide.
#RAVENSBANE.
Whilst I sing? My fate, then, is waiting at the end of a song?
#RACHEL.
At the end of a song.
#DICKON.
Your lordship.
#RAVENSBANE.
Permit me. Baron von Rabenstod arose; Before him flew a flock of crows: Sing heigh! Sing heigh! Sing heigh! Sing— “Ill speed, ill speed thee, baron - wight; Ill speed thy palfrey pawing! Blithe is the morn but black the night That hears a raven’s cawing.” Caw! Caw! Caw!
#MISTRESS DODGE.
Did you hear them?
#MINISTER DODGE.
Hush!
#AMELIA.
What can it be?
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Oh, the latest, be sure.
#DICKON.
You note, my friends, the accompanying harmonics; they are an intrinsic part of the ballad, and may not be omitted.
#RAVENSBANE.
The baron reckèd not a pin; He rode to woo, he rode to win; Sing heigh! Sing heigh! Sing heigh! Sing— He rode into his prince’s hall Through knights and damsels flow’ry: “Thy daughter, prince, I bid thee call; I claim her hand and dowry.”
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Well?
#RICHARD.
Gold will not buy her. She defies us.
#SIR CHARLES.
This gentleman’s playing is rather ventriloquistical.
#CAPTAIN BUGBY.
Quite, as it were. This smells unholy. Shall we leave?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Not now.
#RICHARD.
Pardon me—it must be now.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Squire Talbot—
#RICHARD.
Sir—I come from Goody Rickby.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Hush!
#RAVENSBANE.
“What cock is this, with crest so high, That crows with such a pother?” “Baron von Rabenstod am I; Methinks we know each other.” “Now welcome, welcome, dear guest of mine, So long why didst thou tarry? Now, for the sake of auld lang syne, My daughter thou shalt marry.”
#RICHARD.
What! you will sacrifice her?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
What can I do?
#RICHARD.
Tell her the truth at least.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Never, Richard, no, no, never that!
#AMELIA.
And he kept right on smoking!
#MINISTER DODGE.
This smacks of witchcraft. The Justice seems moved.
#RAVENSBANE.
The bride is brought, the priest as well; They stood beside the altar rail; Sing ah! Sing ah! Sing ah! Sing— “Woman, with this ring I thee wed.” What makes his voice so awing? The baron by the bride is dead: Outside the crows were cawing. Chorus. Caw! Caw! Caw!
#MINISTER DODGE.
This is no longer godly.—Justice Merton!
#RICHARD.
I told you, sir, that witchcraft, like murder, will out. If you want further proof, I believe I can provide it.
#MINISTER DODGE.
Justice Merton, sir!
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah! and you have my tassel!
#RACHEL.
See! I will wear it now. You yourself shall fasten it.
#RAVENSBANE.
Rachel! Mistress!
#RACHEL.
My dear lord!
#RICHARD.
Lovers! This is the glass of truth. Behold yourselves!
#RACHEL.
Ah! Do not look!
#DICKON.
Too late!
#RAVENSBANE.
What is there?
#RACHEL.
Leave me! Leave me!—Richard!
#RAVENSBANE.
Help her! See! It is seizing her.
#RACHEL.
Richard!
#RAVENSBANE.
Fear not, mistress, I will kill the thing. Ah! ah! fear’st thou me? What art thou? Why, ’tis a glass. Thou mockest me? Look, look, mistress, it mocks me! O God, no! no! Take it away. Dear God, do not look!—It is I!
#ALL.
Witchcraft! Witchcraft!
#RAVENSBANE.
All have left me—but not thou. Rachel has left me; her eyes have turned away from me; she is gone. And with her, the great light itself from heaven has drawn her glorious skirts, contemptuous, from me—and they are gone together. Dickon, he too has left me—but not thou. All that I loved, all that loved me, have left me. A thousand ages—a thousand ages ago, they went away; and thou and I have gazed upon each other’s desertedness. Speak! and be pitiful! If thou art I, inscrutable image, if thou dost feel these pangs thine own, show then self - mercy; speak! What art thou? What am I? Why are we here? How comes it that we feel and guess and suffer? Nay, though thou answer not these doubts, yet mock them, mock them aloud, even as there, monstrous, thou counterfeitest mine actions. Speak, abject enigma!—Ah! with what vacant horror it looks out and yearns toward me. Peace to thee! Thou poor delirious mute, prisoned in glass and moonlight, peace! Thou canst not escape thy gaol, nor I break in to thee. Poor shadow, thou— Stand back, inanity! Thrust not thy mawkish face in pity toward me. Ape and idiot! Scarecrow!—to console me! Haha!—A flail and broomstick! a cob, a gourd and pumpkin, to fuse and sublimate themselves into a mage - philosopher, who puffeth metaphysics from a pipe and discourseth sweet philanthropy to itself—itself, God! Dost Thou hear? Itself! For even such am whom Thou madest to love Rachel. Why, God—haha! dost Thou dwell in this thing? Is it Thou that peerest forth at me—from me? Why, hark then; Thou shalt listen, and answer—if Thou canst. Hark then, Spirit of life! Between the rise and setting of a sun, I have walked in this world of Thine. I have gazed upon it, I have peered within it, I have grown enamoured, enamoured of it. I have been thrilled with wonder, I have been calmed with knowledge, I have been exalted with sympathy. I have trembled with joy and passion. Power, beauty, love have ravished me. Infinity itself, like a dream, has blazed before me with the certitude of prophecy; and I have cried, “This world, the heavens, time itself, are mine to conquer,” and I have thrust forth mine arm to wear Thy shield forever—and lo! for my shield Thou reachest me a mirror—and whisperest: “Know thyself! Thou art—a scarecrow: a tinkling clod, a rigmarole of dust, a lump of ordure, contemptible, superfluous, inane!” Haha! Hahaha! And with such scarecrows Thou dost people a planet! O ludicrous! Monstrous! Ludicrous! At least, I thank Thee, God! at least, this breathing bathos can laugh at itself. At least this hotch - potch nobleman of stubble is enough of an epicure to turn his own gorge. Thou hast vouchsafed to me, Spirit,—hahaha!—to know myself. Mine, mine is the consummation of man—even self - contempt! Scarecrow! Scarecrow! Scarecrow!
#THE IMAGE IN THE GLASS.
Scarecrow! Scarecrow! Scarecrow!
#RAVENSBANE.
What face are you, high up through the twinkling leaves? Why do you smile upon me with such white beneficence? Or why do you place your viewless hand upon my brow, and say, “Be comforted”? Do you not, like all the rest, turn, aghast, your eyes away from me—me, abject enormity, grovelling at your feet? Gracious being, do you not fear—despise me? To you alone am I not hateful—unredeemed? O white peace of the world, beneath your gaze the clouds glow silver, and the herded cattle, slumbering far afield, crouch—beautiful. The slough shines lustrous as a bridal veil. Beautiful face, you are Rachel’s, and you have changed the world. Nothing is mean, but you have made it miraculous; nothing is loathsome, nothing ludicrous, but you have converted it to loveliness, that even this shadow of a mockery myself, cast by your light, gives me the dear assurance I am a man. Yea, more, that I too, steeped in your universal light, am beautiful. For you are Rachel, and you love me. You are Rachel in the sky, and the might of your serene loveliness has transformed me. Rachel, mistress, mother, beautiful spirit, out of my suffering you have brought forth my soul. I am saved! very pretty sophistry.
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah! what voice has snatched you from me? most poetified pumpkin!
#RAVENSBANE.
Thing! dost thou speak at last? My soul abhors thee.
#THE IMAGE IN THE GLASS.
I am thy soul.
#RAVENSBANE.
Thou liest.
#THE IMAGE IN THE GLASS.
Our Daddy Dickon and our mother Rickby begot and conceived us at sunrise, in a Jack - o’ - lantern.
#RAVENSBANE.
Thou liest, torturing illusion. Thou art but a phantom in a glass.
#THE IMAGE IN THE GLASS.
Why, very true. So art thou. We are a pretty phantom in a glass.
#RAVENSBANE.
It is a lie. I am no longer thou. I feel it; I am a man.
#THE IMAGE IN THE GLASS.
And prithee, what’s a man? Man’s but a mirror, Wherein the imps and angels play charades, Make faces, mope, and pull each other’s hair— Till crack! the sly urchin Death shivers the glass, And the bare coffin boards show underneath.
#RAVENSBANE.
Yea! if it be so, thou coggery! if both of us be indeed but illusions, why, now let us end together. But if it be not so, then let me for evermore be free of thee. Now is the test—the glass! I’ll play your urchin Death and shatter it. Let see what shall survive!
#DICKON.
I wouldn’t, really!
#RAVENSBANE.
Dickon! dear Dickon! is it you?
#DICKON.
Yes, Jacky! it’s dear Dickon, and I really wouldn’t.
#RAVENSBANE.
Wouldn’t what, Dickon?
#DICKON.
Sweep the cobwebs off the sky with thine aspiring broomstick. When a man questions fate, ’tis bad digestion. When a scarecrow does it, ’tis bad taste.
#RAVENSBANE.
At last, you will tell me the truth, Dickon! Am I then—that thing?
#DICKON.
You mustn’t be so sceptical. Of course you’re that thing.
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah me despicable! Rachel, why didst thou ever look upon me?
#DICKON.
I fear, cobby, thou hast never studied woman’s heart and hero - worship. Take thyself now. I remarked to Goody Bess, thy mother, this morning, as I was chucking her thy pate from the hay - loft, that thou wouldst make a Mark Antony or an Alexander before night.
#RAVENSBANE.
Thou, then, didst create me!
#DICKON.
Appreciate the honour. Your lordship was designed for a corn - field; but I discerned nobler potentialities: the courts of Europe and Justice Merton’s salon. In brief, your lordship’s origins were pastoral, like King David’s.
#RAVENSBANE.
Cease! cease! in pity’s name. You do not know the agony of being ridiculous.
#DICKON.
Nay, Jacky, all mortals are ridiculous. Like you, they were rummaged out of the muck; and like you, they shall return to the dunghill. I advise ’em, like you, to enjoy the interim, and smoke.
#RAVENSBANE.
This pipe, this ludicrous pipe that I forever set to my lips and puff! Why must I, Dickon? Why?
#DICKON.
To avoid extinction—merely. You see, ’tis just as your fellow in there explained. You yourself are the subtlest of mirrors, polished out of pumpkin and pipe - smoke. Into this mirror the fair Mistress Rachel has projected her lovely image, and thus provided you with what men call a soul.
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah! then, I have a soul—the truth of me? Mistress Rachel has indeed made me a man?
#DICKON.
Don’t flatter thyself, cobby. Break thy pipe, and whiff—soul, Mistress Rachel, man, truth, and this pretty world itself, go up in the last smoke.
#RAVENSBANE.
No, no! not Mistress Rachel—for she is beautiful; and the images of beauty are immutable. She told me so.
#DICKON.
What a Platonic young lady! Nevertheless, believe me, Mistress Rachel exists for your lordship merely in your lordship’s pipe - bowl.
#RAVENSBANE.
Wretched, niggling caricature that I am! All is lost to me—all!
#DICKON.
“Paradise Lost” again! Always blaming it on me. There’s that gaunt fellow in England has lately wrote a parody on me when I was in the apple business.
#RAVENSBANE.
O God! I am so contemptible!
#DICKON.
Good verse, too, for a parody! “Farewell, happy fields Where joy forever dwells! Hail, horrors; hail, Infernal world! and thou, profoundest Hell, Receive thy new possessor.”
#GOODY RICKBY.
Dickon!
#DICKON.
Hullo! You, Bess!
#GOODY RICKBY.
There’s not a minute to lose. Justice Merton and the neighbours have ended their conference at Minister Dodge’s, and are returning here.
#DICKON.
What! coming back in the dark? They ran away in the daylight as if the ghosts were after ’em.
#GOODY RICKBY.
I see their lanterns down the road.
#DICKON.
Well, let ’em come. We’re ready.
#GOODY RICKBY.
But thou toldst me they had discovered— scarecrow in a mirror. Well? The glass is bewitched; that’s all.
#GOODY RICKBY.
All? Witchcraft is hanging—that’s all! Come, how shall the mirror help us?
#DICKON.
’Tis very simple. The glass is bewitched. Mistress Rachel—mind you—shall admit it. She bought it of you.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Yea, of me; ’twill be me they’ll hang.
#DICKON.
Good! then the glass is bewitched. The glass bewitches the room; for witchcraft is catching and spreads like the small - pox. Ergo, the distorted image of Lord Ravensbane; ergo, the magical accompaniments of the ballad; ergo, the excited fancies of all the persons in the room. Ergo, the glass must needs be destroyed, and the room thoroughly disinfected by the Holy Scriptures. Ergo, Master Dickonson himself reads the Bible aloud, the guests apologize and go home, the Justice squirms again in his merry dead past, and his fair niece is wed to the pumpkin.
#RAVENSBANE.
Hideous! Hideous!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Your grateful servant, Devil! But the mirror was bought of me—of me, the witch. Wilt thou be my hangman, Dickon?
#DICKON.
Wilt thou give me a kiss, Goody? When did ever thy Dickon desert thee?
#GOODY RICKBY.
But how, boy, wilt thou—
#DICKON.
Trust me, and thy son. When the Justice’s niece is thy daughter - in - law, all will be safe. For the Justice will cherish his niece’s family.
#GOODY RICKBY.
But when he knows—
#DICKON.
But he shall not know. How can he? When the glass is denounced as fraudulent, how will he, or any person, ever know that we made this fellow out of rubbish? Who, forsooth, but a poet—or a devil—would believe it? You mustn’t credit men with our imaginations, my dear.
#RAVENSBANE.
Mockery! Always mockery!
#GOODY RICKBY.
Then thou wilt pull me through this safe?
#DICKON.
As I adore thee—and my own reputation.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Till we meet, then, boy.
#DICKON.
Stay, marchioness—his lordship!
#GOODY RICKBY.
His lordship’s pardon! How fares “the bottom of thy heart,” my son?
#DICKON.
My lord—your lady mother.
#RAVENSBANE.
Begone, woman.
#GOODY RICKBY.
Your servant—my son!
#RAVENSBANE.
Ye lie! Both of you! Ye lie—I was born of Rachel.
#DICKON.
Tut, tut, Jacky; you mustn’t mix up mothers and prospective wives at your age. It’s fatal.
#GOODY RICKBY.
They’re coming!
#DICKON.
Fear not; if thou shouldst be followed, I will overtake thee.
#RAVENSBANE.
She is coming; Rachel is coming, and I may not look upon her!
#DICKON.
Eh? Why not?
#RAVENSBANE.
I am a monster.
#DICKON.
And born of her—Fie! fie!
#RAVENSBANE.
O God! I know not; I mock myself; I know not what to think. But this I know, I love Rachel. I love her, I love her.
#DICKON.
And shalt have her.
#RAVENSBANE.
Have her, Dickon?
#DICKON.
For lover and wife.
#RAVENSBANE.
For wife?
#DICKON.
For wife and all. Thou hast but to obey.
#RAVENSBANE.
Ah! who will do this for me?
#DICKON.
I!
#RAVENSBANE.
Dickon! Wilt make me a man—a man and worthy of her?
#DICKON.
Fiddlededee! I make over no masterpieces. Thy mistress shall be Cinderella, and drive to her palace with her gilded pumpkin.
#RAVENSBANE.
It is the end.
#DICKON.
What! You’ll not?
#RAVENSBANE.
Never.
#DICKON.
Harkee, manikin. Hast thou learned to suffer?
#RAVENSBANE.
O God!
#DICKON.
I taught thee. Shall I teach thee further?
#RAVENSBANE.
Thou canst not.
#DICKON.
Cannot—ha! What if I should teach Rachel too?
#RAVENSBANE.
Rachel!—Ah! now I know thee.
#DICKON.
Flattered.
#RAVENSBANE.
Devil! Thou wouldst not torment Rachel?
#DICKON.
Not if my lord—
#RAVENSBANE.
Speak! What must I do?
#DICKON.
Not speak. Be silent, my lord, and acquiesce to all I say.
#RAVENSBANE.
I will be silent.
#DICKON.
And acquiesce?
#RAVENSBANE.
I will be silent.
#RACHEL.
Richard and Rachel stand somewhat apart, Rachel drawing close to Richard and hiding her face. All wear their outer wraps, and two or three hold lanterns, which, save the moon, throw the only light upon the scene. All enter solemn and silent.]
#MINISTER DODGE.
Lord, be Thou present with us, in this unholy spot. Amen.
#DICKON.
Friends! Have you seized her? Is she made prisoner?
#MINISTER DODGE.
Stand from us.
#DICKON.
Sir, the witch! Surely you did not let her escape?
#ALL.
The witch! dame in a peaked hood. She has but now fled the house. She called herself—Goody Rickby.
#ALL.
Goody Rickby!
#MISTRESS MERTON.
She here!
#DICKON.
Yea, mistress, and hath confessed all the damnable art, by which all of us have lately been so terrorized, and his lordship, my poor master, so maligned and victimized.
#RICHARD.
Victimized!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
What confessed she?
#MINISTER DODGE.
What said she?
#DICKON.
This: It appeareth that, for some time past, she hath cherished revengeful thoughts against our honoured host, Justice Merton.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Sir! What cause—what cause—
#DICKON.
Inasmuch as your worship hath ever so righteously condemned her damnable faults, and threatened them punishment.
#MINISTER DODGE.
Yea—well?
#DICKON.
Thus, in revenge, she bewitched yonder mirror, and this very morning unlawfully inveigled this sweet young lady into purchasing it.
#SIR CHARLES.
Mistress Rachel!
#MINISTER DODGE.
Didst thou purchase that glass?
#RACHEL.
Yes.
#MINISTER DODGE.
From Goody Rickby?
#RACHEL.
Yes.
#RICHARD.
Sir—the blame was mine.
#RACHEL.
O Richard!
#DICKON.
Pardon, my friends. The fault rests upon no one here. The witch alone is to blame. Her black art inveigled this innocent maid into purchasing the glass; her black art bewitched this room and all that it contained—even to these innocent virginals, on which I played.
#MINISTER DODGE.
Verily, this would seem to account—but the image; the damnable image in the glass? familiar devil of hers—a sly imp, it seems, who wears to mortal eyes the shape of a scarecrow. ’Twas he, by means of whom she bedevilled this glass, by making it his habitat. When, therefore, she learned that honour and happiness were yours, Justice Merton, in the prospect of Lord Ravensbane as your nephew - in - law, she commanded this devil to reveal himself in the glass as my lord’s own image, that thus she might wreck your family felicity.
#MINISTER DODGE.
Infamous!
#DICKON.
Indeed, sir, it was this very devil whom but now she stole here to consult withal, when she encountered me, attendant here upon my poor prostrate lord, and—held by the wrath in my eye—confessed it all.
#SIR CHARLES.
Thunder and brimstone! Where is this accursed hag?
#DICKON.
Alas—gone, gone! If you had but stopped her.
#MINISTER DODGE.
I know her den—the blacksmith shop.
#SIR CHARLES.
Which way?
#MINISTER DODGE.
To the left.
#SIR CHARLES.
Go on, there.
#MINISTER DODGE.
My honoured friend, we shall return and officially destroy this fatal glass. But first, we must secure the witch. Heaven shield, with her guilt, the innocent!
#THE MEN.
Amen.
#SIR CHARLES.
Go on!
#DICKON.
And reveal thy youthful escapades to Rachel?
#JUSTICE MERTON.
God help me! no.
#DICKON.
So then, dear friends, this strange incident is happily elucidated. The pain and contumely have fallen most heavily upon my dear lord and master, but you are witnesses, even now, of his silent and Christian forgiveness of your suspicions. Bygones, therefore, be bygones. The future brightens—with orange - blossoms! Hymen and Felicity stand with us here ready to unite two amorous and bashful lovers. His lordship is reticent; yet to you alone, of all beautiful ladies, Mistress Rachel—
#RAVENSBANE.
Silence!
#DICKON.
My lord would—
#RAVENSBANE.
Silence! Dare not to speak to her!
#DICKON.
My babe is weaned.
#RACHEL.
Oh, my lord, if I have made you suffer—
#RICHARD.
Rachel!
#RAVENSBANE.
Gracious lady! let fall your eyes; look not upon me. If I have dared remain in your presence, if I dare now speak once more to you, ’tis because I would have you know—O forgive me!—that I love you.
#RICHARD.
Sir! This lady has renewed her promise to be my wife.
#RAVENSBANE.
Your wife, or not, I love her.
#RICHARD.
Zounds!
#RAVENSBANE.
Forbear, and hear me! For one wonderful day I have gazed upon this, your world. The sun has kindled me and the moon has blessed me. A million forms—of trees, of stones, of stars, of men, of common things—have swum like motes before my eyes; but one alone was wholly beautiful. That form was Rachel: to her alone I was not ludicrous; to her I also was beautiful. Therefore, I love her. You talk to me of mothers, mistresses, lovers, and wives and sisters, and you say men love these. What is love? The sun’s enkindling and the moon’s quiescence; the night and day of the world—the all of life, the all which must include both you and me and God, of whom you dream. Well then, I love you, Rachel. What shall prevent me? Mistress, mother, wife—thou art all to me!
#RICHARD.
My lord, I can only reply for Mistress Rachel, that you speak like one who does not understand this world.
#RAVENSBANE.
O God! Sir, and do you? If so, tell me—tell me before it be too late—why, in this world, such a thing as I can love and talk of love. Why, in this world, a true man and woman, like you and your betrothed, can look upon this counterfeit and be deceived.
#RACHEL AND RICHARD.
Counterfeit?
#RAVENSBANE.
Me—on me—the ignominy of the earth, the laughing - stock of the angels!
#RACHEL.
Why, my lord. Are you not—
#RAVENSBANE.
No.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Forbear! Not to her—
#DICKON.
My lord forgets.
#RACHEL.
Are you not Lord Ravensbane?
#RAVENSBANE.
Marquis of Oxford, Baron of Wittenberg, Elector of Worms, and Count of Cordova? No, I am not Lord Ravensbane. I am Lord Scarecrow!
#RACHEL.
Ah me! nobleman of husks, bewitched from a pumpkin.
#RACHEL.
The image in the glass was true?
#RAVENSBANE.
Yes, true. It is the glass of truth—thank God! Thank God for you, dear.
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Richard! Go for the minister; this proof of witchcraft needs be known.
#DICKON.
My lord, this grotesque absurdity must end.
#RAVENSBANE.
True, Dickon! This grotesque absurdity must end. The laugher and the laughing - stock, man and the worm, possess at least one dignity in common: both must die.
#DICKON.
Remember! if you dare—Rachel shall suffer for it.
#RAVENSBANE.
You lie. She is above your power.
#DICKON.
Still, thou darest not—
#RAVENSBANE.
Fool, I dare. Mistress, this pipe is I. This intermittent smoke holds, in its nebula, Venus, Mars, the world. If I should break it—Chaos and the dark! And this of me that now stands up will sink jumbled upon the floor—a scarecrow. See! I break it. Oh, Rachel, could I have been a man—!
#DICKON.
Mademoiselle, I felicitate you; you have outwitted the devil.
#MISTRESS MERTON.
Satan!
#JUSTICE MERTON.
Gone!
#RACHEL.
Richard! Richard! support him.
#RICHARD.
He is fainting. A chair!
#RACHEL.
How pale; but yet no change.
#RICHARD.
His heart, perhaps.
#RACHEL.
Oh, Dick, if it should be some strange mistake! Look! he is noble still. My lord! my lord! the glass—
#RAVENSBANE.
Who is it?
#RACHEL.
Yourself, my lord—’tis the glass of truth.
#RAVENSBANE.
man! Rachel!
#RACHEL.
Richard, I am afraid. Was it a chimera, or a hero?
