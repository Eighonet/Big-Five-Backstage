#SETH.
Yes, Pa?
#PA.
What yuh doin'?
#SETH.
Jest settin'.
#PA.
Don't yuh go near my tin box 'til I'm dead.
#PA.
D'yuh hear?
#SETH.
I hear.
#PA.
I won't heve no one know nothin' 'bout my last will an' testament 'til I'm dead.
#PA.
Seth?
#SETH.
What d'yuh want?
#PA.
Bring me a drink.
#SETH.
There ain't no more water in the pail.
#PA.
There's lots in the well this spring.
#PA.
My throat's burnin' up.
#SETH.
Well, maybe I kin find a drop.
#PA.
What's that noise?
#SETH.
I'm gettin' yuh a drink!
#LON.
I hear Pa's dyin'.
#SETH.
Yuh hear right.
#LON.
Is he in there?
#SETH.
Yes.
#SETH.
He's asleep.
#SETH.
What did yuh come here fur?
#LON.
'Cause Pa's dyin'.
#SETH.
Yuh never come when he was about.
#LON.
Wall, no one ever seed yuh a settin' here much.
#SETH.
Suppose yuh want t' know what he's left yuh.
#LON.
Wall, ... it warn't comfortable comin' three miles an' a quarter on a day like this un.
#SETH.
Sand's hot on yer bare naked feet, ain't it?
#LON.
Yuh kin talk about my holey boots. If I didn't heve no mouths but my own t' feed I guess I could buy new ones too. So there, Seth Polland!
#SETH.
Jacobs offered yuh a job at the fisheries same as me.
#LON.
It's too fur t' hoof it twict a day.
#SETH.
Yuh could sleep at the fisheries.
#LON.
I got t' look after my kids.
#SETH.
'Tain't my fault yuh've kids.
#LON.
Don't yuh talk 'bout that! Yer woman had t' leave yuh. Yuh didn't give her 'nough t' eat.
#SETH.
She warn't no good.
#LON.
She had t' leave yuh same as Ma left Pa twenty years ago. Pa's dyin' fur sure?
#SETH.
Who told yuh?
#LON.
Ma.
#SETH.
Ma? What you got t' do with her?
#LON.
I was passin' her place this mornin'. Furst time I spoke t' her in a year.
#SETH.
I ain't in two.
#LON.
Seth, she's cut twenty cords o' wood t' sell.
#SETH.
An' me without a roof o' my own.
#LON.
Me an' the kids wonder sometimes where our next meal's comin' from.
#SETH.
Oh, wall.
#LON.
If I had this house I could work at the fisheries.
#SETH.
But yuh ain't a goin' t' git it.
#LON.
Pa ain't gone an' left it t' yuh?
#SETH.
Pa deeded this t' Doc last winter.
#LON.
He did?
#SETH.
Doc said he could live here 'till he died. But it's Doc's.
#LON.
It warn't right.
#SETH.
Wall, he had t' pay fur his physics some way. He told me yuh wouldn't help him out.
#LON.
And Pa told me yuh wouldn't. An' yuh ain't got two kids t' feed. There's Pa's old shanty down the road. If I had that I could work at the fisheries. Pa still owns it, don't he?
#SETH.
There warn't no call fur him t' make his last will an' testament if he don't.
#LON.
He's left his last will an' testament?
#SETH.
Yes. I'm figgerin' on sellin' the place t' Doc.
#LON.
Pa ain't a left it t' yuh!
#SETH.
Doc'll want it.
#LON.
Where's the will an' testament?
#SETH.
In the tin box under that there kittle.
#LON.
It's locked.
#SETH.
An' the key's round Pa's neck.
#LON.
Let's git it.
#SETH.
Pa won't give it t' us.
#LON.
Yuh said he was sleepin'.
#SETH.
I mean - he might wake up.
#LON.
I think I could open it.
#SETH.
Pa might ask t' see it.
#LON.
Hell.
#SETH.
Doc'll want the place seein' as how it's right next t' this un. Yuh might jest as wall go home.
#LON.
No, yuh don't! Yuh can't make me believe Pa's left it t' yuh.
#SETH.
Then what yuh gettin' so excited 'bout?
#LON.
I ain't excited. It jest makes me mad 'cause yuh say Pa's left it t' yuh, an' I know he ain't. See? There warn't no call fur him t' heve willed an' testamented it t' yuh. Yuh've only yerself t' look after an' I've two motherless kids.
#SETH.
Every one knows how much Pa thought o' them.
#LON.
It warn't my fault if they thumbed their noses at him.
#SETH.
Yuh could o' basted 'em.
#LON.
They's like their Ma. Bastin' never done her no good, God rest her soul. All the same, Pa knowd how hard it is fur me t' keep their bellies full. Why, when we heve bread Alexander never wants less than half the loaf! An' all the work I gits t' do is what the city folks who come t' the Beach in the summer gives me.
#SETH.
Huh! Jest as though I didn't know 'bout yuh. Mr. Breckenridge told me yuh wouldn't even contract t' chop his wood fur him. An' there yuh sits all winter long in that God - fursaken shanty o' yourn, with trees all round yuh, an' yuh won't put an ax t' one 'til yer own fires dies out.
#LON.
My back ain't never been strong. Choppin' puts the kinks in it. Yuh kin talk, yuh kin, Seth Polland, with a soft job at the fisheries an' three squares a day which yuh don't heve t' cook yourself. Nothin' t' do all winter but walk round them cottages an' see that no one broke in. An' I'm the one who knows how often yuh walk round them cottages. I wish I hed yer snap. But I ain't never had no luck.
#SETH.
I walk round them cottages jest as often as I need t' walk round them cottages.
#LON.
Huh! I could tell a tale. Who was it set with his feet in the oven last winter, an' let Jack Tompkins break into them cottages - with keys? I could tell, I could. But I ain't a goin' t' 'til they put me on the witness - stand. But the furst initials o' his name is Seth Polland.
#SETH.
Lon Polland, yuh ever tell an' I'll skin yuh alive.
#LON.
Huh!
#SETH.
Skin yuh like a pole - cat.
#LON.
Huh!
#SETH.
Yuh know what I got on yuh.
#SETH.
Yuh thought I didn't see yuh, but I was right on the spot when yuh set fire t' Mr. Rogers' bath - house.
#SETH.
Right behind a jack pine I was an' seed yuh do it. An' yuh done it 'cause Mr. Rogers leaved Jessup paint the house when yuh thought yuh ought t' had the job.
#LON.
I got t' be a gettin' home a fore dark an' tend t' my stock.
#SETH.
Stock? A blind mare an' a rooster.
#LON.
Rooster's dead.
#SETH.
What of?
#LON.
Pip.
#SETH.
Starvation.
#LON.
I would a killed him this long time, but Victoria howled so when I threatened. The fowl used t' wake me in winter same as summer with his crowin'.
#SETH.
Should think yuh'd want t' set round 'til Pa dies, bein' as yer so sure he's left yuh his property.
#LON.
He oughter a left it t' me.
#SETH.
Well, I'm a tellin' yuh it's mine.
#LON.
Yuh ain't got no right t' it. Pa begged yuh t' come an' live with him, offered yuh this fine roof over yer head, an' yuh was too cussed even t' do that fur him. An' now yuh expect he's made yuh his heir.
#SETH.
I've treated him righter 'an yuh.
#LON.
Yuh ain't.
#SETH.
Maybe he's left it t' the two o' us!
#LON.
What?
#SETH.
Maybe he's divided the place a 'tween us.
#LON.
Oh, he wouldn't be so unhuman as that.
#SETH.
He would. He was always settin' one agin' t' other.
#LON.
He used t' tell me I had t' figger how t' git the best o' yuh or he'd baste me.
#SETH.
He was all the time whettin' us on when we was kids.
#LON.
It was him showed me how t' shake my old clock so it'd run fur five minutes, an' then you'd swop that pail yuh found fur it.
#SETH.
Huh! He give me his gum t' stop up the hole in that pail. Yuh wouldn't know it leaked an' we could laugh at yuh when you had t' carry water in it.
#LON.
There warn't never more 'an a pint left when I got t' the house. An' Pa always hed such a thirst.
#SETH.
He'd like t' laugh at us in his grave.
#LON.
It jest tickled him t' raise hell a 'tween us.
#SETH.
I'll take my oath he's divided the old shanty an' the two acres a 'tween us. An' I figgered I'd be sellin' them t' Doc t'morrow.
#LON.
Me an' the kids was a goin' t' heve a garden on the cleared spot. garden in that sand?
#LON.
Radishes an' rutabagas.
#SETH.
Lon, what yuh need is the shanty.
#LON.
The shanty ain't no good t' me without I hes the ground fur it t' set on.
#SETH.
Yuh can tear it down an' use the lumber t' mend yer old leaky one.
#LON.
I want the shanty t' live in so I kin git a soft job at the fisheries. You ought t' have a shanty, Seth. Supposin' yuh was t' take sick. They wouldn't keep yuh at the fisheries then. Yuh take my place an' give me Pa's.
#SETH.
I want the two acres t' sell Doc. Yer old place leaks like a net! But yuh could make it real comfortable with the lumber in -
#LON.
I'll make a bargain. I'll leave yuh a bed - stead an' a table if yuh'll take my place.
#SETH.
I don't want it! I want Pa's old place.
#LON.
An' I want it. I'm older 'an yuh.
#SETH.
I got the best claim t' it.
#LON.
Yuh ain't. We with three mouths t' feed. Yer a swindler, yuh are. Yuh always tried t' cheat me.
#SETH.
No one kin say that t' me. I'm an honest man. But I'm a goin' 't heve the two acres if I heve t' go t' law.
#LON.
Wall, yuh ain't a goin' t' wreck me.
#SETH.
Maybe yer right, Lon, when yuh say I ought t' have a roof. I'll tell yuh what I'll do, seein' as how yer my brother. Yuh give me the ground an' the house on it, an' I'll make yuh a present o' twenty - five dollars.
#LON.
That's a lie! Yuh ain't got twenty - five dollars t' yer name.
#SETH.
Yuh think so.
#LON.
Every one in these parts knows yuh owes Hawkins forty - three dollars an twenty - nine cents he kin't collect. Give me the house an' ground, an' I'll give yuh my own house an' my note fur twenty - five dollars.
#SETH.
Yer note! I'm a goin' t' heve Pa's old place.
#LON.
An' I say that yuh or no swindler like yuh is a goin' t' cheat me out o' it.
#SETH.
I ain't a swindler, yuh wall - eyed son -
#LON.
Take it back. Don't yuh call me dissipated names.
#SETH.
I'll never take it back!
#SETH.
He's gone, Lon.
#LON.
Yer right, Seth. Don't yuh take it!
#SETH.
I've got it!
#LON.
It's mine!
#SETH.
It ain't!
#LON.
Yuh kin't -
#SETH.
Shut up!
#LON.
Hold off! I'm jest a goin' t' read it. "I, Nathaniel Polland, o' Sandy Point in the County o' Rhodes an' State o' Michigan, bein' o' sound mind an' memory, do make, publish, an' declare this t' be my last Will an' Testament in manner followin', viz - ." What does "viz" mean?
#SETH.
" - Bequeath all my earthly possessions to my wife, Jennie Polland."
#SETH.
The damned old critter.
#LON.
I'll be swaned.
#SETH.
That's gratitude.
#LON.
After all we done fur him.
#SETH.
An' me a plannin' these last five years on gettin' that house an' ground.
#LON.
My kids are packin' our furniture this afternoon, gettin' ready t' move in.
#SETH.
Leavin' it t' Ma.
#LON.
Her who he ain't hardly spoke t' in twenty years.
#SETH.
Jest as though yuh an' me wasn't alive.
#LON.
We'd a given him our last pipeful.
#SETH.
His own flesh an' blood.
#LON.
Why, he told me more 'an a thousand times he hated Ma.
#SETH.
She don't need it.
#LON.
She's ready fur the grave - yard.
#SETH.
She's that stingy, cuttin' an' choppin' wood, sellin it t' the city folks. We might a knowd.
#LON.
An' me a comin' all the three miles an' a quarter t' see him a fore he died.
#SETH.
I been settin' here two days a waitin'.
#LON.
An' then t' treat us like that. Why, the hull place ain't worth a damn! cavin' - in shanty an' two acres yuh couldn't grow weeds on. pile o' sand.
#SETH.
She ain't a goin' t' heve it!
#LON.
What?
#SETH.
I won't let Ma heve it!
#LON.
But how yuh goin' t' stop her? 'Twon't do no good t' tear up the will an' testament. It's rec - ord - ed.
#SETH.
Don't make no difference. She ain't a goin' t' heve that place.
#LON.
But how yuh goin' - ?
#SETH.
I don't know. But I'm a goin' t'.
#LON.
It ain't hers by rights.
#SETH.
Didn't she leave him twenty years ago?
#LON.
Why, she ain't even expectin' it!
#SETH.
She'll never miss it if she don't git it.
#LON.
Me an' the kids packed up, ready t' move in.
#SETH.
Lon?
#LON.
Yes?
#SETH.
Yuh 'member what yuh done t' Rogers when he didn't leave yuh paint his bath - house?
#LON.
Burn it?
#SETH.
Sh!
#LON.
Oh, no!
#SETH.
Yuh don't want Ma t' heve it, does yuh?
#LON.
When I burned that bath - house I didn't sleep good fur a couple o' nights. I dreamed o' the sheriff.
#SETH.
Nobody knows but me. An' nobody'll know yuh an' me set fire t' Pa's old place.
#LON.
Yuh swear yuh won't never tell?
#SETH.
I swear.
#LON.
Yuh won't never try an' make out I done it next time we run agin each other fur district school - inspector?
#SETH.
I swear. 'Cause if I kin't have Pa's old place, no one kin.
#LON.
Got matches?
#SETH.
Yes. An' Pa's kerosene - can's got 'bout a pint in it.
#LON.
I may as wall take these papers along with me.
#SETH.
Heve a smoke, Lon?
#LON.
Maybe I will.
#SETH.
We're brothers.
#LON.
The same flesh an' blood has got t' treat each other right.
#SETH.
An' we wouldn't be treatin' each other right if we let Pa's property come into Ma's hands.
#SETH.
Wait a minute, Lon.
#LON.
What yuh doin', Seth?

#CAREN.
What was the number of that last one?
#HELPER.
Thirteen.
#CAREN.
Thirteen....
#VOICES.
Shove that stiff up! He's got more room than what's coming to him.
#CAREN.
Who is it you're moving?
#HANK.
Thirteen. Any reason why he should sprawl?
#CAREN.
Not a bit. Shove him along.
#KRAIG.
Oh.... Oh! Let me stay here just a moment away from that horror.
#CAREN.
You're all the same the first day.
#KRAIG.
Oh.... Oh!
#CAREN.
That last one got you ... eh?
#KRAIG.
So young ... so young!
#CAREN.
Must have been a good looker. Much as you can tell the way his face is banged up. I'll bet his own mother wouldn't know him.
#KRAIG.
Don't!
#CAREN.
He ... he ... he! Number thirteen...! I hope he ain't superstitious.
#KRAIG.
He has nothing more to fear.
#CAREN.
There's no tellin'.
#KRAIG.
He's dead.... ... Dead!
#CAREN.
Fool!
#KRAIG.
Dead!
#CAREN.
Bah!
#KRAIG.
You think it was fair...? He went of his own free will?
#CAREN.
Eh...? What put that into your head?
#KRAIG.
No clothes ... naked! lot of them do that when they take the plunge. It ain't so easy to identify them. It saves a lot of bother, too. We stick 'em on the slabs a while and then....
#KRAIG.
Don't! It makes me cold ... cold! He's so calm ... so still. I wonder if he suffered first! I wonder if - he starved!
#CAREN.
That soft white kitten? Not much. Did you get a squint at his hands? He's never even tied his own tie.
#KRAIG.
And he's here!
#CAREN.
This is a funny job for a kid like you to pick.
#KRAIG.
I'm not as young as I look. I've got three little ones already. And another on the way.
#CAREN.
It's a queer hang out for a kid like you, just the same.
#KRAIG.
I tell you ... there's another on the way.
#CAREN.
What do you mean by that?
#KRAIG.
Nothing! Oh there's one joy down here. You can burrow and hide like a rat from it all. The damn carriages don't roll by before your eyes. The women don't!... Oh, those women, how I hate them. Their silks, their jewels, their soft white skins. Fed! Clothed! Housed!... While Martha starves! Oh, God! They drive by laughing and I could choke them! Listen what happened. Yesterday in the park I stood there ... shivering ... wondering! And all at once the mad hate came into my heart and I felt that I could kill. And then.... Ha ... ha ... ha! Then.... The King.... The King drove by. And off came my hat! My hat came off my head, Old Man, and I bowed and cringed WITH THE HATE IN MY HEART. I could have torn the warm furs from his throat and wrapped my fingers in their place Ugh!
#CAREN.
Hush.... Hush! You mustn't talk so of our King. A nice young boy he is.
#KRAIG.
Oh the hate ... the hate. Perhaps it will leave me here in this hall of the dead. It all seems so level here. So level.
#CAREN.
You're right. Here's the one spot on earth where you get fair play. That's what I like. There ain't no rich and there ain't no poor. And there ain't no class nor nothing. Every man gets a square deal here ... a square deal.
#KRAIG.
Perhaps that's worth dying for - a square deal.
#CAREN.
Dying ... bah! Wait until you've seen a few more of them slung on the slabs. You'll lose your longing for death. I'm an old man, but....
#KRAIG.
If only I can see more of it. If only I can bear it.
#CAREN.
The pay's not bad?
#KRAIG.
It would be bad at any price.
#CAREN.
Tut ... tut! We're fair here ... fair. There ain't no flowers ... he ... he ... he ... and there ain't no song , but....
#KRAIG.
If only the living could have what is spent on the dead. All the waste ... the hateful waste. Flowers wilting in dead hands. Stones weighing down dead hearts. While living bodies famish and living eyes burn for the sight of beauty. Oh, I wonder the dead don't scream out at our madness. I wonder the graves don't burst with the pain of it all.
#CAREN.
Have they shut me up with a maniac? Have you gone stark out of your mind?
#CAREN.
What do you want?
#HANK.
Let me in.
#CAREN.
Get away.
#HANK.
Let me look once ... just once.
#CAREN.
Got a pass?
#HANK.
No ... no. Oh, let me in.
#CAREN.
Get away.
#HANK.
Let me look once ... just once. Are there any ... women?
#CAREN.
Women? Of course, there's women ... always women. What is it you've craving? The sight of the beauties or the smell of their stinking flesh? Go on ... get out. This isn't a bawdy house.
#KRAIG.
What is it he wants? peep at the stiffs. Probably looking for his girl.
#KRAIG.
Oh! Man!... You can see the new ones through the panel there. Lift up the curtain. There's two. A blond haired girl and a boy. Poor soul!
#CAREN.
There's something queer about that last young stiff.
#KRAIG.
Number thirteen?
#CAREN.
Yes, number thirteen. You may have been right after all. Perhaps it wasn't fair play to put him in the river. There's some mystery ... something wrong. He ... he ... he! Not number thirteen for nothing.
#KRAIG.
How do you know there's anything wrong?
#CAREN.
That's telling, Sonny. But you get wise quick ... looking at the dead.
#KRAIG.
Ugh!
#CAREN.
People are telephoning and messengers are on the way. Pah ... things like this are a nuisance. They keep one late. What are you watching?
#KRAIG.
That man who was here at the door. He doesn't go away. I wonder what keeps him here.
#CAREN.
Conscience! Scared to death he'll find his girl. Afraid not to look for her.
#KRAIG.
You mean?...
#CAREN.
Oh, there's just two things drives people into the water. The men ... 'cause they've got too little inside 'em.... The women....
#KRAIG.
Stop!
#CAREN.
He ... he ... he! Pretty clever little joke. He ... he!
#CAREN.
I must tell that to the boys inside. Pretty clever little joke!...
#KRAIG.
There's something wrong with the fellow. I'd better see.
#CAREN.
You'd better shut your eyes and see nothing.
#KRAIG.
He is staggering.
#CAREN.
Let him stagger.
#KRAIG.
He may be ill. He may be - starving.
#CAREN.
He's come to a good place to lose his appetite.
#KRAIG.
Oh, let me see what's wrong with him ... please.
#CAREN.
You go out that door and you don't come back. I guess you'll stay.
#KRAIG.
Just as you say.
#HANK.
Maria!
#KRAIG.
He's fallen.
#CAREN.
He'll get up.
#KRAIG.
I wonder what happened.
#CAREN.
Perhaps he got a peep at the new blonde.
#KRAIG.
He's here.
#HANK.
My woman!... Maria!
#CAREN.
If you can identify her shut up your racket. Go to the first door at the right and make arrangements to take her away.
#HANK.
Maria.
#CAREN.
Shut up! Bottle the tears until you get home. The first door to the right.
#HANK.
Cover her. For the love of the Lord ... cover her. Don't let her lie like that.
#CAREN.
Ain't she covered enough to suit you?
#HANK.
Cover her ... cover her.
#CAREN.
Afraid she'll catch cold? Go on ... get out!
#KRAIG.
His woman ... his LOVE. Poor devil!
#CAREN.
What's the matter with you, Softy?
#KRAIG.
Nothing. I was just thinking.
#CAREN.
Don't be a fool.
#KRAIG.
Couldn't we cover her just a little? The sheet seems to have slipped.
#CAREN.
And no harm done. Meat's meat.
#KRAIG.
Her hair would cover her like a mantle. How soft and white she is. And how happy she seems. I wonder just when that look came into her face. It surely wasn't there when she plunged into the river.
#CAREN.
You ought to be nurse maid to a doll baby. What are you anyway?
#KRAIG.
A dreamer ... a creator ... a starver!
#CAREN.
Well, you're the wrong sort for in here. This is one place where you get down to facts; truth. No lies, no frills, no dreams. Dreams don't count Money don't count. Power don't count ... beauty don't count. Nothing counts.
#KRAIG.
Then it's not truth if beauty and dreams don't count. That's what we starved for, Martha and I.
#CAREN.
Well, you won't starve here. It's a fair place ... fair. The King himself wouldn't be treated no different than a beggar. The man with brains and the man without....
#HELPER.
Some one wants to blink at number thirteen. He's got two swell dames with him. Can they go in?
#CAREN.
If their permit's all right. Yes. Bring them in.
#HELPER.
They won't come in here. They want to go in the private way.
#CAREN.
I know there's some mystery about number thirteen....
#HELPER.
Yes, there is. He's a swell ... a big one. I shouldn't wonder if....
#CAREN.
Go on. Get out.
#KRAIG.
Aren't you going to cover the boy before you let them enter?
#CAREN.
If they can't see him how are they going to know him? He ain't a tailor's dummy.
#KRAIG.
It all seems horrible.
#CAREN.
I guess you'll never see a second day at this.
#KRAIG.
Oh.... Oh, I don't know.
#CAREN.
You think I'm going to tuck on a few extras just because he's a swell. Don't I keep telling you 'til there's not a breath left in my body, that there ain't no class here? Tramp or gentleman, they're all alike. Now get that into your head and let it grow.
#HELPER.
I oughtn't to tell. They'd kill me if they knew. It's to be kept a secret, but....
#CAREN.
What's the matter?
#HELPER.
Number thirteen.... He ... he....
#CAREN.
Well, what about him?
#HELPER.
He ain't a loafer. He ain't a tramp. He ain't even a gentleman. He....
#CAREN.
Who is he? Quick!

Our.... Our King!
#CAREN.
Our ... King!
#KRAIG.
Ha ... ha ... ha ... ha - HERE!
#CAREN.
Are you mad, Boy, mad? Our King! Oh!
#HELPER.
Ain't you got a flag or something ... some little mark of respect to cover his nibs?
#CAREN.
Run upstairs and get that big silk flag that.... Go.
#KRAIG.
No.
#CAREN.
What do you mean? No?
#KRAIG.
This is one place in the world where all are treated fair. Dreams don't count. POWER don't count. There's no rich, no poor....
#CAREN.
Shut up and get that flag.
#KRAIG.
You're going to cover him ... but she.... Oh! Even death can't level. No ... not even death.
