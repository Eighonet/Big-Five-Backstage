#IVY.
I picked these for yu, Mr. Strangway.
#STRANGWAY.
Ah! Ivy. Thank you. Where are the others?
#GLADYS.
Mercy's comin', Mr. Strangway.
#STRANGWAY.
Good morning, Gladys; good morning, Connie.
#STRANGWAY.
Good morning, Mercy.
#MERCY.
Good morning, Mr. Strangway.
#STRANGWAY.
Now, yesterday I was telling you what our Lord's coming meant to the world. I want you to understand that before He came there wasn't really love, as we know it. I don't mean to say that there weren't many good people; but there wasn't love for the sake of loving. D'you think you understand what I mean?
#IVY.
Yes, Mr. Strangway.
#STRANGWAY.
It isn't enough to love people because they're good to you, or because in some way or other you're going to get something by it. We have to love because we love loving. That's the great thing - without that we're nothing but Pagans.
#GLADYS.
Please, what is Pagans?
#STRANGWAY.
That's what the first Christians called the people who lived in the villages and were not yet Christians, Gladys.
#MERCY.
We live in a village, but we're Christians.
#STRANGWAY.
Yes, Mercy; and what is a Christian?
#STRANGWAY.
Ivy?
#IVY.
'Tis a man - whu - whu -
#STRANGWAY.
Yes? - Connie?
#CONNIE.
Please, Mr. Strangway, 'tis a man what goes to church.
#GLADYS.
He 'as to be baptised - and confirmed; and - and - buried.
#IVY.
'Tis a man whu - whu's gude and -
#GLADYS.
He don't drink, an' he don't beat his horses, an' he don't hit back.
#MERCY.
'Tisn't your turn. 'Tis a man like us.
#IVY.
I know what Mrs. Strangway said it was, 'cause I asked her once, before she went away.
#STRANGWAY.
Yes?
#IVY.
She said it was a man whu forgave everything.
#STRANGWAY.
Ah!
#CONNIE.
Please, Mr. Strangway, father says if yu hit a man and he don't hit yu back, he's no gude at all.
#MERCY.
When Tommy Morse wouldn't fight, us pinched him - he did squeal! Made me laugh!
#STRANGWAY.
Did I ever tell you about St. Francis of Assisi?
#IVY.
No.
#STRANGWAY.
Well, he was the best Christian, I think, that ever lived - simply full of love and joy.
#IVY.
I expect he's dead.
#STRANGWAY.
About seven hundred years, Ivy.
#IVY.
Oh!
#STRANGWAY.
Everything to him was brother or sister - the sun and the moon, and all that was poor and weak and sad, and animals and birds, so that they even used to follow him about.
#MERCY.
I know! He had crumbs in his pocket.
#STRANGWAY.
No; he had love in his eyes.
#IVY.
'Tis like about Orpheus, that yu told us.
#STRANGWAY.
Ah! But St. Francis was a Christian, and Orpheus was a Pagan.
#IVY.
Oh!
#STRANGWAY.
Orpheus drew everything after him with music; St. Francis by love.
#IVY.
Perhaps it was the same, really.
#STRANGWAY.
Perhaps it was, Ivy.
#GLADYS.
Did 'e 'ave a flute like yu?
#IVY.
The flowers smell sweeter when they 'ear music; they du.
#STRANGWAY.
What's the name of this one?
#CONNIE.
We call it a cuckoo, Mr. Strangway.
#GLADYS.
'Tis awful common down by the streams. We've got one medder where 'tis so thick almost as the goldie cups.
#STRANGWAY.
Odd! I've never noticed it.
#IVY.
Please, Mr. Strangway, yu don't notice when yu're walkin'; yu go along like this.
#STRANGWAY.
Bad as that, Ivy?
#IVY.
Mrs. Strangway often used to pick it last spring.
#STRANGWAY.
Did she? Did she?
#MERCY.
I like being confirmed.
#STRANGWAY.
Ah! Yes. Now - What's that behind you, Mercy?
#MERCY.
My skylark.
#STRANGWAY.
What!
#MERCY.
It can fly; but we're goin' to clip its wings. Bobbie caught it.
#STRANGWAY.
How long ago?
#MERCY.
Yesterday.
#STRANGWAY.
Give me the cage!
#MERCY.
I want my skylark. I gave Bobbie thrippence for it!
#STRANGWAY.
There!
#MERCY.
I want my skylark!
#STRANGWAY.
God made this poor bird for the sky and the grass. And you put it in that! Never cage any wild thing! Never!
#MERCY.
I want my skylark.
#STRANGWAY.
No! Off you go, poor thing!
#IVY.
I'm glad!
#GLADYS.
Don't cry, Mercy. Bobbie'll soon catch yu another.
#STRANGWAY.
The class is over for to - day.
#CONNIE.
'Twasn't his bird.
#IVY.
Skylarks belong to the sky. Mr. Strangway said so.
#GLADYS.
Not when they'm caught, they don't.
#IVY.
They du.
#CONNIE.
'Twas her bird.
#IVY.
He gave her sixpence for it.
#GLADYS.
She didn't take it.
#CONNIE.
There it is on the ground.
#IVY.
She might have.
#GLADYS.
He'll p'raps take my squirrel, tu.
#IVY.
The bird sang - I 'eard it! Right up in the sky. It wouldn't have sanged if it weren't glad.
#GLADYS.
Well, Mercy cried.
#IVY.
I don't care.
#GLADYS.
'Tis a shame! And I know something. Mrs. Strangway's at Durford.
#CONNIE.
She's - never!
#GLADYS.
I saw her yesterday. An' if she's there she ought to be here. I told mother, an' she said: "Yu mind yer business." An' when she goes in to market to - morrow she'm goin' to see. An' if she's really there, mother says, 'tis a fine tu - du an' a praaper scandal. So I know a lot more'n yu du.
#CONNIE.
Mrs. Strangway told mother she was goin' to France for the winter because her mother was ill.
#GLADYS.
'Tisn't, winter now - Ascension Day. I saw her cumin' out o' Dr. Desert's house. I know 'twas her because she had on a blue dress an' a proud luke. Mother says the doctor come over here tu often before Mrs. Strangway went away, just afore Christmas. They was old sweethearts before she married Mr. Strangway. 'Twas yure mother told mother that.
#CONNIE.
Father says if Mrs. Bradmere an' the old Rector knew about the doctor, they wouldn't 'ave Mr. Strangway 'ere for curate any longer; because mother says it takes more'n a year for a gude wife to leave her 'usband, an' 'e so fond of her. But 'tisn't no business of ours, father says.
#GLADYS.
Mother says so tu. She's praaper set against gossip. She'll know all about it to - morrow after market.
#IVY.
I don't want to 'ear nothin' at all; I don't, an' I won't.
#GLADYS.
'Ere's Mrs. Burlacombe.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Ivy, take Mr. Strangway his ink, or we'll never 'eve no sermon to - night. He'm in his thinkin' box, but 'tis not a bit o' yuse 'im thinkin' without 'is ink. What ever's this?
#GLADYS.
'Tis Mercy Jarland's. Mr. Strangway let her skylark go.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Aw! Did 'e now? Serve 'er right, bringin' an 'eathen bird to confirmation class.
#CONNIE.
I'll take it to her.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
No. Yu leave it there, an' let Mr. Strangway du what 'e likes with it. Bringin' a bird like that! Well 'I never!
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Yes, yu just be off, an' think on what yu've been told in class, an' be'ave like Christians, that's gude maids. An' don't yu come no more in the 'avenin's dancin' them 'eathen dances in my barn, naighther, till after yu'm confirmed - 'tisn't right. I've told Ivy I won't 'ave it.
#CONNIE.
Mr. Strangway don't mind - he likes us to; 'twas Mrs. Strangway began teachin' us. He's goin' to give a prize.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Yu just du what I tell yu an' never mind Mr. Strangway - he'm tu kind to everyone. D'yu think I don't know how gells oughter be'ave before confirmation? Yu be'ave like I did! Now, goo ahn! Shoo!
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Well, Jim! better? That's right! Yu'm gettin' on bravely. Want Parson?
#JIM.
I want to tell 'un about my cat.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Why! what's she been duin' then? Mr. Strangway's busy. Won't I du?
#JIM.
No. I want to tell him.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Whatever she been duin'? Havin' kittens?
#JIM.
No. She'm lost.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Dearie me! Aw! she'm not lost. Cats be like maids; they must get out a bit.
#JIM.
She'm lost. Maybe he'll know where she'll be.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Well, well. I'll go an' find 'im.
#JIM.
He's a gude man. He's very gude.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
That's certain zure.
#STRANGWAY.
Mrs. Burlacombe, I can't think where I've put my book on St. Francis - the large, squarish pale - blue one?
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Aw! there now! I knu there was somethin' on me mind. Miss Willis she came in yesterday afternune when yu was out, to borrow it. Oh! yes - I said - I'm zure Mr. Strangway'll lend it 'ee. Now think o' that!
#STRANGWAY.
Of course, Mrs. Burlacombe; very glad she's got it.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Aw! but that's not all. When I tuk it up there come out a whole flutter o' little bits o' paper wi' little rhymes on 'em, same as I see yu writin'. Aw! my gudeness! I says to meself, Mr. Strangway widn' want no one seein' them.
#STRANGWAY.
Dear me! No; certainly not!
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
An' so I putt 'em in your secretary.
#STRANGWAY.
My - ah! Yes. Thank you; yes.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
But I'll goo over an' get the buke for yu. 'T won't take me 'alf a minit.
#STRANGWAY.
Well, Jim?
#JIM.
My cat's lost.
#STRANGWAY.
Lost?
#JIM.
Day before yesterday. She'm not come back. They've shot 'er, I think; or she'm caught in one o' they rabbit - traps.
#STRANGWAY.
Oh! no; my dear fellow, she'll come back. I'll speak to Sir Herbert's keepers.
#JIM.
Yes, zurr. I feel lonesome without 'er.
#STRANGWAY.
Lonesome! Yes! That's bad, Jim! That's bad!
#JIM.
I miss 'er when I sits than in the avenin'.
#STRANGWAY.
The evenings - They're the worst - and when the blackbirds sing in the morning.
#JIM.
She used to lie on my bed, ye know, zurr. She'm like a Christian.
#STRANGWAY.
The beasts are.
#JIM.
There's plenty folk ain't 'alf as Christian as 'er be.
#STRANGWAY.
Well, dear Jim, I'll do my very best. And any time you're lonely, come up, and I'll play the flute to you.
#JIM.
No, zurr. Thank 'ee, zurr.
#STRANGWAY.
What - don't you like music?
#JIM.
Ye - es, zurr. "'Ere's Mrs. Bradmere, comin' from the Rectory." She don't like cats. But she'm a cat 'erself, I think.
#STRANGWAY.
Jim!
#JIM.
She'm always tellin' me I'm lukin' better. I'm not better, zurr.
#STRANGWAY.
That's her kindness.
#JIM.
I don't think it is. 'Tis laziness, an' 'avin' 'er own way. She'm very fond of 'er own way. Ah! Jim; you're looking better.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
You know how that came on him? Caught the girl he was engaged to, one night, with another man, the rage broke something here. Four years ago.
#STRANGWAY.
Poor fellow!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Is your wife back?
#STRANGWAY.
No.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
By the way, poor Mrs. Cremer - is she any better?
#STRANGWAY.
No; going fast: Wonderful - so patient.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Um! Yes. They know how to die! D'you expect your wife soon?
#STRANGWAY.
I I - hope so. So do I. The sooner the better.
#STRANGWAY.
I trust the Rector's not suffering so much this morning?
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Thank you! His foot's very bad.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Good day, M'm!
#STRANGWAY.
She was very welcome, Mrs. Burlacombe.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
He misses his wife very much, I'm afraid.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Ah! Don't he? Poor dear man; he keeps a terrible tight 'and over 'imself, but 'tis suthin' cruel the way he walks about at night. He'm just like a cow when its calf's weaned. 'T'as gone to me 'eart truly to see 'im these months past. T'other day when I went up to du his rume, I yeard a noise like this ; an' ther' 'e was at the wardrobe, snuffin' at 'er things. I did never think a man cud care for a woman so much as that.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
H'm!
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
'Tis funny rest an' 'e comin' 'ere for quiet after that tearin' great London parish! 'E'm terrible absent - minded tu - don't take no interest in 'is fude. Yesterday, goin' on for one o'clock, 'e says to me, "I expect 'tis nearly breakfast - time, Mrs. Burlacombe!" 'E'd 'ad it twice already!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Twice! Nonsense!
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Zurely! I give 'im a nummit afore 'e gets up; an' 'e 'as 'is brekjus reg'lar at nine. Must feed un up. He'm on 'is feet all day, gain' to zee folk that widden want to zee an angel, they're that busy; an' when 'e comes in 'e'll play 'is flute there. Hem wastin' away for want of 'is wife. That's what 'tis. An' 'im so sweet - spoken, tu, 'tes a pleasure to year 'im - Never says a word!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Yes, that's the kind of man who gets treated badly. I'm afraid she's not worthy of him, Mrs. Burlacombe.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
'Tesn't for me to zay that. She'm a very pleasant lady. Too pleasant. What's this story about her being seen in Durford?
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Aw! I du never year no gossip, m'm.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Of course not! But you see the Rector wishes to know.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Well - folk will talk! But, as I says to Burlacombe - "'Tes paltry," I says; and they only married eighteen months, and Mr. Strangway so devoted - like. 'Tes nothing but love, with 'im.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Come!
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
There's puzzivantin' folk as'll set an' gossip the feathers off an angel. But I du never listen. Now then, Mrs. Burlacombe?
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Well, they du say as how Dr. Desart over to Durford and Mrs. Strangway was sweethearts afore she wer' married.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
I knew that. Who was it saw her coming out of Dr. Desart's house yesterday?
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
In a manner of spakin' 'tes Mrs. Freman that says 'er Gladys seen her.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
That child's got an eye like a hawk.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
'Tes wonderful how things du spread. 'Tesn't as if us gossiped. Du seem to grow - like in the naight. I never lied her. That Riviera excuse, Mrs. Burlacombe - Very convenient things, sick mothers. Mr. Strangway doesn't know?
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
The Lord forbid! 'Twid send un crazy, I think. For all he'm so moony an' gentlelike, I think he'm a terrible passionate man inside. He've a - got a saint in 'im, for zure; but 'tes only 'alf - baked, in a manner of spakin'.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
I shall go and see Mrs. Freman. There's been too much of this gossip all the winter.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
'Tes unfortunate - like 'tes the Fremans. Freman he'm a gipsy sort of a feller; and he've never forgiven Mr. Strangway for spakin' to 'im about the way he trates 'is 'orses.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Ah! I'm afraid Mr. Strangway's not too discreet when his feelings are touched.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
'E've a - got an 'eart so big as the full mune. But 'tes no yuse espectin' tu much o' this world. 'Tes a funny place, after that.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Yes, Mrs. Burlacombe; and I shall give some of these good people a rare rap over the knuckles for their want of charity. For all they look as if butter wouldn't melt in their mouths, they're an un - Christian lot. It's lucky we've some hold over the village. I'm not going to have scandal. I shall speak to Sir Herbert, and he and the Rector will take steps.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Aw! I du hope 'twon't upset the Rector, an' 'is fute so poptious!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
His foot'll be sound enough to come down sharp. By the way, will you send me a duck up to the Rectory?
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Zurely, m'm; at once. I've some luv'ly fat birds.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Old puss - cat!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Well, Tibby Jarland, what do you want here? Always sucking something, aren't you?
#MERCY.
What! Haven't you found it, Tibby? Get along with 'ee, then!
#IVY.
Oh! Mrs. Strangway!
#BEATRICE.
Well, Ivy - you've grown! You didn't expect me, did you?
#IVY.
No, Mrs. Strangway; but I hoped yu'd be comin' soon.
#BEATRICE.
Ah! Yes. Is Mr. Strangway in?
#IVY.
Yes - oh, yes! He's writin' his sermon in the little room. He will be glad!
#BEATRICE.
Yes. Now, Ivy; will you do something for me?
#IVY.
Oh, yes, Mrs. Strangway.
#BEATRICE.
Quite sure?
#IVY.
Oh, yes!
#BEATRICE.
Are you old enough to keep a secret?
#IVY.
I'm fourteen now.
#BEATRICE.
Well, then - , I don't want anybody but Mr. Strangway to know I've been here; nobody, not even your mother. D'you understand?
#IVY.
No. Only, I can keep a secret.
#BEATRICE.
Mind, if anybody hears, it will hurt Mr. Strangway.
#IVY.
Oh! I wouldn't - hurt - him. Must yu go away again? I wish yu wer goin' to stay. And perhaps some one has seen yu - They -
#BEATRICE.
No, no one. I came motoring; like this. And I came straight down the little lane, and through the barn, across the yard.
#IVY.
People du see a lot.
#BEATRICE.
I know, but - Now go and tell him quickly and quietly.
#IVY.
Mother's pluckin' a duck. Only, please, Mrs. Strangway, if she comes in even after yu've gone, she'll know, because - because yu always have that particular nice scent.
#BEATRICE.
Thank you, my child. I'll see to that.
#STRANGWAY.
Thank God! I don't understand, though. I thought you were still out there.
#BEATRICE.
No. You're staying? Oh! Beatrice; come! We'll get away from here at once - as far, as far - anywhere you like. Oh! my darling - only come! If you knew -
#BEATRICE.
It's no good, Michael; I've tried and tried.
#STRANGWAY.
Not! Then, why - ? Beatrice! You said, when you were right away - I've waited -
#BEATRICE.
I know. It's cruel - it's horrible. But I told you not to hope, Michael. I've done my best. All these months at Mentone, I've been wondering why I ever let you marry me - when that feeling wasn't dead!
#STRANGWAY.
You can't have come back just to leave me again?
#BEATRICE.
When you let me go out there with mother I thought - I did think I would be able; and I had begun - and then - spring came!
#STRANGWAY.
Spring came here too! Never so - aching! Beatrice, can't you?
#BEATRICE.
I've something to say.
#STRANGWAY.
No! No! No!
#BEATRICE.
You see - I've - fallen.
#STRANGWAY.
Ah! Why, in the name of mercy, come here to tell me that? Was he out there, then?
#BEATRICE.
I came straight back to him.
#STRANGWAY.
To Durford?
#BEATRICE.
To the Crossway Hotel, miles out - in my own name. They don't know me there. I told you not to hope, Michael. I've done my best; I swear it.
#STRANGWAY.
My God!
#BEATRICE.
It was your God that brought us to live near him!
#STRANGWAY.
Why have you come to me like this?
#BEATRICE.
To know what you're going to do. Are you going to divorce me? We're in your power. Don't divorce me - Doctor and patient - you must know - it ruins him. He'll lose everything. He'd be disqualified, and he hasn't a penny without his work.
#STRANGWAY.
Why should I spare him?
#BEATRICE.
Michael; I came to beg. It's hard.
#STRANGWAY.
No; don't beg! I can't stand it.
#BEATRICE.
What are you going to do, then? Keep us apart by the threat of a divorce? Starve us and prison us? Cage me up here with you? I'm not brute enough to ruin him.
#STRANGWAY.
Heaven!
#BEATRICE.
I never really stopped loving him. I never - loved you, Michael.
#STRANGWAY.
Is that true? Never loved me? Not - that night - on the river - not - ?
#BEATRICE.
No.
#STRANGWAY.
Were you lying to me, then? Kissing me, and - hating me?
#BEATRICE.
One doesn't hate men like you; but it wasn't love.
#STRANGWAY.
Why did you tell me it was?
#BEATRICE.
Yes. That was the worst thing I've ever done.
#STRANGWAY.
Do you think I would have married you? I would have burned first! I never dreamed you didn't. I swear it!
#BEATRICE.
Forget it!
#STRANGWAY.
Did he try to get you away from me? Tell me the truth!
#BEATRICE.
No. It was - I - alone. But - he loves me.
#STRANGWAY.
One does not easily know love, it seems.
#BEATRICE.
It was cruel to come, I know. For me, too. But I couldn't write. I had to know.
#STRANGWAY.
Never loved me? Never loved me? That night at Tregaron? You might have told me before you went away! Why keep me all these -
#BEATRICE.
I meant to forget him again. I did mean to. I thought I could get back to what I was, when I married you; but, you see, what a girl can do, a woman that's been married - can't.
#STRANGWAY.
Then it was I - my kisses that - ! How did you stand them? Imagination helped you, perhaps!
#BEATRICE.
Michael, don't, don't! And - oh! don't make a public thing of it! You needn't be afraid I shall have too good a time! If ever you want to marry some one else - then, of course - that's only fair, ruin or not. But till then - till then - He's leaving Durford, going to Brighton. No one need know. And you - this isn't the only parish in the world.
#STRANGWAY.
You ask me to help you live in secret with another man?
#BEATRICE.
I ask for mercy.
#STRANGWAY.
What am I to do?
#BEATRICE.
What you feel in the bottom of your heart.
#STRANGWAY.
You ask me to help you live in sin?
#BEATRICE.
To let me go out of your life. You've only to do - nothing.
#STRANGWAY.
I want you. Come back to me! Beatrice, come back!
#BEATRICE.
It would be torture, now.
#STRANGWAY.
Oh!
#BEATRICE.
Whatever's in your heart - do!
#STRANGWAY.
You'd come back to me sooner than ruin him? Would you?
#BEATRICE.
I can't bring him harm.
#STRANGWAY.
God! - if there be one help me! Never cage any wild thing! Go! Go please, quickly! Do what you will. I won't hurt you - can't - But - go!
#BEATRICE.
Thank you!
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
'Tis poor Sue Cremer, zurr, I didn't 'ardly think she'd last thru the mornin'. An' zure enough she'm passed away! Mr. Strangway - yu'm feelin' giddy?
#STRANGWAY.
No, no! What was it? You said -
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
'Tes Jack Cremer. His wife's gone. 'E'm in a terrible way. 'Tes only yu, 'e ses, can du 'im any gude. He'm in the kitchen.
#STRANGWAY.
Cremer? Yes! Of course. Let him -
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Yu ain't wantin' that - 'tes all twizzled. Sure yu'm not feelin' yer 'ead?
#STRANGWAY.
No!
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
I'll send 'im in, then.
#STRANGWAY.
Jack! Don't give way. If we give way - we're done.
#CREMER.
Yes, zurr.
#STRANGWAY.
She didn't. Your wife was a brave woman. A dear woman.
#CREMER.
I never thought to luse 'er. She never told me 'ow bad she was, afore she tuk to 'er bed. 'Tis a dreadful thing to luse a wife, zurr.
#STRANGWAY.
Yes. But don't give way! Bear up, Jack!
#CREMER.
Seems funny 'er goin' blue - bell time, an' the sun shinin' so warm. I picked up an 'orse - shu yesterday. I can't never 'ave 'er back, zurr.
#STRANGWAY.
Some day you'll join her. Think! Some lose their wives for ever.
#CREMER.
I don't believe as there's a future life, zurr. I think we goo to sleep like the beasts.
#STRANGWAY.
We're told otherwise. But come here! Look! Listen! To sleep in that! Even if we do, it won't be so bad, Jack, will it?
#CREMER.
She wer' a gude wife to me - no man didn't 'ave no better wife.
#STRANGWAY.
Take hold - hard - harder! I want yours as much as you want mine. Pray for me, Jack, and I'll pray for you. And we won't give way, will we?
#CREMER.
No, zurr; thank 'ee, zurr. 'Tes no gude, I expect. Only, I'll miss 'er. Thank 'ee, zurr; kindly.
#GODLEIGH.
Well, TIBBY JARLAND, what've yu come for, then? Glass o' beer?
#GODLEIGH.
I shid zay glass o' 'arf an' 'arf's about yure form. Yu'm a praaper masterpiece. Well! 'Ave sister Mercy borrowed yure tongue? Aw, she 'aven't. Well, maid?
#TIBBY.
Father wants six clay pipes, please.
#GODLEIGH.
'E du, du 'ee? Yu tell yure father 'e can't 'ave more'n one, not this avenin'. And 'ere 'tis. Hand up yure shillin'.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Gracious, child! What are you doing here? And what have you got in your mouth? Who is it? Tibby Jarland? Take that thing out. And tell your father from me that if I ever see you at the inn again I shall tread on his toes hard. Godleigh, you know the law about children?
#GODLEIGH.
Surely, m'm. But she will come. Go away, my dear.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Now, Godleigh, I've come to talk to you. Half the scandal that goes about the village begins here. No, no - its no good. You know the value of scandal to your business far too well.
#GODLEIGH.
Wi' all respect, m'm, I knows the vally of it to yourn, tu.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
What do you mean by that?
#GODLEIGH.
If there weren't no Rector's lady there widden' be no notice taken o' scandal; an' if there weren't no notice taken, twidden be scandal, to my thinkin'.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Very well! You've given me your views. Now for mine. There's a piece of scandal going about that's got to be stopped, Godleigh. You turn the tap of it off here, or we'll turn your tap off. You know me. See?
#GODLEIGH.
I shouldn' never presume, m'm, to know a lady.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
The Rector's quite determined, so is Sir Herbert. Ordinary scandal's bad enough, but this touches the Church. While Mr. Strangway remains curate here, there must be no talk about him and his affairs.
#GODLEIGH.
I was just thinkin' how to du it, m'm. 'Twid be a brave notion to putt the men in chokey, and slit the women's tongues - like, same as they du in outlandish places, as I'm told.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Don't talk nonsense, Godleigh; and mind what I say, because I mean it.
#GODLEIGH.
Make yure mind aisy, m'm there'll be no scandal - monkeyin' here wi' my permission.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Good! You know what's being said, of course?
#GODLEIGH.
Yu'll pardon me, m'm, but ef an' in case yu was goin' to tell me, there's a rule in this 'ouse: "No scandal 'ere!"
#MRS. BRADMERE.
You're too smart by half, my man.
#GODLEIGH.
Aw fegs, no, m'm - child in yure 'ands.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
I wouldn't trust you a yard. Once more, Godleigh! This is a Christian village, and we mean it to remain so. You look out for yourself.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Evening, Mr. Trustaford. Burlacombe, tell your wife that duck she sent up was in hard training.
#TRUSTAFORD.
What's the old grey mare want, then? 'Er's lukin' awful wise!
#GODLEIGH.
Ah!
#TRUSTAFORD.
Drop o' whisky, an' potash.
#BURLACOMBE.
What's wise, Godleigh? Drop o' cider.
#GODLEIGH.
Nuse? There's never no nuse in this 'ouse. Aw, no! Not wi' my permission. This is a Christian village.
#TRUSTAFORD.
Thought the old grey mare seemed mighty busy.
#BURLACOMBE.
Aye!
#TRUSTAFORD.
Off again she was in 'alf an hour. 'Er didn't give poor old curate much of a chance, after six months.
#GODLEIGH.
Havin' an engagement elsewhere - No scandal, please, gentlemen.
#BURLACOMBE.
Never asked to see my missis. Passed me in the yard like a stone.
#TRUSTAFORD.
'Tes a little bit rumoursome lately about 'er doctor.
#GODLEIGH.
Ah! he's the favourite. But 'tes a dead secret; Mr. Trustaford. Don't yu never repate it - there's not a cat don't know it already! frowns, and TRUSTAFORD utters his laugh. The door is opened and FREMAN, a dark gipsyish man in the dress of a farmer, comes in.
#GODLEIGH.
Don't yu never tell Will Freman what 'e told me!
#FREMAN.
Avenin'!
#TRUSTAFORD.
Avenin', Will; what's yure glass o' trouble?
#FREMAN.
Drop o' eider, clove, an' dash o' gin. There's blood in the sky to - night.
#BURLACOMBE.
Ah! We'll 'ave fine weather now, with the full o' the mune.
#FREMAN.
Dust o' wind an' a drop or tu, virst, I reckon. 'Earl t' nuse about curate an' 'is wife?
#GODLEIGH.
No, indeed; an' don't yu tell us. We'm Christians 'ere in this village.
#FREMAN.
'Tain't no very Christian nuse, neither. He's sent 'er off to th' doctor. "Go an' live with un," 'e says; "my blessin' on ye." If 'er'd a - been mine, I'd 'a tuk the whip to 'er. Tam Jarland's maid, she yeard it all. Christian, indeed! That's brave Christianity! "Goo an' live with un!" 'e told 'er.
#BURLACOMBE.
No, no; that's not sense - a man to say that. I'll not 'ear that against a man that bides in my 'ouse.
#FREMAN.
'Tes sure, I tell 'ee. The maid was hid - up, scared - like, behind the curtain. At it they went, and parson 'e says: "Go," 'e says, "I won't kape 'ee from 'im," 'e says, "an' I won't divorce 'ee, as yu don't wish it!" They was 'is words, same as Jarland's maid told my maid, an' my maid told my missis. If that's parson's talk, 'tes funny work goin' to church.
#TRUSTAFORD.
'Tes wonderful quare, zurely.
#FREMAN.
Tam Jarland's fair mad wi' curate for makin' free wi' his maid's skylark. Parson or no parson, 'e've no call to meddle wi' other people's praperty. He cam' pokin' 'is nose into my affairs. I told un I knew a sight more 'bout 'orses than 'e ever would!
#TRUSTAFORD.
He'm a bit crazy 'bout bastes an' birds.
#CLYST.
Ah! he'm that zurely, Mr. Trustaford.
#GODLEIGH.
Now, Tim Clyst, if an' in case yu've a - got some scandal on yer tongue, don't yu never unship it here. Yu go up to Rectory where 'twill be more relished - like.
#CLYST.
Will y' give me a drink for this, Mr. Godleigh? 'Tes rale funny. Aw! 'tes somethin' swats. Butiful readin'. Poetry. Rale spice. Yu've a luv'ly voice for readin', Mr. Godleigh.
#GODLEIGH.
Aw, what is it then?
#CLYST.
Ah! Yu want t'know tu much.
#CLYST.
Hello, Jim! Cat come 'ome?
#JIM BERE.
No.
#GODLEIGH.
What's all this, now - no scandal in my 'ouse!
#CLYST.
'Tes awful peculiar - like a drame. Mr. Burlacombe 'e don't like to hear tell about drames. A guess a won't tell 'ee, arter that.
#FREMAN.
Out wi' it, Tim.
#CLYST.
'Tes powerful thirsty to - day, Mr. Godleigh.
#GODLEIGH.
Yu're all wild cat's talk, Tim; yu've a - got no tale at all.
#CLYST.
Aw, indade!
#GODLEIGH.
No tale, no cider!
#CLYST.
Did ye ever year tell of Orphus?
#TRUSTAFORD.
What? The old vet. up to Drayleigh?
#CLYST.
Fegs, no; Orphus that lived in th' old time, an' drawed the bastes after un wi' his music, same as curate was tellin' the maids.
#FREMAN.
I've 'eard as a gipsy over to Vellacott could du that wi' 'is viddle.
#CLYST.
'Twas no gipsy I see'd this arternune; 'twee Orphus, down to Mr. Burlacombe's long medder; settin' there all dark on a stone among the dimsy - white flowers an' the cowflops, wi' a bird upon 'is 'ead, playin' his whistle to the ponies.
#FREMAN.
Yu did never zee a man wi' a bird on 'is 'ead.
#CLYST.
Didn' I?
#FREMAN.
What sort o' bird, then? Yu tell me that.
#TRUSTAFORD.
Praaper old barndoor cock. Haw, haw!
#GODLEIGH.
'Tes a vairy - tale; us mustn't be tu partic'lar. In my long medder? Where were yu, then, Tim Clyst?
#CLYST.
Passin' down the lane on my bike. Wonderful sorrowful - fine music 'e played. The ponies they did come round 'e - yu cud zee the tears rennin' down their chakes; 'twas powerful sad. 'E 'adn't no 'at on.
#FREMAN.
No; 'e 'ad a bird on 'is 'ead.
#CLYST.
He went on playin' an' playin'. The ponies they never muved. An' all the dimsy - white flowers they waved and waved, an' the wind it went over 'em. Gav' me a funny feelin'.
#GODLEIGH.
Clyst, yu take the cherry bun!
#CLYST.
Where's that cider, Mr. Godleigh?
#GODLEIGH.
Yu've a - 'ad tu much already, Tim.
#CLYST.
'Tis Tam Jarland there 'as the cargo aboard.
#JARLAND.
Avenin', all! Pinto' beer. Avenin', Jim.
#GODLEIGH.
'Ere y'are, Tam. Where'd yu get thiccy paper?
#CLYST.
Yure tongue du watter, don't it, Mr. Godleigh? No zider, no poetry. 'Tis amazin' sorrowful; Shakespeare over again. "The boy stude on the burnin' deck."
#FREMAN.
Yu and yer yap!
#CLYST.
Ah! Yu wait a bit. When I come back down t'lane again, Orphus 'e was vanished away; there was naught in the field but the ponies, an' a praaper old magpie, a - top o' the hedge. I zee somethin' white in the beak o' the fowl, so I giv' a "Whisht," an' 'e drops it smart, an' off 'e go. I gets over bank an' picks un up, and here't be.
#BURLACOMBE.
Here, give 'im 'is cider. Rade it yureself, ye young teasewings.
#CLYST.
'Tes a pity I bain't dressed in a white gown, an' flowers in me 'air.
#FREMAN.
Read it, or we'll 'aye yu out o' this.
#CLYST.
Aw, don't 'ee shake my nerve, now!
#TRUSTAFORD.
'Tes amazin' funny stuff.
#FREMAN.
Be danged! 'Tes the curate's 'andwritin'. 'Twas curate wi' the ponies, after that.
#CLYST.
Fancy, now! Aw, Will Freman, an't yu bright!
#FREMAN.
But 'e 'adn't no bird on 'is 'ead.
#CLYST.
Ya - as, 'e 'ad.
#JARLAND.
'E 'ad my maid's bird, this arternune. 'Ead or no, and parson or no, I'll gie 'im one for that.
#FREMAN.
Ah! And 'e meddled wi' my 'orses.
#TRUSTAFORD.
I'm thinkin' 'twas an old cuckoo bird 'e 'ad on 'is 'ead. Haw, haw!
#GODLEIGH.
"His 'eart She 'ath Vorgot!"
#FREMAN.
'E's a fine one to be tachin' our maids convirmation.
#GODLEIGH.
Would ye 'ave it the old Rector then? Wi' 'is gouty shoe? Rackon the maids wid rather 'twas curate; eh, Mr. Burlacombe?
#BURLACOMBE.
Curate's a gude man.
#JARLAND.
I'll be even wi' un.
#FREMAN.
Tell 'ee one thing - 'tes not a proper man o' God to 'ave about, wi' 'is luse goin's on. Out vrom 'ere he oughter go.
#BURLACOMBE.
You med go further an' fare worse.
#FREMAN.
What's 'e duin', then, lettin' 'is wife runoff?
#TRUSTAFORD.
If an' in case 'e can't kape 'er, 'tes a funny way o' duin' things not to divorce 'er, after that. If a parson's not to du the Christian thing, whu is, then?
#BURLACOMBE.
'Tes a bit immoral - like to pass over a thing like that. Tes funny if women's gain's on's to be encouraged.
#FREMAN.
Act of a coward, I zay.
#BURLACOMBE.
The curate ain't no coward.
#FREMAN.
He bides in yure house; 'tes natural for yu to stand up for un; I'll wager Mrs. Burlacombe don't, though. My missis was fair shocked. "Will," she says, "if yu ever make vur to let me go like that, I widden never stay wi' yu," she says.
#TRUSTAFORD.
'Tes settin' a bad example, for zure.
#BURLACOMBE.
'Tes all very airy talkin'; what shude 'e du, then?
#FREMAN.
Go over to Durford and say to that doctor: "Yu come about my missis, an' zee what I'll du to 'ee." An' take 'er 'ome an' zee she don't misbe'ave again.
#CLYST.
'E can't take 'er ef 'er don' want t' come - I've 'eard lawyer, that lodged wi' us, say that.
#FREMAN.
All right then, 'e ought to 'ave the law of 'er and 'er doctor; an' zee 'er goin's on don't prosper; 'e'd get damages, tu. But this way 'tes a nice example he'm settin' folks. Parson indade! My missis an' the maids they won't goo near the church to - night, an' I wager no one else won't, neither.
#JARLAND.
The beggar! I'll be even wi' un.
#GODLEIGH.
'Tes the last, then, Tam.
#BURLACOMBE.
I don' goo with what curate's duin - 'tes tiff soft 'earted; he'm a muney kind o' man altogether, wi' 'is flute an' 'is poetry; but he've a - lodged in my 'ouse this year an' mare, and always 'ad an 'elpin' 'and for every one. I've got a likin' for him an' there's an end of it.
#JARLAND.
The coward!
#TRUSTAFORD.
I don' trouble nothin' about that, Tam Jarland. What gits me is 'e don't seem to 'ave no zense o' what's his own praperty.
#JARLAND.
Take other folk's property fast enough! He wants one on his crop, an' one in 'is belly; 'e wants a man to take an' gie un a gude hidin zame as he oughter give 'is fly - be - night of a wife. Zame as a man wid ha' gi'en the doctor, for takin' what isn't his'n.
#STRANGWAY.
I came for a little brandy, Mr. Godleigh - feeling rather faint. Afraid I mightn't get through the service.
#GODLEIGH.
Marteil's Three Star, zurr, or 'Ennessy's?
#STRANGWAY.
Thank you; I believe I can do without, now.
#JARLAND.
Lave me be - I'll talk to un - parson or no. I'll tache un to meddle wi' my maid's bird. I'll tache un to kape 'is thievin' 'ands to 'imself.
#CLYST.
Be quiet, Tam.
#JARLAND.
That's for one chake; zee un turn t'other, the white - livered buty! Whu lets another man 'ave 'is wife, an' never the sperit to go vor un!
#BURLACOMBE.
Shame, Jarland; quiet, man!
#TRUSTAFORD.
Come away, Tam; yu've a - 'ad to much, man.
#JARLAND.
Zee, 'e darsen't touch me; I might 'it un in the vase an' 'e darsen't; 'e's afraid - like 'e was o' the doctor.
#JARLAND.
Luke at un, Luke at un! A man wi' a slut for a wife -
#CLYST.
Tam's hatchin' of yure cucumbers, Mr. Godleigh.
#TRUSTAFORD.
'E did crash; haw, haw!
#FREMAN.
'Twas a brave throw, zurely. Whu wid a' thought it?
#CLYST.
Tam's crawlin' out. Hello, Tam - 'ow's t' base, old man?
#FREMAN.
They'm all comin' up from churchyard to zee.
#TRUSTAFORD.
Tam du luke wonderful aztonished; haw, haw! Poor old Tam!
#CLYST.
Can yu zee curate? Reckon 'e'm gone into church. Aw, yes; gettin' a bit dimsy - service time.
#TRUSTAFORD.
Well, I'm jiggered. In 'alf an hour he'm got to prache.
#GODLEIGH.
'Tes a Christian village, boys.
#TRUSTAFORD.
What I mean to zay is that 'tes no yuse, not a bit o' yuse in the world, not duin' of things properly. If an' in case we'm to carry a resolution disapprovin' o' curate, it must all be done so as no one can't, zay nothin'.
#SOL POTTER.
That's what I zay, Mr. Trustaford; ef so be as 'tis to be a village meetin', then it must be all done proper.
#FREMAN.
That's right, Sot Potter. I purpose Mr. Sot Potter into the chair. Whu seconds that?
#CLYST.
Yu can't putt that to the meetin'. Only a chairman can putt it to the meetin'. I purpose that Mr. Burlacombe - bein as how he's chairman o' the Parish Council - take the chair.
#FREMAN.
Ef so be as I can't putt it, yu can't putt that neither.
#TRUSTAFORD.
'Tes not a bit o' yuse; us can't 'ave no meetin' without a chairman.
#GODLEIGH.
Us can't 'ave no chairman without a meetin' to elect un, that's zure.
#MORSE.
To my way o' thinkin', Mr. Godleigh speaks zense; us must 'ave a meetin' before us can 'ave a chairman.
#CLYST.
Then what we got to du's to elect a meetin'.
#BURLACOMBE.
Yu'll not find no procedure far that.
#SOL POTTER.
'Tes my belief there's no other way to du, but to elect a chairman to call a meetin'; an' then for that meetin' to elect a chairman.
#CLYST.
I purpose Mr. Burlacombe as chairman to call a meetin'.
#FREMAN.
I purpose Sol Potter.
#GODLEIGH.
Can't 'ave tu propositions together before a meetin'; that's apple - pie zure vur zurtain.
#TRUSTAFORD.
Us must get the rights of it zettled some'ow. 'Tes like the darned old chicken an' the egg - meetin' or chairman - which come virst?
#SOL POTTER.
To my thinkin' there shid be another way o' duin' it, to get round it like with a circumbendibus. 'T'all comes from takin' different vuse, in a manner o' spakin'.
#FREMAN.
Vu goo an' zet in that chair.
#SOL POTTER.
I shid'n never like fur to du that, with Mr. Burlacombe zettin' there.
#BURLACOMBE.
'Tes all darned fulishness.
#CLYST.
Rackon curate's pretty well thru by now, I'm goin' to zee. 'Ow's to base, old man?
#JARLAND.
Darn all this puzzivantin'! Got an' zet in that chair.
#SOL POTTER.
'Tes my duty now, gentlemen, to call a meetin' of the parishioners of this parish. I beg therefore to declare that this is a meetin' in accordance with my duty as chairman of this meetin' which elected me chairman to call this meetin'. And I purceed to vacate the chair so that this meetin' may now purceed to elect a chairman.
#FREMAN.
Mr. Chairman, I rise on a point of order.
#GODLEIGH.
There ain't no chairman.
#FREMAN.
I don't give a darn for that. I rise on a point of order.
#GODLEIGH.
'Tes a chairman that decides points of order. 'Tes certain yu can't rise on no points whatever till there's a chairman.
#TRUSTAFORD.
'Tes no yuse yure risin', not the least bit in the world, till there's some one to set yu down again. Haw, haw!
#FREMAN.
What I zay is the chairman ought never to 'ave vacated the chair till I'd risen on my point of order. I purpose that he goo and zet down again.
#GODLEIGH.
Yu can't purpose that to this meetin'; yu can only purpose that to the old meetin' that's not zettin' any longer.
#FREMAN.
I didn' care what old meetin' 'tis that's zettin'. I purpose that Sol Potter goo an' zet in that chair again, while I rise on my point of order.
#TRUSTAFORD.
'Tesn't regular but I guess yu've got to goo, Sol, or us shan't 'ave no peace.
#MORSE.
Zet down, Will Freman.
#FREMAN.
I'm not a - goin' to zet down till I've arisen.
#JARLAND.
Now then, there 'e is in the chair. What's yore point of order?
#FREMAN.
'Twas - 'twas - Darned ef y' 'aven't putt it clean out o' my 'ead.
#JARLAND.
We can't wait for yore points of order. Come out o' that chair. Sol Potter.
#FREMAN.
I know! There ought to 'a been minutes taken. Yu can't 'ave no meetin' without minutes. When us comes to electin' a chairman o' the next meetin', 'e won't 'ave no minutes to read.
#SOL POTTER.
'Twas only to putt down that I was elected chairman to elect a meetin' to elect a chairman to preside over a meetin' to pass a resolution dalin' wi' the curate. That's aisy set down, that is.
#FREMAN.
We'll 'ave that zet down, then, while we're electin' the chairman o' the next meetin'.
#TRUSTAFORD.
Well then, seein' this is the praaper old meetin' for carryin' the resolution about the curate, I purpose Mr. Sol Potter take the chair.
#FREMAN.
I purpose Mr. Trustaford. I 'aven't a - got nothin' against Sol Potter, but seein' that he elected the meetin' that's to elect 'im, it might be said that 'e was electin' of himzelf in a manner of spakin'. Us don't want that said.
#MORSE.
There's some - at in that. One o' they tu purposals must be putt to the meetin'.
#FREMAN.
Second must be putt virst, fur zure.
#TRUSTAFORD.
I dunno as I wants to zet in that chair. To hiss the curate, 'tis a ticklish sort of a job after that. Vurst comes afore second, Will Freeman.
#FREMAN.
Second is amendment to virst. 'Tes the amendments is putt virst.
#TRUSTAFORD.
'Ow's that, Mr. Godleigh? I'm not particular eggzac'ly to a dilly zort of a point like that.
#SOL POTTER.
'Tes a very nice point, for zure.
#GODLEIGH.
'Tes undoubtedly for the chairman to decide.
#JARLAND.
Sol Potter's chairman.
#FREMAN.
No, 'e ain't.
#MORSE.
Yes, 'e is - 'e's chairman till this second old meetin' gets on the go.
#FREMAN.
I deny that. What du yu say, Mr. Trustaford?
#TRUSTAFORD.
I can't 'ardly tell. It du zeem a darned long - sufferin' sort of a business altogether.
#MORSE.
Tell 'ee what 'tis, us shan't du no gude like this.
#GODLEIGH.
'Tes for Mr. Freman or Mr. Trustaford, one or t'other to withdraw their motions.
#TRUSTAFORD.
I've no objections to withdrawin' mine, if Will Freman'll withdraw his'n.
#FREMAN.
I won't never be be'indhand. If Mr. Trustaford withdraws, I withdraws mine.
#MORSE.
That's zensible. Putt the motion to the meetin'.
#SOL POTTER.
There ain't no motion left to putt.
#GODLEIGH.
Jim Bere to spike. Silence for Jim!
#VOICES.
Aye! Silence for Jim!
#SOL POTTER.
Well, Jim?
#JIM.
Nothin' duin'.
#TRUSTAFORD.
Bravo, Jim! Yu'm right. Best zense yet!
#SOL POTTER.
Du seem to me, gentlemen, seem' as we'm got into a bit of a tangle in a manner of spakin', 'twid be the most zimplest and vairest way to begin all over vrom the beginnin', so's t'ave it all vair an' square for every one.
#TIBBY.
Please, sister Mercy says, curate 'ave got to "Lastly." An' please to come quick.
#JARLAND.
Come on, mates; quietly now!
#MORSE.
'Tes rare lucky us was all agreed to hiss the curate afore us began the botherin' old meetin', or us widn' 'ardly 'ave 'ad time to settle what to du.
#SOL POTTER.
Aye, 'tes rare lucky; but I dunno if 'tes altogether reg'lar.
#WHISPERING VOICE OF GLADYS.

#VOICE OF MERCY.
Yes. of CONNIE. Mr. Burlacombe's gone in home, I saw 'im pass by just now - 'e don' like it. Father don't like it neither. of MERCY. Mr. Strangway shoudn' 'ave taken my skylark, an' thrown father out o' winder. 'Tis goin' to be awful fun! Oh!

No, Jarland, no! I ask you to forgive me. Humbly!

Bravo!

That's vair.

'E's afraid o' the sack - that's what 'tis.

'E's a praaper coward.

Whu funked the doctor?
#CLYST'S VOICE.
Shame on 'ee, therr!
#STRANGWAY.
You're right - all of you! I'm not fit! An uneasy and excited mustering and whispering dies away into renewed silence.
#STRANGWAY.
What I did to Tam Jarland is not the real cause of what you're doing, is it? I understand. But don't be troubled. It's all over. I'm going - you'll get some one better. Forgive me, Jarland. I can't see your face - it's very dark. Voice. Wait for the full mune.

'Tes the mischief 'e'm a parson. 'Tes 'im bein' a lamb o' God - or 'twidden be so quare for 'im to be forgivin'.
#BURLACOMBE.
Yu goo an' make un a gude 'ot drink.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Poor soul! What'll 'e du now, I wonder? 'E's cumin'!
#BURLACOMBE.
I wanted for yu to know, zurr, that me an' mine 'adn't nothin' to du wi' that darned fulishness, just now.
#STRANGWAY.
Thank you, Burlacombe. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter a bit.
#BURLACOMBE.
I 'ope yu won't take no notice of it. Like a lot o' silly bees they get. Yu'll excuse me spakin' of this mornin', an' what 'appened. 'Tes a brave pity it cam' on yu so sudden - like before yu 'ad time to think. 'Tes a sort o' thing a man shude zet an' chew upon. Certainly 'tes not a bit o' yuse goin' against human nature. Ef yu don't stand up for yureself there's no one else not goin' to. 'Tes yure not 'avin' done that 'as made 'em so rampageous. Yu'll excuse me, zurr, spakin' of it, but 'tes amazin' sad to zee a man let go his own, without a word o' darin'. 'Tea as ef 'e 'ad no passions like.
#STRANGWAY.
Look at me, Burlacombe.
#STRANGWAY.
Do I look like that? Please, please! I've too much here. Please!
#BURLACOMBE.
Well, zurr, 'tes not for me to zay nothin', certainly.
#STRANGWAY.
Passions! No passions! Ha!
#IVY.
Oh! Mr. Strangway, Mrs. Bradmere's cumin' from the Rectory. I ran an' told 'em. Oh! 'twas awful.
#VOICE OF GLADYS.
Ivy! Come on Ivy. I won't.
#VOICE OF MERCY.
Yu must. Us can't du without Yu. Ivy. I don't want to. of GLADYS. "Naughty maid, she won't come out," Ah! du 'ee!
#VOICE OF CREMER.
Tim Clyst an' Bobbie's cumin'; us'll only be six anyway. Us can't dance "figure of eight" without yu. Ivy. I don't want to dance at all! I don't.
#MERCY.
Aw! She's temper. Yu can bang on tambourine, then!
#GLADYS.
Quick, Ivy! Here's the old grey mare cumin' down the green. Quick. of MRS. BRADMERE. Who's that? This disgraceful business! Where's Mr. Strangway? I see he's in.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Yes, m'm, he'm in - but - but Burlacombe du zay he'm terrible upset.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
I should think so. I must see him - at once.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
I doubt bed's the best place for 'un, an' gude 'ot drink. Burlacombe zays he'm like a man standin' on the edge of a cliff; and the lasts tipsy o' wind might throw un over.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
You've seen him, then?
#BURLACOMBE.
Yeas; an' I don't like the luke of un - not a little bit, I don't.
#MRS. BURLACOMBE.
Poor soul; 'e've a - 'ad to much to try un this yer long time past. I've a - seen 'tis sperrit cumin' thru 'is body, as yu might zay. He's torn to bits, that's what 'tis.
#BURLACOMBE.
'Twas a praaper cowardly thing to hiss a man when he's down. But 'twas natural tu, in a manner of spakin'. But 'tesn't that troublin' 'im. 'Tes in here , along of his wife, to my thinkin'. They zay 'e've a - known about 'er a - fore she went away. Think of what 'e've 'ad to kape in all this time. 'Tes enough to drive a man silly after that. I've a - locked my gun up. I see a man like - like that once before - an' sure enough 'e was dead in the mornin'!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Nonsense, Burlacombe! Go and tell him I want to see him - must see him. And look here, Burlacombe; if we catch any one, man or woman, talking of this outside the village, it'll be the end of their tenancy, whoever they may be. Let them all know that. I'm glad he threw that drunken fellow out of the window, though it was a little -
#BURLACOMBE.
Aye! The nuspapers would be praaper glad of that, for a tiddy bit o' nuse.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
My goodness! Yes! The men are all up at the inn. Go and tell them what I said - it's not to get about. Go at once, Burlacombe.
#BURLACOMBE.
Must be a turrable job for 'im, every one's knowin' about 'is wife like this. He'm a proud man tu, I think. 'Tes a funny business altogether!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Horrible! Poor fellow! Now, come! Do your best, Burlacombe!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
You baggage!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
This is most distressing. I'm deeply sorry. I'm an old woman; and old women must take liberties, you know, or they couldn't get on at all. Come now! Let's try and talk it over calmly and see if we can't put things right.
#STRANGWAY.
You were very good to come; but I would rather not.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
I know you're in as grievous trouble as a man can be.
#STRANGWAY.
Yes.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
What are you - thirty - five? I'm sixty - eight if I'm a day - old enough to be your mother. I can feel what you must have been through all these months, I can indeed. But you know you've gone the wrong way to work. We aren't angels down here below! And a son of the Church can't act as if for himself alone. The eyes of every one are on him.
#STRANGWAY.
Take this, please.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
No, no, no! Jarland deserved all he got. You had great provocation.
#STRANGWAY.
It's not Jarland. Please take it to the Rector. I beg his forgiveness. There's too much I can't speak of - can't make plain. Take it to him, please.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Mr. Strangway - I don't accept this. I am sure my husband - the Church - will never accept -
#STRANGWAY.
Take it!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Mind! We don't accept it. You must come and talk to the Rector to - morrow. You're overwrought. You'll see it all in another light, then.
#STRANGWAY.
Perhaps. Beautiful night! Couldn't be more beautiful!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Don't turn sway from these who want to help you! I'm a grumpy old woman, but I can feel for you. Don't try and keep it all back, like this! A woman would cry, and it would all seem clearer at once. Now won't you let me - ?
#STRANGWAY.
No one can help, thank you.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Come! Things haven't gone beyond mending, really, if you'll face them. You know what I mean. We dare not foster immorality.
#STRANGWAY.
Don't speak of that!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
But think what you've done, Mr. Strangway! If you can't take your wife back, surely you must divorce her. You can never help her to go on like this in secret sin.
#STRANGWAY.
Torture her - one way or the other?
#MRS. BRADMERE.
No, no; I want you to do as the Church - as all Christian society would wish. Come! You can't let this go on. My dear man, do your duty at all costs!
#STRANGWAY.
Break her heart?
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Then you love that woman - more than God!
#STRANGWAY.
Love!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
They told me - Yes, and I can see you're is a bad way. Come, pull yourself together! You can't defend what you're doing.
#STRANGWAY.
I do not try.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
I must get you to see! My father was a clergyman; I'm married to one; I've two sons in the Church. I know what I'm talking about. It's a priest's business to guide the people's lives.
#STRANGWAY.
But not mine! No more!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
There's something very queer about you to - night. You ought to see doctor.
#STRANGWAY.
If I am not better soon -
#MRS. BRADMERE.
I know it must be terrible to feel that everybody - But come! Live it down! Live it down, man! You can't desert your post - and let these villagers do what they like with us? Do you realize that you're letting a woman, who has treated you abominably; - yes, abominably - go scot - free, to live comfortably with another man? What an example!
#STRANGWAY.
Will you, please, not speak of that!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
I must! This great Church of ours is based on the rightful condemnation of wrongdoing. There are times when forgiveness is a sin, Michael Strangway. You must keep the whip hand. You must fight!
#STRANGWAY.
Fight! My fight is here. Have you ever been in hell? For months and months - burned and longed; hoped against hope; killed a man in thought day by day? Never rested, for love and hate? I - condemn! I - judge! No! It's rest I have to find - somewhere - somehow - rest! And how - how can I find rest?
#MRS. BRADMERE.
You are a strange man! One of these days you'll go off your head if you don't take care.
#STRANGWAY.
One of these days the flowers will grow out of me; and I shall sleep.
#MRS. BRADMERE.
And you mean to let all this go on - Your wife -
#STRANGWAY.
Go! Please go!
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Men like you have been buried at cross - roads before now! Take care! God punishes!
#STRANGWAY.
Is there a God?
#MRS. BRADMERE.
Ah! You must see a doctor.
#STRANGWAY.
Gone! What is there, now?
#STRANGWAY.
Gone! Taken faith - hope - life!
#JIM BERE.
Gude avenin', zurr.
#JIM.
Yu threw un out of winder. I cud 'ave, once, I cud. They'm laughin' at yu, zurr. An' so I come to tell 'ee how to du. 'Twas full mune - when I caught 'em, him an' my girl. I caught 'em. I did; an' I tuk un like that - I tuk un. As the coat falls, like a body out of which the breath has been squeezed, STRANGWAY, rising, catches it.
#STRANGWAY.
And he fell!
#JIM.
Yu see, I loved 'er - I did. Then somethin' - I dunno - and - and - Twas like this for ever.
#JIM.
I come to tell yu. They'm all laughin' at yu. But yu'm strong - yu go over to Durford to that doctor man, an' take un like I did. They can't laugh at yu no more, then. Tha's what I come to tell yu. Tha's the way for a Christian man to du. Gude naight, zurr. I come to tell yee.
#VOICES.
Gude night, Tam. Glide naight, old Jim!
#VOICES.
Gude might, Mr. Trustaford. 'Tes a wonderful fine mune.
#VOICE OF TRUSTAFORD.
Ah! 'Tes a brave mune for th' poor old curate!
#HANK.
"My 'eart 'E lighted not!"
#MERCY.
That'll du, Tibby; we're finished. Ate yore apple.
#CLYST.
Yu maids don't dance 'elf's well as us du. Bobbie 'e's a great dancer. 'E dance vine. I'm a gude dancer, meself.
#GLADYS.
A'n't yu conceited just?
#CLYST.
Aw! Ah! Yu'll give me kiss for that. Can't she glimmer!
#MERCY.
Gladys! Up ladder!
#CLYST.
Yu go up ladder; I'll catch 'ee then. Naw, yu maids, don't yu give her succour. That's not vair
#CONNIE.
Mercy, don't! Mrs. Burlacombe'll hear. Ivy, go an' peek.
#CLYST.
Ya - as, this is a gude apple. Luke at Tibby!
#CLYST.
Us 'as got on vine; us'll get prize for our dancin'.
#CONNIE.
There won't be no prize if Mr. Strangway goes away. 'Tes funny 'twas Mrs. Strangway start us.
#IVY.
'Twas wicked to hiss him.
#CLYST.
Twasn't I.
#BOBBIE.
I never did.
#GLADYS.
Oh! Bobbie, yu did! Yu blew in my ear.
#CLYST.
'Twas the praaper old wind in the trees. Did make a brave noise, zurely.
#MERCY.
'E shuld'n' 'a let my skylark go.
#CLYST.
Ya - as, 'e shude, then. What du yu want with th' birds of the air? They'm no gude to yu.
#IVY.
And now he's goin' away.
#CLYST.
Ya - as; 'tes a pity. He's the best man I ever seen since I was comin' from my mother. He's a gude man. He'em got a zad face, sure enough, though.
#IVY.
Gude folk always 'ave zad faces.
#CLYST.
I knu a gude man - 'e sold pigs - very gude man: 'e 'ad a budiful bright vase like the mane. I was sad, meself, once. 'Twas a funny scrabblin' - like feelin'.
#GLADYS.
If 'e go away, whu's goin' to finish us for confirmation?
#CONNIE.
The Rector and the old grey mare.
#MERCY.
I don' want no more finishin'; I'm confirmed enough.
#CLYST.
Ya - as; yu'm a buty.
#GLADYS.
Suppose we all went an' asked 'im not to go?
#IVY.
'Twouldn't be no gude.
#CONNIE.
Where's 'e goin'?
#MERCY.
He'll go to London, of course.
#IVY.
He's so gentle; I think 'e'll go to an island, where there's nothin' but birds and beasts and flowers.
#CLYST.
Aye! He'm awful fond o' the dumb things.
#IVY.
They're kind and peaceful; that's why.
#CLYST.
Aw! Yu see tu praaper old tom cats; they'm not to peaceful, after that, nor kind naighther.
#BOBBIE.
If 'e's sad, per'aps 'e'll go to 'Eaven.
#IVY.
Oh! not yet, Bobbie. He's tu young.
#CLYST.
Ya - as. 'Tes a funny place, tu, nowadays, judgin' from the papers.
#GLADYS.
Wonder if there's dancin' in 'Eaven?
#IVY.
There's beasts, and flowers, and waters, and 'e told us.
#CLYST.
Naw! There's no dumb things in 'Eaven. Jim Bere 'e says there is! 'E thinks 'is old cat's there.
#IVY.
Yes. There's stars, an' owls, an' a man playin' on the flute. Where 'tes gude, there must be music.
#CLYST.
Old brass band, shuldn' wonder, like th' Salvation Army.
#IVY.
No; 'tis a boy that goes so; an' all the dumb things an' all the people goo after 'im - like this. An' 'tes all like that in 'Eaven.
#CLYST.
'Tes a glory - be full mune to - night! goldie - cup - a big one. An' millions o' little goldie - cups on the floor of 'Eaven.
#MERCY.
Oh! Bother 'Eaven! Let's dance "Clapperclaws"! Wake up, Tibby!
#GLADYS.
Clapperelaws, clapperclaws! Come on, Bobbie - make circle!
#CLYST.
Clapperclaws! I dance that one fine.
#IVY.
See, Tibby; like this. She hums and beats gently, then restores the tambourine to the sleepy TIBBY, who, waking, has placed a piece of apple in her mouth.
#CONNIE.
'Tes awful difficult, this one.
#IVY.
No; yu just jump, an' clap yore 'ands. Lovely, lovely!
#CLYST.
Like ringin' bells! Come ahn!
#CONNIE.
What is it?
#GLADYS.
I hear - some one comin' across the yard.
#TIBBY.
O - oh! Mercy! Where are yu? I'm frightened! I'm frightened! O - oooo!
#STRANGWAY.
Who's that? Who is it?
#TIBBY.
O - oh! A ghosty! Oo - ooo!
#STRANGWAY.
It's me, Tibby - Tib only me!
#TIBBY.
I seed a ghosty.
#STRANGWAY.
No, no, my bird, you didn't! It was me.
#TIBBY.
I'm frighted. It was a big one. O - o - oh!
#STRANGWAY.
There, there! It's nothing but me. Look!
#TIBBY.
No.
#STRANGWAY.
See! It's the moonlight made me all white. See! You're a brave girl now?
#TIBBY.
I want my apple.
#TIBBY.
I want any tambourine.
#STRANGWAY.
Now we're both ghosties! Isn't it funny?
#TIBBY.
Yes.
#STRANGWAY.
See! The moon's laughing at us! See? Laugh then!
#TIBBY.
I'se still frightened.
#STRANGWAY.
No! Full moon, Tibby! Shall we wish for it?
#TIBBY.
Full mune.
#STRANGWAY.
Moon! We're wishing for you. Moon, moon!
#TIBBY.
Mune, we're wishin' for yu!
#STRANGWAY.
What do, you wish it to be?
#TIBBY.
Bright new shillin'! face.
#TIBBY.
Shillin', a shillin'!
#STRANGWAY.
See! Your wish comes true.
#TIBBY.
Oh! Mune's still there!
#STRANGWAY.
Wish for me, Tibby!
#TIBBY.
Mune. I'm wishin' for yu!
#STRANGWAY.
Not yet!
#TIBBY.
Shall I shake my tambouline?
#STRANGWAY.
Yes, shake your tambouline.
#TIBBY.
Mune, I'm shaken' at yu.
#TIBBY.
What d'yu du that for?
#STRANGWAY.
To put it out of reach. It's better -
#TIBBY.
Why is it better?
#STRANGWAY.
Come along, Tibby! See! All asleep! The birds, and the fields, and the moon!
#TIBBY.
Mune, mune, we're wishing for yu!
#STRANGWAY.
Send her your love, and say good - night.
#TIBBY.
Good - night, mune!
#TIBBY.
Luke. The mune's sent a bit o' love!
#STRANGWAY.
Thank you, Tibby! I want that bit o' love. Listen!
#TIBBY.
It's Miss Willis, playin' on the pianny!
#STRANGWAY.
No; it's Love; walking and talking in the world.
#TIBBY.
Is it?
#STRANGWAY.
See! Everything coming out to listen! See them, Tibby! All the little things with pointed ears, children, and birds, and flowers, and bunnies; and the bright rocks, and - men! Hear their hearts beating! And the wind listening!
#TIBBY.
I can't hear - nor I can't see!
#STRANGWAY.
Beyond - They are - they must be; I swear they are! And now say good - bye to me.
#TIBBY.
Where yu goin'?
#STRANGWAY.
I don't know, Tibby.
#VOICE OF MERCY.
Tibby! Tibby! Where are yu?
#STRANGWAY.
Mercy calling; run to her!
#STRANGWAY.
Who's that?
#CREMER.
Jack Cremer. That yu, zurr?
#STRANGWAY.
Yes, Jack. How goes it?
#CREMER.
'Tes empty, zurr. But I'll get on some'ow.
#STRANGWAY.
You put me to shame.
#CREMER.
No, zurr. I'd be killin' meself, if I didn' feel I must stick it, like yu zaid.
#STRANGWAY.
I honour you.
#CREMER.
What's that? I'll just be walkin' - I won' be gain' 'ome to - night. 'Tes the full mune - lucky.
#STRANGWAY.
Wait for me at the crossroads, Jack. I'll come with you. Will you have me, brother?
#CREMER.
Sure!
#STRANGWAY.
Wait, then.
#CREMER.
Aye, zurr.
#STRANGWAY.
God, of the moon and the sun; of joy and beauty, of loneliness and sorrow - give me strength to go on, till I love every living thing!
