#CZESKA.
Why do you tell me this only now? Really, my dear Stella, I should be angry with you. I live only a mile from here; I was your teacher before you were put into the hands of English and French governesses. I see you almost every day. I love my darling with all my soul, and still you did not tell me that for several weeks you have been engaged. At least do not torture me any longer, but tell me, who is he?
#STELLA.
You must guess, my dear mother.
#CZESKA.
As long as you call me mother, you must not make me wait.
#STELLA.
But I wish you to guess and tell me. Naturally it is he and not another. Believe me, it will flatter and please me.
#CZESKA.
Count Drahomir, then.
#STELLA.
Ah!
#CZESKA.
You are blushing. It is true. He has not been here for a long time, but how sympathetic, how gay he is. Well, my old eyes would be gladdened by seeing you both together. I should at once think what a splendid couple. Perhaps there will be something in it.
#STELLA.
There will be nothing in it, because Count Drahomir, although very sympathetic, is not my fiancé. I am betrothed to Mr. Pretwic.
#CZESKA.
Mr. George Pretwic?
#STELLA.
Yes. Are you surprised?
#CZESKA.
No, my dear child. May God bless you. Why should I be surprised? But I am so fond of Count Drahomir, so I thought it was he. Mr. George Pretwic! - Oh, I am not surprised at all that he should love you. But it came a little too soon. How long have you known each other? Living at my Berwinek I do not know anything that goes on in the neighborhood.
#STELLA.
Since three months. My fiancé has inherited an estate in this neighborhood from the Jazlowieckis, and came, as you know, from far off. He was a near relation of the Jazlowieckis, and he himself comes of a very good family. Dear madam, have you not heard of the Pretwics?
#CZESKA.
Nothing at all, my dear Stella. What do I care for heraldry!
#STELLA.
In former times, centuries ago, the Pretwics were related to our family. It is a very good family. Otherwise papa would not have consented. Well then, Mr. Pretwic came here, took possession of the Jazlowieckis estate, became acquainted with us, and -
#CZESKA.
And fell in love with you. I should have done the same if I were in his place. It gives him more value in my eyes.
#STELLA.
Has he needed it?
#CZESKA.
No, my little kitten - rest easy. You know I am laughed at for seeing everything in a rosy hue. He belongs to a good family, he is young, rich, good - looking, well - bred, but -
#STELLA.
But what? bird must have sung it, because I cannot remember who told me that he is a little bit like a storm.
#STELLA.
Yes, his life has been stormy, but he was not broken by it.
#CZESKA.
So much the better. Listen! Such people are the best - they are true men. The more I think of it, the more sincerely I congratulate you.
#STELLA.
Thank you. I am glad I spoke to you frankly. The fact is that I am very lonesome here: papa is always ailing and our doctor has been away for three months.
#CZESKA.
Let that doctor of yours alone.
#STELLA.
You never liked him.
#CZESKA.
You know that I am not easily prejudiced against any one, but I do not like him.
#STELLA.
And do you know that he has been offered a professorship at the university, and that he is anxious to be elected a member of parliament? Mother, you are really unjust. You know that he sacrificed himself for us. He is famous, rich, and a great student, but notwithstanding all that he remains with us when the whole world is open to him. I would surely have asked his advice.
#CZESKA.
Love is not an illness - but no matter about him. May God help him! You had better tell me, dear kitten - are you very much in love?
#STELLA.
Do you not see how quickly everything has been done? It is true that Countess Miliszewska came here with her son. I know it was a question about me, and I feared, although in vain, that papa might have the same idea.
#CZESKA.
You have not answered my question.
#STELLA.
Because it is a hard matter to speak about. Mother, Mr. Pretwic's life is full of heroic deeds, sacrifices, and dangers. Once he was in great peril, and he owes his life to Count Drahomir. But how dearly he loves him for it. Well, my fiancé bears the marks of distant deserts, long solitudes, and deep sufferings. But when he begins to tell me of his life, it seems that I truly love that stalwart man. If you only knew how timidly, and at the same time how earnestly he told me of his love, and then he added that he knows his hands are too rough -
#CZESKA.
Not too rough - for they are honest. After what you have told me, I am in his favor with all my soul.
#STELLA.
But in spite of all that, sometimes I feel very unhappy.
#CZESKA.
What is the matter? Why?
#STELLA.
Because sometimes we cannot understand each other. There are two kinds of love - one is strong as the rocks, and the other is like a brook in which one can see one's self. When I look at George's love, I see its might, but my soul is not reflected in it like a face in a limpid brook. I love him, it is true, but sometimes it seems to me that I could love still more - that all my heart is not in that love, and then I am unhappy.
#CZESKA.
But I cannot understand that. I take life simply. I love, or I do not love. Well Stella, the world is so cleverly constructed, and God is so good that there is nothing more easy than to be happy. But one must not make a tangle of God's affairs. Be calm. You are very much in love indeed. No matter!
#STELLA.
That confidence in the future is exactly what I need - some of your optimism. I knew that you would frown and say: No matter! I am now more happy. Only I am afraid of our doctor. Well , our gentlemen are coming. Mr. Pretwic and Count Drahomir.
#CZESKA.
- Your future husband is looking very well, but so is Count Drahomir. Since when is he with Mr. Pretwic?
#STELLA.
- For the past two weeks. Mr. Pretwic has invited him. They are coming.
#CZESKA.
And your little heart is throbbing -
#STELLA.
Do not tease me again.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
- The princess is in the drawing - room.
#STELLA.
How late you are to - day!
#GEORGE.
It is true. The sun is already setting. But we could not come earlier. Do you not know that there has been a fire in the neighboring village? We went there.
#CZESKA.
We have heard of it. It seems that several houses were burned.
#GEORGE.
The fire began in the morning, and it was extinguished only now. Some twenty families are without a roof and bread. We are also late because Karol had an accident.
#STELLA.
- It is true. Your arm is in a sling!
#DRAHOMIR.
Oh, it is a mere trifle. If there were no more serious wounds in the world, courage would be sold in all the markets. Only a slight scratch -
#STELLA.
Mr. Pretwic, how did it happen?
#GEORGE.
When it happened I was at the other end of the village, and I could not see anything on account of the smoke. I was only told that Karol had jumped into a burning house.
#STELLA.
Oh, Lord!
#DRAHOMIR.
- I see that my deed gains with distance.
#CZESKA.
You must tell us about it yourself.
#DRAHOMIR.
They told me that there was a woman in a house of which the roof had begun to burn. Thinking that this salamander who was not afraid of fire was some enchanted beauty, I entered the house out of pure curiosity. It was quite dark owing to the smoke. I looked and saw that I had no luck, because the salamander was only an old Jewish woman packing some feathers in a bag. Amidst the cloud of down she looked like anything you please but an enchantress. I shouted that there was a fire, and she shouted too, evidently taking me for a thief - so we both screamed. Finally I seized hold of my salamander, fainting with fear, and carried her out, not even through a window, but through the door.
#GEORGE.
But you omitted to say that the roof fell in and that a spar struck your hand.
#DRAHOMIR.
True - and I destroyed the dam of my modesty, and will add that one of the selectmen of the village made a speech in my honor. It seems to me that he made some mention of a monument which they would erect for me. But pray believe that the fire was quenched by George and his people. I think they ought to erect two monuments.
#CZESKA.
I know that you are worthy of each other.
#STELLA.
Thank God that you have not met with some more serious accident.
#DRAHOMIR.
I have met with something very pleasant - your sympathy. Czeska - You have mine also - as for Mr. Pretwic, I have a bone to pick with him. George - Why, dear madam?
#CZESKA.
Because you are a bad boy. You had better go to the Prince, and let us talk for a while.
#STELLA.
Mother, I see you wish to flirt with Mr. Pretwic.
#CZESKA.
Be quiet, you giddy thing. May I not compete with you? But you must remember, you Mayflower, that before every autumn there is a spring. Well, be off!
#STELLA.
- Let us go; Papa is in the garden and I am afraid that he is feeling worse. What a pity it is that the doctor is not here.
#CZESKA.
I should scold you, as I have my dear girl, for keeping the secret. But she has already told me everything, so I only say, may God bless you both.
#GEORGE.
- Thank you, madam.
#CZESKA.
I have reared that child. I was ten years with her, so I know what a treasure you take, sir. You have said that your hands are too rough. I have answered her - not too rough, for they are honest. But Stella is a very delicate flower. She must be loved much, and have good care taken of her. But you will be able to do it - will you not?
#GEORGE.
What can I tell you? As far as it is in human power to make happy that dearest to me girl, so far I wish to assure her happiness with me.
#CZESKA.
With all my soul, I say: God bless you!
#GEORGE.
The Princess Stella loves you like her own mother, so I will be as frank with you as with a mother. My life has been a very hard one. There was a moment when my life was suspended by one thread - Karol rescued me then, and for that I love him as a brother; and then -
#CZESKA.
Stella told me. You lived far from here?
#GEORGE.
I was in the empty steppe, half wild myself, among strangers, therefore very sad and longing for the country. Sometimes there was not a living soul around me.
#CZESKA.
God was over the stars.
#GEORGE.
That is quite different. But a heart thrown on earth must love some one. Therefore, with all this capacity for love, I prayed to God that he permit me to love some one. He has granted my prayer, and has given her to me. Do you understand me now?
#CZESKA.
Yes, I do understand you!
#GEORGE.
How quickly everything has changed. I inherited here an estate and am able to settle - then I met the princess, and now I love her - she is everything in this world to me.
#CZESKA.
My dear Mr. Pretwic, you are worthy of Stella and she will be happy with you. My dear Stelunia -
#STELLA.
- What good news! The doctor is coming. He is already in the village. Papa will at once be more quiet and is in better humor.
#CZESKA.
You must not rush. She is already tired. Where is the prince?
#STELLA.
In the garden. He wishes you to come here.
#GEORGE.
We will go.
#STELLA.
- But you must not tell the doctor anything of our affair. I wish to tell him first. I have asked papa also to keep the secret.
#JOZWOWICZ.
- Jan, carry my trunk up - stairs and have the package I left in the antechamber sent at once to Mr. Anton Zuk, the secretary of the county.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
- Very well, doctor.
#JOZWOWICZ.
- At last After three months of absence, how quiet this house is always! In a moment I will greet them as a future member of the parliament. I have thrown six years of hard work, sleepless nights, fame, and learning into the chasm which separates us - and now we shall see! They are coming - she has not changed at all.
#STELLA.
Here is our doctor! Our dear doctor! How do you do? We were looking for you!
#CZESKA.
- Especially the prince.
#JOZWOWICZ.
- Good evening, princess. I have also been anxious to return. I have come to stay for a longer time - to rest. Ah, the prince! How is Your Highness's health?
#PRINCE.
- Dear boy. I am not well. You did well to come. You must see at once what is the matter with me.
#JOZWOWICZ.
But now Your Highness will introduce me to these gentlemen.
#PRINCE.
It is true. Doctor Jozwowicz, the minister of my interior affairs - I said it well, did I not? For you do look after my health. Count Karol Drahomir.
#DRAHOMIR.
Your name is familiar to me, therefore, strictly speaking, I alone ought to introduce myself.
#DR. BEVAN.
Sir.
#PRINCE.
- Mr. George Pretwic, our neighbor, and - and - I wish to say -
#GEORGE.
If I am not mistaken, your schoolmate.
#DR. BEVAN.
I did not wish to be the first to recollect.
#GEORGE.
I am glad to see you. It is quite a long time since then, but we were good comrades. Truly, I am very glad, especially after what I have heard here about you.
#DRAHOMIR.
You are the good spirit of this house.
#STELLA.
Oh, yes!
#PRINCE.
Let me tell you my opinion of him.
#GEORGE.
How often the best student, Jozwowicz, helped Pretwic with his exercises.
#DR. BEVAN.
You have a good memory, sir.
#GEORGE.
Very good, indeed, for then we did not call each other "sir." Once more, Stanislaw, I welcome you.
#DR. BEVAN.
And I return the welcome. George - But do I not remember that after you went through college you studied law?
#DR. BEVAN.
And afterward I became a doctor of medicine.
#PRINCE.
Be seated. Jan, bring the lights.
#STELLA.
How charming that you are acquainted!
#DR. BEVAN.
The school - bench, like misery, unites people. But then, social standing separates them. George's future was assured. I was obliged to search for mine.
#PRINCE.
He has searched also, and found adventures.
#DRAHOMIR.
In two parts of the world.
#CZESKA.
That is splendid.
#DR. BEVAN.
Well, he followed his instinct. Even in school he broke the horses, went shooting and fenced.
#GEORGE.
Better than I studied.
#DR. BEVAN.
- Yes - we used to call him the general, because he commanded us in our student fights.
#DRAHOMIR.
George, I recognized you there.
#CZESKA.
But now, I think, he will stop fighting.
#STELLA.
Who knows?
#GEORGE.
I am sure of it.
#DR. BEVAN.
As for me, I was his worst soldier. I never was fond of playing that way.
#PRINCE.
Because those are the distractions of the nobility and not of a doctor.
#DR. BEVAN.
We begin to quarrel already. You are all proud of the fact that your ancestors, the knights, killed so many people. But if the prince knew how many people I have killed with my prescriptions! I can guarantee you that none of Your Highness's ancestors can be proud of such great number.
#DRAHOMIR.
Bravo. Very good!
#PRINCE.
And he is my doctor!
#STELLA.
Papa! The doctor is joking.
#PRINCE.
Thanks for such jokes. But it is sure that the world is now upside - down.
#DR. BEVAN.
Your Highness, we will live a hundred years more. Come, tell me, what became of you?
#PRINCE.
You would not believe how unhappy I am because I cannot get along with that man. He is the son of a blacksmith from Stanislawow. I sent him to school because I wished to make an overseer of him. But afterwards he went to study at the University.
#DRAHOMIR.
He is twice a doctor - he is an intelligent man. One can see that by merely looking at him.
#STELLA.
Very much so.
#CZESKA.
So intelligent that I am afraid of him.
#DRAHOMIR.
But the prince must be satisfied.
#PRINCE.
Satisfied, satisfied! He has lost his common sense. He became a democrat - a sans culotte. But he is a good doctor, and I am sick. I have some stomach trouble. Have you heard of it?
#DRAHOMIR.
The prince complained already some time ago.
#CZESKA.
For twenty years.
#PRINCE.
Sorrow and public service have ruined my health.
#CZESKA.
But Your Highness is healthy.
#PRINCE.
- I tell you that I am sick. Stella, I am sick - am I not?
#STELLA.
But now you will feel better.
#PRINCE.
Because he alone keeps me alive. Stella would have died also with heart trouble if it had not been for him.
#DRAHOMIR.
If that is so, he is a very precious man.
#STELLA.
We owe him eternal gratitude.
#PRINCE.
- He will also be necessary to Pretwic. What, Stella, will he not?
#STELLA.
- Papa, how can I know that?
#DRAHOMIR.
Truly, I sometimes envy those stalwart men. During the battle they strengthen in themselves the force which lessens and disappears in us, because nothing nourishes it. Perhaps we are also made of noble metal, but we are eaten up with rust while they are hardened in the battle of life. It is a sad necessity.
#CZESKA.
How about Mr. Pretwic?
#DRAHOMIR.
George endured much, it is true, and one feels this although it is difficult to describe it. Look at those two men. When the wind blows George resists like a century - old tree, and men like the doctor subdue it and order it to propel his boat. There is in that some greater capacity for life, therefore the result is more easy to be foreseen. The tree is older, and although still strong, the more it is bitten by the storms, the sooner it will die.
#PRINCE.
I have said many times that we die like old trees. Some other thicket grows, but it is composed only of bushes.
#STELLA.
The one who is good has the right to live - we must not doubt about ourselves.
#DRAHOMIR.
I do not doubt, even for the reason that the poet says: "Saintly is the one who knows how to be a friend" "with saints."
#STELLA.
If he has not secured their friendship by flattery.
#DRAHOMIR.
But I must be permitted not to envy the doctor anything.
#STELLA.
The friendship is not exclusive, although I look upon the doctor as a brother.
#PRINCE.
Stella, what are you talking about? He is your brother as I am a republican. I cannot suffer him, but I cannot get along without him.
#CZESKA.
Prince, you are joking -
#DRAHOMIR.
- Why should you hate him?
#PRINCE.
Why? Have I not told you? He does with us what he pleases. He does as he likes in the house, he does not believe anything, and he is ambitious as the deuce. He is already a professor in the University, and now he wishes to be a member of parliament. Do you hear? - he will be a member of parliament! But I would not be a Starogrodzki if I had permitted it. Jozwowicz!
#DR. BEVAN.
- Your Highness, what do you order?
#PRINCE.
Is it true that you are trying to become a member of parliament.
#DR. BEVAN.
At your service, Your Highness?
#PRINCE.
Mrs. Czeska. Have you heard - the world is upside down, Jozwowicz!
#DR. BEVAN.
What is it, Your Highness?
#PRINCE.
And perhaps you will also become a minister.
#DR. BEVAN.
It may be.
#PRINCE.
Did you hear? And do you think that I will call you "Your Excellency"?
#DR. BEVAN.
It would be proper.
#PRINCE.
Jozwowicz, do you wish to give me a stroke of apoplexy?
#DR. BEVAN.
Be calm, Your Highness. My Excellency will always take care of your Grace's bile.
#PRINCE.
It is true. The irritation hurts me. What, Jozwowicz - does it hurt me?
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes, it excites the bile, but it gives you an appetite.
#STELLA.
What were you talking about?
#DR. BEVAN.
I have been listening to George. Horrible! Dreadful! George made a mistake by coming into the world two hundred years too late. Bayards are not appreciated nowadays.
#CZESKA.
Providence is above all.
#DRAHOMIR.
I believe it also.
#DR. BEVAN.
Were I a mathematician, without contradicting you I would say that, as in many cases we do not know what X equals, we must take care of ourselves.
#PRINCE.
What are you saying?
#STELLA.
Doctor, pray do not talk so sceptically, or there will be a war - not with papa, but with me.
#DR. BEVAN.
My scepticism is ended where your words begin, therefore I surrender.
#STELLA.
How gallant - the member of parliament.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
Tea is served.
#GEORGE.
I must bid you good - bye.
#STELLA.
Why, why are you going so early to - night?
#DR. BEVAN.
- My old schoolmate is at home here.
#GEORGE.
You must excuse me. I am very happy with you, but to - night I must be going home. I will leave Drahomir - he will replace me.
#STELLA.
To be angry with you would be to make you conceited. But you must tell me why you are going.
#GEORGE.
The people who have lost their homes by fire are in my house. I must give some orders and provide for their necessities.
#CZESKA.
- He is sacrificing pleasure to duty. Stella!
#STELLA.
What is it?
#CZESKA.
To - morrow we must make some collections for them, and provide them with clothing.
#DR. BEVAN.
I will go with you, ladies. It will be the first case in which misery did not search for the doctor, but the doctor searched for misery.
#CZESKA.
Very clever.
#PRINCE.
- Pretwic!
#GEORGE.
Your Highness, what do you order?
#PRINCE.
You say that this rabble is very poor?
#GEORGE.
Very poor, indeed.
#PRINCE.
You say that they have nothing to eat?
#GEORGE.
Almost nothing, my prince.
#PRINCE.
God punishes them for voting for such a man as that one.
#DR. BEVAN.
- They have not elected me yet.
#STELLA.
Papa.
#PRINCE.
What did I want to say? Aha! Pretwic!
#GEORGE.
I listen to you, my prince.
#PRINCE.
You said that they were starving?
#GEORGE.
I said - almost.
#PRINCE.
Very well, then. Go to my cashier, Horkiewicz, and tell him to give that rabble a thousand florins. They must know that I will not permit any one to be hungry. Stella - Dear father!
#DRAHOMIR.
I knew it would end that way.
#PRINCE.
Yes, Mr. Jozwowicz! Noblesse oblige! Do you understand, your Excellency, Mr. Jozwowicz?
#DR. BEVAN.
I understand, Your Highness.
#PRINCE.
- And now let us take some tea.
#DR. BEVAN.
I must also be going. I am tired and I have some letters to write.
#PRINCE.
Upon my honor, one might think that he was already a minister. But come to see us - I cannot sleep without you.
#DR. BEVAN.
I will be at the service of Your Highness.
#PRINCE.
- As soon as this Robespièrre arrived, I immediately felt better.
#STELLA.
Doctor, wait a moment. I do not take any tea. I will only put papa in his place, and then I will be back immediately. I must have a talk with you.
#DR. BEVAN.
What are these people doing here, and what does she wish to tell me? Is it possible - But no, it is impossible. I am uneasy, but in a moment everything will be cleared up. What an ass I am! She simply wishes to talk to me about the prince's health. It is this moonlight that makes me so dreamy - I ought to have a guitar.
#STELLA.
- Mr. Jozwowicz?
#DR. BEVAN.
I am here, princess.
#STELLA.
I did my best not to make you wait too long. Let us be seated and have a talk, as formerly, when I was small and not well and you took care of my health. I remember sometimes I used to fall asleep, and you carried me in your arms to my room.
#DR. BEVAN.
The darling of every one in the house was very weak then.
#STELLA.
And to - day, if she is well, it is thanks to you. If she has any knowledge, it is also thanks to you. I am a plant of which you have taken good care.
#DR. BEVAN.
And my greatest pride. There were few calm, genial moments in my life - and peace I found only in that house.
#STELLA.
You were always good, and for that reason I look upon you as an older brother.
#DR. BEVAN.
Your words form the only smile in my life. I not only respect you, but I also love you dearly - like a sister, like my own child.
#STELLA.
Thank you. I have not the same confidence in any one else's judgment and honesty as I have in yours, so I wished to speak to you about an important matter. I hope even that what I am going to tell you will please you as much as it pleases me. Is it true that you are going to become a member of parliament?
#DR. BEVAN.
- No, it is only probable. But speak of what concerns you.
#STELLA.
Well, then - ah, Lord! But you will not leave papa, will you?
#DR. BEVAN.
- Oh, you wish to speak of the prince's health?
#STELLA.
No, I know that papa is getting better. I did not expect that it would be difficult - I am afraid of the severe opinion that you have of people.
#DR. BEVAN.
- Pray, do not torture my curiosity.
#STELLA.
Then I will close my eyes and tell you, although it is not easy for any young girl. You know Mr. George Pretwic well, do you not?
#DR. BEVAN.
- I know him.
#STELLA.
How do you like him? He is my fiancé.
#DR. BEVAN.
- Your fiancé?
#STELLA.
Good gracious! - then you do not approve of my choice?
#DR. BEVAN.
Only one moment. Your choice, princess, if it is of your heart and will, must be good - only - it was unexpected news to me; therefore, perhaps, I received it a little too seriously. But I could not hear it with indifference owing to the affection I have for - your family. And then, my opinion does not amount to anything in such a matter. Princess, I congratulate you and wish you all happiness.
#STELLA.
Thank you. Now I shall be more easy.
#DR. BEVAN.
You must return to your father. Your news has been so sudden that it has shocked me a little. I must collect my wits - I must familiarize myself with the thought. But in any event, I congratulate you.
#STELLA.
Good night.
#JOZWOWICZ.
- Too late!
#DR. BEVAN.
Anton, come here. We can talk quietly, for they are preparing my room. What news from the city?
#ANTON.
Good news. In an hour or so a delegation of the voters will be here. You must say something to them - you understand? Something about education - public roads, heavy taxes. You know what to say better than I do.
#DR. BEVAN.
I know, I know; and how do they like my platform?
#ANTON.
You have made a great hit. I congratulate you. It is written with scientific accuracy. The papers of the Conservative party have gone mad with wrath.
#DR. BEVAN.
Very good. What more?
#ANTON.
Three days ago your election was doubtful in the suburbs. I learned about it, however - gathered the electors and made a speech. "Citizens," I said, in the end, "I know only one remedy for all your misery - it is called Jozwowicz. Long live Progress!" I also attacked the Conservative party.
#DR. BEVAN.
Anton, you are a great boy. Then there is a hope of victory?
#ANTON.
Almost a surety. And then, even if we do not win now, the future is open to us. And do you know why? Because - leaving out the details of the election, you and I, while talking of our business affairs, need not laugh at each other, like Roman augurs. Progress and truth are on our side, and every day makes a new breach in the old wall. We are only aiding the centuries and we must conquer. I am talking calmly: Our people, our electors are merely sheep, but we wish to make men of them, and therein lies our strength. As for me, if I were not persuaded that in my principles lie truth and progress, I would spit on everything and become a monk.
#DR. BEVAN.
But it would be a dreadful thing if we do not win this time.
#ANTON.
I am sure we will win. You are a fearful candidate for our adversaries. You have only one antagonist who is at all dangerous - Husarski, a rich and popular nobleman.
#DR. BEVAN.
Once I am in parliament, I will try to accomplish something.
#ANTON.
I believe in you, and for that reason I am working for you. Ha! ha! "They have already taken from us everything," said Count Hornicki at the club yesterday, "importance, money - even good manners." Well, at least I have not taken their good manners from them. To the devil with them!
#DR. BEVAN.
No, you have truly not taken their good manners from them.
#ANTON.
But it is said in the city that your prince has given a thousand florins to those whose houses were burned. This may be bad for us. You must do something also.
#DR. BEVAN.
I did what I could.
#ANTON.
I must also tell you that yesterday - What is the matter with you? I am talking to you and you are thinking about something else.
#DR. BEVAN.
Excuse me. I am in great trouble. I cannot think as calmly as usual.
#ANTON.
The idea!
#DR. BEVAN.
You could not understand it.
#ANTON.
I am the coachman of the carriage in which you are riding - I must know everything.
#DR. BEVAN.
No. It does not concern you.
#ANTON.
It does concern me, because you are losing your energy. We have no need of any Hamlets.
#DR. BEVAN.
- You are mistaken. I have not given up.
#ANTON.
I see. You close your mouth on this subject. It is not in your character to give up.
#DR. BEVAN.
No. You must work to have me elected. I would lose doubly if we were bitten.
#ANTON.
They must have burned you like the deuce, for you hiss dreadfully.
#DR. BEVAN.
An old story. A peasant did not sleep for six years, did not eat, bent his neck, wounded his hands, and carried logs for a hut. After six years a lord came along, kicked the hut and said: "My castle shall stand here." We are sceptical enough to laugh at such things.
#ANTON.
He was a real lord! lord for generations. He carried his head so high that he did not notice what cracked beneath his feet.
#ANTON.
I like the story. And what about the peasant?
#DR. BEVAN.
According to the peasant tradition, he is thinking of a flint and tinder.
#ANTON.
Glorious idea! Truly we despise tradition too much. There are good things in it.
#DR. BEVAN.
Enough. Let us talk of something else.
#ANTON.
- An old and rich house. It would make a splendid cabin.
#DR. BEVAN.
What do you say?
#ANTON.
Nothing. Has the old prince a daughter?
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes. Why?
#ANTON.
- Ha, ha! Your trouble has the scent of a perfume used by a lady. I smell here the petticoat of the princess. Behind the member of parliament is Jozwowicz, just as behind the evening dress there is the morning gown. What a strong perfume!
#DR. BEVAN.
You may sell your perspicacity at another market. It is my personal affair.
#ANTON.
Not at all, for it means that you put only half your soul into public affairs. To the deuce with such business! Look at me. They howl at me in the newspapers, they laugh at me - but I do not care. I will tell you more! I feel that I shall never rise, although I am not lacking in strength nor intelligence. I could try to get the first place in camp to command, but I do not do it. Why? Because I know myself very well. Because I know that I am lacking in order, authority, tact. I have been and I am a tool, used by such as you, and which to - morrow may be kicked aside when it is no more needed. But my self - love does not blind me. I do not care most for myself - I am working for my convictions - that is all. Any day I may be ousted from my position. There is often misery in my house, and although I love my wife and children - no matter. When it is a question of my convictions, I will work, act, agitate. I put my whole soul in it. And for you, the petticoat of a princess bars your way. I did not expect this from you. Tfu! spit on everything and come with us.
#DR. BEVAN.
You are mistaken. I have no desire for martyrdom, but for victory. And the more personal ties there are between me and public affairs, the more I will serve them with my mind, heart, and deeds - with all that constitutes a man. Do you understand?
#ANTON.
Amen. His eyes shine like the eyes of a wolf - now I recognize you.
#DR. BEVAN.
What more do you wish?
#ANTON.
Nothing more. I will only tell you that our motto should be: Attack the principles, and not the people.
#DR. BEVAN.
Your virginal virtue may rest assured. I shall not poison any one.
#ANTON.
I believe you, but I must tell you that I know you well. I appreciate your energy, your learning, your common sense, but I should not like to cross you in anything.
#DR. BEVAN.
So much the better for me.
#ANTON.
But if it is a question of the nobility, notwithstanding our programme I make you a present of them. You shall not cut their heads off.
#DR. BEVAN.
To be sure. And now go and get to work for me - or rather, for us.
#ANTON.
For us, Jozwowicz. Do not forget that.
#DR. BEVAN.
I will not swear it to you, but I promise you that I will not forget.
#ANTON.
But how will you manage that nobleman?
#DR. BEVAN.
Do you require that I make you my confidant?
#ANTON.
In the first place, I do not need your confidence, because in our camp we have sufficient perspicacity. There is the matter of the prince's daughter - that is all. But I am always afraid that for her sake you will abandon public affairs. As I am working for you, I am responsible for you, therefore we must be frank.
#DR. BEVAN.
Let us be frank.
#ANTON.
Therefore you have said to yourself: I shall get rid of that nobleman. Do it then. It is your business - but I ask you once more: Do you wish to become a member of parliament for us, or for the princess? That is my business.
#DR. BEVAN.
I throw my cards on the table. I, you, we are all new people, and all of us have this quality - we are not dolls, painted with the same color. There is room in us for convictions, love, hatred - in a word, as I told you, for everything of which a man of complex nature is composed. Nature has given me a heart and the right to live, therefore I desire for happiness; it gave me a mind, therefore I serve my chosen idea. One does not exclude the other. Why should you mix the princess with our public affairs - you, an intelligent man? Why do you wish to replace life by a phrase? I have the right to be happy, and I shall achieve it. And I shall know how to harmonize the idea with the life, like a sail with a boat. I shall sail more surely then. You must understand me; in that is our strength - that we know how to harmonize. In that lies our superiority over others, for they do not know how to live. What I will amount to with that woman, I do not know. You call me a Hamlet - perhaps I may become a Hamlet, but you have no need of it.
#ANTON.
It seems to me that you are again right. But thus you will fight two battles, and your forces will have to be divided.
#DR. BEVAN.
No! I am strong enough.
#ANTON.
Say frankly - she is betrothed.
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes.
#ANTON.
And she loves her fiancé.
#DR. BEVAN.
Or she deceives herself.
#ANTON.
At any rate, she does not love you.
#DR. BEVAN.
In the first place, I must get rid of him. In the mean while, go and work.
#ANTON.
- In a few moments the committee will be here to see you.
#DR. BEVAN.
Very well. The prince is coming with the Countess Miliszewska and her son, my opponent. Let us be going.
#COUNTESS.
It is impossible to understand. The world grows wild nowadays.
#PRINCE.
I say the same. Stella, do I not say so?
#STELLA.
Very often.
#COUNTESS.
- Sit near the princess and entertain her. Go ahead!
#JANET.
I am going, mamma.
#COUNTESS.
There is too much of that audacity. I have sent Mr. Podczaski to the electors, and they say: "We do not need representatives without heads." I am only surprised that the prince is not more indignant. I rush here and there, I pray and work, and they dare to oppose to my son Mr. Jozwowicz.
#PRINCE.
But madam, what can I do?
#COUNTESS.
And who is Mr. Jozwowicz - a physician? What does a doctor amount to? Jan has influence, importance, social position, relatives - and what has the doctor? From whence did he come here? Who ever heard of him? Really, I cannot speak calmly, and I think it must be the end of the world. Is it not, Mr. Podczaski?
#PODCZASKI.
- Yes, countess, God's wrath. There were never such loud thunders.
#PRINCE.
Thunders? Mrs. Czeska, what? Have your heard thunder?
#CZESKA.
It is a very usual thing at the end of spring. Do not mind it.
#COUNTESS.
- Jan, go ahead.
#JANET.
Yes, mamma, I am going.
#COUNTESS.
Prince, you will see that Jan will not be elected purely on account of the hatred against us. They say that he does not know the country, and does not understand its needs. But before all we must not allow such people as Jozwowicz to become important in the country. Prince, is it not so?
#PRINCE.
He will not ask your permission.
#COUNTESS.
That is exactly why the world must be coming to an end - that such people can do as they please! They dare to say that Jan will not be able to make a good representative, and that Mr. Jozwowicz will. Jan was always an excellent student in Metz. Jan, were you not a good student?
#JANET.
Yes, mamma.
#PODCZASKI.
Countess, you are perfectly right. It is the end of the world.
#STELLA.
What did you study especially?
#JANET.
I, madam? I studied the history of heresy.
#PRINCESS.
Mrs. Czeska - what? Have studied what?
#COUNTESS.
They reproach us with not having talent, but for diplomacy one must have talent.
#PODCZASKI.
The count does even look like a diplomat.
#PRINCE.
- Well, not very much.
#CZESKA.
The count does not have much to say.
#JANET.
No, madam, but sometimes I speak quite enough.
#COUNTESS.
For my part, I declare that if Jan is not elected, we will leave the country.
#PODCZASKI.
They will be guilty of it.
#COUNTESS.
It will be the fault of the prince.
#PRINCE.
Mine?
#COUNTESS.
How can you permit such as Jozwowicz to compete with society people? Why do you retain him?
#PRINCE.
Frankly speaking, it is not I who keep him - it is he who keeps me. If it were not for him, I should long since be
#COUNTESS.
- By keeping him, you serve the democracy. serve the democracy? Stella, do you hear?
#COUNTESS.
Every one will say so. Mr. Jozwowicz is the democratic candidate.
#PRINCE.
But I am not, and if it is so I will not allow him to be. I have enough of Mr. Jozwowicz's democracy. They shall not say that I am the tool of democracy. Ask the doctor to come here.
#COUNTESS.
Now the prince is a true prince.
#PRINCE.
I serve democracy, indeed!
#STELLA.
Papa, dear.
#COUNTESS.
We must bid the prince good - bye. Jan, get ready. Good - bye, dear Stella. Good - bye, my child. Kiss the princess's hand.
#JOZWOWICZ.
Your Highness must excuse me if I am too late, but I was obliged to receive the delegates.
#COUNTESS.
What delegates are here? Jan, go ahead.
#DR. BEVAN.
- Count, you must hasten, they are leaving.
#PODCZASKI.
I am Your Highness's servant.
#PRINCE.
- I forbid you to become a member of parliament.
#DR. BEVAN.
I shall not obey.
#PRINCE.
You make me angry.
#DR. BEVAN.
Your Highness closes to me the future.
#PRINCE.
- I have brought you up.
#DR. BEVAN.
I preserve Your Highness's life.
#PRINCE.
I have been a second father to you.
#DR. BEVAN.
Your Highness, let us speak calmly. If you have been to me a father, I have until now been to you a son. But the father must not bar to his son the road to distinction.
#PRINCE.
Public distinction is not for such people as you, sir.
#DR. BEVAN.
- A moment ago Your Highness called me a son.
#PRINCE.
What son?
#DR. BEVAN.
Your Highness, were I your son I would be rich and have a title - in a word everything Your Highness possesses. But being a poor man, I must make my way, and no one has the right to bar it to me, especially if my road is straight and honest. Unless Your Highness would like to adopt me in order to preserve the family.
#PRINCE.
What nonsense you are talking.
#DR. BEVAN.
I am only joking. Well, Your Highness, let us cease this irritation.
#PRINCE.
It is true, it hurts me. Why will you not give up the idea of becoming a member of parliament?
#DR. BEVAN.
It is my future.
#PRINCE.
And in the mean time I am vexed by every one on that account. When I was young I was in many battles and I did not fear. I can show my decorations. I was not afraid of death on the battlefield, but those Latin illnesses of yours - Why do you look at me in that way?
#DR. BEVAN.
I am looking as usual. As for your illness, I will say that it is more the imagination of Your Highness than anything else. The constitution is strong, and with my assistance Your Highness will live to the age of Methusaleh.
#PRINCE.
Are you sure of it?
#DR. BEVAN.
Positive.
#PRINCE.
Good boy! And you will not leave me?
#DR. BEVAN.
Your Highness may be assured of that.
#PRINCE.
Then you may become a member of parliament or whatever you please. Stella! Oh, she is not here! Upon my honor, that Miliszewski is an ass. Don't you think so?
#DR. BEVAN.
I cannot contradict Your Highness.
#STELLA.
I came because I was afraid you would quarrel. Well, what is the end of the discussion?
#PRINCE.
Well, that good - for - nothing man will do what he pleases.
#DR. BEVAN.
The fact is that the prince has approved of my plans and has granted me permission to try my luck at the election. Mrs. Czeska. - We had better all go to the garden. Mr. Pretwic and Count Drahomir are waiting - we are going for a sail on the lake.
#PRINCE.
Then let us be going You see, madam, that Miliszewska!
#STELLA.
How is my father's health?
#DR. BEVAN.
All that can be expected. But you are pale, princess.
#STELLA.
Oh, I am well.
#DR. BEVAN.
It is the consequence of the betrothal.
#STELLA.
It must be.
#DR. BEVAN.
But health requires one to be merry - to enjoy life.
#STELLA.
I do not wish for any other distraction.
#DR. BEVAN.
If not distraction, at least enjoyment. We here are too grave for you. Perhaps we cannot understand you.
#STELLA.
You are all too good.
#DR. BEVAN.
At least solicitous. If you have a moment to spare let us be seated and have a talk. My solicitude must explain my boldness. With the dignity of a fiancé, serenity and happiness generally go hand in hand. When the heart is given willingly, all longing ceases and the future is viewed with serenity.
#STELLA.
My future contains something which might cause even the most valiant to fear.
#DR. BEVAN.
Of what are you talking? You have called me a sceptic, but it is I who says: who loves, believes.
#STELLA.
What then?
#DR. BEVAN.
Who doubts?
#STELLA.
Doctor.
#DR. BEVAN.
Princess, I do not inquire. There are moments when the serenity visibly departs from your face, therefore I question you, which is my duty as a physician and a friend. Be calm. Pray, remember that this is asked by a man whom a while ago you called "brother," and who knows how dear to him is the happiness of such a sister! I have no one in this world - all my love of family is centred in your house. My heart has also its sorrows. Pray, quiet my apprehensions - that is all I ask you.
#STELLA.
What apprehensions?
#DR. BEVAN.
Apprehensions of which I dare not speak. Since my return I have watched you constantly, and the more I watch you the more do I fear. You fear the future - you do not look into it with confidence and hope.
#STELLA.
Permit me to go.
#DR. BEVAN.
No, madam. I have the right to ask, and if you fear to look into the bottom of your heart, then I have the right to say that you lack courage, and for such sinful weakness one pays later with his own happiness and the happiness of others. I suffer also - but I must - I must. Madam, listen to me. If in your heart there is even the shadow of a doubt, you have mistaken your sentiments.
#STELLA.
Is it possible to make such a mistake?
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes. Sometimes - often one mistakes sympathy, pity, commiseration for love.
#STELLA.
What a dreadful mistake!
#DR. BEVAN.
Which one recognizes as soon as the heart flies in another direction. The dignity of a fiancé is a hidden pain. If I am mistaken, pray forgive me.
#STELLA.
Doctor, I do not wish to think of such things.
#DR. BEVAN.
Then I am not mistaken. Do not look on me with fear. I wish to save you, my dear child. Where is your heart? The moment that you recognize you do not love Mr. Pretwic, that moment will tell you whom you do love. No, I shall not withdraw my question. Where is your heart? By God, if he is not equal to you, he shall rise to your height! But no, I have become a madman.
#STELLA.
I must be going.
#DR. BEVAN.
- No, you shall not go until you have given me an answer. Whom do you love?
#STELLA.
Doctor, spare me - otherwise I shall doubt everything. Have pity on me.
#DR. BEVAN.
- Whom do you love?
#DRAHOMIR.
Princess.
#STELLA.
Ah!
#DRAHOMIR.
What! Have I frightened you? I came to tell you that the boats are waiting. What is the matter with you?
#STELLA.
Nothing. Let us be going.
#DR. BEVAN.
- Oh! I - under - stand!
#PODCZASKI.
Tell the Doctor that Mr. Podczaski wishes to see him on an important matter.
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
The Doctor is very busy. The princess is ill. But I will tell him
#PODCZASKI.
- I have enough of this work for nothing. The countess sends me about to agitate for her, but when I ask her for some money, she answers: We shall see about it after the election. She is an aristocrat and she refuses a hundred florins to a nobleman. To the deuce with such business. I had better try elsewhere, to serve the Doctor. He pays because he has common sense. And as he will bite them, then I will rise in consideration.
#PODCZASKI.
Your servant, sir.
#DR. BEVAN.
What can I do for you?
#PODCZASKI.
Well, sir, I am going to come right to the point. You know what services I have rendered the Countess Miliszewski?
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes, you have been agitating against me in favor of Count Miliszewski. Podczaski. - No, not at all, sir. Well, sir, it was so, but I am going to change that, and you may be certain -
#DR. BEVAN.
In a word, what do you wish, sir?
#PODCZASKI.
God sees, sir, that I served the countess faithfully, and it cost me quite a little, but on consulting my conscience I have concluded not to act any more against such a man as you, sir, for the sake of the country.
#DR. BEVAN.
I appreciate your sentiments, which are those of a good citizen. You do not wish to act against me any longer?
#PODCZASKI.
No, sir!
#DR. BEVAN.
You are right. Then you are with me?
#PODCZASKI.
If I may offer my services -
#DR. BEVAN.
I accept.
#PODCZASKI.
- He is a man - I have a hundred florins in my pocket already. My gratitude -
#DR. BEVAN.
Mine will be shown after the election.
#PODCZASKI.
Oh!
#JANET.
Good - morning, doctor. Is my mother here?
#DR. BEVAN.
The countess is not here.
#JANET.
We came together, but mamma went directly to the prince's apartment. I remained alone and I cannot find my way to the prince's apartment. Ah! Mr. Podczaski, what are you doing here?
#PODCZASKI.
Your servant, sir. Well, I came to consult the doctor - I have rheumatism in my feet.
#JANET.
Doctor, will you be kind enough to show me to the Prince's apartment?
#DR. BEVAN.
They are in the left wing of the château.
#JANET.
Thank you. But later I would like to have a talk with you.
#DR. BEVAN.
I will be at your service, sir.
#ANTON.
I beg your pardon, sir.
#JANET.
Pardon
#ANTON.
- I was told you were here and I rushed. Listen, a matter of great importance. What! You are here? Our adversary here?
#PODCZASKI.
- I am no longer your adversary.
#ANTON.
- So much the better then - but leave us alone just the same.
#PODCZASKI.
- Bad. Gentleman, do not forget me. The devil has taken my hundred florins.
#ANTON.
What did he wish?
#DR. BEVAN.
Money.
#ANTON.
Did you give it to him?
#DR. BEVAN.
No.
#ANTON.
You did well. We do not bribe. But no matter about that. What good luck that they put up Miliszewski for a candidate. Otherwise you would be lost because Husarski would have had the majority.
#DR. BEVAN.
Anton, I am sure that we will be defeated.
#ANTON.
No! What am I for? Uf! How tired I am. Let me rest for five
#MINUTES.
Good gracious! how soft the furniture is here. We must donate some money for some public purpose. Have you any money?
#DR. BEVAN.
I have some.
#ANTON.
We are going to give that money to build a school.
#DR. BEVAN.
Here is the key of my desk - you will find some ready money there, and some checks.
#ANTON.
Very well, but I must rest a moment. In the mean while what is the news here? You are not looking well. Your eyes have sunken. Upon my word, I was not so much in love with my wife. Speak - I will rest in the mean while - but speak frankly.
#DR. BEVAN.
I will be frank with you.
#ANTON.
What more?
#DR. BEVAN.
That marriage will be broken off.
#ANTON.
Why.
#DR. BEVAN.
Because there are times when these people do not succeed in anything.
#ANTON.
To the garret with those peacocks. And what about that cannibal Pretwic? long story. The princess has mistaken the sympathy which she feels for him for something more serious. To - day she knows that she does not love him.
#ANTON.
That is good. Truly, it looks as though they were pursued by fate. It is the lot of races that have lived too long.
#DR. BEVAN.
Implacable logic of things.
#ANTON.
Then she is not going to marry him. I pity them, but to the deuce with sentimentality!
#DR. BEVAN.
She would marry him if it killed her to keep her word. But there is a third person entangled in the matter - Count Drahomir.
#ANTON.
At every step one meets a count! He betrays Pretwic?
#DR. BEVAN.
What a blockhead you are.
#ANTON.
Well, frankly speaking, I do not care one whit for your drawing - room affairs.
#DR. BEVAN.
Drahomir and she do not know that they love each other. But something attracts them to each other. What is that force? They do not ask. They are like children.
#ANTON.
And how will you profit from all this?
#DR. BEVAN.
Listen, you democrat. When two knights are in love with one noble damsel, that love usually ends dramatically - and the third party usually gets the noble damsel.
#ANTON.
And the knights?
#DR. BEVAN.
Let them perish.
#ANTON.
What then do you suppose will happen?
#DR. BEVAN.
I do not know. Pretwic is a passionate man. He does not foresee anything - I see only the logic of things which is favorable to me, and I shall not be stupid enough to place any obstacles to my happiness.
#ANTON.
I am sure you will help it along in case of need.
#DR. BEVAN.
Well, I am a physician. It is my duty to assist nature.
#ANTON.
The programme is ready. I know you. I only wish to ask you how you know what you say is so. Maybe it is only a story.
#DR. BEVAN.
I can have verification of it through the princess's ex - governess.
#ANTON.
You must know as soon as possible.
#DR. BEVAN.
Mrs. Czeska will be here in a moment. I asked her to come here.
#ANTON.
Then I am going. Do you know what? Do not help nature too much, because it would be -
#CZESKA.
- You wished to speak to me?
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes, madam.
#ANTON.
- I am going to get the money and I will be back in a moment.
#DR. BEVAN.
Very well.
#CZESKA.
Who is that gentleman? pilot.
#CZESKA.
What do you mean?
#DR. BEVAN.
He guides the boat in which I am sailing. As for the rest, he is a horribly honest man.
#CZESKA.
I do not understand very well. What did you wish to speak to me about?
#DR. BEVAN.
About the princess. You are both like mother and daughter, and you should have her entire confidence. What is the matter with her? She conceals something - some sorrow. As a doctor I must know everything, because in order to cure physical disease one must know the moral cause. The spirit of Aesculapius forgive me this phrase.
#CZESKA.
My good sir, what are you asking about?
#DR. BEVAN.
I have told you that the princess conceals some sorrow.
#CZESKA.
I do not know.
#DR. BEVAN.
We both love her; let us then speak frankly.
#CZESKA.
I am willing.
#DR. BEVAN.
Then, does she love her fiancé?
#CZESKA.
How can you ask me such a question? If she did not, she would not be betrothed to him. It is such a simple thing that even I do not talk to her about it any more.
#DR. BEVAN.
You say: "I do not talk about it any more"; so you have already talked about it.
#CZESKA.
Yes. She told me that she was afraid she did not love him enough. But every pure soul fears that it does not fulfil its duty. Why did you ask me that?
#DR. BEVAN.
- I have my reasons. I wished to know. I am wasting my time with her.
#JANET.
I could not find mamma. Good - morning, madam. Do I intrude?
#CZESKA.
Not at all, sir. She will do her duty; rest assured of that.
#DR. BEVAN.
Thank you.
#JANET.
Doctor.
#DR. BEVAN.
I am listening to you, sir.
#JANET.
Let us speak frankly. Mamma wishes me to become a member of parliament, but I do not care for it.
#DR. BEVAN.
You are too modest, sir.
#JANET.
You are sneering, and I do not know how to defend myself. But I am frank with you - I would not care a bit about being elected to parliament if it were not for my mamma. When mamma wishes for something it must be accomplished. All women of the family of Srokoszynski are that way, and mamma is of that family.
#DR. BEVAN.
But, count, you have a will of your own.
#JANET.
That is the trouble - the Miliszewskis are all ruled by the women. It is our family characteristic, sir. knightly characteristic indeed! But what can I do for you?
#JANET.
I am not going to oppose you.
#DR. BEVAN.
I must be as frank with you as you are with me. Until now you have helped me.
#JANET.
I don't know how, but if it is so, then you must help me in your turn.
#DR. BEVAN.
In what?
#JANET.
It is a very delicate question. But you must not tell mamma anything about it.
#DR. BEVAN.
Certainly not.
#JANET.
Mamma wishes me to marry the princess, but I, sir, I do not want -
#DR. BEVAN.
You do not want?
#JANET.
It astonishes you?
#DR. BEVAN.
I must be frank -
#JANET.
I do not wish to because I do not wish to. When a man does not feel like marrying, then he does not feel like it. You will suppose that I am in love with some one else? It may be. But it is not with the princess. Naturally, when mamma says: "Jan, go ahead," I go ahead, because I cannot help it. The Miliszewskis knew how to manage the men, but not the women.
#DR. BEVAN.
I do not understand - how can I be useful to you?
#JANET.
You can do anything in this house, so you must help me secretly, to be refused.
#DR. BEVAN.
Count, you may rely on me in that matter.
#JANET.
Thank you.
#DR. BEVAN.
And it will be so much the easier done because the princess is betrothed.
#JANET.
I did not know that any one dared to compete with me.
#DR. BEVAN.
- What an idea! It is Mr. George Pretwic.
#JANET.
Then they wished to make sport of me.
#DR. BEVAN.
Mr. Pretwic is an audacious man. You were perfectly right when you said the question was a delicate one. The people are afraid of Mr. Pretwic; if you were to give up, people would say that -
#JANET.
That I am also afraid? Then I will not give up. My dear sir, I see you do not know the Miliszewskis. We do not know how to handle the women, but there is not a coward in our family. I know that people laugh at me, but the one who would dare to call me a coward would not laugh. I will show them at once that I am not a coward. Where is Mr. Pretwic?
#DR. BEVAN.
He is in the garden Do you see him there, near the lake?
#JANET.
Good - bye.
#DR. BEVAN.
The men who have not such sons are great! Ha! ha! ha!
#ANTON.
- You are here? Here are your receipts for the money. Why are you laughing?
#DR. BEVAN.
Miliszewski has gone to challenge Pretwic.
#ANTON.
Are they crazy?
#DR. BEVAN.
What an opinion she would have of Pretwic if he were to quarrel with such an idiot!
#ANTON.
You have done it.
#DR. BEVAN.
I told you that I shall assist nature.
#ANTON.
Do as you please; I withdraw.
#DR. BEVAN.
Good - bye. Or no, I am going also. I must prevent the adventure from going too far.
#ANTON.
I wanted to tell you that I must buy some food for my children. I will return the money - later on. Is it all right?
#DR. BEVAN.
How can you ask?
#STELLA.
That walk tired me. See how weak I am Where is Mr. Pretwic?
#DRAHOMIR.
Young Miliszewski asked to speak to him a moment. The countess is speaking to the prince. It seems that their conversation is very animated because the countess did not know that you were betrothed, and she had some designs on you. But pray excuse me; I laugh and you suffer by it.
#STELLA.
I would laugh too if I did not know how much it troubles my father. And then, I pity Count Miliszewski.
#DRAHOMIR.
I understand how a similar situation would be painful to a man who was in love, but such is not the case with the count. He will console himself if his mother orders it.
#STELLA.
Sometimes one may be mistaken about people.
#DRAHOMIR.
Do you speak about me or Miliszewski?
#STELLA.
Let us say it is about you. They told me that you were a mirror of all perfections.
#DRAHOMIR.
And have you discovered that I am the personification of all faults?
#STELLA.
I did not say so.
#DRAHOMIR.
But you think so. But I am not deceived. Your portrait drawn by Mr. Pretwic and the Doctor is exactly like you.
#STELLA.
How was the portrait?
#DRAHOMIR.
With wings at the shoulders.
#STELLA.
That means that I have as much dignity as a butterfly.
#DRAHOMIR.
Angels' wings are in harmony with their dignity.
#STELLA.
True friendship should speak the truth. Tell me some bitter one.
#DRAHOMIR.
Very bitter?
#STELLA.
As wormwood - or as is sometimes the case - with life.
#DRAHOMIR.
Then you are kind to me.
#STELLA.
For what sin shall I begin penitence?
#DRAHOMIR.
For lack of friendship for me.
#STELLA.
I was the first to appeal for friendship - in what respect am I untrue to it?
#DRAHOMIR.
Because you share with me your joys, sports, laughter, but when a moment of sorrow comes, you keep those thorns for yourself. Pray share with me your troubles also.
#STELLA.
It is not egotism on my part. I do not wish to disturb your serenity.
#DRAHOMIR.
The source of my serenity does not lie in egotism either. George told me of you when I came here: "I know only how to look at her and how to pray to her; you are younger and more mirthful, try to amuse her." Therefore I brought all my good spirits and laid them at your feet. But I notice that I have bored you. I see a cloud on your face - I suspect some hidden sorrow, and being your best friend, I am ready to give my life to dispel that cloud.
#STELLA.
- You must not talk that way.
#DRAHOMIR.
- Let me talk. I was a giddy boy, but I always followed my heart, and my heart guessed your sorrow. Since that moment a shadow fell across my joy, but I overcame it. One cannot recall a tear which has rolled down the cheek, but a friendly hand can dry it. Therefore I overcame that cloud in order that the tears should not come to your eyes. If I have been mistaken, if I have chosen the wrong path, pray forgive me. Your life will be as beautiful as a bouquet of flowers, therefore be mirthful - be mirthful.
#STELLA.
- I shall be; being near you, I am capricious, spoiled, and a little bit ill. Sometimes I do not know myself what is the matter with me, and what I wish. I am happy; truly I am happy.
#DRAHOMIR.
Then, no matter, as Mrs. Czeska says. Let us be merry, laugh, and run in the garden and play pranks with the countess and her son.
#STELLA.
I have discovered the source of your mirth; it is a good heart.
#DRAHOMIR.
No, madam. I am a great good - for - nothing. But the source of true happiness is not in this.
#STELLA.
Sometimes I think that there is none in this world.
#DRAHOMIR.
We cannot grasp it with our common sense, and will not fly after that winged vision. Sometimes perhaps it flies near us, but before we discover it, before we stretch out our hands, it is too late!
#STELLA.
What sad words - too late!
#DR. BEVAN.
- Ha! ha! Do you know what has happened?
#STELLA.
Is it something amusing? dreadful, tragic, but before a ridiculous thing. Miliszewski wished to challenge Pretwic.
#STELLA.
For Heaven's sake!
#DR. BEVAN.
You must laugh with me. If there were anything dreadful I would not frighten you, princess.
#DRAHOMIR.
And what has been the end of it?
#DR. BEVAN.
I was angry with Mr. Pretwic for taking the matter so seriously.
#DRAHOMIR.
How could he help it?
#DR. BEVAN.
But it would be shameful for a man like Mr. Pretwic to fight with such a poor thing.
#STELLA.
The doctor is right. I do not understand Mr. Pretwic.
#DR. BEVAN.
Our princess must not be irritated. I have made peace between them. Mr. Pretwic did not grasp the real situation and his naturally sanguine disposition carried him away. But now that I have explained to him, he agrees that it would be too utterly ridiculous.
#DRAHOMIR.
And what about Miliszewski?
#DR. BEVAN.
I have sent him to his mamma. He is a good boy.
#STELLA.
I shall scold Mr. Pretwic, nevertheless.
#DRAHOMIR.
But you must not be too severe.
#STELLA.
You are laughing, gentlemen. I am sorry that it was necessary to explain the matter to Mr. Pretwic. I must scold him immediately
#DRAHOMIR.
The princess is a true angel.
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes, there is not a spot in the crystalline purity of her nature.
#DRAHOMIR.
It must be true when even you, a sceptic, speak of her with such enthusiasm.
#DR. BEVAN.
I have been here six years. When I came she wore short dresses. She grew by my side. Six years have their strength - it was impossible not to become attached to her.
#DRAHOMIR.
I believe you. Strange, however, that you self - made people have no hearts.
#DR. BEVAN.
Why?
#DRAHOMIR.
Because - I know what you would say about her social position, but hearts are equal, so it does not matter. Then how did it happen that you, being so near the princess, did not -
#DR. BEVAN.
- What?
#DRAHOMIR.
I cannot find an expression.
#DR. BEVAN.
But I have found it. You are asking me why I did not fall in love with her?
#DRAHOMIR.
I hesitated to pronounce the too bold word.
#DR. BEVAN.
Truly, if you, count, are lacking in boldness, I am going to help you out, and I ask you: And you, sir?
#DRAHOMIR.
Doctor, be careful.
#DR. BEVAN.
I hear some lyrical tone.
#DRAHOMIR.
Let us finish this conversation.
#DR. BEVAN.
As you say, although I can speak quietly, and in order to change the conversation, I prefer to ask you: Do you think she will be happy with Mr. Pretwic?
#DRAHOMIR.
What a question! George loves her dearly.
#DR. BEVAN.
I do not doubt it, but their natures are so different. Her thoughts and sentiments are as delicate as cobweb - and George? Have you noticed how hurt she was that he accepted the challenge?
#DRAHOMIR.
Why did you tell her about it?
#DR. BEVAN.
I was wrong. Therefore George -
#DRAHOMIR.
Will be happy with her.
#DR. BEVAN.
Any one would be happy with her, and to every one one might give the advice to search for some one like her. Yes, count, search for some one like her
#DRAHOMIR.
- Search for some one like her - and if there is some one like, her - too late
#STELLA.
- What is the matter with you?
#DRAHOMIR.
You here?
#STELLA.
- I am searching for papa. Excuse me, sir, I must go.
#DRAHOMIR.
- Go, madam. I must get away from here as soon as possible.
#PRINCE.
- She has tormented me until now. Good gracious! Ah, it is you, Drahomir.
#DRAHOMIR.
Yes, prince. Who tormented you?
#PRINCE.
The Countess Miliszewski. My dear boy, how can he be a member of parliament when he is so densely stupid!
#DRAHOMIR.
It is true.
#PRINCE.
Don't you see! And then she proposed to marry him to Stella. The idea! She is already betrothed. But of course they did not know.
#DRAHOMIR.
How did you get rid of her?
#PRINCE.
The doctor helped me out. Jozwowicz is a smart man - he has more intelligence than all of us together.
#DRAHOMIR.
It is true.
#PRINCE.
But you, Drahomir, you are smart also, are you not?
#DRAHOMIR.
How can I either affirm or deny? But Jozwowicz is very intelligent, that much is certain.
#PRINCE.
Yes. I do not like him, and I am afraid of him and I am fond of him, but I tell you I could not live without him.
#DRAHOMIR.
He is an honest man, too.
#PRINCE.
Honest? Very well, then, but you are better because you are not a democrat. Drahomir, I love you. Stella, I love him - Ah! She is not here.
#DRAHOMIR.
Thank you, prince.
#PRINCE.
If I had another daughter, I would - well -
#DRAHOMIR.
Prince, pray do not speak that way. I must run away.
#PRINCE.
Come, have a cigar with me. We will call the others and have a talk. Jozwowicz! Pretwic!
#DR. BEVAN.
- What are your orders, Your Highness?
#PRINCE.
You, Robespièrre, come and have a cigar. Thank you, my boy. You have rid me of the countess.
#DR. BEVAN.
I will send for Pretwic, and we will join you. Ask Mr. Pretwic to come here.
#DR. BEVAN.
- Anton was right. I am helping along the logic. But I do not like the sap - because I am accustomed to break.
#GEORGE.
I was looking for you.
#DR. BEVAN.
The prince has invited us to smoke a cigar with him.
#GEORGE.
Wait a moment. For God's sake tell me what it means. Stella changes while looking at her - there is something heavy in the air. What does it mean?
#DR. BEVAN.
That melancholy is the mode now.
#GEORGE.
You are joking with me.
#DR. BEVAN.
I know nothing.
#GEORGE.
Excuse me. The blood rushes to my head. I see some catastrophe hanging over me. I thought you would say something to pacify me. I thought you were my friend.
#DR. BEVAN.
Do you doubt it?
#GEORGE.
Shake hands first. Then give me some advice.
#DR. BEVAN.
Advice? Are you ill?
#GEORGE.
- Truly, you play with me as a cat with a mouse.
#DR. BEVAN.
Because I know nothing of presentiments.
#GEORGE.
Did you not tell me that she is not ill?
#DR. BEVAN.
No, she is wearied.
#GEORGE.
You speak about it in a strange way and you have no conception of the pain that your words cause me.
#DR. BEVAN.
Then try to distract her.
#GEORGE.
What? Who?
#DR. BEVAN.
Who? Count Drahomir, for instance.
#GEORGE.
Is she fond of him?
#DR. BEVAN.
And he of her also. Such poetical souls are always fond of each other.
#GEORGE.
What do you mean by that?
#DR. BEVAN.
- And you - how do you take my words?
#GEORGE.
- Not another word. You understand me, and you must know that I do not always forgive.
#DR. BEVAN.
- I believe you wish to frighten me. Besides this, what more do you wish?
#GEORGE.
- You must ask me what I did wish, because I do not now wish for anything. You have known her longer than I have, therefore I came to you as her friend and mine, and for answer you banter with me. In your eyes there shone hatred for me, although I have never wronged, you. Be the judge yourself! I would be more than right in asking you: What do you wish of me, if it were not for the reason that it is immaterial to me.
#DR. BEVAN.
We shall see.
#DR. BEVAN.
Give it to me. Oh, I can no longer control my hatred. I will crush you into dust; and now I shall not hesitate any longer. Damnation, I must be going there at once.
#CZESKA.
- Doctor, I am looking for you.
#DR. BEVAN.
What has happened?
#CZESKA.
Stella is ill. I found her weeping.
#DR. BEVAN.
- Poor child! I will go to see her at once.
#DRAHOMIR.
Doctor, I came to bid you farewell.
#DR. BEVAN.
- Ah, you are going away?
#DRAHOMIR.
Yes.
#DR. BEVAN.
So suddenly? For long?
#DRAHOMIR.
I am returning to - day to Swietlenice, to George; to - morrow I leave for Paris.
#DR. BEVAN.
One word - have you said anything to any one of your plans?
#DRAHOMIR.
Not yet. I only made up my mind an hour ago.
#DR. BEVAN.
Then Mr. Pretwic knows nothing about it as yet?
#DRAHOMIR.
No; but why do you ask?
#DR. BEVAN.
- I must act now - otherwise everything is lost. Count, I have not much time to speak to you now, because in a moment I expect Anton in regard to a matter on which my whole future depends. Listen to me. I beseech you, for the sake of the peace and health of the princess, not to mention to any one that you are going away. Neither to the Prince nor to Mr. Pretwic.
#DRAHOMIR.
I do not understand you.
#DR. BEVAN.
You will understand me. Now I cannot tell you anything more. In a half hour pray grant me a moment of conversation. Then you will understand me - that I guarantee you. Here is Anton. You see I cannot explain now.
#DRAHOMIR.
I will see you again.
#ANTON.
The fight is very hot. Have you the address?
#DR. BEVAN.
Here it is. How goes it?
#ANTON.
Up to now everything is well, but I repeat - the fight is very hot. If you had not come the last time, you would have lost the battle, because Miliszewski has withdrawn and his partisans vote for Husarski. Podczaski is good for nothing. Your speech in the city hall was splendid. May thunder strike you! Your address was admired even by your enemies. Oh, we will at last be able to do something. For three days I have not slept - I have not eaten - I work and I have plenty of time, because I have lost my position.
#DR. BEVAN.
You have lost your position?
#ANTON.
On account of the agitation against Husarski.
#DR. BEVAN.
Have you found any means against him?
#ANTON.
I have - written an article. I have brought it to you. Read it. He sues me - he will beat me. They will put me in prison, but it will be only after the election, and my article wronged him very much.
#DR. BEVAN.
Very well.
#ANTON.
But when I am in prison you must take care of my wife and children. I love them dearly. I have three of them. It is too much - but natura lex dura.
#DR. BEVAN.
Be assured.
#ANTON.
You would not believe me if I were to tell you that I am almost happy. Sometimes it seems to me that our country is a moldy room and that I open the window and let in the fresh air. We will work very hard. I believe in you, because you are an iron man.
#DR. BEVAN.
I shall either perish or gain two victories.
#ANTON.
Two?
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes; the other one even to - day, here. The events have surprised me in some way. The facts turned against me, and I was obliged to build my plans of action only a short while ago.
#ANTON.
Eh! If we win only there. Do you know what - I would prefer that you abandon the idea of the other victory.
#DR. BEVAN.
Anton, you are mistaken.
#ANTON.
Because you worry a great deal. You have grown awfully thin. Look in the mirror.
#DR. BEVAN.
No matter; after I have sprung the mine I shall be calmer and the mine is ready.
#ANTON.
But it will cost you too much.
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes, but I shall not retract.
#ANTON.
At least be careful and do not smear your hands with the powder.
#STELLA.
- Ah, excuse me.
#DR. BEVAN.
Mr. Anton Zuk, a friend of mine. What is your wish, princess?
#STELLA.
You told me to stay in bed and it is so hard to lie down. Mrs. Czeska went to the chapel and I escaped. Do you approve?
#DR. BEVAN.
I cannot help it, princess, although I would like to scold you like a disobedient child. A few moments ago some one else begged for you also.
#STELLA.
Who was it?
#DR. BEVAN.
Count Drahomir. And he begged so earnestly that I promised him that I would allow you to leave the bed. He wishes to have a talk with you to - day, because he will not be able to see you again.
#STELLA.
- What does it mean?
#DR. BEVAN.
He will be here at five o'clock.
#STELLA.
Very well.
#DR. BEVAN.
And now, pray, return to your room. Your dress is too thin and you might catch cold.
#ANTON.
Ah, that is the princess.
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes, it is she.
#ANTON.
Very pretty, but looks as though she was made of mist. As for me, I prefer women like my wife. From such as your princess you cannot expect sturdy democrats.
#DR. BEVAN.
Enough of that.
#ANTON.
Then I will weigh anchor and sail. I will distribute the pamphlet with your address, and then I will write another article against Husarski. If they put me in prison they shall at least have a reason for it. Good - bye.
#DR. BEVAN.
If you meet a servant, tell him that I am waiting for Count Drahomir.
#DR. BEVAN.
- Let that golden - haired page go, but he must see her before he goes. This leave - taking shall be the red flag for the bull. I am waiting for you, sir. Is Mr. Pretwic in the château?
#DRAHOMIR.
He is with the prince.
#DR. BEVAN.
Count, be seated, and let us talk.
#DRAHOMIR.
- I am listening, sir.
#DR. BEVAN.
You are in love with the princess.
#DRAHOMIR.
Mr. Jozwowicz!
#DR. BEVAN.
On your honor - yes or no?
#DRAHOMIR.
Only God has the right to ask me such a question. I do not dare to ask myself.
#DR. BEVAN.
And your conscience?
#DRAHOMIR.
And no one else.
#DR. BEVAN.
Then let us turn the question. She loves you.
#DRAHOMIR.
Be silent, sir. Oh, God!
#DR. BEVAN.
Your pride is broken. You knew of it?
#DRAHOMIR.
I did not wish to know it.
#DR. BEVAN.
But now you are aware of it.
#DRAHOMIR.
That is the reason why I am going away from here forever.
#DR. BEVAN.
It is too late, sir. You have tangled her life and now you leave her.
#DRAHOMIR.
For God's sake, what shall I do, then?
#DR. BEVAN.
Go away, but not forever, and not without telling her good - bye.
#DRAHOMIR.
Why should I add the last drop to an already overflowing cup? beautiful phrase. Can you not understand that it will hurt her good name if you should go away suddenly without taking leave of her? And she - she is ill and she may not be able to bear your departure.
#DRAHOMIR.
I do not see any remedy -
#DR. BEVAN.
There is only one. Find some pretext, bid her good - bye quietly, and tell her that you will be back. Otherwise it will be a heavy blow for her strength. You must leave her hope. She must not suspect anything. Perhaps later she will become accustomed to your absence - perhaps she will forget -
#DRAHOMIR.
It will be better for her to forget.
#DR. BEVAN.
I will do my best, but I shall first throw a handful of earth on your memory.
#DRAHOMIR.
What shall I do, then?
#DR. BEVAN.
To find a pretext to bid her good - bye, tell every one that you are going. Then come back - and go away. Mr. Pretwic also must not know anything.
#DRAHOMIR.
When shall I bid her good - bye?
#DR. BEVAN.
In a moment. I told her. I will manage to be with Pretwic during that time. She will be here presently.
#DRAHOMIR.
I would prefer to die.
#DR. BEVAN.
No one is certain of to - morrow. Be off now.
#DR. BEVAN.
How warm it is here! My head is splitting. Ask Mr. Pretwic to come here. My head is bursting - but then I will have a long peace.
#GEORGE.
- What do you wish with me?
#DR. BEVAN.
I wish to give you good advice about the princess's health.
#GEORGE.
How is she?
#DR. BEVAN.
Better. I allowed her to leave bed because she and Drahomir asked me to.
#GEORGE.
Drahomir?
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes. He wishes to talk with her. They will be here in a quarter of an hour.
#GEORGE.
Jozwowicz, I am choking with wrath and pain. Drahomir avoids me.
#DR. BEVAN.
But you do not suspect him.
#GEORGE.
I swear to you that I have defended myself from suspicions as a man dying on the steppe defends himself from the crows - that I have bitten my hands with pain and despair - that I still defend myself. But I cannot any more. I cannot. The evidence pounds on my brain. He avoids me. He tells me that I have become an idiot - that I have become a madman, because -
#DR. BEVAN.
Keep your temper. Even if he were in love with the princess, nobody rules his own heart.
#GEORGE.
Enough! You were right when you coupled his name with hers. At that moment I repulsed the thought, but it was there just the same The fruit is ripened. Oh, what a ridiculous and dreadful part I am playing here -
#DR. BEVAN.
But he saved your life.
#GEORGE.
In order to take it when it began to have a certain value. His service is paid with torture, with a slain happiness, with a broken hope, with destroyed faith in myself, in him and in her.
#DR. BEVAN.
Be easy.
#GEORGE.
I loved that man. Tell me that I am a madman and I shall be calmed. How dreadful to think that it is he! Forgive me everything I said to you before and help me. Evil thoughts are rushing through my head.
#DR. BEVAN.
Be calm - you are mistaken.
#GEORGE.
Prove to me that I am mistaken and I will kneel before you.
#DR. BEVAN.
You are mistaken, because Drahomir is going away.
#GEORGE.
He is going away. Oh, Lord! Then I can live without such tortures, I may hope!
#DR. BEVAN.
- But he is not going away forever. He said he would return.
#GEORGE.
You put me on the cross again.
#DR. BEVAN.
Come to your senses and do not let yourself be carried away by madness. At any rate you gain time. You can win her heart back again.
#GEORGE.
No - it is done. I am sinking into a precipice.
#DR. BEVAN.
Everything will be straightened out by his absence.
#GEORGE.
- But did you not tell me that he will return?
#DR. BEVAN.
Listen: I agree with you that you have repaid Drahomir for the services of saving your life with your tortures. Drahomir has betrayed you and has broken the friendship between you by winning her heart. But I do not think that he is going away in order to avoid your vengeance.
#GEORGE.
And to give her time to break her engagement! Yes, yes! I am cursed. I suspect him now of everything. He avoids me.
#DR. BEVAN.
Mr. Pretwic.
#GEORGE.
Enough. I am going to ask him when he will be back. He has saved my life once, and slain me ten times.
#DR. BEVAN.
Where are you going?
#GEORGE.
To ask him how long he is going away.
#DR. BEVAN.
Wait a moment. How could you ask him such a question? Perhaps he is innocent, but pride will shut his mouth and everything will be lost. Stay here - you can leave only over my corpse. I am not afraid of you! - do you understand? In a moment they will be here. You wish for proofs - you shall have them. From the piazza you cannot hear them, but you can see them. You shall be persuaded with your own eyes - perhaps you will regret your impetuosity.
#GEORGE.
- Very well, then. May God grant that I was mistaken! Thank you - but you must not leave me now.
#DR. BEVAN.
One word more. No matter what happens I shall consider you a villain if you place her life in peril by any outburst.
#GEORGE.
Granted. Where shall we go?
#DR. BEVAN.
On the piazza. But you have fever - you are already shaking.
#GEORGE.
I am out of breath. Some one is coming. Let us be going.
#DRAHOMIR.
The last evening and the last time. O Lord, thy will be done!
#STELLA.
- The Doctor told me that you wished to see me.
#DRAHOMIR.
Yes, madam. Pray forgive my boldness. A very important affair calls me home. I come to bid you good - bye.
#STELLA.
You are going away?
#DRAHOMIR.
To day I am going to Swietlenice, to - morrow still further.
#STELLA.
Yes, it is necessary.
#DRAHOMIR.
Life has flown like a dream - it is time to wake up.
#STELLA.
Shall we see each other again?
#DRAHOMIR.
If God permits it.
#STELLA.
Then let us shake hands in farewell. I can assure you that you have a friend in me. Friendship is like an immortal - it is a pale flower, but does not wither. May God guide you and protect you. The heart - of a sister - will follow you everywhere. Remember -
#DRAHOMIR.
Farewell.
#STELLA.
Farewell. Why do you deceive me? You are going forever.
#DRAHOMIR.
Have mercy on me.
#STELLA.
Are you going away forever?
#DRAHOMIR.
Yes, then.
#STELLA.
I guessed it. But perhaps it is better - for both of us.
#DRAHOMIR.
Oh, yes. There are things which cannot be expressed, although the heart is bursting. A while ago you told me that you will remember - it will be better for you to forget.
#STELLA.
I cannot.
#DRAHOMIR.
- Then I love you, my dearest, and that is the reason why I escape.
#STELLA.
- Oh, God!
#DRAHOMIR.
Ah, it is you, George.
#GEORGE.
Do not approach me. I have seen all. You are a villain and a coward. Drahomir - George!
#GEORGE.
In order not to soil my hand, I throw in your face our broken friendship, my trampled happiness, lost faith in God and man, endless contempt for you and myself.
#DRAHOMIR.
Enough.
#GEORGE.
Do not approach me, because I will lose my self - command and will sprinkle these walls with your brains. No, I shall not do that - because I have promised. But I slap your face, you villain. Do you hear me?
#DRAHOMIR.
- Such an insult I swear before God and man I will wash out with blood.
#GEORGE.
Yes, with blood Here is the witness of these words.
#DR. BEVAN.
At your service, gentlemen.
#DR. BEVAN.
You are here?
#GEORGE.
You are as afraid of me as of a ghost.
#DR. BEVAN.
I thought you were elsewhere.
#GEORGE.
I am going directly from here to fight. I have still an hour. The duel will take place at Dombrowa, on the Miliszewski's estate - not far from here.
#DR. BEVAN.
Too near from here.
#GEORGE.
Miliszewski insisted. And then you will be here to prevent the news from being known until as late as possible.
#DR. BEVAN.
Doctor Krzycki will be with you?
#GEORGE.
Yes.
#DR. BEVAN.
Ask him to send me the news at once. I would go with you, but I must be here.
#GEORGE.
You are right. If I am killed?
#DR. BEVAN.
You must not think of that.
#GEORGE.
There are some people who are cursed from the moment they are born, and for whom death is the only redemption. I belong to that class. I have thought everything over quietly. God knows that I am more afraid of life than of death. There is no issue for me. Suppose I am not killed - tell me what will become of me, if I kill the man whom she loves? Tell me! I will live without her, cursed by her. Do you know that when I think of my situation, and what has happened, I think some bad spirit has mixed with us and entangled everything so that only death can disentangle it. duel is very often ended by a mere wound.
#GEORGE.
I insulted Drahomir gravely, and such an insult cannot be wiped out by a wound. Believe me, one of us must die. But I came to talk with you about something else.
#DR. BEVAN.
I am listening to you.
#GEORGE.
Frankly speaking, as I do not know what will become of me, and whether in an hour I shall be alive or not, I came to have one more look at her. Because I love her dearly. Perhaps I was too rough for her - too stupid - but I loved her. May God punish me if I have not desired her happiness. As you see me here it is true that at this moment I pity her the most and feel miserable about her future. Listen: whether I am killed or not, she cannot be mine. Drahomir cannot marry her, because he could not marry the woman whose fiancé he has killed. Of the three of us you alone will remain near her. Take care of her - guard her. Into your hands I give her, the only treasure I ever possessed.
#DR. BEVAN.
- I shall carry out your wishes.
#GEORGE.
And now - I may be killed. I wish to die like a Christian. If ever I have offended you, forgive me.
#DR. BEVAN.
- Yes, of the three of us I alone shall remain near her.
#ANTON.
- Man, have you become an idiot? When every moment is valuable, you remain here. The results are uncertain. They have put up big posters - Husarski's partisans are catching the votes in the streets. For God's sake come with me. A carriage is waiting for us.
#DR. BEVAN.
I must remain here. I cannot go under any consideration in the world. Let be what may.
#ANTON.
I did not expect such conduct from you. Come and show yourself, if only for a moment, and the victory is ours. I cannot speak any more. I am dead tired. Have you become a madman? There - we have worked for him, and he clings to a petticoat and stays here.
#DR. BEVAN.
Anton! Even if I should lose there I would not stir one step from here. I cannot and I will not go.
#ANTON.
So?
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes.
#ANTON.
Do what you please, then. Very well. My congratulations. What does it mean?
#DR. BEVAN.
It means that I must remain here. At this moment Drahomir stands opposite Pretwic with a pistol. If the news of the fight should come to the princess, she would pay for it with her life.
#ANTON.
They are fighting!
#DR. BEVAN.
For life or death. In a moment the news will come who is killed.
#ANTON.
Jozwowicz, you have done all this.
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes, it is I, I crushed those who were in my way, and I shall act the same always. You have me such as I am.
#ANTON.
If so, I am no longer in a hurry. Do you know what I am going to tell you?
#DR. BEVAN.
You must go for a while. The princess is coming. Go in there for a moment.
#STELLA.
Doctor, what is the matter in this house?
#DR. BEVAN.
What do you mean, princess?
#STELLA.
Mr. Pretwic came to tell me good - bye. He was very much changed and asked me to forgive him if he ever offended me.
#DR. BEVAN.
- A sentimental ass.
#STELLA.
He said that he might be obliged to go away in a few days. I have a presentiment that you are hiding something from me. What does it mean? Do not torture me any longer. I am so miserable that you should have pity on me.
#DR. BEVAN.
Do not let anything worry you. What can there be the matter? An idle fancy, that is all! The care of loving hearts surrounds you. Why should you have such a wild imagination? You had better return to your apartment and do not receive any one. I will come to see you in a moment.
#STELLA.
Then truly there is nothing bad?
#DR. BEVAN.
What an idea! Pray believe me, I should be able to remove anything which would threaten your happiness.
#STELLA.
- Oh, Mr. Jozwowicz, happiness is a very difficult thing to take hold of. May only the peace not leave us.
#DR. BEVAN.
This way, princess. Some one is waiting for me in that room. In a moment I will come to see you. Pray do not receive any one. Anton!
#ANTON.
Here I am. Poor child!
#DR. BEVAN.
I cannot go for her sake. I must be here and not let the bad news reach her, for it would kill her.
#ANTON.
What! and you, knowing this, you still expose her, and sacrifice her for yourself?
#DR. BEVAN.
- I love her and I must have her, even if the walls of this house should crumble around our heads.
#ANTON.
Man, you are talking nonsense.
#DR. BEVAN.
Man, you are talking like a nincompoop, and not like a man. You have plenty of words in your mouth, but you lack strength - you cannot face facts. Who would dare say: You have no right to defend yourself?
#ANTON.
- Good - bye.
#DR. BEVAN.
Where are you going?
#ANTON.
I return to the city.
#DR. BEVAN.
Are you with me or against me?
#ANTON.
I am an honest man. servant - A messenger brought this letter from Miliszewski.
#DR. BEVAN.
Give it to me. Go "Pretwic is dead." Ah -
#ANTON.
Before I go I must answer your question as to why I am going. I have served you faithfully. I served you like a dog because I believed in you. You knew how to use me, or perhaps to use me up. I knew that I was a tool, but I did not care for that, because - But now -
#DR. BEVAN.
You give up the public affair?
#ANTON.
You do not know me. What would I do if I were to give up my ideas? And then, do you think that you personify public affairs? I will not give up because I have been deceived by you. But I care about something else. I was stupid to have cared for you, and I regret now that I must tell you that you have heaped up the measure and used badly the strength which is in you. Oh, I know that perhaps it would be better for me not to tell you this, perhaps to hold with you would mean a bright future for such a man as I, who have hardly the money to buy food for my wife and children. But I cannot. Before God, I cannot! I am a poor man and I shall remain poor, but I must at least have a clear conscience. Well, I loved you almost as much as I loved my wife and children, but from to - day you are only a political number - for friendship you must look to some one else. You know I have no scruples; a man rubs among the people and he rubs off many things; but you have heaped up the measure. May I be hanged if I do not prefer to love the people than pound them! They say that honesty and politics are two different things. Elsewhere it may be so, but in our country we must harmonize them. Why should they not go together? I do not give up our ideas, but I do not care for our friendship because the man who says he loves humanity, and then pounds the people threateningly on their heads - that man is a liar; do you understand me?
#DR. BEVAN.
I shall not insist upon your giving me back your friendship, but you must listen to me for the last time. If there shall begin for me an epoch of calamity, it will begin at the moment when such people as you begin to desert me. The man who was killed was in my way to happiness - he took everything from me. He came armed with wealth, good name, social position, and all the invincible arms which birth and fortune give. With what arms could I fight him? What could I oppose to such might? Nothing except the arms of a new man - that bit of intelligence acquired by hard work and effort. He declared a mute war on me. I have defended myself. With what? With the arms which nature has given me. When you step on a worm you must not take it amiss if the worm bites you; he cannot defend himself otherwise. It is the law of nature. I placed everything on one card, and I won - or rather it is not I, but intelligence which has conquered. This force - the new times - have conquered the old centuries. And you take that amiss? What do you want? I am faithful, to the principle. You are retreating. I am not! That woman is necessary for my happiness because I love her. I need her wealth and her social position for my aims. Give me such weapons and I will accomplish anything. Do you know what an enormous work and what important aims I have before me? You wish me to tear down the wall of darkness, prejudice, laziness, you wish me to breathe new life into that which is dead. I cry: "Give me the means." You do not have the means, therefore I wish to get them, or I shall perish. But what now? Across the road to my plans, to my future - not only mine but everybody's - there stands a lord, a wandering knight, whose whole merit lies in the fact that he was born with a coat of arms. And have I not the right to crush him? And you wish me to fall down on my knees before him? Before his lordship - to give up everything for his sake? No! You do not know me. Enough of sentiment. A certain force is necessary and I have it, and I shall make a road for myself and for all of you even if I should be obliged to trample over a hundred such as Pretwic.
#ANTON.
No, Jozwowicz, you have always done as you wanted with me, but now you cannot do it. As long as there was a question of convictions I was with you, but you have attacked some principles which are bigger than either you or I, more stable and immutable. You cannot explain this to me, and you yourself must be careful. At the slightest opportunity you will fall down with all your energy as a man. The force you are attacking is more powerful than you are. Be careful, because you will lose. One cannot change a principle: straight honesty is the same always. Do what you please, but be careful. Do you know that human blood must always be avenged? It is only a law of nature. You ask me whether I am going to leave you? Perhaps you would like to be given the right to fire on the people from behind a fence when it will suit you. No, sir. From to - day there must be kept between us a strict account. You will be a member of parliament, but if you think we are going to serve you, and not you us, you are greatly mistaken. You thought that the steps of the ladder on which you will ascend are composed of rascals? Hold on! We, who have elected you - we, in whose probity you do not believe - we will watch you and judge you. If you are guilty we will crush you. We have elected you; now you must serve.
#DR. BEVAN.
- Anton!
#ANTON.
Quiet. In the evening you must appear before the electors. Good - bye, Mr. Jozwowicz.
#DR. BEVAN.
- He is the first.
#JANET.
- Pst!
#DR. BEVAN.
Who is there?
#JANET.
It is I, Miliszewski. Are you alone?
#DR. BEVAN.
You may enter. What then?
#JANET.
Everything is over. He did not live five minutes. I have ordered them to carry the body to Miliszewo.
#DR. BEVAN.
Your mother is not here?
#JANET.
I sent her to the city. To - day is election day and mamma does not know that I have withdrawn, therefore she will wait for the evening papers in the hope that she will find my name among those elected.
#DR. BEVAN.
Did no one see?
#JANET.
I am afraid they will see the blood. He bled dreadfully. strange thing. He was such a good marksman.
#JANET.
He permitted himself to be killed. I saw that very plainly. He did not fire at Drahomir at all. He did not wish to kill Drahomir. Six steps - it was too near. It was dreadful to look at his death. Truly, I would have preferred to be killed myself. They had to fire on command - one! two! three! We heard the shot, but only one. We rushed - Pretwic advanced two steps, knelt and tried to speak. The blood flowed from his mouth. Then he took up the pistol and fired to one side. We were around him and he said to Drahomir: "You have done me a favor and I thank you. This life belonged to you, because you saved it. Forgive me," he said, "brother!" Then he said: "Give me your hand" and expired. Drahomir threw himself on his breast - it was dreadful. Poor Princess Stella. What will become of her now?
#DR. BEVAN.
For God's sake, not a word in her presence. She is ill.
#JANET.
I will be silent.
#DR. BEVAN.
You must control your emotion.
#JANET.
I cannot. My knees are trembling.
#PRINCE.
I thought Pretwic was with you. Jozwowicz, where is Pretwic?
#DR. BEVAN.
I do not know.
#STELLA.
Did he tell you where he was going?
#DR. BEVAN.
I know nothing about it.
#CZESKA.
- Count, what is the matter with you? You are so pale.
#JANET.
Nothing. It is on account of the heat.
#PRINCE.
Jozwowicz, Pretwic told me -
#COUNTESS.
Jan, where is my Jan? O God, what is the matter? How dreadful!
#DR. BEVAN.
- Be silent, madam.
#STELLA.
What has happened?
#COUNTESS.
Then you have not killed Pretwic? You have not fought?
#DR. BEVAN.
Madam, be silent.
#STELLA.
Who is killed?
#COUNTESS.
Stella, my dearest, Drahomir has killed Pretwic.
#STELLA.
Killed! O God!
#DR. BEVAN.
Princess, it is not true.
#STELLA.
Killed!
#DR. BEVAN.
She has fainted. Let us carry her to her chamber.
#PRINCE.
My child!
#CZESKA.
Stelunia!
#JANET.
- It is dreadful. Who could have expected that mamma would return! Mamma, how is the princess?
#COUNTESS.
The doctor is trying to bring her to her senses. Until now he has not succeeded. Jan, let us be going.
#JANET.
- I shall not go. Why did you return from the city?
#COUNTESS.
For you. To - day is election day - have you forgotten it?
#JANET.
I do not wish to be a member of parliament. Why did you tell her that Pretwic was killed?
#DR. BEVAN.
Everything is over.
#JANET.
- What, the bell of the chapel? Then she is dead!
#PODCZASKI.
- Victory! Victory! The deputation is here. Hurrah! Hurrah! for victory!
#JOZWOWICZ.
I have lost!
