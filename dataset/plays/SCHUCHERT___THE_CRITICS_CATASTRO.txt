#DONALD WORCESTER.
I suppose it will be eminently respectable.
#CARBON HATCHETT.
Her advance notices would lead one to suppose that she has something of a prestige.
#EDWARD MORLESS.
That guff! I saw it. Awful! What I want to know is: what the devil does she mean by beginning her program with Debussy. I just wonder what’s become of Beethoven—ha, ha!
#DONALD WORCESTER.
I suppose she imagines she’s going to revolutionize program - making.
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Gentlemen, when I give my piano recital on March twentieth, you’ll hear the best possible way to start a program. Debussy is altogether too weak to lead; he’s scarcely able to get in at all but I’ve found a leader that is a leader—Archibald Shanks. If I know anything, and I do, this Shanks is going to become the American composer. Why, he’s so much better than MacDowell with all his Scotchy junk that there’s no comparison. I found Shanks in Rolling Prairie, South Dakota; and when I play his March of the Rock - Spirits at my recital on March the twentieth, you’ll hear the real thing—it’s music, I tell you.
#XILEF BOWOWSKI.
Hmh! Ah - hmh! I remember looking over compositions by Archibald Shanks, sent me by a certain New York publisher, to get my opinion before taking them; and in one of them—I forget the title—I think it was Through the Marsh—some such title—hmh!—it doesn’t really matter—I found seven consecutive fifths and twelve parallel octaves within the space of a few bars. Positively inexcusable!
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Blgh - h! That belongs to his early period. Through the Marsh is simply a practice - stunt, done when he was about fifteen—a mere youthful exercise. You can’t judge by—blgh - h!
#DONALD WORCESTER.
I read in the Artists’ News that young Shanks is only seventeen at the present time.
#EDWARD MORLESS.
Probably means his son—Waiter!—What do you want, boys? I’m dry as a bone. And we’ve got a long afternoon before us. However, for my part, I shan’t be in any hurry about getting there. What’ll it be? little plum brandy for me.
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Bring me some Haig and Haig.
#CARBON HATCHETT.
Manhattan cocktail. large beer.
#EDWARD MORLESS.
Good! Let’s have some Green River, Tim. Krupp, do you think she’ll be any good at all? woman? From Budapest? On a Thimble piano? Starting in with Debussy? And you ask if she’ll be good! How could she be?
#DONALD WORCESTER.
I was reading the other day——
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
All she plays is trash, of one kind or another. Debussy never does anything but move up and down the whole - tone scale; no melody, no counterpoint, no music at all. And take the Tchaikowsky thing, for instance. Everybody knows that Tchaikowsky always carried a whip in one hand and a gun in the other, and when he wasn’t using one, it was the other. It’s proverbial, and makes such a handy remark when thinking would take too long. And his piano - style: he simply hasn’t got any; it’s pathetic. I see you don’t get my joke on the sixth symphony—the Pathetique. I say, America won’t stand for that sort of thing. Some kindly person should have informed this Madame Frizza Bonjoline before she made a complete fool of herself.
#CARBON HATCHETT.
She hasn’t played yet, and maybe it won’t be so bad after all. friend of mine tells me that Mr. Debussy is one of the greatest living melodists.
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Blgh - h! No further imbecility is displayed for the time being. Soon the party breaks up, and a natural modesty prevents the critics from seeing each other again until after the piano recital by Madame Frizza Bonjoline, an artist who is but slightly known in the United States, but one who has achieved recognition throughout Europe, South America, and Australia. She has just given an unusual program, which she could not close with less than seven encores. While the five critics wait outside the green - room, they
#HATCHETT TO KRUPP.
It’s good to have you among us again, Krupp. Although I do have a terrible time steering my thoughts through the mazes of the English language I feel like the only live one left, since the Trib dropped you. The town needs you, and I’m glad you have an opportunity again to mould public opinion. We need more strong - minded men like you.
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
I know it, but the cattle don’t recognize good criticism when they see it.
#HATCHETT TO KRUPP.
How did the Madame strike you? Plenty of emotion, I thought.
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Impossible program—good God!—did you ever hear such a medley? And she hasn’t the strength of a kitten.
#HATCHETT TO KRUPP.
Of course, she didn’t seem quite vital enough, but that may have been because of her choice of numbers. They were somewhat “outre.”
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Altogether too girlish, I say.
#EDWARD MORLESS.
Splendid personality, but a rotten technic, don’t you think?
#DONALD WORCESTER.
As near as I can tell, she wears marvelous silk hose. They were the most striking thing about the whole concert.
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Blgh - ggh - h!
#XILEF BOWOWSKI.
I suppose then, Mr. Worcester, one doesn’t require any ears to get the good or bad out of a concert—only eyes.
#EDWARD MORLESS.
Well, Bowowski, ears were a nuisance today, at any rate, don’t you think? The optic impressions were far the best—easily. I wonder when we’re going to get in here. Xilef Bowowski has been tramping up and down the corridor, his ultra - distinguished chin a trifle elevated, his hands locked behind his back. He is evidently searching for words. In a moment, the door of the green - room swings open and a well - dressed man is seen bidding good - bye to Madame Frizza. The stranger takes no notice of the group of critics as he brushes past and hurries away. Then a most charming voice welcomes the five critics. The Madame is greeted by four blushes and one scowl. The scowling one, Mr. Krupp, is the first one to enter the green - room. Close behind
#MADAME BONJOLINE.
Gentlemen, this is so good of you. And how did you like my recital? I hope it pleased you—yes? There is a moment of silence which, as it becomes awkward, is broken
#DONALD WORCESTER.
Some concert, all right.
#MADAME BONJOLINE.
How good of you. I am happy.
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
I confess I find myself unable to understand the judgment which places Debussy at the first of a program. Now why did you——
#MADAME BONJOLINE.
Ah,—ho, ho, ha, ha—that is our little joke, gentlemen, is it not? I suppose no one knew that I played Rachmaninoff instead of Debussy at the start—no one but ourselves. I changed my mind after I was out on the platform.
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
I was—blgh - h!—that is, Mr. Stalk was at my office to see me about my coming American orchestra concert, at which I myself conduct, and so I was detained, and did not get to hear your opening number.
#DONALD WORCESTER.
How did you manage to get along without Brahms, Madame. I should be interested——
#MADAME BONJOLINE.
Oh, you did not hear my third encore, then—the Brahms B - minor Capriccio. I am so sorry you missed it.
#DONALD WORCESTER.
Oh, was that Brahms? I thought it sounded rather chunky, now that I recall it.
#EDWARD MORLESS.
Would it seem too—well, let us say—American to you if I were to ask you to lunch with me, Madame Bonjoline? I should be extremely happy to have that pleasure.
#MADAME BONJOLINE.
Ah, but the pleasure is mine. I shall be delighted to accept—that is, if there is time. I make that condition only.
#EDWARD MORLESS.
Thank you, thank you, Madame.
#XILEF BOWOWSKI.
Madame Bonjoline, do you remember the date of publication of the Gliere Prelude which you played today? It has completely slipped my mind.
#MADAME BONJOLINE.
My good sir, I could not recall it to save my soul.
#DONALD WORCESTER.
I wish your playing sounded as good as it looks, Madame.
#MADAME BONJOLINE.
How delightfully American you are! So frank, so utterly frank! But that reminds me: my friend, James Shooneker—perhaps you saw him; he left just as you came in—told me that my playing looked as good as it sounded. How strange a coincidence! You all know him, of course. For Europe, he is the great critic. He is in Chicago for a short time, and he is going to review my recital for a magazine here—I believe it is called Le Petit Revue, or something like that.
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Oh, yes; that effusive young lady’s journal, The Little Review. I have heard of it. Ha!
#DONALD WORCESTER.
Their poor musical writer was in your audience this afternoon, Madame.
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
He’s one of those chaps you can meet three or four times and still never recognize on the street.
#MADAME BONJOLINE.
So? At any rate, James Shooneker is going to “write up” my recital. I understand that this number of The Little Review is coming from the press in the morning, and his article will appear in it.
#CARBON HATCHETT.
So, indeed. This Mr. Shooneker, if I remember correctly, has written a book—what is the title of it?
#MADAME BONJOLINE.
Och! He has written so many, many books! I do not know which one you mean. The charms of the woman, her little moues, smiles, and quick gestures, are entangling the five men. Conversation becomes increasingly difficult. The writers leave the green - room and, on the outside with the door closed, they glance nervously at one
#EDWARD MORLESS.
Say: this James Shooneker,—who’s he?
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Who cares who he is? His stuff won’t get far in that sheet.
#EDWARD MORLESS.
Of course not. I just wondered. For my part, I’ve had a terrible afternoon.
#DONALD WORCESTER.
But Ed, think of tonight. You’ve got to listen to Walter Spratt’s piano - playing.
#CARBON HATCHETT.
Do you call that playing? Nothing seems to relieve the collective nervousness of the five judges. At the outer door, they separate. Ben Dullard Krupp makes his way to McChug’s book - store and, after one swift glance up the street and another down the street, he pushes strenuously through the whirling doors. With swinging tread, he marches down the broad center aisle and hails a busy clerk. Yes, the clerk has sometimes heard of James Shooneker and—yes,—they have a book or two of his—just a minute. Then a convulsive terror seizes Ben Dullard Krupp, for on the other side of the same counter stands Donald Worcester. The younger approaches the elder with unaccustomed familiarity, having him, at the moment, on the hip,
#DONALD WORCESTER.
Looking up Shooneker? Here’s one of his things,—Half - tones in Modern Music.
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Oh, yes; that. I remember reading it when I was scarcely more than a boy.
#DONALD WORCESTER.
It was published in 1909, I see.
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Must be a later edition, then. Oh, pshaw! What’s the use of waiting for that clerk? I think I have a complete set of Shooneker packed away at home.
#DONALD WORCESTER.
That so? Well, I’ll tell the clerk you couldn’t wait. Maybe I’d like the book myself, if it’s worth anything at all. The presence in Chicago of one James Shooneker is like some fearfully disturbing shadow behind each of the five writers. Bowowski, within half an hour after the recital, has three helpers in the Public Library searching for every printed word of Shooneker. After a tasteless dinner, Ben Dullard Krupp scares three piano pupils out of their wits by an unusual amount of shouting and stamping; this, also, should be attributed to the visiting author. Worcester seeks his desk in the editorial room and crams on “Pathetic Spaces”—Shooneker’s latest book, according to the clerk. But the young critic’s attention strays from the pages of print to the lady in the green - room ... lovely person, if she can’t play the piano. Worcester has an impulse to use the telephone, and soon it masters him. He calls up Madame Bonjoline’s hotel and, as she is out, leaves a message—he will call in person at eight o’clock. Then a note is written, which he despatches to her by messenger. After that, there is time to think things over. Was there ever anyone as charming as she? And she has expressed her admiration for his frank manner and open criticism. Perhaps——Now the Madame is not willing to admit him at first; but he is insistent, and she permits him to enter. James Shooneker is seated by the window. Worcester, like a guilty boy, shakes hands with him and mumbles acknowledgement. But soon the celebrated critic has him at his ease, and the young journalist is talking with his accustomed candor. Then, continuing in the
#JAMES SHOONEKER.
Mr. Worcester, you might be interested in knowing the reason for my Chicago visit. In fact, it is only fair you should know.
#DONALD WORCESTER.
Sure!
#JAMES SHOONEKER.
Very well then. Your paper, the Worst Glaring Nuisance, as its catch - word has it, has sent for me to fill the vacancy created by your resignation.
#DONALD WORCESTER.
Who’s bluff is this?
#JAMES SHOONEKER.
It is true. I have your place offered me. Now, I don’t want to seem arbitrary, but here’s my proposition: In the first place, cut out your infatuation for Madame Bonjoline. That’s the main condition, if you want me to leave Chicago. The second thing is perhaps more important to yourself, and that is that you promise to take a long course in counterpoint and musical history under some good authority, if you can find one in the United States. Perhaps you would do well to tap the boundless information of your friend, Bowowski. These are my only demands. I don’t want your job. I’ll drop a note to your editor and tell him he doesn’t appreciate you. But you will have to forget your aspirations for the Madame, and behave yourself with a dignity becoming your position. You mustn’t make yourself ridiculous over Frizza, and for her sake—
#DONALD WORCESTER.
Shooneker, you certainly are a brick! You certainly are! I can’t help being a bit dazed with Madame, but I’ll keep it all to myself. You’re a peach!
#MADAME BONJOLINE.
See, James, how perfectly American he is! I told you he would be. Isn’t he a dear boy?
#JAMES SHOONEKER.
You like the conditions, then?
#DONALD WORCESTER.
Bully! I appreciate them. And say, didn’t you write a book once called The Insane Melons?
#JAMES SHOONEKER.
Yes, I have a book with a title something like that. Why do you ask?
#DONALD WORCESTER.
If you’ve got one with you, I’d like a signed copy.
#JAMES SHOONEKER.
I’m very sorry, but I didn’t bring any with me. Perhaps I can send you one later.
#DONALD WORCESTER.
Fine! I wish you would. That’s treating me mighty good.
#MADAME BONJOLINE.
You deserve it, my boy. In a confusion of thanks, apologies, and compliments, Worcester leaves the room and returns to the office, where an article is written which harbors no doubt that Madame Frizza is a great pianist. About the same hour, Mr. Morless is passing in a copy of his own criticism, stating that the Madame is a fairly promising amateur. The menacing cloud of Shooneker seems to hang over him; it has nearly prevented his passing in the article. And Ben Dullard Krupp, without a regular post, mails his lengthy and scathing opinion of the Madame to a weekly paper, in the hope of securing a steady allotment of their space. To him, also, the thought of an “outside” critic in their midst is irritating and, at times, threatening. What was HE going to say about her? His word might have weight. Suppose ... and Krupp wishes now he could reach into the mail - box and pull out his article. But the panic passes; he recalls several of his pet phrases, and this restores Again—the same dining - room in the “Cave Dwellers,” with three of the critics disposing of an early lunch, almost early enough to be
#BOWOWSKI.
They can’t print more than a couple hundred.
#HATCHETT.
Somebody told me they had several thousand paid subscriptions, and then printed a bunch of extras.
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
What difference does that make? The point is: what will they sell for? I’m good for my share, but there’s a limit, you know. Do you suppose that if I offered to do their musical criticism, they would destroy this issue as it stands?
#HATCHETT.
You can’t tell. It isn’t “they” but “she.” You’re dealing with a woman, a young one at that.
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Oh, Hell; I can get around that difficulty. Waiter! Bring me a telephone! Hurry up!
#BOWOWSKI.
Do you realize, gentlemen, that it is more than possible, in fact it is even likely, considerably more than probable, that we are right in the case of Madame Bonjoline, and that one James Shooneker is in error?
#HATCHETT.
By George! That’s so, isn’t it!
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
There’s no question about it. Just wait a minute now, while I call up this “Little Revolt”—ha! ha!—and see how they jump at the mention of my name. Ben Dullard Krupp is informed over the wire that the new issue of in large quantities is already in the mails, etc. In fact, at the same moment, the famous Shooneker is glancing through his own contribution; he swears at a misprint and puts the magazine in his suitcase, to read on the train. Madame Bonjoline does not open her copy, having read the article
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Rank insolence, I call it!
#HATCHETT.
What’s the matter? Won’t they sell?
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
She says the mails are flooded with the impudent sheet.
#BOWOWSKI.
Horrible! Horrible, indeed!
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
It’s a great pity somebody couldn’t loosen up and say something about this Shooneker. How did I know who he was, or that his opinion was worth anything? Fine chance I’ll have now of getting on The Saturday Blade!
#BOWOWSKI.
Perhaps if you had been able to curb your unfounded hatred of Tchaikowsky for a moment, we wouldn’t have been placed in this ridiculous position.
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Blgh - gg - h! It’s bad music, rotten! and I don’t care who knows I said it. This country is simply spineless when it comes to having an opinion about music. Why, I’ve got enough opinion to supply the nation, and they need it. That’s why I put on my American concerts. They’ve got to learn that I’m the only prophet in America’s musical future. I feel that it’s my duty—
#HATCHETT.
Tchaikowsky has written some very good—
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Tchaikowsky! Man! if you mention that mediocrity’s unhallowed name again, I’ll go completely mad!
#BOWOWSKI.
Great Heavens! Tim is coming to put us out, just on account of your infernal shouting. And look! With him! Shooneker! How perfectly horrible!
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
Blgh - gh - h! Abashed and silent, the three judges leave the table and get into their coats with more celerity than is comfortable. They glimpse a faint smile on the face of their jinx as they hasten out. The waiter, Tim, conceals his own mirth. Two critics rush down the
#BEN DULLARD KRUPP.
I don’t care who he is. I know I was right in saying—
