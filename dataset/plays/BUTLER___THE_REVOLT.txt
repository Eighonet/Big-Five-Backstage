"All alone, all alone, nobody here but me. All alone, all alone, nobody here but me, All alone, all - " Here it is now two weeks I've been workin' out my tuition in this Academy of Household Science for Young Ladies, and 'tis nothin' but scrub, scrub, mop, mop, sweep, sweep, from mornin' 'til night! I see plenty of work, but none of that tuition has come my way yet "Wanted," says the advertisement, "a young lady to work out her tuition in an academy." It says that, "Grandma Gregg's Flushing Academy of Household Science," it says, "fits the young ladies for to occupy properly their positions at the heads of their homes," it says, "It will be a fine thing for you, PAULINE," I says, "to be tuitioned in an Academy," so I come, "We'll begin your lessons right away," says Grandma Gregg, "take th' scrub brush an' a pail of water an' some soap an' scrub th' cellar." I've been scrubbin' ever since. I don't care much for the higher education when there is so much scrub in it.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
PAULINE!
#PAULINE.
Yes'm!
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Don't forget your curtsey, PAULINE.
#PAULINE.
Good mornin', Grandma Gregg. I hope I see you well to - day. If it ain't askin' too much, mam, when does my tuitioning begin? I've been scrubbin' for two weeks now, from mornin' 'til night -
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Have you scrubbed the cellar, Pauline?
#PAULINE.
Yes'm.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Don't forget your curtsey, PAULINE.
#PAULINE.
No'm. Yes'm.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
You have scrubbed the cellar?
#PAULINE.
Yes'm.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
And the garret? And the first floor? And the second floor? PAULINE, Yes'm.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Very good, very good, Pauline. Then, when you have finished scrubbing this class room, you may scrub the front porch and the stable. Then it will be time to scrub the cellar again. You are doing very nicely.
#PAULINE.
Yes'm, thank you, mam. But I was thinkin', mam, maybe I could have a little more tuition, and a little less work. "Work and tuition" was what the advertisement said, mam, an' I've seen nothin' but the work yet.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
My dear child! My dear, sweet child! I don't understand you. You have done no work yet.
#PAULINE.
I've done no work? I wonder, now, what I have been doin'!
#GRANDMA GREGG.
You have been receiving your tuition. In this academy the study of Household Science begins with the rudiments. Scrubbing is one of the rudiments. As a new scholar you begin with the rudiments, of course. And I must say you are doing very well. You are making excellent progress. Apply yourself earnestly to your lessons and in a short time you will be promoted to another class. Let me see you scrub, Pauline.
#PAULINE.
Yes'm.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Don't forget your curtsey, Pauline.
#PAULINE.
No'm
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Very good indeed! Very good indeed! You are progressing, Pauline! You are progressing. Apply yourself faithfully to your lessons. You may study awhile on the front porch now. And don't be afraid to use your muscle.
#PAULINE.
Good morning, Grandma Gregg. Rudiment, is it? If I haven't done any work yet, I wonder now what the work will be like.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Pauline.
#PAULINE.
Yes'm.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Did you curtsey, Pauline?
#PAULINE.
No'm. But I will,
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Pauline, have the new Professors come yet? I have hired two new Professors. A Professor of Husbandology, and a Professor of Rudiments. They are very highly recommended.
#PAULINE.
Beg pardon mam, but what's Husbandology?
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Husbandology is the Science of the Proper Treatment of Husbands.
#PAULINE.
And I know what Rudiments is. It's scrubbin'. No, mam, nothin' like them has come yet. "All alone. All alone - " GRANDMA, Dear me! Dear me! I thought when I started this Academy the girls would flock to it most eagerly. When I was a young girl my mother would have been glad to have an academy like this for me to attend. I don't know what the world is coming to. Suffragists and Suffragettes, and Suffrage - this and Suffrage - that! If this academy wasn't sustained by the Anti - suffrage League it would have to close its doors. "Woman and Her Rights." Augh! Who brought that here? I declare, I believe this is the last stronghold of the old - fashioned home - loving woman. I teach the girls to be good wives, PAULINE, If you please, mam, there's a female at the door says she is the new Professor of Husbandology. It's Susan Jane Jones, mam.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Show her in, Pauline.
#PAULINE.
Yes'm.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Don't forget your curtsey, Pauline.
#PAULINE.
No'm.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
I hope Susan Jane Jones will be a real nice lady. There's nothing in the world more necessary than lessons on the Proper Treatment of Husbands. Women don't seem to know how to treat husbands now - a - days. They neglect 'em, the poor things. When I was a girl -
#SUSAN.
Well, here I am -
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Don't forget your curtsey, Miss Jones.
#SUSAN.
Hey? What's that?
#GRANDMA GREGG.
All the faculty and students curtsey when they come into my presence, Miss Jones. It is a sweet old - fashioned custom -
#SUSAN.
Well, I'll soon change that - I mean, Howdy! Howdy! I must not forget I am here as a spy in the enemy's country. If you are going to do the Romans you must do as the Romans do. Swell joint you've got here, old lady. GRANDMA, Swell joints? Yes, my dear, a little rheumatiz makes the joints swell. But I don't complain. I'm an old lady. I have to expect some aches and pains at my time of life. I'm thankful I can do a little good work in the world. Do you understand What your duties will be?
#SUSAN.
Sure Mike! I'm the Husbandology lady. I teach the girls how to treat their husbands when they get 'em.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Just so. You will lecture on How to Coddle and Pet a Husband. Five lectures. Then you will give five lectures on Smoothing the Lines of Care from Hubby's Brow. Then - of course you show by example how all this is done.
#SUSAN.
By example? You don't have a man here, do you?
#GRANDMA GREGG.
We use the practical method in our classes. "Practice makes perfect," you know, Pauline! PAULINE, Yes'm, I'm comin'. GRANDMA, Bring me the Ideal Husband, Pauline.
#PAULINE.
Yes'm. In a minute, mam.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
There! That is our Ideal Husband. He is all a husband should be. He does not drink nor smoke. He does not go to the club at night. He never says an unkind word. And he is happy. Do you know why?
#SUSAN.
Go ahead. I'll be the goat. What's the answer?
#GRANDMA GREGG.
He is happy because we are kind to him. Because we coddle and pet him. I think, before I finally engage you, Miss Jones, I would like to see an example of your method of coddling and petting.
#SUSAN.
Poor hubby, does his poor head ache? Was he out so late last night? Let little wifey rub his poor head, What did hubby say? All right, little wifey will tie a nice cold cloth around poor hubby's head. Now, kiss little wifey. What did hubby say?
#GRANDMA GREGG.
What did he say?
#SUSAN.
He said "For goodness sake get away from here and leave me alone. Can't you see I'm a sick man? Get out of here and stop bothering me." GRANDMA, How like a real man! And what do you do next?
#SUSAN.
I get a pillow. And I wrap up his feet There, poor dear. He's sleeping now.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Very good. You will do very well. Remember to teach that wives should obey their husbands and be kind to them. Husbands are such tender creatures. We should love them and obey them. I will see that your room is in order. No doubt you will wish to practise coddling the Ideal Husband a little longer before your classes begin. SUSAN, Get off that chair, you big brute! Come home intoxicated, will you? Don't talk back to me! You are going out, are you? Well, go out! Out you go! I'll stand no nonsense, I tell you! Go, if you want to! There! Coddle and pet them! That's how I coddle and pet them! This is a nice situation for Susan Jane Jones, Captain of Company A, First Regiment, Militant Suffragettes! But all is fair in Love and Votes for Women! This academy is the last stronghold of the old - fashioned woman, and from in it the tender young girls learn the vicious habits of keeping house, being good housewives and attending to their own affairs as their grandmothers did. From this root anti - suffragism might spread over the whole world, and I have crept in, like a spy, to corrupt and destroy it. Woman must and will rule!
#KATE.
I don't care! I don't care one bit! I'm never, never going to speak to John Mason again as long as I live. I think he is just too horrid for anything, I just hate him. I hate every boy that ever lived, I do! I think they are mean, overbearing, egotistical things.
#SUSAN.
My sentiments exactly! I so consider all men.
#KATE.
Oh! I did not know anyone was here. Good morning! Please, you won't tell Grandma Gregg what I said, will you? She wouldn't like it. She says females should admire and worship all males.
#SUSAN.
Humph! Fiddlesticks! Absolutely exploded theory. Latest theory is, females should abhor and despise all males. What's a man? He's a worm. A poor silly worm. Now, here! We understand each other. You have felt the cruel oppression of a man! just think John Mason treated me real mean, anyway.
#SUSAN.
Woman, how else do men ever treat us? We are slaves. But we must be free. You think I am the new Professor of Husbandology, don't you? You think I am here to teach you how to treat husbands, don't you?
#KATE.
I did think so. SUSAN, Oh, I'll teach you how to treat husbands! I'll teach you how to treat all men. For ages man has crushed us under his cruel heel.
#KATE.
Has he?
#SUSAN.
But we will trample him under foot.
#KATE.
Will we?
#SUSAN.
We must throttle him. We must crush him.
#KATE.
Must we?
#SUSAN.
Pooh! He's a worm. We will do without him. We will drive him from the land. Absolutely. Man is a by - gone institution. I class him with the stage coach and the dodo bird. Woman can do his work better than he can. He must be driven from the land.
#PAULINE.
But, now, mam, if he's driven from the land, he'll be taking a death of cold in the water.
#SUSAN.
So much the better. The object that should burn in every true woman's heart is the utter extermination of man. You have felt a man's cruelty.
#KATE.
I don't see why boys have to be so mean.
#SUSAN.
And you, too, you poor creature. Have you not felt the heel of the oppressor?
#PAULINE.
Heel of the oppressor? Mercy sakes! That reminds me. Grandma Gregg sent me for to get the Ideal Husband and take him down cellar and black his shoes for him. SUSAN, You see! Man makes slaves of us all!
#PAULINE.
Has any of you seen the Ideal Husband? Grandma Gregg said he was in the Classroom conversin' with the new Professor.
#SUSAN.
Oh, he's gone to his club. I mean, look behind the screen.
#SUSAN.
My child, the time for the great revolution is at hand. Woman is about to take her rightfully supreme place in the world. In me you see one of the leaders of the Militant Suffragettes. Can I count on you?
#KATE.
I don't know. I think John Mason treated me just too mean - Oh! here Comes Grandma Gregg.
#SUSAN.
Hush. Not a word of this! Yes, my dear, when his head aches take a handful of chopped ice, and fold it in a bandage - KATE, Good morning, Grandma Gregg.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Good morning, my dear.
#GRACE.
Good morning, GRANDMA GREGG.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Good morning, my dear. and IDA. Good morning, Grandma Gregg.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Good morning, my dears. and Other Girls, Good morning, Grandma Gregg.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Good morning, my dears. And now we are all here, have you all done your home work? Let me see it.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Very good - The stitches are a little too large, sweetheart - This buttonhole might be a little neater, precious, etc.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Grace, will you act as monitor of the teapot?
#GRACE.
Yes, Grandma Gregg.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Now, young ladies, will you repeat the Golden Text for the day?
#ALL.
"The way to a man's heart is through his stomach."
#SUSAN.
Yes, feed the beast and he'll grin.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Kate, do you know your precept?
#SUSAN.
He was, but now he's no such thing.
#GRACE.
wife should never hem and haw, Her husband's word should be her law.
#SUSAN.
Does any woman think that? Pshaw!
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Next.
#EDITH.
SUSAN, That sentiment don't go to - day.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Next.
#SUSAN.
That notion's in its little grave!
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Very good, my darlings, Edith, yesterday you could not tell me all the ingredients of bread. Do you know now what you omitted?
#EDITH.
Yes, Grandma Gregg. Add a cup of butter.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Correct. IDA, if you had a husband and he came home very late, what would you do?
#IDA.
I would pretend to be fast, fast asleep.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Yes. And what would you say the next morning?
#IDA.
"Good morning, dear. I was asleep when you came in. I hope you had a pleasant evening."
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Now, Miss -
#SUSAN.
Susan Jane Jones.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Don't forget your curtsey, Miss Jones. You may take the class now, Miss Jones, and give it instruction in the proper treatment of husbands. Inculcate ideas of meekness and gentleness.
#SUSAN.
Oh, I'll inculcate. Have no fear of that.
#PAULINE.
Here's your husband.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
My dear child, you should not handle a husband in that manner.
#PAULINE.
I'll not be handling that husband in any manner very long, mam. I'm going to quit my job. Nothing but scrub, scrub, mop, mop, from morning to night. Look at them young ladies, a drinkin' tea and me doin' the scrub work. I'm tired of being scholar, I am.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
You are tired of being a scholar, are you, PAULINE?
#PAULINE.
Yes'm. I'm sick of it. I've learned this scrubbin' lesson from the cellar up.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
So you have, dear, so you have! You do it very well. And I am going to reward you.
#PAULINE.
Reward me, mam?
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Yes. I have just received word my newly engaged Professor of Rudimentary Household Science cannot come. How would you like to be a professor, Pauline?
#PAULINE.
Oh, me a professor, mam! Me, who has nothing but rags to my name, a professor?
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Yes, Pauline. I have made up my mind. I am going to make you my Professor of Rudiments. Young ladies, this is our new Professor of Rudiments, PAULINE, I feel like I ought to make a speech, mam, but I can't, I'm that overcome. I don't feel like I could do justice to the job, mam.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Oh, yes you can, my dear. Now, your duties as Professor of Rudiments will consist in teaching the young ladies scrubbing -
#PAULINE.
Scrubbin'?
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Yes, scrubbing, and mopping, and blacking stoves.
#PAULINE.
Scrubbin' an' moppin' an' blackin' stoves?
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Just so. And you will teach by example. The young ladies will study your methods. You will scrub and mop and black stoves, and they will watch you.
#PAULINE.
I'll scrub and mop and - It's mighty like the job of bein' scholar, ain't it, mam? What pay do I get, mam, for all this scrub and mop?
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Pay? I am surprised you should ask for pay when I have given you such a position of trust and honor. But there. If you must have pay, you shall have it. I will give you the work you owe me for the tuition you have received. PAULINE, Yes'm. Thank you, mam. Now, now, do you do that work I owe you, or do I do it?
#GRANDMA GREGG.
What a question! You do it, of course. You owe it to me, child, don't you? Now, young ladies, I will leave you to your two new Professors,
#PAULINE.
Get to work, you husband, get to work!
#SUSAN.
Fellow females!
#KATE.
Well, I'll never speak to John again as long as I live.
#GRACE.
Well, he can't be a bit worse than Arthur. Oh, I'm so mad at Arthur. I was so mad I could have slapped him.
#EDITH.
What did he do, Grace?
#GRACE.
I met him on Main Street, quite by chance, you know, and he said, "Hello, GRACE, you don't want an ice cream soda, do you?" And I said, "Oh, I don't care." And he said, "Oh, well, if you don't care!"
#IDA.
The horrid thing. I think boys are just too horrid for anything. I oo - ooed at George to - day, and he didn't OO - OO back at me at all. I'm through with George!
#EDITH.
Imagine! When I Oo - oo at a boy and he doesn't OO - OO back I consider it a deadly insult. I suppose he was talking to some other girl.
#IDA.
No, he wasn't! He was riding his motor cycle, and he was only two blocks away -
#EDITH.
Perhaps he didn't hear you.
#IDA.
That's no excuse at all. When a girl oo - oos it is a boy's duty to hear. I always hear when George oo - oos.
#MAY.
Certainly! Any gentleman would OO - OO back at a girl if she oo - ooed at him.
#KATE.
I suppose you mean Henry would OO - OO back at you. You and Henry!
#MAY.
Thank you, but I don't speak to Henry any more. I've sent him about his business! I was going over to the tennis court yesterday, and I oo - ooed at him, and he said, "Where are you going, MAY?" and I said, "I'm going to play tennis, if I can find a partner." And what do you think he said?
#GRACE.
What did he say?
#MAY.
He said, "Well, I'm sorry I can't go with, you!" All. Oh, how horrid!
#EDITH.
Well, I've had all of Sam I want! When I got home from school yesterday I sat on the front porch all afternoon. Of course I expected Sam would happen to pass by.
#KATE.
Of course. Any gentleman would happen, to pass by.
#EDITH.
Certainly. And there I sat. And sat. And sat. And no Sam came by. Oh, I was mad. And what do you think his excuse was? His mother had fallen down the cellar stairs and broken her arm.
#KATE.
And he let that keep him home! Girls, I think the way the boys treat us is perfectly outrageous! There are whole minutes in every day when they don't think of us at all.
#GRACE.
Oh, not whole minutes.
#KATE.
Well, parts of minutes, anyway. I understand that several times this term several of the boys almost knew their lessons. That couldn't happen if they thought of us all the time. All. The horrid things!
#KATE.
Well, for my part, I'm through with boys! I wish they were all - all extinct. SUSAN, Ladies! Fellow females! I have heard what you said. Your wrongs are enormous, but what does man live for but to oppress us? We are down - trod, down - trod by man, that worm that like a roaring lion seeks to cast dust in our eyes with his soaring wings while he rends our heart with his cruel beak! Shall we, ladies, be slaves to a worm?
#PAULINE.
No, mam.
#SUSAN.
No! You wish the men were extinct. We will extinguish them. Why waste your lives here doing plain and fancy sewing -
#PAULINE.
And scrubbin' -
#SUSAN.
When woman was meant to occupy the noblest spheres? Wives? Faugh! Housewives? Faugh! Let us take the work of the men, and do it! Follow the bright banner of Susan Jane Jones, the Militant Suffragette, and drive the men into the sea! I have heard the story of your wrongs -
#KATE.
Well, I do think Henry was just too mean for anything.
#SUSAN.
Sewing! Scrubbing! Have you women never wished to do the work of men?
#KATE.
Yes, I have. I always wanted to be a doctor, but my father wouldn't hear of it.
#GRACE.
What kind of a doctor, Kate?
#KATE.
Oh, a handsome doctor with curly gray hair. And you, Grace?
#GRACE.
Oh, I want to be a lawyer, a plump, jolly lawyer. And you, Edith?
#EDITH.
I want to be an editor.
#GRACE.
Republican or Democrat?
#EDITH.
I don't know. The kind with a big automobile. And you, Ida?
#IDA.
I want to be a politician. Mat. An honest one, of course.
#IDA.
Well, no. A successful politician. And you, May? Mat. I want to run a vegetable market, where the women can come with their market baskets.
#SUSAN.
Where the men can come with their market baskets, And you, you poor creature, have you never felt the longing to usurp man's sphere? Have you never longed to do a man's work?
#PAULINE.
Oh, yes, mam. This humble heart has felt the what - you - call it many a time. I have always wished, mam, to be a pirate. All. A pirate! pirate. And why not? That's men's work. Listen: -
#SUSAN.
Just so high! All. Just so high!
#SUSAN.
So have I. All. So have I.
#SUSAN.
I call that a very noble and uplifting ambition for a modern young lady.
#PAULINE.
Listen: -
#SUSAN.
Oh, how dear!
#ALL.
Oh, how dear!
#PAULINE.
SUSAN, Hear! Hear! All. Hear! Hear!
#SUSAN.
I consider Bloody - bones a very sweet name for a young lady pirate. Very!
#PAULINE.
Yes, mam. So, if it's all the same to you, I'd like to be a pirate, mam, SUSAN. Certainly. A pirate's life is a very mannish occupation.
#KATE.
Wouldn't it be lovely to be a pirate! It is much more interesting than being a doctor.
#PAULINE.
Yes, Miss Kate. And there's no scrubbin' on a pirate craft. The wash of the sea is merely a poetical term. And if the men is drove off the land, they'll take to ships, do you see, and there'll be plenty of work for a respectable, blood - thirsty lady pirate to do, catchin' 'em and extinguishing 'em.
#GRACE.
Oh, girls, wouldn't it be lovely to be pirates?
#SUSAN.
Then be pirates! The Militant Suffragettes need a navy as well as an army. Every revolution needs its privateers.
#KATE.
No more sewing!
#PAULINE.
No more scrubbin'.
#GRACE.
No more rag bags!
#PAULINE.
Hold on, Miss GRACE! Pirates is mostly dressed out of rag bags, Wait till I get the swords, KATE, OO - I feel blood - thirsty!
#SUSAN.
And you look extremely blood - thirsty. GRACE, OO - I feel ferocious!
#SUSAN.
And you look too ferocious for anything. feel wicked!
#SUSAN.
You are certainly a fear - compelling sight. feel murderous!
#SUSAN.
You look like a most criminal character. Mat. OO - I feel dangerous!
#SUSAN.
You look extremely dangerous.
#PAULINE.
OO - I feel like if I seen a cake of soap I could kick it!
#SUSAN.
Reserve your wrath for the men. Hist! To - night - at dead of night - we will capture - a lumber schooner - at Copp's lumber yard - All. Aye! Aye! Mam!
#SUSAN.
To - night - at dead of night - meet me - at the corner of - Main and Broadway! All. Aye! Aye! Mam!
#SUSAN.
To - night - at dead of night - we will strangle the watchmen -
#KATE.
At dead of night? I don't think we ought to strangle watchmen at dead of night unless we have a chaperone, do you girls?
#SUSAN.
Nonsense! What kind of Suffragettes are you to need a chaperone? I don't have a chaperone.
#GRACE.
Well, I don't care! I'm not going out strangling at night without a chaperone! It isn't proper.
#SUSAN.
But you are a pirate.
#EDITH.
I don't care if we are pirates. We don't have to be improper pirates. I want to strangle and murder in a perfectly proper manner.
#PAULINE.
How about takin' the old lady with you?
#KATE.
Grandma Gregg? Why, she's no Suffragette. Oh, girls! The very thing! We will take Grandma Gregg! We'll capture her! We'll take her, in chains!
#SUSAN.
Excellent! You will have your chaperone, and I will be rid of the most dangerous Anti - suffra - gette! Seek her and seize her! All. We go! We go!
#GRANDMA GREGG.
I thought I heard a noise, Pauline. How are the dear girls getting on with their lessons? PAULINE, Fine, mam. They're learning new tricks every day.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Very good. But I wouldn't wear a bandeau on my hair if I were you, Pauline. I don't like these ribbons bound around the head of young girls. They make them look like pirates.
#PAULINE.
Pirates, mam? What a notion!
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Pirates, or Italian ditch diggers. PAULINE, Well, mam, let it be pirates, then. Pirate is what I am. Grandma Gregg, you've always been good to me, barring the scrubbing and mopping and blacking shoes and stoves. If I was you, mam, I'd pack some clothes, so as to be ready for the sea voyage.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Me? A sea voyage?
#PAULINE.
Yes'm. This Susan Jane Jones is not what she seems, mam. I let on, mam, I was of her way of thinking, mam, but I ain't. A husband is good enough woman's rights for me, mam. A nice, quiet, well - behaved husband like that one there is all I want.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
I don't understand you.
#PAULINE.
Susan Jane Jones is a Militant Suffragette, mam. Militant Suffragette? In this academy?
#PAULINE.
Yes, mam. She's here like a snake in the grass, mam, and her and the young ladies is goin' to extinguish all the men. They're all goin' to be pirates, mam, and most bloody minded pirates they be, too. And you, mam, that never did them any harm, they are going to capture and take along with them in chains. For a chaperone, mam. GRANDMA, And is this the reward for my efforts to make good wives of them!
#SUSAN.
This way! She's here!
#SUSAN.
Woman! Your hour has come!
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Well, I do declare!
#SUSAN.
These poor maidens you thought to corrupt into housework ways, I have won from you. Here, to - day, the revolution that will sweep the men from the land and sea, begins! We are resolved! ALL. We are resolved!
#SUSAN.
In these hearts burns nothing but hatred and detestation of man.
#ALL.
Hatred and detestation.
#KATE.
We don't want to have anything more to do with men.
#GRACE.
We are absolutely through with them. And with boys, too.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Now, my dears -
#SUSAN.
Enough! Pirates, do your duty! Seize that man!
#SUSAN.
Ha! Ha! Now seize and bind and gag that woman,
#GRANDMA GREGG.
The girls rush at GRANDMA, who skips backward) SUSAN, pirates! My faithful band of man - haters, You men, your turn is next!
#A BOY'S VOICE.
OO - oo! That's John!
#SECOND BOY'S VOICE.
Oo - oo! Oo - oo!)
#GRACE.
That's - that's Arthur!
#SEVERAL BOY'S VOICES.
Oo - oo! Oo - Oo! Oo - oo! EDITH, IDA and Mat. That's Sam! That's George! That's Henry!
#KATE.
Oh, girls! It's the boys, they want us to come out! Where's my hat?
#SUSAN.
Girls! Pirates! Stop! The revolution! Remember your cause!
#KATE.
Revolution! I haven't time for revolutions, don't you hear the boys calling us?
#SUSAN.
Stop! Are you not women?
#GRACE.
Women? Pirates? Why no, we are just the I. I. Club. Just girls. Just sweet girls! VOICES, Oo - oo!
#GIRLS.
Oo - oo! Oo - oo! Oo - oo!
#PAULINE.
I'm ashamed of you, sir. Why didn't you - oo at me when all them boys was oo - ooing? you had oo - ooed at me I would have oo - ooed back.
#GRANDMA GREGG.
Did he speak to you, Pauline?
#PAULINE.
No, mam. He's an Ideal Husband, and Ideal Husbands don't talk back, mam.
