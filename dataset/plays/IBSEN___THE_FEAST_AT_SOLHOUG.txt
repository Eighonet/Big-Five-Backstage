#ERIK.
In one word, now, what answer have you to make to my wooing on Knut Gesling's behalf?
#BENGT.
Well, I - to me it seems - H'm, Margit, let us first hear your thought in the matter.
#MARGIT.
Sir Knut Gesling, I have long known all that Erik of Hegge has told of you. I know full well that you come of a lordly house; you are rich in gold and gear, and you stand in high favour with our royal master.
#BENGT.
In high favour - so say I too.
#MARGIT.
And doubtless my sister could choose her no doughtier mate -
#BENGT.
None doughtier; that is what I say too.
#MARGIT.
- If so be that you can win her to think kindly of you.
#BENGT.
Nay - nay, my dear wife -
#KNUT.
Stands it so, Dame Margit! You think that your sister -
#BENGT.
Nay, nay, Knut Gesling! Have patience, now. You must understand us aright.
#MARGIT.
There is naught in my words to wound you. My sister knows you only by the songs that are made about you - and these songs sound but ill in gentle ears. No peaceful home is your father's house. Day out, day in, must you hold carouse - God help the maiden you lure or buy Soon will her sore heart long to lie
#ERIK.
Aye, aye - true enough - Knut Gesling lives not overpeaceably. But there will soon come a change in that, when he gets him a wife in his hall.
#KNUT.
And this I would have you mark, Dame Margit: it may be a week since, I was at a feast at Hegge, at Erik's bidding, whom here you see. I vowed a vow that Signe, your fair sister, should be my wife, and that before the year was out. Never shall it be said of Knut Gesling that he brake any vow. You can see, then, that you must e'en choose me for your sister's husband - be it with your will or against it.
#MARGIT.
Ere that may be, I must tell you plain, You must rid yourself of your ravening train. You must scour no longer with yell and shout O'er the country - side in a galloping rout; You must still the shudder that spreads around When Knut Gesling is to a bride - ale bound. Courteous must your mien be when a - feasting you ride; Let your battle - axe hang at home at the chimney - side - It ever sits loose in your hand, well you know, When the mead has gone round and your brain is aglow. From no man his rightful gear shall you wrest, You shall harm no harmless maiden; You shall send no man the shameless hest That when his path crosses yours, he were best Come with his grave - clothes laden. And if you will so bear you till the year be past, You may win my sister for your bride at last.
#KNUT.
You know how to order your words cunningly, Dame Margit. Truly, you should have been a priest, and not your husbands wife.
#BENGT.
Oh, for that matter, I too could -
#KNUT.
But I would have you take note that had a sword - bearing man spoken to me in such wise -
#BENGT.
Nay, but listen, Knut Gesling - you must understand us!
#KNUT.
Well, briefly, he should have learnt that the axe sits loose in my hand, as you said but now.
#BENGT.
There we have it! Margit, Margit, this will never end well.
#MARGIT.
You asked for a forthright answer, and that I have given you.
#KNUT.
Well, well; I will not reckon too closely with you, Dame Margit. You have more wit than all the rest of us together. Here is my hand; - it may be there was somewhat of reason in the keen - edged words you spoke to me.
#MARGIT.
This I like well; now are you already on the right way to amendment. Yet one word more - to - day we hold a feast at Solhoug. feast?
#BENGT.
Yes, Knut Gesling: you must know that it is our wedding day; this day three years ago made me Dame Margit's husband.
#MARGIT.
As I said, we hold a feast to - day. When Mass is over, and your other business done, I would have you ride hither again, and join in the banquet. Then you can learn to know my sister.
#KNUT.
So be it, Dame Margit; I thank you. Yet 'twas not to go to Mass that I rode hither this morning. Your kinsman, Gudmund Alfson, was the cause of my coming.
#MARGIT.
He! My kinsman? Where would you seek him?
#KNUT.
His homestead lies behind the headland, on the other side of the fiord.
#MARGIT.
But he himself is far away.
#ERIK.
Be not so sure; he may be nearer than you think.
#KNUT.
Hold your peace!
#MARGIT.
Nearer? What mean you?
#KNUT.
Have you not heard, then, that Gudmund Alfson has come back to Norway? He came with the Chancellor Audun of Hegranes, who was sent to France to bring home our new Queen.
#MARGIT.
True enough, but in these very days the King holds his wedding - feast in full state at Bergen, and there is Gudmund Alfson a guest.
#BENGT.
And there could we too have been guests had my wife so willed it.
#ERIK.
Then Dame Margit knows not that - ?
#KNUT.
So it would seem; but keep your counsel. Well, well, Dame Margit, I must go my way none the less, and see what may betide. At nightfall I will be here again.
#MARGIT.
And then you must show whether you have power to bridle your unruly spirit.
#BENGT.
Aye, mark you that.
#MARGIT.
You must lay no hand on your axe - hear you, Knut Gesling?
#BENGT.
Neither on your axe, nor on your knife, nor on any other weapon whatsoever.
#MARGIT.
For then can you never hope to be one of our kindred.
#BENGT.
Nay, that is our firm resolve.
#KNUT.
Have no fear.
#BENGT.
And what we have firmly resolved stands fast.
#KNUT.
That I like well, Sir Bengt Gauteson. I, too, say the same; and I have pledged myself at the feast - board to wed your kinswoman. You may be sure that my pledge, too, will stand fast. - God's peace till to - night!
#BENGT.
Methought he seemed to threaten us as he departed.
#MARGIT.
Aye, so it seemed.
#BENGT.
Knut Gesling is an ill man to fall out with. And when I bethink me, we gave him over many hard words. But come, let us not brood over that. To - day we must be merry, Margit! - as I trow we have both good reason to be.
#MARGIT.
Aye, surely, surely.
#BENGT.
Tis true I was no mere stripling when I courted you. But well I wot I was the richest man for many and many a mile. You were a fair maiden, and nobly born; but your dowry would have tempted no wooer.
#MARGIT.
Yet was I then so rich.
#BENGT.
What said you, my wife?
#MARGIT.
Oh, nothing, nothing. I will deck me with pearls and rings. Is not to - night a time of rejoicing for me?
#BENGT.
I am fain to hear you say it. Let me see that you deck you in your best attire, that our guests may say: Happy she who mated with Bengt Gauteson. - But now must I to the larder; there are many things to - day that must not be over - looked.
#MARGIT.
'Twas well he departed. While here he remains Meseems the blood freezes within my veins; Meseems that a crushing mighty and cold My heart in its clutches doth still enfold. He is my husband! I am his wife! How long, how long lasts a woman's life? Sixty years, mayhap - God pity me Who am not yet full twenty - three! Hard, so long in a gilded cage to pine; Hard a hopeless prisoner's lot - and mine. With rings, and with jewels, and all of my best By his order myself I am decking - But oh, if to - day were my burial - feast, 'Twere little that I'd be recking. But if thus I brood I must needs despair; I know a song that can lighten care. The Hill - King to the sea did ride; - Oh, sad are my days and dreary - To woo a maiden to be his bride. - I am waiting for thee, I am weary. - The Hill - King rode to Sir Hakon's hold; - Oh, sad are my days and dreary - Little Kirsten sat combing her locks of gold. - I am waiting for thee, I am weary. - The Hill - King wedded the maiden fair; - Oh, sad are my days and dreary - silvern girdle she ever must wear. - I am waiting for thee, I am weary. - The Hill - King wedded the lily - wand, - Oh, sad are my days and dreary - With fifteen gold rings on either hand. - I am waiting for thee, I am weary. - Three summers passed, and there passed full five; - Oh, sad are my days and dreary - In the hill little Kirsten was buried alive. - I am waiting for thee, I am weary. - Five summers passed, and there passed full nine; - Oh, sad are my days and dreary - Little Kirsten ne'er saw the glad sunshine. - I am waiting for thee, I am weary. - In the dale there are flowers and the birds' blithe song; - Oh, sad are my days and dreary - In the hill there is gold and the night is long. - I am waiting for thee, I am weary. - How oft in the gloaming would Gudmund sing This song in may father's hall. There was somewhat in it - some strange, sad thing That took my heart in thrall; Though I scarce understood, I could ne'er forget - And the words and the thoughts they haunt me yet. Rings of red gold! And a belt beside - ! 'Twas with gold the Hill - King wedded his bride! Woe! Woe! I myself am the Hill - King's wife! And there cometh none to free me from the prison of my life.
#SIGNE.
Margit, Margit, - he is coming!
#MARGIT.
Coming? Who is coming?
#SIGNE.
Gudmund, our kinsman!
#MARGIT.
Gudmund Alfson! Here! How can you think - ?
#SIGNE.
Oh, I am sure of it.
#MARGIT.
Gudmund Alfson is at the wedding - feast in the King's hall; you know that as well as I.
#SIGNE.
Maybe; but none the less I am sure it was he.
#MARGIT.
Have you seen him?
#SIGNE.
Oh, no, no; but I must tell you -
#MARGIT.
Yes, haste you - tell on!
#SIGNE.
'Twas early morn, and the church bells rang, To Mass I was fain to ride; The birds in the willows twittered and sang, In the birch - groves far and wide. All earth was glad in the clear, sweet day; And from church it had well - nigh stayed me; For still, as I rode down the shady way, Each rosebud beguiled and delayed me. Silently into the church I stole; The priest at the altar was bending; He chanted and read, and with awe in their soul, The folk to God's word were attending. Then a voice rang out o'er the fiord so blue; And the carven angels, the whole church through, Turned round, methought, to listen thereto.
#MARGIT.
O Signe, say on! Tell me all, tell me all!
#SIGNE.
'Twas as though a strange, irresistible call Summoned me forth from the worshipping flock, Over hill and dale, over mead and rock. 'Mid the silver birches I listening trod, Moving as though in a dream; Behind me stood empty the house of God; Priest and people were lured by the magic 'twould seem, Of the tones that still through the air did stream. No sound they made; they were quiet as death; To hearken the song - birds held their breath, The lark dropped earthward, the cuckoo was still, As the voice re - echoed from hill to hill.
#MARGIT.
Go on.
#SIGNE.
They crossed themselves, women and men; But strange thoughts arose within me then; For the heavenly song familiar grew: Gudmund oft sang it to me and you - Ofttimes has Gudmund carolled it, And all he e'er sang in my heart is writ.
#MARGIT.
And you think that it may be - ?
#SIGNE.
I know it is he! I know it? I know it! You soon shall see! From far - off lands, at the last, in the end, Each song - bird homeward his flight doth bend! I am so happy - though why I scarce know - ! Margit, what say you? I'll quickly go And take down his harp, that has hung so long In there on the wall that 'tis rusted quite; Its golden strings I will polish bright, And tune them to ring and to sing with his song.
#MARGIT.
Do as you will -
#SIGNE.
But when Gudmund comes will your heart grow light - Light, as when I was a child, again.
#MARGIT.
So much has changed - ah, so much! - since then -
#SIGNE.
Margit, you shall be happy and gay! Have you not serving - maids many, and thralls? Costly robes hang in rows on your chamber walls; How rich you are, none can say. By day you can ride in the forest deep, Chasing the hart and the hind; By night in a lordly bower you can sleep, On pillows of silk reclined.
#MARGIT.
And he comes to Solhoug! He, as a guest!
#SIGNE.
What say you?
#MARGIT.
That fortune which seemeth to you so bright May await yourself.
#SIGNE.
Margit, say what you mean!
#MARGIT.
I mean - nay, no more! 'Twill shortly be seen - ; I mean - should a wooer ride hither to - night - ? wooer? For whom?
#MARGIT.
For you.
#SIGNE.
That he'd ta'en the wrong road full soon he would see.
#MARGIT.
What would you say if a valiant knight Begged for your hand?
#SIGNE.
That my heart was too light To think upon suitors or choose a mate.
#MARGIT.
But if he were mighty, and rich, and great?
#SIGNE.
O, were he a king, did his palace hold Stores of rich garments and ruddy gold, 'Twould ne'er set my heart desiring. With you I am rich enough here, meseeems, With summer and sun and the murmuring streams, And the birds in the branches quiring. Dear sister mine - here shall my dwelling be; And to give any wooer my hand in fee, For that I am too busy, and my heart too full of glee!
#MARGIT.
Gudmund Alfson coming hither! Hither - to Solhoug? No, no, it cannot be. - Signe heard him singing, she said! When I have heard the pine - trees moaning in the forest afar, when I have heard the waterfall thunder and the birds pipe their lure in the tree - tops, it has many a time seemed to me as though, through it all, the sound of Gudmund's songs came blended. And yet he was far from here. - Signe has deceived herself. Gudmund cannot be coming.
#BENGT.
An unlooked - for guest my wife!
#MARGIT.
What guest?
#BENGT.
Your kinsman, Gudmund Alfson! Let the best guest - room be prepared - and that forthwith!
#MARGIT.
Is he, then, already here?
#BENGT.
Nay, not yet; but he cannot be far off. The carved oak bed, with the dragon - heads! His shield - bearer brings a message of greeting from him; and he himself is close behind.
#MARGIT.
His shield - bearer! Comes he hither with a shield - bearer!
#BENGT.
Aye, by my faith he does. He has a shield - bearer and six armed men in his train. What would you? Gudmund Alfson is a far other man than he was when he set forth to seek his fortune. But I must ride forth to seek him. The gilded saddle on my horse! And forget not the bridle with the serpents' heads! Ha, there he is already at the gate! Well, then, my staff - my silver - headed staff! Such a lordly knight - Heaven save us! - we must receive him with honour, with all seemly honour!
#MARGIT.
Alone he departed, a penniless swain; With esquires and henchmen now comes he again. What would he? Comes he, forsooth, to see My bitter and gnawing misery? Would he try how long, in my lot accurst, I can writhe and moan, ere my heart - strings burst - Thinks he that - ? Ah, let him only try! Full little joy shall he reap thereby. List, little maids, what I say to you: Find me my silken mantle blue. Go with me into my bower anon: My richest of velvets and furs do on. Two of you shall deck me in scarlet and vair, The third shall wind pearl - strings into my hair. All my jewels and gauds bear away with ye! Since Margit the Hill - King's bride must be, Well! don we the queenly livery!
#BENGT.
And now once more - welcome under Solhoug's roof, my wife's kinsman.
#GUDMUND.
I thank you. And how goes it with her? She thrives well in every way, I make no doubt?
#BENGT.
Aye, you may be sure she does. There is nothing she lacks. She has five handmaidens, no less, at her beck and call; a courser stands ready saddled in the stall when she lists to ride abroad. In one word, she has all that a noble lady can desire to make her happy in her lot.
#GUDMUND.
And Margit - is she then happy?
#BENGT.
God and all men would think that she must be; but, strange to say -
#GUDMUND.
What mean you?
#BENGT.
Well, believe it or not as you list, but it seems to me that Margit was merrier of heart in the days of her poverty, than since she became the lady of Solhoug.
#GUDMUND.
I knew it; so it must be.
#BENGT.
What say you, kinsman?
#GUDMUND.
I say that I wonder greatly at what you tell me of your wife.
#BENGT.
Aye, you may be sure I wonder at it too. On the faith and troth of an honest gentleman, 'tis beyond me to guess what more she can desire. I am about her all day long; and no one can say of me that I rule her harshly. All the cares of household and husbandry I have taken on myself; yet notwithstanding - Well, well, you were ever a merry heart; I doubt not you will bring sunshine with you. Hush! here comes Dame Margit! Let her not see that I -
#GUDMUND.
Margit - my dear Margit!
#MARGIT.
Your pardon, Sir Knight; but - ? Surely, if I mistake not, 'tis Gudmund Alfson.
#GUDMUND.
And you did not at once know me again?
#BENGT.
Why, Margit, of what are you thinking? I told you but a moment agone that your kinsman -
#MARGIT.
Twelve years is a long time, Gudmund. The freshest plant may wither ten times over in that space.
#GUDMUND.
'Tis seven years since last we met.
#MARGIT.
Surely it must be more than that.
#GUDMUND.
I could almost think so. But 'tis as I say.
#MARGIT.
How strange! I must have been but a child then; and it seems to me a whole eternity since I was a child. Well, sit you down, my kinsman! Rest you, for to - night you shall dance, and rejoice us with your singing. Doubtless you know we are merry here to - day - we are holding a feast.
#GUDMUND.
'Twas told me as I entered your homestead.
#BENGT.
Aye, 'tis three years to - day since I became -
#MARGIT.
My kinsman has already heard it. Will you not lay aside your cloak?
#GUDMUND.
I thank you, Dame Margit; but it seems to me cold here - colder than I had foreseen.
#BENGT.
For my part, I am warm enough; but then I have a hundred things to do and to take order for. Let not the time seem long to our guest while I am absent. You can talk together of the old days.
#MARGIT.
Are you going? Will you not rather - ?
#BENGT.
See you well - Sir Bengt of Solhoug is the man to make the women fain of him. How short so e'er the space, my wife cannot abide to be without me. Content you; I shall soon be with you again.
#MARGIT.
Oh, torture, to have to endure it all.
#GUDMUND.
How goes it, I pray, with your sister dear?
#MARGIT.
Right well, I thank you.
#GUDMUND.
They said she was here With you.
#MARGIT.
She has been here ever since we - She came, now three years since, to Solhoug with me. Ere long she'll be here, her friend to greet.
#GUDMUND.
Well I mind me of Signe's nature sweet. No guile she dreamed of, no evil knew. When I call to remembrance her eyes so blue I must think of the angels in heaven. But of years there have passed no fewer than seven; In that time much may have altered. Oh, say If she, too, has changed so while I've been away?
#MARGIT.
She too? Is it, pray, in the halls of kings That you learn such courtly ways, Sir Knight? To remind me thus of the change time brings -
#GUDMUND.
Nay, Margit, my meaning you read aright! You were kind to me, both, in those far - away years - Your eyes, when we parted were wet with tears. We swore like brother and sister still To hold together in good hap or ill. 'Mid the other maids like a sun you shone, Far, far and wide was your beauty known. You are no less fair than you were, I wot; But Solhoug's mistress, I see, has forgot The penniless kinsman. So hard is your mind That ever of old was gentle and kind.
#MARGIT.
Aye, of old - !
#MARGIT.
No, no, not of them! My mind unwillingly backward strays. Tell rather of what your life has been, Of what in the wide world you've done and seen. Adventures you've lacked not, well I ween - In all the warmth and the space out yonder, That heart and mind should be light, what wonder?
#GUDMUND.
In the King's high hall I found not the joy That I knew by my own poor hearth as a boy.
#MARGIT.
While I, as at Solhoug each day flits past, Thank Heaven that here has my lot been cast.
#GUDMUND.
'Tis well if for this you can thankful be -
#MARGIT.
Why not? For am I not honoured and free? Must not all folk here obey my hest? Rule I not all things as seemeth me best? Here I am first, with no second beside me; And that, as you know, from of old satisfied me. Did you think you would find me weary and sad? Nay, my mind is at peace and my heart is glad. You might, then, have spared your journey here To Solhoug; 'twill profit you little, I fear.
#GUDMUND.
What, mean you, Dame Margit?
#MARGIT.
I know why you come to my lonely hall.
#GUDMUND.
And you welcome me not, though you know why I came? God's peace and farewell, then, my noble dame!
#MARGIT.
To have stayed in the royal hall, indeed, Sir Knight, had better become your fame.
#GUDMUND.
In the royal hall? Do you scoff at my need?
#MARGIT.
Your need? You are ill to content, my friend; Where, I would know, do you think to end? You can dress you in velvet and cramoisie, You stand by the throne, and have lands in fee -
#GUDMUND.
Do you deem, then, that fortune is kind to me? You said but now that full well you knew What brought me to Solhoug -
#MARGIT.
I told you true!
#GUDMUND.
Then you know what of late has befallen me; - You have heard the tale of my outlawry?
#MARGIT.
An outlaw! You, Gudmund!
#GUDMUND.
I am indeed. But I swear, by the Holy Christ I swear, Had I known the thoughts of your heart, I ne'er Had bent me to Solhoug in my need. I thought that you still were gentle - hearted, As you ever were wont to be ere we parted: But I truckle not to you; the wood is wide, My hand and my bow shall fend for me there; I will drink of the mountain brook, and hide My head in the beast's lair.
#MARGIT.
Outlawed! Nay, stay! I swear to you That naught of your outlawry I knew.
#GUDMUND.
It is as I tell you. My life's at stake; And to live are all men fain. Three nights like a dog 'neath the sky I've lain, My couch on the hillside forced to make, With for pillow the boulder grey. Though too proud to knock at the door of the stranger, And pray him for aid in the hour of danger, Yet strong was my hope as I held on my way: I thought: When to Solhoug you come at last Then all your pains will be done and past. You have sure friends there, whatever betide. - But hope like a wayside flower shrivels up; Though your husband met me with flagon and cup, And his doors flung open wide, Within, your dwelling seems chill and bare; Dark is the hall; my friends are not there. 'Tis well; I will back to my hills from your halls.
#MARGIT.
Oh, hear me!
#GUDMUND.
My soul is not base as a thrall's. Now life to me seems a thing of nought; Truly I hold it scarce worth a thought. You have killed all that I hold most dear; Of my fairest hopes I follow the bier. Farewell, then, Dame Margit!
#MARGIT.
Nay, Gudmund, hear! By all that is holy - !
#GUDMUND.
Live on as before Live on in honour and joyance - Never shall Gudmund darken your door, Never shall cause you 'noyance.
#MARGIT.
Enough, enough. Your bitterness You presently shall rue. Had I known you outlawed, shelterless, Hunted the country through - Trust me, the day that brought you here Would have seemed the fairest of many a year; And a feast I had counted it indeed When you turned to Solhoug for refuge in need.
#GUDMUND.
What say you - ? How shall I read your mind?
#MARGIT.
Read this: that at Solhoug dwell kinsfolk kind.
#GUDMUND.
But you said of late - ?
#MARGIT.
To that pay no heed, Or hear me, and understand indeed. For me is life but a long, black night, Nor sun, nor star for me shines bright. I have sold my youth and my liberty, And none from my bargain can set me free. My heart's content I have bartered for gold, With gilded chains I have fettered myself; Trust me, it is but comfort cold To the sorrowful soul, the pride of pelf. How blithe was my childhood - how free from care! Our house was lowly and scant our store; But treasures of hope in my breast I bore.
#GUDMUND.
E'en then you were growing to beauty rare.
#MARGIT.
Mayhap; but the praises showered on me Caused the wreck of my happiness - that I now see. To far - off lands away you sailed; But deep in my heart was graven each song You had ever sung; and their glamour was strong; With a mist of dreams my brow they veiled. In them all the joys you had dwelt upon That can find a home in the beating breast; You had sung so oft of the lordly life 'Mid knights and ladies. And lo! anon Came wooers a many from east and from west; And so - I became Bengt Gauteson's wife.
#GUDMUND.
Oh, Margit!
#MARGIT.
The days that passed were but few Ere with tears my folly I 'gan to rue. To think, my kinsman and friend, on thee Was all the comfort left to me. How empty now seemed Solhoug's hall, How hateful and drear its great rooms all! Hither came many a knight and dame, Came many a skald to sing my fame. But never a one who could fathom aright My spirit and all its yearning - I shivered, as though in the Hill - King's might; Yet my head throbbed, my blood was burning.
#GUDMUND.
But your husband - ?
#MARGIT.
He never to me was dear. 'Twas his gold was my undoing. When he spoke to me, aye, or e'en drew near, My spirit writhed with ruing. And thus have I lived for three long years - life of sorrow, of unstanched tears! Your coming was rumoured. You know full well What pride deep down in my heart doth dwell. I hid my anguish, I veiled my woe, For you were the last that the truth must know.
#GUDMUND.
'Twas therefore, then, that you turned away -
#MARGIT.
I thought you came at my woe to jeer.
#GUDMUND.
Margit, how could you think - ?
#MARGIT.
Nay, nay, There was reason enough for such a fear. But thanks be to Heaven that fear is gone; And now no longer I stand alone; My spirit now is as light and free As a child's at play 'neath the greenwood tree. Ah, where are my wits fled! How could I forget - ? Ye saints, I need sorely your succor yet! An outlaw, you said - ?
#GUDMUND.
Hither the King's men scarce dare come.
#MARGIT.
Your fall has been sudden. I pray you, tell How you lost the King's favour.
#GUDMUND.
'Twas thus it befell. You know how I journeyed to France of late, When the Chancellor, Audun of Hegranes, Fared thither from Bergen, in royal state, To lead home the King's bride, the fair Princess, With her squires, and maidens, and ducats bright. Sir Audun's a fair and stately knight, The Princess shone with a beauty rare - Her eyes seemed full of a burning prayer. They would oft talk alone and in whispers, the two - Of what? That nobody guessed or knew. There came a night when I leant at ease Against the galley's railing; My thought flew onward to Norway's leas, With the milk - white seagulls sailing. Two voices whispered behind my back; - I turned - it was he and she; I knew them well, though the night was black, But they - they saw not me. She gazed upon him with sorrowful eyes And whispered: "Ah, if to southern skies We could turn the vessel's prow, And we were alone in the bark, we twain, My heart, methinks, would find peace again, Nor would fever burn my brow." Sir Audun answers; and straight she replies, In words so fierce, so bold; Like glittering stars I can see her eyes; She begged him -
#MARGIT.
She begged - ?
#GUDMUND.
I arose, and they vanished apace; All was silent, fore and aft: - But this I found by their resting place.
#MARGIT.
And that - ?
#GUDMUND.
drop of this in your enemy's cup And his life will sicken and wither up. No leechcraft helps 'gainst the deadly thing.
#MARGIT.
And that - ?
#GUDMUND.
That draught was meant for the King.
#MARGIT.
Great God!
#GUDMUND.
In three days more was our voyage ended; Then I fled, by my faithful men attended. For I knew right well, in the royal hall, That Audun subtly would work my fall, - Accusing me -
#MARGIT.
Aye, but at Solhoug he Cannot harm you. All as of old will be.
#GUDMUND.
All? Nay, Margit - you then were free.
#MARGIT.
You mean - ? Nay, I meant naught. My brain Is wildered; but ah, I am blithe and fain To be, as of old, with you sisters twain. But tell me, - Signe - ?
#MARGIT.
To greet her kinsman she needs must don Her trinkets - a task that takes time, 'tis plain.
#GUDMUND.
I must see - I must see if she knows me again.
#MARGIT.
How fair and manlike he is! There is little likeness 'twixt him and - "You then were free," he said. Yes, then! 'Twas a strange tale, that of the Princess who - She held another dear, and then - Aye, those women of far - off lands - I have heard it before - they are not weak as we are; they do not fear to pass from thought to deed. 'Twas in this beaker that Gudmund and I, when he went away, drank to his happy return. 'Tis well - nigh the only heirloom I brought with me to Solhoug. How soft is this summer day; and how light it is in here! So sweetly has the sun not shone for three long years.
#SIGNE.
Ha, ha, ha! He will not believe that 'tis I!
#MARGIT.
You see: while in far - off lands you strayed, She, too, has altered, the little maid.
#GUDMUND.
Aye truly! But that she should be - Why, 'Tis a marvel in very deed. Yet, when I look in these eyes so blue, The innocent child - mind I still can read - Yes, Signe, I know that 'tis you! I needs must laugh when I think how oft I have thought of you perched on my shoulder aloft As you used to ride. You were then a child; Now you are a nixie, spell - weaving, wild.
#SIGNE.
Beware! If the nixie's ire you awaken, Soon in her nets you will find yourself taken.
#GUDMUND.
I am snared already, it seems to me.
#SIGNE.
But, Gudmund, wait - you have still to see How I've shielded your harp from the dust and the rust. You shall teach me all of your songs! You must!
#GUDMUND.
She has flushed to the loveliest rose of May, That was yet but a bud in the morning's ray.
#SIGNE.
Behold!
#GUDMUND.
Still the old chords ring sweet and clear - On the wall, untouched, thou shalt hang no more.
#MARGIT.
Our guests are coming.
#GUDMUND.
I roamed through the uplands so heavy of cheer; The little birds quavered in bush and in brere; The little birds quavered, around and above: Wouldst know of the sowing and growing of love? It grows like the oak tree through slow - rolling years; 'Tis nourished by dreams, and by songs, and by tears; But swiftly 'tis sown; ere a moment speeds by, Deep, deep in the heart love is rooted for aye.
#SIGNE.
But swiftly 'tis sown; ere a moment speeds by, Deep, deep in the heart love is rooted for aye.
#MARGIT.
Did you speak to me? - I heard not clearly - ? No, no. I only meant -
#MARGIT.
It grows like the oak tree through slow - rolling years; 'Tis nourished by dreams, and by songs and by tears.
#SIGNE.
You said that - ?
#MARGIT.
Nay, 'twas nothing. Come, we must go meet our guests.
#GUESTS.
With song and harping enter we
#THE GUESTS.
Set bow to fiddle! To sound of strings We'll dance till night shall furl her wings, Through the long hours glad and golden! Like blood - red blossom the maiden glows - Come, bold young wooer and hold the rose In a soft embrace enfolden.
#ERIK.
If only you come not to repent it, Knut.
#KNUT.
That is my affair.
#ERIK.
Well, say what you will, 'tis a daring move. You are the King's Sheriff. Commands go forth to you that you shall seize the person of Gudmund Alfson, wherever you may find him. And now, when you have him in your grasp, you proffer him your friendship, and let him go freely, whithersoever he will.
#KNUT.
I know what I am doing. I sought him in his own dwelling, but there he was not to be found. If, now, I went about to seize him here - think you that Dame Margit would be minded to give me Signe to wife?
#ERIK.
No, by fair means it might scarcely be, but -
#KNUT.
And by foul means I am loth to proceed. Moreover, Gudmund is my friend from bygone days; and he can be helpful to me. Therefore it shall be as I have said. This evening no one at Solhoug shall know that Gudmund Alfson is an outlaw; - to - morrow he must look to himself.
#ERIK.
Aye, but the King's decree?
#KNUT.
Oh, the King's decree! You know as well as I that the King's decree is but little heeded here in the uplands. Were the King's decree to be enforced, many a stout fellow among us would have to pay dear both for bride - rape and for man - slaying. Come this way, I would fain know where Signe - ?
#SIGNE.
Oh, speak! Say on! For sweeter far Such words than sweetest music are.
#GUDMUND.
Signe, my flower, my lily fair!
#SIGNE.
I am dear to him - I! Gudmund.
#SIGNE.
And is it I that can bind your will! And is it I that your heart can fill! Oh, dare I believe you?
#GUDMUND.
Indeed you may. List to me, Signe! The years sped away, But faithful was I in my thoughts to you, My fairest flowers, ye sisters two. My own heart I could not clearly read. When I left, my Signe was but a child, fairy elf, like the creatures wild Who play, while we sleep, in wood and mead. But in Solhoug's hall to - day, right loud My heart spake, and right clearly; It told me that Margit's a lady proud, Whilst you're the sweet maiden I love most dearly.
#SIGNE.
I mind me, we sat in the hearth's red glow, One winter evening - 'tis long ago - And you sang to me of the maiden fair Whom the neckan had lured to his watery lair. There she forgot both father and mother, There she forgot both sister and brother; Heaven and earth and her Christian speech, And her God, she forgot them all and each. But close by the strand a stripling stood And he was heartsore and heavy of mood. He struck from his harpstrings notes of woe, That wide o'er the waters rang loud, rang low. The spell - bound maid in the tarn so deep, His strains awoke from her heavy sleep, The neckan must grant her release from his rule, She rose through the lilies afloat on the pool - Then looked she to heaven while on green earth she trod, And wakened once more to her faith and her God.
#GUDMUND.
Signe, my fairest of flowers!
#SIGNE.
It seems That I, too, have lived in a world of dreams. But the strange deep words you to - night have spoken, Of the power of love, have my slumber broken. The heavens seemed never so blue to me, Never the world so fair; I can understand, as I roam with thee, The song of the birds in air.
#GUDMUND.
So mighty is love - it stirs in the breast Thought and longings and happy unrest. But come, let us both to your sister go.
#SIGNE.
Would you tell her - ?
#GUDMUND.
Everything she must know.
#SIGNE.
Then go you alone; - I feel that my cheek Would be hot with blushes to hear you speak.
#GUDMUND.
So be it, I go.
#SIGNE.
And here will I bide; Or better - down by the riverside, I hear Knut Gesling, with maidens and men.
#GUDMUND.
There will you stay?
#SIGNE.
Till you come again
#MARGIT.
In the hall there is gladness and revelry; The dancers foot it with jest and glee. The air weighed hot on my brow and breast; For Gudmund, he was not there. Out here 'tis better: here's quiet and rest. How sweet is the cool night air! The horrible thought! Oh, why should it be That wherever I go it follows me? The phial - doth a secret contain; drop of this in my - enemy's cup, And his life would sicken and wither up; The leech's skill would be tried in vain. Were I sure that Gudmund - held me dear - Then little I'd care for -
#GUDMUND.
You, Margit, here? And alone? I have sought you everywhere.
#MARGIT.
'Tis cool here. I sickened of heat and glare. See you how yonder the white mists glide Softly over the marshes wide? Here it is neither dark nor light, But midway between them - Is't not so - when you wander on such a night You hear, though but half to yourself confessed, stirring of secret life through the hush, In tree and in leaf, in flower and in rush? Can you guess what I wish?
#GUDMUND.
Well?
#MARGIT.
That I could be The nixie that haunts yonder upland lea. How cunningly I should weave my spell! Trust me - !
#GUDMUND.
Margit, what ails you? Tell!
#MARGIT.
How I should quaver my magic lay! Quaver and croon it both night and day! How I would lure the knight so bold Through the greenwood glades to my mountain hold. There were the world and its woes forgot In the burning joys of our blissful lot.
#GUDMUND.
Margit! Margit!
#MARGIT.
Sweet were our sleep in my lonely bower; - And if death should come with the dawn, I trow 'Twere sweet to die so; - what thinkest thou?
#GUDMUND.
You are sick!
#MARGIT.
To laugh when the heart is in laughing mood!
#GUDMUND.
I see that you still have the same wild soul As of old -
#MARGIT.
'Tis only at midnight it mocks control; By day I am timid as any hind. How tame I have grown, you yourself must say, When you think on the women in lands far away - Of that fair Princess - ah, she was wild! Beside her lamblike am I and mild. She did not helplessly yearn and brood, She would have acted; and that -
#GUDMUND.
'Tis good You remind me; Straightway I'll cast away What to me is valueless after this day -
#MARGIT.
The phial! You meant - ?
#GUDMUND.
I thought it might be At need a friend that should set me free Should the King's men chance to lay hands on me. But from to - night it has lost its worth; Now will I fight all the kings of earth, Gather my kinsfolk and friends to the strife, And battle right stoutly for freedom and life.
#MARGIT.
Nay, hold! Let me have it -
#GUDMUND.
First tell me why?
#MARGIT.
I'd fain fling it down to the neckan hard by, Who so often has made my dull hours fleet With his harping and songs, so strange and sweet. Give it me!
#MARGIT.
Aye, surely! You saw - Gudmund!
#MARGIT.
Teach me, I pray, How to interpret the ancient lay They sing of the church in the valley there: gentle knight and a lady fair, They loved each other well. That very day on her bier she lay He on his sword - point fell. They buried her by the northward spire, And him by the south kirk wall; And theretofore grew neither bush nor briar In the hallowed ground at all. But next spring from their coffins twain Two lilies fair upgrew - And by and by, o'er the roof - tree high, They twined and they bloomed the whole year through. How read you the riddle?
#MARGIT.
You may doubtless read it in many a way; But its truest meaning, methinks, is clear: The church can never sever two that hold each other dear.
#GUDMUND.
Ye saints, if she should - ? Lest worse befall, 'Tis time indeed I told her all! Do you wish for my happiness - Margit, tell!
#MARGIT.
Wish for it! I!
#GUDMUND.
Then, wot you well, The joy of my life now rests with you -
#MARGIT.
Gudmund!
#GUDMUND.
Listen! 'tis the time you knew -
#KNUT.
Gudmund Alfson! Wait; I must speak a word with you.
#MARGIT.
The joy of his life - ! What else can he mean but - ! Signe - my dear, dear sister!
#GUDMUND.
Aye, so it were wisest. Both Signe and I must away from Solhoug. Knut Gesling has shown himself my friend; he will help me.
#KNUT.
Yes, yes, I say, Gudmund is her kinsman; he can best plead my cause.
#ERIK.
Well, as you will.
#KNUT.
Listen, Gudmund -
#GUDMUND.
Come you to tell me that you dare no longer let me go free.
#KNUT.
Dare! Be at your ease as to that. Knut Gesling dares whatever he will. No, 'tis another matter. You know that here in the district, I am held to be a wild, unruly companion -
#GUDMUND.
Aye, and if rumour lies not -
#KNUT.
Why no, much that it reports may be true enough. But now, I must tell you -
#SIGNE.
I understand you not. You speak as though an unlooked - for happiness had befallen you. What is in your mind?
#MARGIT.
Signe - you are still a child; you know not what it means to have ever in your heart the dread of - Think, Signe, what it must be to wither and die without ever having lived.
#SIGNE.
Nay, but, Margit - ?
#MARGIT.
Aye, aye, you do not understand, but none the less -
#GUDMUND.
Well, if so it be - if this wild life no longer contents you - then I will give you the best counsel that ever friend gave to friend: take to wife an honourable maiden.
#KNUT.
Say you so? And if I now told you that 'tis even that I have in mind?
#GUDMUND.
Good luck and happiness to you then, Knut Gesling! And now you must know that I too -
#KNUT.
You? Are you, too, so purposed?
#GUDMUND.
Aye truly. But the King's wrath - I am a banished man -
#KNUT.
Nay, to that you need give but little thought. As yet there is no one here, save Dame Margit, that knows aught of the matter; and so long as I am your friend, you have one in whom you can trust securely. Now I must tell you -
#SIGNE.
But tell me then Margit - !
#MARGIT.
More I dare not tell you.
#SIGNE.
Then will I be more open - hearted than you. But first answer me one question. Is there no one who has told you anything concerning me?
#MARGIT.
Concerning you? Nay, what should that be?
#SIGNE.
You said to me this morning: if a wooer came riding hither - ?
#MARGIT.
That is true. Knut Gesling - has he already - ? Well? What then?
#SIGNE.
The wooer has come! He has come, Margit! I knew not then whom you meant; but now - !
#MARGIT.
And what have you answered him?
#SIGNE.
Oh, how should I know? But the world seems to me so rich and beautiful since the moment when he told me that he held me dear.
#MARGIT.
Why, Signe, Signe, I cannot understand that you should so quickly - ! You scarce knew him before to - day.
#SIGNE.
Oh, 'tis but little I yet know of love; but this I know that what the song says is true: Full swiftly 'tis sown; ere a moment speeds by, Deep, deep in the heart love is rooted for aye -
#MARGIT.
So be it; and since so it is, I need no longer hold aught concealed from you. Ah -
#KNUT.
Ha, this is as I would have it, Gudmund. Here is my hand!
#MARGIT.
What is this?
#GUDMUND.
And here is mine!
#KNUT.
But now we must each of us name who it is -
#GUDMUND.
Good. Here at Solhoug, among so many fair women, I have found her whom -
#KNUT.
I too. And I will bear her home this very night, if it be needful.
#MARGIT.
All saints in heaven!
#GUDMUND.
The same is my intent.
#SIGNE.
Gudmund!
#GUDMUND AND KNUT.
There she is!
#GUDMUND.
Aye, mine.
#KNUT.
No, mine!
#MARGIT.
Signe!
#GUDMUND.
What mean you by that?
#KNUT.
I mean that 'tis Signe whom I -
#GUDMUND.
Signe! Signe is my betrothed in the sight of God.
#MARGIT.
It was she! No - no!
#GUDMUND.
Margit! She has heard everything.
#KNUT.
Ho, ho! So this is how it stands? Nay, Dame Margit, 'tis needless to put on such an air of wonder; now I understand everything.
#MARGIT.
But not a moment ago you said - ? 'Twas Gudmund you meant!
#SIGNE.
Yes, did you not know it! But what ails you, Margit?
#MARGIT.
Nay, nothing, nothing.
#KNUT.
And this morning, when you made me give my word that I would stir no strife here to - night - you already knew that Gudmund Alfson was coming. Ha, ha, think not that you can hoodwink Knut Gesling! Signe has become dear to me. Even this morning 'twas but my hasty vow that drove me to seek her hand; but now -
#SIGNE.
He? Was this the wooer that was in your mind?
#MARGIT.
Hush, hush!
#KNUT.
Dame Margit - you are her elder sister; you shall give me an answer.
#MARGIT.
Signe has already made her choice; - I have naught to answer.
#KNUT.
Good; then I have nothing more to do at Solhoug. But after midnight - mark you this - the day is at an end; then you may chance to see me again, and then Fortune must decide whether it be Gudmund or I that shall bear Signe away from this house.
#GUDMUND.
Aye, try if you dare; it shall cost you a bloody sconce.
#SIGNE.
Gudmund! By all the saints - !
#KNUT.
Gently, gently, Gudmund Alfson! Ere sunrise you shall be in my power. And she - your lady - love - Erik! Erik! come hither! we must away to our kinsfolk. Woe upon you all when I come again!
#SIGNE.
Oh, tell me, what does all this mean?
#GUDMUND.
We must both leave Solhoug this very night.
#SIGNE.
God shield me - you would - !
#GUDMUND.
Say nought of it! No word to any one, not even to your sister.
#MARGIT.
She - it is she! She of whom he had scarce thought before to - night. Had I been free, I know well whom he had chosen. - Aye, free!
#YOUNG MEN AND MAIDENS.
Out here, out here be the feast arrayed, While the birds are asleep in the greenwood shade, How sweet to sport in the flowery glade Out here, out here, shall be mirth and jest, No sigh on the lips and no care in the breast, When the fiddle is tuned at the dancers' 'hest,
#BENGT.
That is well, that is well! So I fain would see it! I am merry, and my wife likewise; and therefore I pray ye all to be merry along with us.
#ONE OF THE GUESTS.
Aye, now let us have a stave - match.*
#MANY.
Yes, yes, a stave - match!
#ANOTHER GUEST.
Nay, let that be; it leads but to strife at the feast. Bear in mind that Knut Gesling is with us to - night.
#SEVERAL.
Aye, aye, that is true. Remember the last time, how he - Best beware.
#AN OLD MAN.
But you, Dame Margit - I know your kind had ever wealth of tales in store; and you yourself, even as a child, knew many a fair legend.
#MARGIT.
Alas! I have forgot them all. But ask Gudmund Alfson, my kinsman; he knows a tale that is merry enough.
#GUDMUND.
Margit!
#MARGIT.
Why, what a pitiful countenance you put on! Be merry, Gudmund! Be merry! Aye, aye, it comes easy to you, well I wot. He has seen the huldra to - night. She would fain have tempted him; but Gudmund is a faithful swain. Aye, but the tale is not finished yet. When you bear away your lady - love, over hill and through forest, be sure you turn not round; be sure you never look back - the huldra sits laughing behind every bush; and when all is done - - you will go no further than she will let you.
#SIGNE.
Oh, God! Oh, God!
#BENGT.
Ha, ha, ha! Dame Margit knows how to set the mirth afoot! When she takes it in hand, she does it much better than I.
#GUDMUND.
She threatens! I must tear the last hope out of her breast; else will peace never come to her mind.
#SEVERAL OF THE GUESTS.
Thanks, thanks, Gudmund Alfson!
#GUDMUND.
I rode into the wildwood, But 'twas at home I wooed and won It was the Queen of Elfland, Never, she swore, shall that maiden fair Hear me, thou Queen of Elfland, For naught can sunder two true hearts
#AN OLD MAN.
That is a right fair song. See how the young swains cast their glances thitherward! Aye, aye, doubtless each has his own.
#BENGT.
Yes, I have mine, that is sure enough. Ha, ha, ha!
#MARGIT.
To have to suffer all this shame and scorn! No, no; now to essay the last remedy.
#BENGT.
What ails you? Meseems you look so pale.
#MARGIT.
'Twill soon pass over. Did I say e'en now that I had forgotten all my tales? I bethink me now that I remember one.
#BENGT.
Good, good, my wife! Come, let us hear it.
#YOUNG GIRLS.
Yes, tell it us, tell it us, Dame Margit!
#MARGIT.
I almost fear that 'twill little please you; but that must be as it may.
#GUDMUND.
Saints in heaven, surely she would not - !
#MARGIT.
It was a fair and noble maid, She dwelt in her father's hall; Both linen and silk did she broider and braid, Yet found in it solace small. For she sat there alone in cheerless state, Empty were hall and bower; In the pride of her heart, she was fain to mate With a chieftain of pelf and power. But now 'twas the Hill King, he rode from the north, With his henchmen and his gold; On the third day at night he in triumph fared forth, Bearing her to his mountain hold. Full many a summer she dwelt in the hill; Out of beakers of gold she could drink at her will. Oh, fair are the flowers of the valley, I trow, But only in dreams can she gather them now! 'Twas a youth, right gentle and bold to boot, Struck his harp with such magic might That it rang to the mountain's inmost root, Where she languished in the night. The sound in her soul waked a wondrous mood - Wide open the mountain - gates seemed to stand; The peace of God lay over the land, And she saw how it all was fair and good. There happened what never had happened before; She had wakened to life as his harp - strings thrilled; And her eyes were opened to all the store Of treasure wherewith the good earth is filled. For mark this well: it hath ever been found That those who in caverns deep lie bound Are lightly freed by the harp's glad sound. He saw her prisoned, he heard her wail - But he cast unheeding his harp aside, Hoisted straightway his silken sail, And sped away o'er the waters wide To stranger strands with his new - found bride. So fair was thy touch on the golden strings That my breast heaves high and my spirit sings! I must out, I must out to the sweet green leas! I die in the Hill - King's fastnesses! He mocks at my woe as he clasps his bride And sails away o'er the waters wide. With me all is over; my hill - prison barred; Unsunned is the day, and the night all unstarred.
#SIGNE.
Margit! My sister!
#GUDMUND.
Help! help! she is dying!
#BENGT.
God speed you, then, and bring you back ere long to Solhoug. Methinks you, like the rest, might have stayed and slept till morning. Well, well! Yet hold - I'll e'en go with you to the gate. I must drink your healths once more.
#GUESTS.
Farewell, and God's blessing on one and all Beneath this roof abiding! The road must be faced. To the fiddler we call: Tune up! Our cares deriding, We'll shorten the way so weary and long.
#MAID.
God save us, my lady, have you left your bed?
#MARGIT.
I am well. Go you and sleep. Stay - tell me, are the guests all gone?
#MAID.
No, not all; some wait till later in the day; ere now they are sleeping sound.
#MARGIT.
And Gudmund Alfson - ?
#MAID.
He, too, is doubtless asleep. 'Tis some time since he went to his chamber - yonder, across the passage.
#MARGIT.
Good; you may go.
#MARGIT.
To - morrow, then, Gudmund will ride away Out into the world so great and wide. Alone with my husband here I must stay; And well do I know what will then betide. Like the broken branch and the trampled flower I shall suffer and fade from hour to hour. I once heard a tale of a child blind from birth, Whose childhood was full of joy and mirth; For the mother, with spells of magic might, Wove for the dark eyes a world of light. And the child looked forth with wonder and glee Upon the valley and hill, upon land and sea. Then suddenly the witchcraft failed - The child once more was in darkness pent; Good - bye to games and merriment; With longing vain the red cheeks paled. And its wail of woe, as it pined away, Was ceaseless, and sadder than words can say. - Oh! like the child's my eyes were sealed, To the light and the life of summer blind - But now - ! And I in this cage confined! No, now is the worth of my youth revealed! Three years of life I on him have spent - My husband - but were I longer content This hapless, hopeless weird to dree, Meek as a dove I needs must be. I am wearied to death of petty brawls; The stirring life of the great world calls. I will follow Gudmund with shield and bow, I will share his joys, I will soothe his woe, Watch o'er him both by night and day. All that behold shall envy the life Of the valiant knight and Margit his wife. - His wife! Forgive me, forgive me, and oh! let me feel The peace that hath power both to soothe and to heal. Signe, my sister - ? How hateful 'twere To steal her glad young life from her! But who can tell? In very sooth She may love him but with the light love of youth. This phial - were I its powers to try - My husband would sleep for ever and aye! No, no! To the river's depths with it straight! And yet I could - 'tis not yet too late. - With what a magic resistless might Sin masters us in our own despite! Doubly alluring methinks is the goal I must reach through blood, with the wreck of my soul.
#BENGT.
My faith, this has been a feast that will be the talk of the country.
#MARGIT.
Is the door barred?
#BENGT.
I have seen to everything. I went with the last guests as far as the gates. But what became of Knut Gesling to - night? - Give me mead, Margit! I am thirsty Fill this cup.
#MARGIT.
You asked about Knut Gesling.
#BENGT.
That I did. The boaster, the braggart! I have not forgot his threats of yester - morning.
#MARGIT.
He used worse words when he left to - night.
#BENGT.
He did? So much the better. I will strike him dead.
#MARGIT.
H'm -
#BENGT.
I will kill him, I say! I fear not to face ten such fellows as he. In the store - house hangs my grandfather's axe; its shaft is inlaid with silver; with that axe in my hands, I tell you - ! To - morrow I shall arm myself, go forth with all my men, and slay Knut Gesling.
#MARGIT.
Oh, to have to live with him!
#BENGT.
Margit, come here! Fill my cup again. Ha, ha, ha! You are right fair, Margit! I love thee well!
#MARGIT.
Let me go!
#BENGT.
You are not in the humour to - night. Ha, ha, ha! That means no great matter, I know.
#MARGIT.
Oh, that this might be the last beaker I should fill for you.
#BENGT.
Hark to me, Margit. For one thing you may thank Heaven, and that is, that I made you my wife before Gudmund Alfson came back.
#MARGIT.
Why so?
#BENGT.
Why, say you? Am not I ten times the richer man? And certain I am that he would have sought you for his wife, had you not been the mistress of Solhoug.
#MARGIT.
Say you so?
#BENGT.
I could take my oath upon it. Bengt Gauteson has two sharp eyes in his head. But he may still have Signe.
#MARGIT.
And you think he will - ?
#BENGT.
Take her? Aye, since he cannot have you. But had you been free, - then - Ha, ha, ha! Gudmund is like the rest. He envies me my wife. That is why I set such store by you, Margit. Here with the goblet again. And let it be full to the brim!
#MARGIT.
You shall have it straightway.
#BENGT.
Knut Gesling is a suitor for Signe, too, but him I am resolved to slay. Gudmund is an honourable man; he shall have her. Think, Margit, what good days we shall have with them for neighbours. We will go a - visiting each other, and then will we sit the live - long day, each with his wife on his knee, drinking and talking of this and that.
#MARGIT.
No doubt no doubt!
#BENGT.
Ha, ha, ha! it may be that at first Gudmund will look askance at me when I take you in my arms; but that, I doubt not, he will soon get over.
#MARGIT.
This is more than woman can bear! Your beaker is full.
#BENGT.
Then bring it hither!
#MARGIT.
I pray you drink no more to - night!
#BENGT.
Oho! You are impatient for my coming? Get you in; I will follow you soon.
#MARGIT.
Your beaker is full. There it is.
#BENGT.
I like her well. It repents me not a whit that I took her to wife, though of heritage she owned no more than yonder goblet and the brooches of her wedding gown.
#HOUSE-CARL.
Sir Bengt, Sir Bengt! haste forth with all the speed you can! Knut Gesling with an armed train is drawing near the house.
#BENGT.
Knut Gesling? Who brings the tidings?
#HOUSE-CARL.
Some of your guests espied him on the road beneath, and hastened back to warn you.
#BENGT.
E'en so. Then will I - ! Fetch me my grandfather's battle - axe!
#SIGNE.
It must then, be so!
#GUDMUND.
Constrains us.
#SIGNE.
Oh! thus under cover of night To steal from the valley where I was born? Yet shalt thou hear no plaint forlorn. 'Tis for thy sake my home I flee; Wert thou not outlawed, Gudmund dear, I'd stay with my sister.
#GUDMUND.
Only to be Ta'en by Knut Gesling, with bow and spear, Swung on the croup of his battle - horse, And made his wife by force.
#SIGNE.
Quick, let us flee. But whither go?
#GUDMUND.
Down by the fiord a friend I know; He'll find us a ship. O'er the salt sea foam We'll sail away south to Denmark's bowers. There waits you there a happy home; Right joyously will fleet the hours; The fairest of flowers they bloom in the shade Of the beech - tree glade.
#SIGNE.
Farewell, my poor sister! Like my mother tender Thou hast guarded the ways my feet have trod, Hast guided my footsteps, aye praying to God, The Almighty, to be my defender. - Gudmund - here is a goblet filled with mead; Let us drink to her; let us wish that ere long Her soul may again be calm and strong, And that God may be good to her need.
#GUDMUND.
Aye, let us drain it, naming her name! Stop!
#SIGNE.
'Tis Margit's beaker.
#GUDMUND.
I mind me still of the red wine's glow As she drank from it on the day we parted To our meeting again in health and glad - hearted. To herself that draught betided woe. No, Signe, ne'er drink wine or mead From that goblet.
#SIGNE.
List, Gudmund! Voices and trampling feet!
#GUDMUND.
Knut Gesling's voice!
#SIGNE.
O save us, Lord!
#GUDMUND.
Nay, nay, fear nothing, Signe sweet - I am here, and my good sword.
#MARGIT.
What means this? Is my husband - ?
#GUDMUND AND SIGNE.
Margit!
#MARGIT.
Gudmund! And Signe! Are you here?
#SIGNE.
Margit - dear sister!
#MARGIT.
The goblet! Who has drunk from it?
#GUDMUND.
Drunk - ? I and Signe - we meant -
#MARGIT.
O God, have mercy! Help! Help! They will die!
#GUDMUND.
Margit - !
#SIGNE.
What ails you, sister?
#MARGIT.
Help, help! Will no one help?
#HOUSE-CARL.
Lady Margit! Your husband - !
#MARGIT.
He - has he, too, drunk - !
#GUDMUND.
Ah! now I understand -
#HOUSE-CARL.
Knut Gesling has slain him.
#SIGNE.
Slain!
#GUDMUND.
Not yet, I hope. Fear not. No one has drunk from your goblet.
#MARGIT.
Then thanks be to God, who has saved us all!
#ANOTHER HOUSE-CARL.
You come too late. Sir Bengt is dead.
#GUDMUND.
Too late, then, too late.
#HOUSE-CARL.
The guests and your men have prevailed against the murderous crew. Knut Gesling and his men are prisoners. Here they come.
#KNUT.
Man - slayer, Gudmund. What say you to that?
#GUDMUND.
Knut, Knut, what have you done?
#ERIK.
'Twas a mischance, of that I can take my oath.
#KNUT.
He ran at me swinging his axe; I meant but to defend myself, and struck the death - blow unawares.
#ERIK.
Many here saw all that befell.
#KNUT.
Lady Margit, crave what fine you will. I am ready to pay it.
#MARGIT.
I crave naught. God will judge us all. Yet stay - one thing I require. Forgo your evil design upon my sister.
#KNUT.
Never again shall I essay to redeem my baleful pledge. From this day onward I am a better man. Yet would I fain escape dishonourable punishment for my deed. Should you be restored to favour and place again, say a good word for me to the King! Ere the sun sets, I must have left the country.
#MARGIT.
You go? And Signe with you?
#SIGNE.
Margit!
#MARGIT.
Good fortune follow you both!
#SIGNE.
Dear sister!
#GUDMUND.
Margit, I thank you. And now farewell. Hush! I hear the tramp of hoofs in the court - yard.
#SIGNE.
Strangers have arrived.
#HOUSE-CARL.
The King's men are without. They seek Gudmund Alfson.
#SIGNE.
Oh God!
#MARGIT.
The King's men!
#GUDMUND.
All is at an end, then. Oh Signe, to lose you now - could there be a harder fate?
#KNUT.
Nay, Gudmund; sell your life dearly, man! Unbind us; we are ready to fight for you, one and all.
#ERIK.
'Twould be in vain; they are too many for us.
#SIGNE.
Here they come. Oh Gudmund, Gudmund!
#MESSENGER.
In the King's name I seek you, Gudmund Alfson, and bring you his behests.
#GUDMUND.
Be it so. Yet am I guiltless; I swear it by all that is holy!
#MESSENGER.
We know it.
#GUDMUND.
What say you?
#MESSENGER.
I am ordered to bid you as a guest to the King's house. His friendship is yours as it was before, and along with it he bestows on you rich fiefs.
#GUDMUND.
Signe!
#SIGNE.
Gudmund!
#GUDMUND.
But tell me - ?
#MESSENGER.
Your enemy, the Chancellor Audun Hugleikson, has fallen.
#GUDMUND.
The Chancellor!
#GUESTS.
Fallen!
#MESSENGER.
Three days ago he was beheaded at Bergen. His offence was against Norway's Queen.
#MARGIT.
Thus punishment treads on the heels of crime! Protecting angels, loving and bright, Have looked down in mercy on me to - night, And come to my rescue while yet it was time. Now know I that life's most precious treasure Is nor worldly wealth nor earthly pleasure, I have felt the remorse, the terror I know, Of those who wantonly peril their soul, To St. Sunniva's cloister forthwith I go. - Nay: think not to move me or control. Take her then Gudmund, and make her your bride. Your union is holy; God's on your side.
#GUDMUND.
Signe - my wife! See, the morning glow! 'Tis the morning of our young love. Rejoice!
#SIGNE.
All my fairest of dreams and of memories I owe To the strains of thy harp and the sound of thy voice. My noble minstrel, to joy or sadness Tune thou that harp as seems thee best; There are chords, believe me, within my breast To answer to thine, or of woe or of gladness.
#CHORUS OF MEN AND WOMEN.
Over the earth keeps watch the eye of light, Guardeth lovingly the good man's ways, Sheddeth round him its consoling rays; - Praise be to the Lord in heaven's height!
