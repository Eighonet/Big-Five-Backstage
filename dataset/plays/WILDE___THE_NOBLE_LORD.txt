#SHE.
Mother! Mother, dear!
#HE.
Eh?
#SHE.
Mother, dear, I'm so glad -
#HE.
Really, I beg your pardon.
#SHE.
I'm so glad you've come.
#HE.
Ah, yes. . Quite so.
#SHE.
Kiss me, mother.
#HE.
Eh?
#SHE.
Kiss me, mother.
#HE.
But I'm not your mother.
#SHE.
Won't you kiss me, mother?
#SHE.
Ah! That's so nice. Hold me close, mother, hold me close. I've had such a terrible dream!
#HE.
Good Heavens! You're not dreaming now. .
#SHE.
I dreamt - I dreamt - Where - where am I?
#HE.
Don't you know?
#SHE.
No.
#HE.
We are about half a mile away from the Poland Springs Hotel, Poland Springs, Maine.
#SHE.
Oh! And you, how do you come here?
#HE.
Strolling.
#SHE.
Strolling?
#HE.
I reached the hotel this morning. It was hot - beastly hot. I went for a walk in the woods.
#SHE.
And then?
#HE.
I beg your pardon?
#SHE.
What happened then? How did we meet?
#HE.
Don't you know?
#SHE.
I remember nothing - I'm confused. My shoes - where are my shoes?
#HE.
Here they are.
#SHE.
Thank you. . Those aren't my shoes!
#HE.
No?
#SHE.
They're wet.
#HE.
They would be.
#SHE.
But they're not mine.
#HE.
I found them on your feet.
#SHE.
On my feet?
#HE.
Yes. . One on each.
#SHE.
Oh! . I can't get them on.
#HE.
No?
#SHE.
Will you help me? : Oh!
#HE.
Did I hurt you?
#SHE.
My clothes are wet!
#HE.
Yes.
#SHE.
How funny! And you - you're wet also!
#HE.
Soaked.
#SHE.
What a coincidence! How curious! How did it happen? Oh, if I could only think! Think! Tell me: you must know.
#HE.
Well, I was strolling through the woods. I heard a splash
#SHE.
A splash! Oh, don't say any more: I remember! That horrible lake! Horrible! It was so warm at the hotel: I had gone off to the woods. I was sitting at the edge of the lake - on a rock - reading. I must have been sleepy. I fell in.
#HE.
Then you screamed.
#SHE.
Yes: I was drowning! Drowning! I called for help!
#HE.
I heard you.
#SHE.
I sank - I sank, oh, miles and miles! It felt as if hands were trying to pull me down to the bottom! I screamed again - and then - then - I felt a strong arm around my waist - I was dizzy - there was a roaring in my ears - I knew no more.
#HE.
Too bad, too bad.
#SHE.
And you - you were the man who jumped in!
#HE.
I was passing by.
#SHE.
You saved my life! Oh, how can I ever thank you? My hero!
#HE.
That's all right. .
#SHE.
But it's not all right. I can never repay you! Never! Never! Not if I live to be a thousand years old!
#HE.
That's the second time.
#SHE.
The second time?
#HE.
I kissed you before.
#SHE.
Oh! You didn't!
#HE.
Yes, I did.
#SHE.
While I was unconscious?
#HE.
Precisely.
#SHE.
Oh, how could you do such a thing? How could you?
#HE.
It was by request.
#SHE.
I asked you?
#HE.
You said, "Mother! Mother! Kiss me!"
#SHE.
I said that?
#HE.
They were your first words.
#SHE.
But you didn't have to kiss me.
#HE.
No?
#SHE.
You didn't have to!
#HE.
I tried to explain that I was not your mother, but you seemed to know better. You insisted. I couldn't help it.
#SHE.
What do you mean: you couldn't "help it"?
#HE.
You know -
#SHE.
Yes?
#HE.
You're a pretty girl - a deucedly pretty girl.
#SHE.
Oh, no!
#HE.
But you are; honor bright!
#SHE.
You really think so?
#HE.
There was no one around. It was the kind of an opportunity which does not present itself every day: life is so - monotonous. And you didn't seem to object.
#SHE.
I couldn't very well - not while I was unconscious.
#HE.
That's so. I am a man, with a man's tastes. And you begged me so hard - it was so inviting - well, I kissed you.
#SHE.
On the lips?
#HE.
Yes. On the lips.
#SHE.
How often?
#HE.
Eh?
#SHE.
How often did you kiss me?
#HE.
Only once.
#SHE.
Was that all?
#HE.
Why, it's hardly worth mentioning.
#SHE.
Well, I forgive you.
#HE.
Thank you.
#SHE.
Two kisses is not a great deal for saving my life.
#HE.
No?
#SHE.
I owe you much more than that!
#HE.
Really?
#SHE.
Really! Really! You must tell me all about yourself. Just think: if it hadn't been for you, I would be at the bottom of the lake now. What a horrible tragedy that would have been: to die in such a way! . It's natural that I should want to know something about the man who saved me from that. .
#HE.
I don't like to talk about myself -
#SHE.
You're still a young man, aren't you?
#HE.
Thirty - one.
#SHE.
Are you?
#HE.
Last November.
#SHE.
I'm just twenty. Eleven years between us.
#HE.
Just the right ages, aren't we?
#SHE.
Do you think so?
#HE.
Eleven years difference - ideal!
#SHE.
Ten and a half.
#HE.
Eh?
#SHE.
I was born in June.
#HE.
Oh, were you? That's better yet.
#SHE.
Do you think so - Lord Brookfield?
#HE.
Eh?
#SHE.
Lord Brookfield?
#HE.
How on earth did you know it?
#SHE.
Oh, I am not so stupid as all that!
#HE.
You recognized me?
#SHE.
No. I have never seen you. photo?
#SHE.
No.
#HE.
Then how did you know? .
#SHE.
Lord Brookfield is a well - known man. The papers said he was coming to the hotel. I knew every other guest -
#HE.
But three or four others arrived this morning.
#SHE.
Americans.
#HE.
Oh!
#SHE.
You are English. I could see that right away.
#HE.
How clever of you!
#SHE.
Oh, Lord Brookfield!
#HE.
And how curious that I should meet you in this way - informal, so to speak.
#SHE.
Odd, wasn't it? Ugh! - how my clothes are sticking to me!
#HE.
That's so. You had better change.
#SHE.
And you?
#HE.
I'm rather wet myself.
#SHE.
Will you take me back to the hotel?
#HE.
The sun is very hot here.
#SHE.
Oh, would you rather stay?
#HE.
Tell me: can you swim?
#SHE.
Eh?
#HE.
Can you swim?
#SHE.
Lord Brookfield! Of course I can't!
#HE.
That's curious.
#SHE.
Curious?
#HE.
Neither can I.
#SHE.
Oh, but you swam splendidly! Clothes and all! All the way from the other side of the lake!
#HE.
Did I?
#SHE.
Of course you did! One plunge, and a few magnificent overhand strokes. .
#HE.
Plunge?
#SHE.
Why, certainly.
#HE.
I would have sworn I waded.
#SHE.
You are really too modest, Lord Brookfield.
#HE.
Let's see. Of course, I might have swum, but - Ah! the water line comes only as far as the waist!
#SHE.
That means nothing.
#HE.
No? If I had plunged, my hair would have been wet.
#SHE.
It dried in the sun.
#HE.
Ah, yes! But my cigarettes!
#SHE.
The case is waterproof.
#HE.
Still, the matches are wet. You see?
#SHE.
Lord Brookfield, don't deny that you saved my life!
#HE.
That is what I am trying to do.
#SHE.
I beg your pardon?
#HE.
I jumped in without thinking. It was the natural thing to do: I heard you scream for help. But the moment the water came to my waist I knew that if it went any deeper I should have to call for help also.
#SHE.
Well?
#HE.
I was spared that humiliation: the pond isn't over three feet deep in any place. And I waded the whole twenty feet from one end to the other. . And I can't swim.
#SHE.
But I was drowning! Drowning!
#HE.
Are you in the habit of drowning often?
#SHE.
Lord Brookfield!
#HE.
I nearly forgot to mention -
#SHE.
What?
#HE.
That I saw you jump in.
#SHE.
Oh!
#HE.
It was pleasant while it lasted, wasn't it? And romantic! Why, romantic doesn't begin to describe it! "Mother, kiss me!"
#SHE.
Oh, how can you?
#HE.
Unconscious - helpless - and you didn't remember! Not even the shoes. That was clever - very clever! And the hands trying to pull you down to the bottom: that was the touch of genius! Ah, well, I was willing to have a little fun.
#SHE.
You played with me - played with me. Oh, you're disgusting! Revolting! What a thing for a man to do! I thought -
#HE.
Yes?
#SHE.
Nothing. . I thought Lord Brookfield was a gentleman!
#HE.
Oh, but I'm not.
#SHE.
Not a gentleman?
#HE.
No. . I'm not Lord Brookfield.
#SHE.
Not Lord Brookfield?
#HE.
No.
#SHE.
Then who on earth are you?
#HE.
I? I'm a friend of his. friend? close friend - very close.
#SHE.
Who? Who?
#HE.
I'm not related, you know, but I see a lot of him. We're thick - very thick.
#SHE.
Who are you?
#HE.
I'm his valet.
#SHE.
Oh! . And you kissed me! A valet! You dared kiss me!
#HE.
At your request.
#SHE.
But a valet! A valet!
#HE.
I'm a good valet. One of the best there is.
#SHE.
Your insolence! Oh!
#HE.
My handkerchief.
#SHE.
Oh, you coward! You. . You
#HE.
Listen to me.
#SHE.
I won't.
#HE.
Listen to me.
#SHE.
I don't want to talk to you!
#HE.
I'll help you.
#SHE.
I don't want your help.
#HE.
Then you're silly.
#SHE.
How dare you -
#HE.
I'll make a bargain with you.
#SHE.
What dealings can there be between us?
#HE.
Did you hear the whistling a minute ago?
#SHE.
Well?
#HE.
That's Brookfield.
#SHE.
Well?
#HE.
The path leads here. He is following the path -
#SHE.
Well?
#HE.
You and I might be very good friends -
#SHE.
Oh, you mean - valet is not paid very well -
#SHE.
No. . Still -
#SHE.
If anything comes of it -
#SHE.
Comes of what?
#HE.
You understand me. : Your clothes are still wet, aren't they?
#SHE.
Yes -
#HE.
Enough said! Quick!
#SHE.
You won't tell? I'll remember you.
#HE.
Peters!
#PETERS.
M'lord?
#HE.
Give me a light, Peters.
#PETERS.
Yes, m'lord.
#HE.
Thanks. Peters, you're a brave man, aren't you?
#PETERS.
I am 'andy with me fists, m'lord.
#HE.
That's not quite what I mean, Peters. . Peters, you have the making of a hero in you. Something tells me that you're going to have your chance.
#PETERS.
M'lord!
#HE.
Yes, Peters?
#PETERS.
Somebody's calling for 'elp, m'lord!
#HE.
Yes, Peters.
#PETERS.
Shall I go, m'lord?
#HE.
Yes, Peters. . Gallop!
#PETERS.
: H'I'm coming! H'I'm coming!
