#PAMELA.
What is it, Chalmers? Oh!
#CHALMERS.
Telegram, madam.
#PAMELA.
Thank you. Hah! What's that?
#CHALMERS.
Another one, madam.
#PAMELA.
Oh! Yes - all right. Oh - a - Chalmers - I'm expecting three more -
#CHALMERS.
Telegrams, madam?
#PAMELA.
Y - es. Bring them to me directly they arrive.
#CHALMERS.
Very good, madam.
#JOHN GALE.
What a face!
#PAMELA.
Oh! Oh!
#JOHN GALE.
What is it? What is it? What the devil - ? Oh! it's you, Pam. I didn't know you were home. Haven't you been to Folkestone?
#PAMELA.
Of course I have. Mother wasn't well, so we came back yesterday.
#JOHN GALE.
Yesterday? Oh! Oh! oh! Did you sleep at a - at mother's last night? I say, I suppose you slept at your mother's last night.
#PAMELA.
Where did you sleep?
#JOHN GALE.
Where did I sleep?
#PAMELA.
I'm asking you.
#JOHN GALE.
What a funny question to ask anyone! I slept at home - in there - of course . obviously . naturally.
#PAMELA.
Whenever you adopt that innocent attitude I always know you are telling me a wilful lie.
#JOHN GALE.
I couldn't tell you a lie if I tried. Do you remember that phrenologist we went to at Eastbourne? He told me I had an enormous bump of veracity.
#PAMELA.
This is nothing to do with phrenology. Am I to believe that you slept at home last night?
#JOHN GALE.
Y - yes, of course. Why?
#PAMELA.
I slept at home, too. Strange we didn't meet.
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, that is funny.
#PAMELA.
I locked that bedroom door from half - past eleven last night until nine o'clock this morning.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, if you lock the bedroom door, how can you possibly expect me to sleep at home? Absurd! No, I'll tell you the whole facts of the case, Pam. We went to the - er - opera last night.
#PAMELA.
We?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes. My friend Tully and I. Tully had some tickets given him.
#PAMELA.
And you came home together?
#JOHN GALE.
Y - yes. And - er - I slept at Tully's.
#PAMELA.
What opera did you go to?
#JOHN GALE.
The - a - a - the - a - that's rather a silly question. No one ever goes to an opera and remembers anything about the performance.
#PAMELA.
But the name of the opera?
#JOHN GALE.
Oh! - o - h! The name! You mean what the opera was called?
#PAMELA.
Exactly.
#JOHN GALE.
The - er - the title?
#PAMELA.
Yes.
#JOHN GALE.
Well - er - you know the - the opera where the girl comes on with a sewing machine - no, you know what I mean - a spinning wheel; two long plaits - Marguerite - Faust, that's it!
#PAMELA.
Faust?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, Faust - with the devil in it.
#PAMELA.
And so you both went to see Faust?
#JOHN GALE.
After that we came home. I remember making a joke to Tully -
#PAMELA.
Never mind the joke.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, it was just then that I missed my latchkey.
#PAMELA.
You missed your latchkey?
#JOHN GALE.
And it was rather late to rouse Chalmers, so Tully offered me a shakedown at his place, and I stayed there.
#PAMELA.
There's a good deal of Tully about it. But if you lost your latch - key, how did you get in just now?
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, I found the key afterwards.
#PAMELA.
Well, give it to me. Give it to me, please. While I pay the rent of the flat -
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, don't say that. It isn't cricket, Pam, to throw the rent up in my face. After all, it was you who made me give up my office in the city.
#PAMELA.
For the simple reason you were making -
#JOHN GALE.
I was making a profit of five pounds a week!
#PAMELA.
And it was costing me another fifteen pounds to keep the office open. Now look here. I have enough for both, so long as you do not work in the City.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, I can't grub along on five pounds a week like some people.
#PAMELA.
Must I remind you that I have been allowing you forty pounds a month?
#JOHN GALE.
No, excuse me, dear; it was agreed between us that my allowance should be fifteen pounds only.
#PAMELA.
I'm quite aware it was agreed. But you keep borrowing on account. Even now you are two years ahead with your money.
#JOHN GALE.
As much as that?
#PAMELA.
Two years!
#JOHN GALE.
How time flies! But I shall pay it back.
#PAMELA.
But let us keep to the point. About last night -
#JOHN GALE.
For me?
#CHALMERS.
No, sir, for the mistress.
#PAMELA.
Oh - er - Chalmers Will you just knock at the flat next door and ask if Mr. - Tully is at home, and if so, will he kindly look in here for a moment?
#CHALMERS.
Very good, madam.
#JOHN GALE.
Chalmers, Chalmers. You dare not do such a thing!
#PAMELA.
Do as I tell you, Chalmers.
#JOHN GALE.
Chalmers - Cha - Cha - You are not going to show me up before my friends?
#PAMELA.
There will be no showing up, John, if what you say is true.
#JOHN GALE.
No, no, of course not.
#PAMELA.
Besides, I don't suppose your friend Tully would give you away. Men are such cunning brutes.
#JOHN GALE.
Aha! Give me Regent 346, Regent 346 -
#PAMELA.
It's no use your 'phoning Mr. Tully. I should be bound to hear what you said.
#JOHN GALE.
I was only trying to get him to come up, dear.
#PAMELA.
Chalmers is quite capable of taking a message.
#JOHN GALE.
Hang it all, Pam, don't you believe what I've told you.
#PAMELA.
Not - one - word!
#JOHN GALE.
Why not?
#PAMELA.
This morning I sent a reply - paid wire to your friends at Kew.
#JOHN GALE.
Harry Crombeley?
#PAMELA.
Yes - asking if you stopped there last night. This is his reply. Read it. Read it out please.
#JOHN GALE.
"Yes, John stayed here last night." Silly owl!
#PAMELA.
Well?
#JOHN GALE.
Dear old Harry! I expect he thought you would be worrying about me. He's very thoughtful is Harry.
#PAMELA.
Wait! I also sent a wire to your friend Blakiston at Kensington asking the same question. His reply - - read it - read that out, please.
#JOHN GALE.
"Yes, John stayed here last night." Well now, I can tell how this happened.
#PAMELA.
Wait! Don't commit yourself. I sent three other wires to Mr. Marshall, Gus Stanhope and Drayling. They all reply that you stayed with them. Read for yourself!
#JOHN GALE.
I can explain it all, dear! You see they were probably all together, and they thought they would put a spoof up on dear old John. They're all jolly good friends.
#PAMELA.
Yes - they must all be very very good friends, or else they must have a shocking opinion of your habits.
#JOHN GALE.
I can explain everything.
#PAMELA.
I believe you could explain the Tower of London away, but you can't have slept in six different beds in one night, unless you were a sleepwalker.
#JOHN GALE.
I still maintain that I slept last night at Tully's.
#PAMELA.
We shall see.
#CHALMERS.
Mr. Tully, madam.
#JOHN GALE.
I say, Tully - didn't I -
#PAMELA.
How do you do, Mr. Tully?
#TULLY.
How d'ye do, Mrs. Ayers? Morning, John!
#JOHN GALE.
Morning, Tully.
#PAMELA.
Good morning?
#JOHN GALE.
Ah, you see he wasn't up when I left this morning, lazy beggar!
#PAMELA.
I have to apologize, Mr. Tully, for bringing you out -
#TULLY.
Oh, not at all.
#PAMELA.
But we - er - John and I are in a little difficulty, and if you could see your way to answer a few questions, it would be doing us a great favour, and it might save both of us lifelong misery.
#JOHN GALE.
My wife won't believe that I -
#PAMELA.
Will you be quiet! You're breaking down the one slender thread that holds our married life together - I want Mr. Tully's version of last night without your assistance. Now, may I ask, did you have anyone staying with you last night at the flat?
#TULLY.
N - o - not to my knowledge.
#PAMELA.
No one stayed at your place at all?
#TULLY.
Oh - er - John stayed there!
#PAMELA.
But just now you said no one stayed there.
#TULLY.
We - we never count John as anybody.
#JOHN GALE.
No, dear, I'm nobody.
#PAMELA.
Now would you mind telling me how you passed the evening?
#TULLY.
Last night?
#PAMELA.
Last night.
#TULLY.
Well, we - er - let me think. We - er - yes - - we went out.
#PAMELA.
And where did you go, might I ask?
#TULLY.
It's rather difficult to remember off - hand - one night is so very much like another.
#PAMELA.
Try to think.
#TULLY.
I think we must have been in a boat on the Serpentine.
#JOHN GALE.
These are very beautiful flowers, dear. Did these come from Covent Garden?
#PAMELA.
Please don't interrupt.
#TULLY.
Oh, now I remember - it's about last night you want to know?
#PAMELA.
Last night!
#TULLY.
Oh, last night we went to Covent - to - to - to the opera. John had tickets given to him.
#JOHN GALE.
No, no - those tickets were given me to give to you. They were a present from Mr. Baxter.
#TULLY.
Oh, I didn't quite understand. I must write and thank Mr. Baster.
#JOHN GALE.
Baxter! Baxter!!
#TULLY.
Baxter - Baxter -
#PAMELA.
Who is Mr. Baxter?
#JOHN GALE.
Don't you know, dear?
#PAMELA.
Do you?
#JOHN GALE.
Of course - he's Mr. Baster - Baxter.
#PAMELA.
And did you enjoy the opera?
#TULLY.
Not very much. I really prefer the singing down at our chapel.
#PAMELA.
What opera was it?
#TULLY.
I don't think I noticed.
#PAMELA.
Didn't notice!
#JOHN GALE.
Of course not, dear - no decent person ever does - it's bad form.
#PAMELA.
Silence! Haven't you any idea of the name of the opera?
#TULLY.
Not for the moment - er - er - I - er - Daisy - Daisy Daydreams?
#PAMELA.
I can't say I have ever heard of an opera of the name of Daisy Daydreams.
#TULLY.
Was it something to do with - er - something hanging from the back of the head?
#PAMELA.
And you can't remember the name of the opera?
#TULLY.
Not for the moment. Are - you - sure - it wasn't Daisy - or Daisies - or Marguerite - er - Marguerite! - er - er - Faust, of course!
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, dear, Faust, of course!
#JOHN GALE.
Now are you satisfied?
#PAMELA.
And after you left the opera?
#TULLY.
We came home.
#PAMELA.
What induced John to sleep at your place, seeing your door is next to ours?
#TULLY.
Oh, he couldn't find his keyhole.
#JOHN GALE.
No, no, dear! We simply went to the opera and saw Daisy - Faust, I mean - came out - had a drink - I told Tully I couldn't find my key - I suppose he thought I said key - hole - he offered me a shake - down and I stayed there. And I think such a clear explanation ought to satisfy anyone.
#PAMELA.
Yes, I suppose so.
#JOHN GALE.
Then everything is quite in order?
#PAMELA.
Y - y - es, y - y - es, except could either of you explain this?
#JOHN GALE.
That's my coat!
#PAMELA.
No this!
#TULLY.
Oh, that's nothing to do with me.
#JOHN GALE.
What is it, dear? What is it? pearl necklace. I suppose you don't wear pearl necklaces, do you, Mr. Tully?
#TULLY.
No, no!
#JOHN GALE.
I can tell you all about that, dear. I saw that in a shop window and I picked it up very cheaply. I'm sure it's a bargain.
#PAMELA.
And who was it intended for, may I ask?
#JOHN GALE.
Who should I buy pearl necklaces for?
#PAMELA.
For me - for me, I suppose.
#JOHN GALE.
Of course - naturally. Ask Tully!
#PAMELA.
Oh! Oh!
#TULLY.
Oh! I'm all of a tremble!
#JOHN GALE.
You're a boiled - headed owl!
#TULLY.
If you had told me yesterday that you could lie like that I should never have believed you.
#JOHN GALE.
You did your share very well.
#TULLY.
What's going to happen now?
#JOHN GALE.
She'll probably pack up and go home to her mother's.
#TULLY.
John, where did you go last night?
#JOHN GALE.
I took a little friend out to dinner and then we went on to the Palace, and after that we had supper at the Five Hundred Club. We watched them dancing and had a dance or two ourselves, but it's perfectly absurd if a man can't have a little innocent enjoyment and a couple of dances with a little bit of fluff without all this absurd fuss.
#TULLY.
But the hour?
#JOHN GALE.
At the Club we kept it up a bit late, that's all. We had breakfast at Jimmy Dawson's flat and cooked bacon and eggs.
#TULLY.
Won't you promise never to do such a thing again?
#JOHN GALE.
I'll promise never to poach an egg in an opera hat again. I can't possibly live without some relaxation now and then.
#TULLY.
But must you really go out and about with little bits of flu - flu - fluff?
#JOHN GALE.
Most certainly if I want to. What have you got to say to that?
#TULLY.
Oh, dear, dear, dear!
#JOHN GALE.
Everything would have been all right only you were so infernally stupid about the opera. I'm sure "Marguerite and plaits" was perfectly clear. If you had only said "Faust" without any hesitation everything would have been all right.
#TULLY.
But it's so risky. They play a different opera every night at Covent Garden.
#JOHN GALE.
I know they do. I wonder what they did play? Where's the newspaper? Here it is. Now if my luck's in they played "Faust" last night - here we are - theatres - last night - Covent Garden - Pictures!! Here, tear that up and this bit too - get rid of it somehow.
#TULLY.
How do you think you will get out of this?
#JOHN GALE.
Quite easily. Tact and diplomacy. Feel that bump - they say I have a bigger bump of tact than Lloyd George.
#TULLY.
Oh, I say -
#JOHN GALE.
Pam - Pam -
#PAMELA.
I am going home to mother's. You'll hear from her later, and probably the solicitors.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, Pam. I think you're awfully silly, and after I've bought you a pearl necklace too.
#PAMELA.
I doubt very much if the necklace was intended for me.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, Tully, did you hear that? The only woman in the world I have ever loved!
#TULLY.
I don't think you ought to say such things, Mrs. Ayers. Do leave us for a few moments, John - I -
#JOHN GALE.
But, Tully, I -
#TULLY.
I'll put it all right.
#JOHN GALE.
But, Tully. I -
#TULLY.
One moment, Mrs. Ayers. You know I feel somehow that I am to blame for all this. I don't want to pose as a hyper - religious man, but every one says I'm very good, and I wouldn't deceive you for the world. I'm sure that necklace was intended for you.
#PAMELA.
Well, in any case, I value my feelings at something more than a - a - a one - and - elevenpenny pearl necklace.
#TULLY.
Really I think you are doing John an injustice. I don't think you quite understand his little ways.
#PAMELA.
I understand as much as is fit for me to understand.
#TULLY.
No, really, I know John doesn't behave in a conventional manner as a rule, but he is quite harmless.
#PAMELA.
Harmless! Harmless! A man who can sleep in six different beds in one night - harmless!
#TULLY.
Six! Impossible! It would be a record.
#PAMELA.
Read for yourself.
#TULLY.
"John stayed here, Kew." "John stayed here, Bloomsbury." "John stayed, Barnes." Kensington - Bloomsbury to Kew - Kew to Kensington - Kensington to Barnes. It couldn't be done in the time! Oh, I can quite understand this. It's all John's friends - all anxious to shield him from the fury of his wife.
#PAMELA.
I beg your pardon!
#TULLY.
I mean all anxious to shield him from your displeasure. John has such a host of good friends. There isn't one who wouldn't lay down his life for him. Why, John's one of the best in the world.
#PAMELA.
I am quite a broad - minded woman, Mr. Tully. I don't expect men to be angels. But there's a limit to everything.
#TULLY.
I quite agree with you in that, Mrs. Ayers, but as a broad - minded woman you must see that a man like John wants a little relaxation, and there's really no harm if he does go out to dinner occasionally with - what was it he called them? - little pieces - no, little bits of fluff.
#PAMELA.
What? What??? You expect me to sit at home while my husband goes out with little - bits - of - fluff!!!
#TULLY.
Well - you know - it's a term - a joke -
#PAMELA.
I'm surprised, Mr. Tully, that your mission teaching should have put such ideas into your head - as little bits of - fluff! - Good day!
#JOHN GALE.
What are you doing?
#TULLY.
Sweeping up "Covent Garden."
#JOHN GALE.
Has she gone?
#TULLY.
Y - y - es. I'm so sorry, John.
#JOHN GALE.
That's all through your meddling in things that don't concern you.
#TULLY.
Did you really sleep in six different beds?
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, don't be silly.
#TULLY.
Is there any chance of her returning?
#JOHN GALE.
Of course she'll come back! She does this sort of thing about every fortnight.
#TULLY.
Do you sleep out as often as that?
#JOHN GALE.
No! She does it with the idea that I shall go and fetch her back.
#TULLY.
Well, why don't you?
#JOHN GALE.
Because once I do that my authority will be gone. She'll treat me like a child, and leave home two or three times a day. Things have never gone so badly as this before.
#TULLY.
I think the pearl necklace did it, don't you?
#JOHN GALE.
Hah, the necklace! Where is it? Where is it? Have you got it?
#TULLY.
No, no. Why should I have it?
#JOHN GALE.
Then where is it? Where is it? The necklace! Look for it! Don't stand there like an anæmic camel! Look for it!
#TULLY.
Where? Where?
#JOHN GALE.
Everywhere - all over the place. Perhaps it's on the floor - look for it. Ah, it may be under the table. Can't you see where you are going?
#TULLY.
I can only see stars.
#JOHN GALE.
Your head's like iron. But where's the necklace? That's the question.
#TULLY.
I've got it!
#JOHN GALE.
Where?
#TULLY.
No - not the necklace - I've got an idea.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh -
#TULLY.
I expect Mrs. Ayers took it. You practically gave it to her, didn't you?
#JOHN GALE.
You think she took it?
#TULLY.
Yes, I remember now - while I was talking to her just now I saw her drop it into her bag.
#JOHN GALE.
Are you sure?
#TULLY.
It doesn't matter - you can get it back from her.
#JOHN GALE.
She'll never part with it - she loves jewellery.
#TULLY.
Well, you can easily buy another. I'll lend you the one - and - elevenpence.
#JOHN GALE.
One - and - elevenpence! One - and - elevenpence! Do you know that necklace is worth five hundred pounds!!
#TULLY.
Five hundred pounds!!
#JOHN GALE.
Yes. It was lent to little Mamie Scott by the Rajah of Changpoor. She took a fancy to the necklace, and he lent it to her to wear just for the evening. There was a big crush as we came out of the club last night, and Mamie asked me to put the necklace in my pocket for safety's sake, as the clasp was broken, which I did, of course. Apparently we both forgot all about it. She'll be in an awful stew. She promised faithfully to return the necklace to the Rajah to - day.
#TULLY.
Oh, dear, dear, dear!
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, damn, damn, damn! What can I do? What can I say? What will Mamie think of me. Oh, don't footle about with that chair!
#TULLY.
Is there no way of getting it back from Mrs. Ayers.
#JOHN GALE.
I tell you she'll never part with it, and she may not be home for several days, possibly a week. In the meantime the Rajah will be clamouring for his pearls . I shall be branded as a - well, there's no telling what it may lead to. Great Heavens! What a hole to be in!
#TULLY.
Couldn't you tell Miss Fluffie Scott you've lost it and buy her another.
#JOHN GALE.
Didn't you hear me say that necklace cost five hundred pounds?
#TULLY.
Yes, that is awkward.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, do put that chair down!
#TULLY.
Couldn't you borrow the money?
#JOHN GALE.
Don't be a fool.
#TULLY.
It's easy enough. I had a letter from someone only this morning, offering to lend me any sum from £10 to £10,000, without any security. He enclosed his photograph. Such a nice, kind, honest open face.
#JOHN GALE.
You innocent lamb! Well, I suppose if I can't give it back I shall have to find the money.
#TULLY.
You will? Oh, it is a fix!
#JOHN GALE.
I say, Tully, I suppose you don't happen to have five hundred that you don't want.
#TULLY.
Not that I don't want.
#JOHN GALE.
Poor old Tully! You never seem to have any money. I don't know what you live on. Are you sure you get enough to eat?
#TULLY.
You know, John, if I had the money I couldn't refuse you. You do know that, don't you, John?
#JOHN GALE.
Of course I do, dear old Tully! Dear old Tully!
#TULLY.
Why do you always call me by my surname, when I call you John. I do wish you'd call me Bertram. Do you know when anyone calls me Bertram, I feel I could do any mortal thing in the world for them!
#JOHN GALE.
Well, you get me out of this hole and I'll call you Bertram till I bust.
#TULLY.
Will you? I think I know where you could get the money.
#JOHN GALE.
Where? Where?
#TULLY.
Sit down! Keep calm! Dick Turner thinks the world of you. .
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, I know, but he hasn't much money.
#TULLY.
I know, I know. But he was in a 'bus accident last Friday and he's claiming £500 compensation from the Motor 'Bus company.
#JOHN GALE.
He'll never get it.
#TULLY.
Oh, I think he will. In fact it's nearly settled. And if you approach him in the matter, I feel sure he would lend you the £500.
#JOHN GALE.
But I was in that 'bus with him coming from Kew.
#TULLY.
That's right - coming from Kew.
#JOHN GALE.
And if Dick Turner could get five hundred, I'm positive I could.
#TULLY.
Well, I'm sure he's going to get it.
#JOHN GALE.
But there was scarcely any damage done. I didn't receive a scratch, neither did Dick Turner. I was thrown forward on top of a fat old woman sitting opposite.
#TULLY.
Still you can't always tell at the time of the accident - injuries sometimes develop afterwards.
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, of course, especially after you've seen your solicitor.
#TULLY.
Er - I -
#JOHN GALE.
Don't talk to me - my brain's working.
#TULLY.
You know, John, in all cases of 'bus accidents the 'Bus Companies have to pay out according to what the doctors think.
#JOHN GALE.
The question is to make the doctors think. Why should Dick Turner get five hundred, and I get nothing?
#TULLY.
I suppose he was really injured.
#JOHN GALE.
Don't talk, don't talk! I've got the most wonderful brain.
#TULLY.
Have you?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes. Feel that bump!
#TULLY.
Oh! - did you get that under the table?
#JOHN GALE.
No, silly ass, it's a natural bump. It's all so simple. It's wonderful how I get myself out of every difficulty. Now, will you run down to the doctor's for me! The last block of flats, you know?
#TULLY.
Doctor Green?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes! That's it. Ask him to call at once.
#TULLY.
John! You're not going to pretend to the doctor that you are ill?
#JOHN GALE.
Now don't ask any questions.
#TULLY.
Oh no, John! I couldn't do a thing like that. It's not fair - it's not honest.
#JOHN GALE.
Bertram! Bertram!!!
#TULLY.
Oh! John! Oh! John! Oh! John!
#JOHN GALE.
Give me Regent one - four - three - six quickly, Miss, please. . Yes. . Hullo! hullo! are you the Motor Omnibus Company? . Yes, yes. Mrs. John Ayers speaking! Mrs. John Ayers. . Yes . my husband was in that terrible 'bus accident you had last Friday coming from Kew. Yes . my husband! And he's very ill indeed. Yes . eh? Oh! speak up! I can't hear a damned word you're saying. Oh! He didn't notice it at the time. He has witnesses to prove everything. Eh? I can't hear. . Oh, you'll send your inspector round to look into it . eh? You'll send your inspector round to look into it. Oh, very good, but don't send him immediately as the patient is asleep. Eh? . yes, in about half an hour's time . we're quite close to your depot . we're quite close to your depot . number 13 St. Mark's Mansions. Yes - very well - thank you - Good - bye! What is it? What is it? lady to see you, sir.
#JOHN GALE.
To see me! What are you laughing at?
#CHALMERS.
Miss Scott, I think she said.
#JOHN GALE.
Good Lord! Oh - I'm busy - dressing for breakfast - not at home. Wait! I'd better see her. Show her in here.
#CHALMERS.
In there, sir?
#JOHN GALE.
No. Here! Here!
#MAMIE.
Hullo, Jack!
#JOHN GALE.
Hullo, you dear little thing! But you mustn't come here - really.
#MAMIE.
Why not? I thought you said the cat was away at Folkestone?
#JOHN GALE.
And please don't call my wife a cat.
#MAMIE.
Oh, I beg the cat's pardon. Say Jack, whose picture's this?
#JOHN GALE.
Which one?
#MAMIE.
This one, here, by the telephone!
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, that is my wife.
#MAMIE.
Your wife? Some girl! She's not the sort of first wife I'd pick out if I was going to be your second.
#JOHN GALE.
Why not?
#MAMIE.
Looks too darned healthy - I'd have to wait too long for you.
#JOHN GALE.
She's come home unexpectedly.
#MAMIE.
Jack!
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, it's all right. She's out just now.
#MAMIE.
Phew! You did give me a fright!
#JOHN GALE.
But it's true - she is home, all the same.
#MAMIE.
Well, come out here and talk to me. I won't keep you long.
#JOHN GALE.
I can't - I'm only half dressed.
#MAMIE.
Well, I'll come in there.
#JOHN GALE.
No, no, this is a bedroom.
#MAMIE.
I'm not afraid of bedrooms!
#JOHN GALE.
Give me a minute - just a minute!
#MAMIE.
Come out as you are. I'm not particular.
#JOHN GALE.
I won't be two ticks.
#MAMIE.
Right - o! I say, Jack! Do you know that you didn't give me back the necklace last night! I say, Jacko! do - you - know - you didn't give - me - back that necklace - last night?
#JOHN GALE.
I say, Mamie, that hat does suit you! You look awfully sweet!
#MAMIE.
You go on, Jack. You're the champion long - distance kidder in the universe.
#JOHN GALE.
But I mean it. It suits you awfully.
#MAMIE.
Oh, awfully! Do you know you didn't give me back the necklace last night - you know - the pearl necklace?
#JOHN GALE.
No, er - I know I didn't. We both forgot all about it, didn't we?
#MAMIE.
We did.
#JOHN GALE.
I left it in my coat, and I left the coat at the club.
#MAMIE.
Jack. It isn't lost?
#JOHN GALE.
Sit down. Sit down and don't worry. It can't be lost. If it is, I'll buy you another, that's all.
#MAMIE.
Five - hundred - pounds!
#JOHN GALE.
Yes. I can't forget that! But it's a mere flea - bite to me.
#MAMIE.
Jack, you don't understand, the Rajah looks on it as an heirloom - he wouldn't part with it for the world - that's why I wanted to wear it - it was such a cute idea. But I promised faithfully to return it to the Rajah to - day.
#JOHN GALE.
Can't you make some excuse?
#MAMIE.
How can I? Have you been to the Club?
#JOHN GALE.
No, I can't possibly go down there for a day or two - for a particular reason.
#MAMIE.
Oh, I do hope it isn't lost. Can't you 'phone?
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, yes. I did 'phone, but the club 'phone seems to be out of order.
#MAMIE.
That's torn it! What will the Rajah think of me!
#JOHN GALE.
Now don't worry. If you'll only wait everything will be all right. In any case if it is lost, I'll buy you another exactly like it. I can't say more, can I?
#MAMIE.
You really mean that?
#JOHN GALE.
Of course I do - I never break my word. I'm even going to get some money to - day - out of accidents - I mean, in case of accidents. Now, listen! I'm awfully glad you've called. My wife's left me!
#MAMIE.
Jack - darling!
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, but only for a little while - and I want you to do me a favour.
#MAMIE.
Of course I will, Jack.
#JOHN GALE.
I'm expecting a man here presently to examine me.
#MAMIE.
To examine you?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, I'm very ill, you know - I was in a 'bus accident the other day, and - er - things have been getting worse.
#MAMIE.
Poor old Jack! I am sorry. But you don't look ill.
#JOHN GALE.
No, I'm one of those who bear up to the last! Now, listen, when this man calls I want you to pretend that I'm bad. Of course I am bad, but while he's here I am sure to be a little worse. Mrs. Ayers - that is me - has been speaking to him on the 'phone and naturally when he comes he'll expect to see me - that is - Mrs. Ayers - I - I see, you don't understand.
#MAMIE.
Jack, dear, you haven't injured your head, have you?
#JOHN GALE.
No, it's quite all right. Nothing to do, but - er - don't say you're my wife. Just pat me on the head now and then and moan "Poor John" - you understand? .
#MAMIE.
Yes, I understand. "Poor John." But say, this is spoof, you're not really ill, Jack, are you?
#JOHN GALE.
Of course not - oh, yes, I am - but don't worry, I'm going to get better. Just "poor John!" Lay it on thick!
#MAMIE.
I see - "Poor John."
#TULLY.
It's all right, John -
#JOHN GALE.
Excuse me a moment.
#TULLY.
Doctor Green was out, but they'll send him round directly he comes back. He's out on a case - about a poor little woman - a poor little woman - who . both - both doing well.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, that's more than we can say. Now I must go and finish dressing, or rather undressing. Oh, let me introduce you to little Mamie Scott.
#TULLY.
Is she - is she - fast!
#JOHN GALE.
Fast?
#TULLY.
Is she a hussy?
#JOHN GALE.
You'll like her immensely, come on.
#TULLY.
No, no! I couldn't. I've never spoken to anyone like that in my life.
#JOHN GALE.
Don't be a fool.
#TULLY.
Oh, no, no! What would they think of me down at the Mission - besides I wouldn't know what to say to her.
#JOHN GALE.
Why not?
#TULLY.
I've never met a fluff.
#JOHN GALE.
You do get hold of the most extraordinary expressions. Mamie! Let me introduce you to a very old chum of mine. Mr. Bertram Tully - Miss Mamie Scott.
#MAMIE.
Oh, what a beautiful boy!
#JOHN GALE.
Talk to him, Mamie. He has a wonderful flow of conversation. I shan't be long.
#TULLY.
Do you ever go - er - go - go - No! Would you like to - to - to - No! It's - it's wonderful how the fine weather lasts!
#MAMIE.
Ripping, isn't it?
#TULLY.
Yes, isn't it?
#MAMIE.
Are you married?
#TULLY.
No, I regret to say. bit of luck in store for some one.
#TULLY.
Oh, thank you!
#MAMIE.
I expect you have a gay old time.
#TULLY.
No, not so very gay. .
#MAMIE.
I know - you're a fly - by - night.
#TULLY.
No, I assure you all my people are most respectable.
#MAMIE.
Well then, you're a dark horse.
#TULLY.
A dark - horse?
#MAMIE.
You know, one of those outsiders who comes up with a rush on the rails at the last minute, and wins by a short head. Do you get me?
#TULLY.
I don't quite understand what you mean.
#MAMIE.
I mean you can go the pace when you like.
#TULLY.
No, I don't go. . No, I don't go at all!
#MAMIE.
What do you do to amuse yourself?
#TULLY.
I go to chapel on Wednesdays and Saturdays and I attend the Mission on Tuesdays and Fridays.
#MAMIE.
Did they teach you that ragtime down at the Mission? I like your drunken step - I must get hold of that!
#TULLY.
John! John!
#JOHN GALE.
What is it? What is it?
#TULLY.
I'm being tempted!
#JOHN GALE.
Well, stick it! Don't be a fool!
#MAMIE.
Now tell me, what's this Mission for?
#TULLY.
It's for the poor people. We give them musical evenings to keep them out of the public - houses. I play the flute.
#MAMIE.
You do what?
#TULLY.
I play the flute.
#MAMIE.
Oh, help!
#TULLY.
Oh, they like it!
#MAMIE.
I wonder what that is? Jack! Jack! There's a ring at the bell - do you think it can be the cat?
#TULLY.
A cat wouldn't ring the bell surely.
#JOHN GALE.
She couldn't possibly be here yet awhile whatever happened. And please don't call my wife a cat!
#MAMIE.
I'm sorry.
#JOHN GALE.
Good! Show him in at once. It's Mr. Nixon Trippett!
#MAMIE.
Mr. How Much?
#JOHN GALE.
Mr. Nixon Trippett - the Inspector from the Motor 'Bus Company - the man I told you about who's going to examine me. Sit down, and ask him to wait. Say I shan't be long.
#TULLY.
What have we got to do?
#JOHN GALE.
Mamie will tell you all about it.
#MAMIE.
Now, listen here, Bertie Brighteyes.
#TULLY.
Oh, stop it!
#MAMIE.
All we've got to do is to keep on saying "Poor John!"
#TULLY.
Poor John!
#MAMIE.
I'm to pretend I'm John's wife.
#TULLY.
Poor John!
#MAMIE.
What do you mean?
#TULLY.
Poor John! I mean Mr. Ayers won't be a minute. Will you take a seat.
#TRIPPETT.
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
#TRIPPETT.
Er - Mr. Ayers - are you the injured person?
#JOHN GALE.
Oh - oh - oh oh!!
#TRIPPETT.
Might I ask if you are the injured person?
#JOHN GALE.
Don't I look like it. Do you think I'm doing this to be funny?
#MAMIE.
P - o - or John!
#TULLY.
Poor John!
#TRIPPETT.
Do you think it would be advisable for me to call another day?
#JOHN GALE.
No, it's all right, I can stick it.
#MAMIE.
He's awfully brave, you know.
#TRIPPETT.
You ought to have kept in bed. It would have been better if I hadn't let you know I was coming.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh no, it wouldn't.
#MAMIE.
Poor John!
#TULLY.
Poor John!
#TRIPPETT.
Well now, may I ask a few questions that will help me to make out my report?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, ask as many as you like. Bring that table over for Mr. Stickson Triplets.
#TRIPPETT.
Not Stickson Triplets! Nixon Trippett!
#JOHN GALE.
I beg your pardon.
#TRIPPETT.
Now then, Mr. - John Ayers, isn't it?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, John Ayers. Oh, my back! Oh!
#MAMIE.
Poor John!
#TULLY.
Poor John!
#TRIPPETT.
Tell me, Mr. Ayers, are you married?
#JOHN GALE.
Of course! Yes, of course!
#TRIPPETT.
Any - family?
#MAMIE.
Yes.
#JOHN GALE.
No!!
#TRIPPETT.
Yes and no. What is your height?
#JOHN GALE.
Four feet four and a bit.
#TRIPPETT.
Age?
#JOHN GALE.
Forty - two.
#TRIPPETT.
Chest measurement?
#JOHN GALE.
Forty - two, too.
#TRIPPETT.
Ever been vaccinated?
#JOHN GALE.
Well, my godfather was Mr. Tully and my godmother was -
#TRIPPETT.
I said vaccinated -
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, I beg -
#TULLY.
Oh no, he never catches anything!
#TRIPPETT.
Now, Mr. Ayers, you say you were travelling in one of the company's 'buses when this accident took place.
#JOHN GALE.
Of course I was - last Friday - coming from Kew. Oh!
#MAMIE.
Poor John!
#TULLY.
Poor John!
#JOHN GALE.
I'm afraid you won't have me with you much longer, darling!
#MAMIE.
A - a - h! O - w - h!
#TULLY.
It's hard to see him struck down like this!
#TRIPPETT.
Could you tell me who was inside the 'bus, or describe the people in any way?
#JOHN GALE.
There was a Mr. Richard Turner -
#TRIPPETT.
Yes, we have acknowledged his claim. A cheque for five hundred was sent him this morning.
#JOHN GALE.
What!!! Oh, it's only a spasm, that's all, oh, I am bad!
#TRIPPETT.
Could you describe anyone else who was in the 'bus?
#JOHN GALE.
There were two soldiers in khaki and a very fat old woman.
#TRIPPETT.
Did these people make any statement or pass any remark?
#JOHN GALE.
When the collision occurred some one said it was like being out at the front.
#TRIPPETT.
The stout lady said that.
#JOHN GALE.
No, Mr. Trippett. The soldier!
#MAMIE.
Poor John!
#TULLY.
Poor John!
#TRIPPETT.
Now may I ask - why didn't you report this at the time?
#JOHN GALE.
How could I? I was too stunned, I suppose.
#TRIPPETT.
I quite appreciate what you say, Mr. Ayers, but it's one of our rules that you should have lodged your complaint at the time the accident occurred.
#JOHN GALE.
I suppose if a man was killed stone dead, he ought to leave his name and address.
#TRIPPETT.
If he knew where he was going. But in this case the situation is rather difficult. The Mr. Turner you mentioned just now informed us that he was the only passenger injured in the accident and the other occupants of the 'bus rather bear out his statement.
#JOHN GALE.
How does he know? He couldn't see my back!
#TRIPPETT.
You see, you have no witnesses.
#JOHN GALE.
No witnesses indeed! Oh yes, I have. Don't you run away with any idea like that. My friend Tully here was sitting next to me in the 'bus the whole of the time!
#TRIPPETT.
Oh, indeed - indeed!
#TULLY.
But I make no claim! Indeed I don't. No. I make no claim! I make no claim at all!
#TRIPPETT.
I don't think I have your name and address?
#TULLY.
Mr. Bertram Josiah Tully. Number 14 Saint Mark's Mansions.
#TRIPPETT.
And you yourself were not injured?
#TULLY.
Not at present - I mean, not a scratch!
#MAMIE.
Poor John!
#TULLY.
Poor John!
#TRIPPETT.
How do you account for that, if he was sitting next to you, Mr. Ayers?
#JOHN GALE.
When the collision came I fell forward on the two soldiers - they had been in training for months and were as hard as nails, and naturally I sprained my back, while Mr. Tully here shot forward right on top of the fat old woman!
#TRIPPETT.
And not hurt?
#JOHN GALE.
She was enormously fat!
#TRIPPETT.
And did you pass any comment at the time?
#JOHN GALE.
No, but the woman did!
#TULLY.
I think I said, "Oh, dear, dear, dear!"
#JOHN GALE.
Of course I shall have to take proceedings against your company if it costs me every penny my wife's got. I mean, that I've got!
#TRIPPETT.
I don't think that will be necessary, Mr. Ayers, our company is a very generous one, and although we cannot acknowledge any legal obligation we like to treat our passengers as fairly as we can -
#JOHN GALE.
I'm sure you do.
#TRIPPETT.
We like to make friends -
#JOHN GALE.
You have a friendly face, Mr. Trippett.
#TRIPPETT.
We want to see you riding in our 'buses again.
#JOHN GALE.
Mind you, I like your 'buses.
#TULLY.
They're such a pretty colour.
#TRIPPETT.
And if this matter could be settled at once, I'm sure you would be most satisfied.
#JOHN GALE.
I'm sure I should.
#TRIPPETT.
Now speaking without prejudice, what sum of money do you fancy would compensate you?
#JOHN GALE.
What do you think, dear? You see, there'll be all the doctor's expenses, a terrible loss of time and money - probably funeral expenses -
#MAMIE.
Ah - a - a - h.
#TULLY.
Ah - a - a - h.
#MAMIE.
I can't bear it!
#JOHN GALE.
Suppose we say five hundred - without prejudice, as you say.
#TRIPPETT.
I'm afraid that's quite out of the question. Do you realize what five hundred means? I'm afraid we couldn't entertain anything like that. But I'll tell you what I will do. If you like to settle the matter off - hand now and give me your signature. I'll pay down at once, the sum of - five pounds.
#JOHN GALE.
Don't be absurd! five - pound Bank of England note, Mr. Ayers; you could go away for a nice little holiday on a five - pun' note.
#JOHN GALE.
Really I think you've come here to insult me.
#TRIPPETT.
Certainly not, Mr. Ayers - and without prejudice I think you would be well advised to accept my offer.
#JOHN GALE.
And without prejudice I think you're a silly ass!
#MAMIE.
Don't upset yourself, John.
#JOHN GALE.
Why doesn't he offer me a bag of nuts or a balloon!!
#TRIPPETT.
I'm sorry you look at things in that light, Mr. Ayers. All I can do is to hand in my report. The company's doctor will come and examine you, and the matter will be out of my hands. I wish you good - day, sir, and I hope you'll soon get better.
#JOHN GALE.
I don't think I shall - £5 for a broken back!
#TULLY.
It's all right, John - Mrs. Ayers has come back.
#JOHN GALE.
What!!
#MAMIE.
Your wife, Jack! Hide me!
#JOHN GALE.
No, that way! Hide her, Tully. Quick behind those curtains and take those things away.
#PAMELA.
John! John! I didn't expect to find you like this.
#JOHN GALE.
And I didn't expect to see you back quite so soon.
#PAMELA.
I've come to say I'm sorry. Mother has seen that necklace you gave me - and she says it's worth five hundred pounds -
#JOHN GALE.
Mother knows!
#PAMELA.
But it is valuable.
#JOHN GALE.
Of course it is. Instead of spending my money on riotous living I've been spending it on you.
#PAMELA.
How good of you! But do tell me, what has happened?
#JOHN GALE.
Don't be alarmed. You know I was in a 'bus accident the other day?
#PAMELA.
You were not hurt.
#JOHN GALE.
Things have developed since. I think they are going to compensate me.
#PAMELA.
Then, you are not really ill?
#JOHN GALE.
That depends - I am going into that bedroom , and I'm not coming out until that 'bus company gives me five hundred pounds, not if I've got to lie there for a month!
#PAMELA.
Oh, don't say that, John!
#JOHN GALE.
I know what I'm doing - I'll teach them to offer me a balloon - I mean a five - pound nut - no, not nut - note. Now please go and get the bed ready.
#PAMELA.
But John - ?
#JOHN GALE.
Do go - to oblige me - I'm expecting the doctor here at any minute. Quick - quick as you can -
#PAMELA.
But, John, it may be weeks and weeks before these people pay out the money -
#JOHN GALE.
Now, do please, do as I ask you, if the doctor finds me out of bed, it'll ruin me.
#PAMELA.
Oh, very well!
#JOHN GALE.
Go on! Hurry up! Hurry up!
#PAMELA.
But, John, it's just occurred to me -
#JOHN GALE.
Oh - er - I don't think you have met before.
#PAMELA.
I - don't - think - we - have.
#JOHN GALE.
Let me introduce you. This is my wife , and this is - this is - this is Mrs. Tully!
#TULLY.
What!!
#PAMELA.
Mrs. - Tully?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, he was married secretly a week ago.
#TULLY.
Oh - I say!!
#JOHN GALE.
I'm sorry to let the cat out of the bag, old man, but it can't be helped!
#TULLY.
John! John!
#JOHN GALE.
Bertram! Bertram!!
#TULLY.
Oh, John! John!!
#PAMELA.
I must say I think it is very good of you, Mr. Tully.
#TULLY.
Beg pardon, Mrs. Ayers.
#PAMELA.
I say it's very good of you to come and sit with John as you do.
#TULLY.
Oh, not at all, Mrs. Ayers. It's a pleasure. John's one of the best, in the world.
#JOHN GALE.
No, that's not your card. Oh, yes it is.
#TULLY.
But he's a dirty cheat.
#JOHN GALE.
Heaven helps those who help themselves.
#TULLY.
No, John, we're here to help others.
#JOHN GALE.
Then what are the others here for?
#TULLY.
To help the others, I suppose.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, I'll go two.
#TULLY.
Now, Mrs. Ayers, didn't we stipulate that there were to be no two's? At two - handed nap you can't call less than three surely.
#PAMELA.
Now don't quarrel, there's good children.
#JOHN GALE.
Tully's a bad loser.
#TULLY.
I'm not. You're a bad player. How can we possibly call two's - it's no game at all.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, I go - three!
#TULLY.
Very good, I pass three.
#JOHN GALE.
Play to that. I'll give you "two's." That's one.
#TULLY.
Trump! Aha!
#JOHN GALE.
I'm not afraid of that.
#TULLY.
You won't get this.
#JOHN GALE.
Thank you.
#TULLY.
That's another one up against you.
#JOHN GALE.
Got it! Got it! Got it!
#TULLY.
Nothing could touch a hand like that.
#JOHN GALE.
You get the cards, Tully, but you don't know how to play them.
#PAMELA.
Oh, I think Mr. Tully plays a very excellent game. Now just a moment.
#JOHN GALE.
Where are you going?
#PAMELA.
I just want to run round and see how mother is. I'll leave John in your care, Mr. Tully.
#TULLY.
Certainly, Mrs. Ayers.
#PAMELA.
Would you mind answering the door?
#JOHN GALE.
Answering the door? Of course he will. What's he here for?
#PAMELA.
We sent the maids away a week ago, they talk so.
#JOHN GALE.
Cook said she knew positively there was nothing the matter with me at all.
#PAMELA.
So I've given them a holiday.
#TULLY.
Much the wisest thing to do.
#PAMELA.
If the inspector or the doctor from the 'bus company calls, just ask him in and say I shall not be long. And you, John -
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, I shall get into bed like a flash of lightning.
#PAMELA.
I don't suppose they'll come.
#JOHN GALE.
Do you think it's wise to wear that necklace on these dark nights. You might have it stolen.
#PAMELA.
Ah! I've been waiting for you to notice it.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, it's running a risk. I should leave it at home if I were you.
#PAMELA.
Does it look valuable to you?
#JOHN GALE.
Of course it does.
#PAMELA.
Well, it isn't - this is only imitation.
#TULLY.
Oh, it looks just the same to me.
#PAMELA.
Mother had the real one copied for thirty shillings, she was so afraid I should lose it.
#TULLY.
That's very thoughtful.
#JOHN GALE.
Mother does know.
#PAMELA.
But it looks genuine, doesn't it?
#JOHN GALE.
It looks jolly good. What have you done with the real one?
#PAMELA.
Ah! that's telling! I'm never going to part with that as long as I live. Shall I give your love to mother?
#JOHN GALE.
No!
#PAMELA.
John!
#JOHN GALE.
I mean yes. Yes, if you like. That's the fourteenth love I've sent to mother this week. I don't mind telling you, Tully, I'm more than sick of this business. I've been shut up now for nearly a fortnight.
#TULLY.
But the doctor from the 'bus company ought to have called on you long ago.
#JOHN GALE.
He did call - last Friday week, and I happened to be out. Just my luck. Pam saw him and made some excuse, and he said he'd call again. But he hasn't been near the place since.
#TULLY.
Their idea is of course to tire you out.
#JOHN GALE.
And we've got to be careful. Did you read about Dick Turner?
#TULLY.
He got his five hundred pounds out of them, didn't he?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes. But do you know the latest? They're going to have him up for fraud.
#TULLY.
Oh, dear! dear! dear! What does Mrs. Ayers say about it?
#JOHN GALE.
The Turner case has rather upset her. She's terribly afraid of the law. If you mention the word she has a panic.
#TULLY.
So you see, good people are the happiest after all.
#JOHN GALE.
But they don't always look it. Let me see now, it's my call, isn't it?
#TULLY.
No, John, you called last time.
#JOHN GALE.
So I did. You're quite right.
#TULLY.
I'm going nap!
#JOHN GALE.
You're - going - nap?
#TULLY.
Yes!
#JOHN GALE.
Hark! It's the doctor - the doctor from the 'bus company.
#TULLY.
There's nobody there. Desist! Desist! There's nobody at the door - not a sign of anyone.
#JOHN GALE.
Really, are you sure?
#TULLY.
Quite sure.
#JOHN GALE.
All right! Deal again. Deal again.
#TULLY.
It's a very funny thing, John, but every time I call nap you imagine you hear the doctor coming. Coincidence, I suppose.
#JOHN GALE.
What's the matter with you, Tully? Have you ever been in love?
#TULLY.
I was nearly caught once.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, what was her name?
#TULLY.
Agnes. She made a vow that if she ever met a really good man she would love him though he be as ugly as sin.
#JOHN GALE.
And she loved you?
#TULLY.
Devotedly.
#JOHN GALE.
Why didn't you marry the girl?
#TULLY.
She was so expensive.
#JOHN GALE.
They all are. I don't believe woman was the rib of man I believe she was the expendix - I mean the appendix - no use to anybody.
#TULLY.
That's what makes me so timid. I'm so afraid that one of these days some woman will get me into a corner and make me do something thoughtless.
#JOHN GALE.
I shouldn't worry about that if I were you. Let me see, it's my call, isn't it?
#TULLY.
Yes.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, I pass!
#TULLY.
You pass? Well - I - I - you can't hear the doctor coming, can you?
#JOHN GALE.
N - o.
#TULLY.
Well, I'm going - nap!!
#JOHN GALE.
What again?
#TULLY.
You haven't given me a chance yet!
#JOHN GALE.
I have an idea.
#TULLY.
No, no, play this hand first; I've called nap.
#JOHN GALE.
No, it's not there.
#TULLY.
What are you looking for?
#JOHN GALE.
The - real necklace!
#TULLY.
She wouldn't leave it about like that.
#JOHN GALE.
You don't know - she might. The doctor! The doctor!
#TULLY.
It isn't - it isn't the doctor. It's the postman. It's the postman. I know his knock.
#JOHN GALE.
Yes! You're right. There's a letter in the box.
#TULLY.
I told you it was only the postman. Do come and play this nap out. I've got such beautiful cards!
#JOHN GALE.
Hang your nap - this is serious. It's from little Mamie Scott.
#TULLY.
Mamie Scott? Who's she?
#JOHN GALE.
You know - your wife!
#TULLY.
Oh, don't start that again, please!
#JOHN GALE.
"The Rajah declines to wait any longer for his necklace and threatens to place the matter in the hands of the police."
#TULLY.
Oh, dear! dear! dear!
#JOHN GALE.
You'd better go and tell her the necklace is having its clasp repaired and is coming back from the jeweller's to - morrow.
#TULLY.
Is it?
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, do have a little common sense. I think I know where to find her. Put on your hat and go round to the Five Hundred Club.
#TULLY.
Is that a ladies' club?
#JOHN GALE.
No - er - mixed.
#TULLY.
No, I couldn't do that - really.
#JOHN GALE.
Why not?
#TULLY.
I never believed in mixed schools or mixed bathing, and I'm certainly not going to a mixed club at my time of life.
#JOHN GALE.
All you've got to do is to ask for Miss Mamie Scott.
#TULLY.
No, no. I've never been to such a place as the Five Hundred Club in my life.
#JOHN GALE.
Take your Cheque Book with you. They'll make you very welcome. great deal too welcome, I expect. No, I couldn't do it. Why don't you go?
#JOHN GALE.
How can I? I'm ill in bed. It's a hundred to one if I put my foot on the doorstep I should run into the arms of the doctor, Pamela and the whole 'bus company. Ruin, divorce and fraud await me on the doorstep.
#TULLY.
Well, I'm not going.
#JOHN GALE.
Don't forget you're in this as well as me; if that necklace is lost you're a party to it.
#TULLY.
Oh, don't say that.
#JOHN GALE.
You've acknowledged that little woman as your wife. She's not the sort to be played with.
#TULLY.
Oh, don't talk like that.
#JOHN GALE.
But I do talk like that.
#TULLY.
Here - take my key - step over the balcony - get through my window and go out through my flat and come back the same way.
#JOHN GALE.
Along the balcony and through your flat! They wouldn't see me then. I could do it in twenty minutes in a taxi, couldn't I?
#TULLY.
Easily!
#JOHN GALE.
Top - hole - that's splendid!
#TULLY.
There isn't a soul at home - the maid's out. I say, you'll play this nap out when you come back?
#JOHN GALE.
What say?
#TULLY.
You'll play this nap out when you come back?
#JOHN GALE.
Oh yes!
#TULLY.
I'll leave the cards just as they are.
#JOHN GALE.
Right - o!
#TULLY.
I won't look at your hand.
#JOHN GALE.
All right!
#TULLY.
Do you know this is the fourth nap I've been done out of?
#JOHN GALE.
Bad luck!
#TULLY.
How long will you be?
#JOHN GALE.
About twenty minutes, I should say.
#TULLY.
Somehow I don't quite like being left here alone.
#JOHN GALE.
Why not?
#TULLY.
I have a presentiment of impending disaster.
#JOHN GALE.
Say it again!
#TULLY.
I have an impediment of presenting disaster.
#JOHN GALE.
You do get hold of the most absurd expressions! Now, all we've got to do is to keep Mamie quiet until we get this money and then everything will be O.K. I'll be as quick as I can. Which way do I go?
#TULLY.
Just step over the balcony. The second window to the right. Mind the geraniums, just step over them and don't be seen.
#JOHN GALE.
They'll take me for a creeper, won't they?
#PAMELA.
John! John! The doctor - the doctor. John! The doctor from the Motor 'Bus Company is coming - John. John, John! Where are you! Oh, Mr. Tully, where's John?
#TULLY.
I couldn't say at the moment.
#PAMELA.
John! Is he in the house? Oh, please don't stand there yawning!
#TULLY.
I'm not yawning. I'm trying to say something.
#PAMELA.
Where - is - John?
#TULLY.
He's out.
#PAMELA.
Out! Impossible! Are you sure?
#TULLY.
Q - q - quite sure.
#PAMELA.
Where has he gone?
#TULLY.
He's gone to - five hundred clubs -
#PAMELA.
Great Heavens! And we've waited for this day!
#TULLY.
We? We've waited for this day?
#PAMELA.
Mr. Tully, you and I are the only people in this house.
#TULLY.
Oh, don't say that - don't say that?
#PAMELA.
We cannot miss this opportunity!
#TULLY.
Opportunity? Can't we? Oh, don't say that! Don't say that!
#PAMELA.
But I do say it. And you can't have an atom of pluck unless you do as I ask.
#TULLY.
Really, this is most embarrassing.
#PAMELA.
I want you to get into pyjamas as quickly as you can.
#TULLY.
Get into pyjamas! I've never been asked to do such a thing in my life! Not for all the gold in the Bank of England, Mrs. Ayers.
#PAMELA.
Yes, yes, please. For my sake! dear Mr. Tully
#TULLY.
Not for any woman breathing. Your endearments are wasted on me. Oh, I knew this would happen one day. I knew some woman would get me into a corner.
#PAMELA.
I only want you to take John's place.
#TULLY.
Hoh! Hoh!
#PAMELA.
Please - please - just for a little time while John is out.
#TULLY.
But it's right against my principles.
#PAMELA.
It's our only chance. He may be back here at any moment. You'll have to do this for me really, Mr. Tully.
#TULLY.
I'll never do it unless you use force - and a woman can't force a man to get into pyjamas. It isn't legal! If you come any nearer I'll shriek from the window!
#PAMELA.
There is the doctor! I knew it! Now what on earth are we going to do
#TULLY.
The doctor??
#PAMELA.
Yes, the doctor!
#TULLY.
The doctor??? Oh - the doctor! Why didn't you make your meaning clear just now?
#PAMELA.
What did you think I meant? What did you think I meant?
#TULLY.
Well, what you said.
#PAMELA.
That man is out there on the doorstep now, and - and there's no John. A doctor and no patient! And we swore he was unable to leave his bed.
#TULLY.
Oh, dear, dear, dear! Perhaps if we keep quite quiet he'll go away.
#PAMELA.
No, he knows we must be in the house. Mr. Tully, this doctor has never even seen John - doesn't know him from Adam.
#TULLY.
I won't impersonate Adam!
#PAMELA.
Would it be asking too much of you to let him think that you - are - my husband?
#TULLY.
Well, if you put it like that, and you think I could, I'll do my best.
#PAMELA.
Very well, go and get into bed.
#TULLY.
Oh no, I couldn't get into bed. I can't bear people to see me in bed. What about the chair? The inspector saw John when he was sitting up. Why couldn't he see me in the chair?
#PAMELA.
Oh, very well. Be as quick as you can. I'll keep the doctor talking. Groan - groan when you're ready. Get into John's pyjamas. I'd do the same for you!
#TULLY.
Oh! O - oh!
#PAMELA.
I've told him you're not awake. Pretend to be asleep. Oh, come in, doctor. This is our patient, doctor.
#DR. BEVAN.
Ahem! Wouldn't he be better in bed?
#PAMELA.
That is what I try to impress on him, but he says he feels the pain less sitting up. And you can't persuade him; his mind seems thoroughly unhinged since the accident. pity to wake him, don't you think? This is the best sleep he's had for weeks.
#DR. BEVAN.
I understood he was quite a small man.
#PAMELA.
Yes, he was. But he seems to have grown considerably since the accident. Oh, don't wake him, please doctor.
#DR. BEVAN.
Oh, I shan't wake him. Don't worry! Any throat trouble.
#PAMELA.
No - I - er - he hasn't complained of any.
#DR. BEVAN.
Keeps you awake at night a good deal, I dare say?
#PAMELA.
Oh! yes. He - does.
#DR. BEVAN.
By the way, has Mr. Trippett, the inspector of claims for our company - has he been here to - day?
#PAMELA.
No - no, doctor - not to my knowledge.
#DR. BEVAN.
I was wondering, that's all. He said he would meet me here to discuss the case.
#PAMELA.
No, I don't think he's called.
#DR. BEVAN.
Ah, probably he'll come later. This matter has been hanging on too long, you know. It ought to have been settled up days ago.
#PAMELA.
Yes, I quite - quite agree.
#DR. BEVAN.
Well, I have another call to pay - close by here. I'll look back a little later on. Perhaps he'll be awake then.
#PAMELA.
Thank you, doctor.
#DR. BEVAN.
Allow me. Oh, I'm forgetting my bag
#PAMELA.
The weather keeps warm - doe - doe - doesn't it - d - d - doctor?
#DR. BEVAN.
It d - d - does - indeed.
#JOHN GALE.
Who told you to do this?
#TULLY.
That's the doctor from the 'Bus Company.
#JOHN GALE.
And those are my new pyjamas.
#TULLY.
I know - I know - er -
#PAMELA.
Oh, there you are, John!
#JOHN GALE.
Who, who is responsible for this absurd jumble? And who does the doctor think that is?
#PAMELA.
Why you! You, of course. There was no one else here when the doctor came, and some one had to be ill in bed.
#JOHN GALE.
But not in a - chair! I know this game backwards. If you can get five hundred in bed, you can't get fifty in a chair. You've mucked up the whole show!
#TULLY.
I'm quite sure I didn't want to do it.
#JOHN GALE.
And it's not very flattering to me if he goes out and about and becomes known as John Ayers.
#TULLY.
I simply did it to oblige your wife.
#JOHN GALE.
If you are in the habit of getting into those things simply to oblige ladies, you'll soon find yourself in the Divorce Court.
#TULLY.
Don't be cruel.
#PAMELA.
It's no use arguing. The doctor has only gone a little way, and he'll be back here at any minute.
#JOHN GALE.
Surely you could have kept the doctor waiting a little while, or made some excuse?
#PAMELA.
What possible excuse could I make? Last time he called I said you were in your bath.
#JOHN GALE.
But that was last Friday week; surely another bath wouldn't be out of place by now!
#PAMELA.
Mr. Tully - please - please not in my presence!
#JOHN GALE.
For Heaven's sake be decent - be decent!
#TULLY.
I've had enough of this.
#JOHN GALE.
Can't you see the awful situation we're in? If Trippett calls he'll demand to see me; if the doctor comes he'll expect to see Tully - and if they both come together - Heaven help us!
#PAMELA.
Hush - Sh!
#JOHN GALE.
What is it? What is it?
#PAMELA.
Ah! It's nothing!
#JOHN GALE.
Well, don't do it, Pam. It unnerves me.
#TULLY.
I'd give anything to be out of this.
#JOHN GALE.
Of course you would. Always thinking of yourself. And don't stretch those pyjamas!
#TULLY.
I don't enjoy the best of health. I shan't be a nuisance to you much longer.
#JOHN GALE.
Why talk like that - you know you will.
#PAMELA.
I can't say that I am enjoying the situation.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, don't lose your heads.
#PAMELA.
Well, what are we going to do?
#JOHN GALE.
Already I have the whole scheme laid out here. It's perfectly simple. This is absolutely an inspiration. Tully - Tully - must - cut - off - his - moustache!
#TULLY.
No - I'm ready to oblige to a certain extent - but I'm not going to be messed about!
#JOHN GALE.
It's absolutely necessary. I've always been clean - shaven, and it's the first thing that is noticed in a man. Now get me a pair of scissors - quickly.
#TULLY.
I protest. I'm not going to be chopped about.
#JOHN GALE.
If you only keep still you won't know anything about it. Now, don't move or I shall hurt you.
#TULLY.
I protest - I pro - gurr! gurr!
#PAMELA.
Oh, don't choke him, John!
#JOHN GALE.
I wouldn't do anything in the world against his wishes. Keep still. Bertram! I don't know why you are making all this fuss. There's practically nothing of it when you come to gather it up. There! I've never seen you look so handsome.
#PAMELA.
Really, I think it suits you, Mr. Tully.
#TULLY.
But don't you see, the doctor's already seen me with a moustache.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, lor!
#TULLY.
And this is my flute night down at the Mission.
#PAMELA.
It's the doctor back again, I expect.
#JOHN GALE.
Go on, get into bed.
#TULLY.
You don't think he'll operate on me? Do you?
#PAMELA.
John, it's a woman.
#JOHN GALE.
A woman!
#PAMELA.
It's Mrs. Tully -
#JOHN GALE.
Mrs. Tully!!!
#PAMELA.
Whatever is she coming here for?
#JOHN GALE.
She knows I'm an invalid and can't leave the house, and I suppose she imagines that her husband is here. Now, you had better not be seen. Go across quickly into the dining - room and shut yourself in.
#PAMELA.
I want to know exactly why Mrs. Tully has called here.
#JOHN GALE.
There's no time to discuss anything. Will you please go and hide in the dining - room?
#PAMELA.
And leave you alone with that woman? Most certainly not!
#JOHN GALE.
Then perhaps you will be good enough to explain to Mrs. Tully why her husband is in your bedroom!
#PAMELA.
No, no! Why can't you explain it.
#JOHN GALE.
Not in your presence.
#PAMELA.
Couldn't Mr. Tully explain if we send his wife in to him?
#JOHN GALE.
Good heavens, no! He'd go mad!
#PAMELA.
Why should he?
#JOHN GALE.
Well - er - he's only recently been married, and he's not in his own flat or in his own bed. Hang it, he's not in his own pyjamas!
#PAMELA.
Well, I'm going to ask him.
#JOHN GALE.
Do please listen to reason, Pam.
#PAMELA.
Mr. Tully, are you in bed?
#TULLY.
Yes!
#PAMELA.
Your wife has called.
#TULLY.
Oh - h - h - h!
#PAMELA.
I say your wife has called. We are sending her in to you.
#TULLY.
Oh - o - h - h - h!
#PAMELA.
Will you kindly explain everything to her?
#JOHN GALE.
That's done it!
#TULLY.
Let me go - let me go!
#JOHN GALE.
I told you what would happen.
#PAMELA.
Shall I go and fetch mother?
#JOHN GALE.
Fetch mother! Good heavens, no! Give the poor devil a chance. Have you got any smelling salts?
#PAMELA.
Scent spray -
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, that'll do.
#PAMELA.
It's the most extraordinary thing I've ever experienced - to see a man so afraid of his wife.
#JOHN GALE.
Ah, some of us don't show it like he does. His marriage was a mistake from the first. Will you go into the dining - room now, and I'll see Mrs. Tully here in the presence of her husband and explain everything.
#PAMELA.
If Mr. Tully will promise to remain in the room.
#JOHN GALE.
Yes! Yes!
#TULLY.
No! No!
#JOHN GALE.
Yes - yes! Now go along as quickly as you can.
#PAMELA.
But understand I shall expect to hear Mr. Tully's voice the whole time.
#JOHN GALE.
You shall - you shall. He shan't leave the room. And when he's not talking I'll get him to sing. Go and let Mamie in as quickly as you can - show her in here - then stand by that door and don't let anyone else in on any account - and sing - just through the key - hole. It'll keep Mrs. Ayers quiet.
#TULLY.
You won't leave me alone with Miss Fluffie Scott again, will you?
#JOHN GALE.
I'll get rid of her as soon as ever I can. Go and let her in quickly. Come along, Mamie. Oh, sorry old man, I forgot! Now don't leave that door whatever you do - and sing - sing!
#MAMIE.
Jack, Jack! Did you get my letter?
#JOHN GALE.
Your letter? What letter?
#MAMIE.
What's that?
#JOHN GALE.
It's all right. He's not listening.
#MAMIE.
I wrote you about the necklace.
#JOHN GALE.
But I sent you word last week that the necklace was in the hands of the jeweller.
#MAMIE.
I know. I told the Rajah that, and he won't believe me. He's simply furious. Where is the jeweller's? Let me take it back to him whether it's damaged or not. Do!
#JOHN GALE.
But there isn't time. I'm expecting my wife at any moment, and you must get away from here.
#MAMIE.
But I dare not go home without it. Darling, do please!
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, dry up, dry up! Well, now I'll tell you the truth - the jeweller sent the necklace back yesterday, and I've given it to my wife to take care of.
#MAMIE.
Then you've got it! You've got it!
#TULLY.
You've got it? You never told me!
#JOHN GALE.
Watch that door! Yes, Mrs. Ayers is wearing it.
#MAMIE.
Oh, I am pleased. But why didn't she give it to Mr. Tully, if she thinks I'm his wife?
#JOHN GALE.
Ah, that's the point - that's the trouble. There are some people in this world you can't trust.
#MAMIE.
I could tell you a few things about Mr. Tully. Ask him if he knows a girl called Agnes - she teaches him ragtime down at the Mission.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, dry up! Will you dry up!!!
#MAMIE.
What's he doing there? Saying his prayers?
#JOHN GALE.
He must keep to that door in case Mrs. Ayers comes back.
#MAMIE.
Well, give me the necklace, and I'll be off at once.
#JOHN GALE.
I'll send it on to you to - morrow.
#MAMIE.
No, I dare not go home without it.
#JOHN GALE.
But how can I give it to you? Mrs. Ayers is wearing it round her neck.
#MAMIE.
Can't I wait till she returns?
#JOHN GALE.
No, no! She doesn't know you're here. And you must leave at once before she comes back.
#PAMELA.
I can't hear Mr. Tully's voice!
#JOHN GALE.
Sing! sing!
#MAMIE.
That is Mrs. Ayers - now you can give me the necklace.
#JOHN GALE.
That's impossible. I don't want her to know you're here.
#MAMIE.
But it doesn't matter if she thinks I am Mrs. Tully!
#TULLY.
I object to that being shouted broadcast.
#JOHN GALE.
You keep quiet! You see, he objects - and don't be so unfeeling. We're expecting the doctor here at any minute, I'm as ill as I can be, and Tully may be operated on at any moment.
#MAMIE.
I don't care who's operated on. I'm not going home without that necklace.
#JOHN GALE.
Can't you see the trouble we're in?
#MAMIE.
There'll be worse trouble when the Rajah arrives.
#JOHN GALE.
Good heavens! You haven't told the Rajah about me?
#MAMIE.
What else could I do? And I had to give him your address.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, Tully, Tully, she's given the Rajah my address!
#MAMIE.
What else could I do? Boo - boo - It's not my fault, and why should I be blamed for it. Boo, boo, boo!
#JOHN GALE.
There, don't cry, don't cry. What's the matter with you?
#TULLY.
I can't bear to see a woman cry.
#JOHN GALE.
Hold her feet down! Don't leave that door!
#TULLY.
John! The doctor's arrived!
#JOHN GALE.
Say - say you're having a bath; you won't be long.
#TULLY.
I'm in my bath! I shan't be long!!!
#JOHN GALE.
You're not shouting the odds at a race meeting!
#TULLY.
I'm in my bath - I shan't be long - splash - splash - splash. I'm drying - I'm dying -
#JOHN GALE.
Oh! Good heavens, this is awful. She's fainting, she's fainting, what shall we do?
#TULLY.
Put a key down her back!
#JOHN GALE.
Well, give me a key. No! Not that one, idiot! We may want that!
#JOHN GALE.
You'll split those pyjamas! Is this the proper thing to do?
#JOHN GALE.
Ah! she's coming round. No more tears! No more tears, little girl!
#MAMIE.
No, no more tears, no more tears!
#JOHN GALE.
There, dear, no more tears, you come along into this room and you shall have the necklace, I promise you -
#MAMIE.
You really mean that, Jack -
#JOHN GALE.
Of course I mean it - now come along.
#TULLY.
Oh, Mrs. Ayers! "Oh dry those tears, oh calm those fears."
#JOHN GALE.
The key - where's the key?
#TULLY.
You put it down Fluffie's back!
#PAMELA.
The doctor says he can't wait much longer.
#JOHN GALE.
I suppose you realize that something's got to be done. This girl demands the necklace - the police have been informed, and the Rajah is rampant. The 'Bus Company claim me as a patient, and my married happiness rocks in the balance.
#TULLY.
Oh, don't talk like that.
#JOHN GALE.
Go on, get into that chair.
#TULLY.
Haven't I done enough for one day?
#JOHN GALE.
At this very moment you can wreck my life, and you're going to take advantage of it. Bertram! Bertram! What did I do with those pieces of your moustache?
#TULLY.
You put them in your pocket.
#JOHN GALE.
Ah, so I did.
#TULLY.
You're not going to leave me in this awful predicament?
#JOHN GALE.
I shall be back immediately. I have a brilliant idea, that will clear up everything. Now, don't forget you are John Ayers.
#TULLY.
I'm John Ayers??
#JOHN GALE.
You can come in. Moan a little, and for heaven's sake try and look intelligent.
#PAMELA.
Ah, here he is, doctor.
#DR. BEVAN.
Is he awake?
#PAMELA.
Are you awake, dear?
#TULLY.
No! - er - yes - yes.
#DR. BEVAN.
Still sitting up, and after a bath too; it's not wise.
#PAMELA.
We can't keep him in bed; he's so full of spirits.
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes, yes, I quite understand. Now, don't distress yourself, my dear lady. You have your own medical man attending, of course.
#PAMELA.
Oh yes, doctor, of course. But I don't think he understands the case, although he thinks it very serious.
#DR. BEVAN.
I think that must be Mr. Trippett.
#PAMELA.
Excuse me a moment.
#DR. BEVAN.
Now then, young man, I want you to tell me exactly where you feel this pain. We don't want you to remain an invalid all your life, although I dare say a little compensation will act as a wonderful restorative.
#JOHN GALE.
Say it's Mr. Tully.
#PAMELA.
Er - Mr. Tully.
#TULLY.
Yes!
#PAMELA.
It's Mr. Tully.
#JOHN GALE.
May I come in? How d'ye do, Mrs. Ayers? So pleased to see you. And how is the patient to - day?
#PAMELA.
Not much better, I'm afraid.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh no, he's worse - a lot worse. I can see that. Poor old John!
#TULLY.
Poor John!
#JOHN GALE.
I don't think we shall have him with us much longer. Bertram.
#DR. BEVAN.
I don't think it's wise to dishearten the patient like that.
#PAMELA.
This is the doctor from the Motor 'Bus Company.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, how d'ye do? I'm a very old friend of Mr. Ayers, and I'm very sorry to see him struck down like this. It's a very serious matter.
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes. The Company wish me to convey their deep sympathies.
#JOHN GALE.
Deep sympathies aren't much good. I'm afraid it will cost them something more than that.
#DR. BEVAN.
Oh! He'll be up and about in a few days.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh no he won't.
#DR. BEVAN.
Oh yes he will!
#JOHN GALE.
Oh no he won't!
#DR. BEVAN.
Oh yes he will!
#JOHN GALE.
Oh no he won't! I can promise you that. Can't you see the man has been terribly knocked about? Groan!
#DR. BEVAN.
Now, tell me, Mrs. Ayers, is he thirsty at all?
#PAMELA.
No, doctor.
#DR. BEVAN.
No, no, he wouldn't be.
#JOHN GALE.
But the pain in his back is simply terrible. He raves! Rave!
#DR. BEVAN.
Does he have any pains in the head?
#PAMELA.
N - no - doctor.
#DR. BEVAN.
No, no, he wouldn't have.
#JOHN GALE.
But his mind's affected.
#DR. BEVAN.
Is he - is he sleepy at all?
#PAMELA.
No, not as a rule, doctor.
#DR. BEVAN.
No, no.
#JOHN GALE.
No, no, he wouldn't be.
#DR. BEVAN.
How dare you, sir? Of course a good deal of this may proceed from a previous debilitated state.
#PAMELA.
Debilitated?
#DR. BEVAN.
I understand the patient has led rather a - well - if I may be allowed to say so - rather a gay life?
#JOHN GALE.
Oh no, you're quite wrong. No one can ever say that John Ayers went the pace. I've known John ever since I was born and I can safely say he's a living saint, isn't he, Mrs. Ayers?
#PAMELA.
Er - yes - yes, of course.
#JOHN GALE.
If anyone knocks about at all, you might accuse me. I'm known everywhere as Tully the Rake. Bertram!
#DR. BEVAN.
There's just one more question, Mrs. Ayers. Does he have any cold sweats?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, he lives entirely on soda - water.
#DR. BEVAN.
I said, sir, does he have any cold sweats?
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, I beg your pardon, I thought you said Schweppes.
#DR. BEVAN.
Schweppes!!
#PAMELA.
Yes, he perspires a good deal.
#JOHN GALE.
Perspire!
#DR. BEVAN.
Perspires. That's quite natural. Now then, will you tell me exactly where you feel this pain in the back?
#JOHN GALE.
Just up between the ribs. Oh, that's the very place!
#DR. BEVAN.
Will you let the patient tell me?
#JOHN GALE.
But he doesn't know as well as I do.
#TULLY.
Mr. Ayers - er - Mr. Tully, this gentleman knows all about it.
#DR. BEVAN.
Mr. Tully, Mr. Tully! Where have I heard that name before? Ah, you were in the 'bus accident with him, I believe?
#JOHN GALE.
No, that was my brother.
#DR. BEVAN.
Your brother? And he escaped unhurt?
#JOHN GALE.
Er - yes. He fell on top of a fat old woman who was sitting opposite.
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes, that poor lady had three ribs broken. Still, that concerns your brother. I can't quite understand all this, you know - according to Mr. Trippett's report, the patient was a much smaller man.
#JOHN GALE.
Surely, you're not going to measure him, doctor? Hang it all, he's not dead yet.
#DR. BEVAN.
No, I simply wish to examine him, that's all. Although I have taken the measure of many people in my time. Now, Mrs. Ayers, will you kindly loosen the patient's things a little - just in front.
#JOHN GALE.
Perhaps I can assist.
#DR. BEVAN.
I shall feel much obliged, sir, if you will not interfere.
#PAMELA.
Couldn't you examine him better in bed, doctor?
#DR. BEVAN.
Undoubtedly!
#JOHN GALE.
No, I can't let him go into bed. I don't advise it.
#TULLY.
And I'm not going to strip.
#PAMELA.
It's Mr. Trippett!
#DR. BEVAN.
Mr. Trippett, good! He's just in time!
#JOHN GALE.
Good! He's just in time. That is lucky. I am glad!
#DR. BEVAN.
He promised to meet me here.
#JOHN GALE.
Isn't it Motor 'Bus etiquette for you to discuss the case with Mr. Trippett in private?
#DR. BEVAN.
No, I don't think that's at all necessary.
#JOHN GALE.
I'm sure both Mr. and Mrs. Ayers would like you to consult before anything is said or done in the matter. The dining - room is at your service.
#PAMELA.
Yes - yes - of course.
#DR. BEVAN.
Well, if you particularly wish it, I'll see Mr. Trippett.
#PAMELA.
This way, doctor.
#DR. BEVAN.
I thank you, madam, I thank you.
#TULLY.
I've had enough of this! I'm going mad!
#JOHN GALE.
Bertram! Bertram!
#TULLY.
Bertram be damned!
#JOHN GALE.
I think you're very ungrateful. Just as everything's going so splendidly.
#TULLY.
Splendidly! Is it? Do you think Mr. Trippett and the doctor are going to swallow this tale. I've lost my reputation and I've lost my moustache!
#PAMELA.
Mr. Trippett would like to see you now. He's in rather a hurry. What will you do?
#JOHN GALE.
That's all right. Send Trippett in here in two seconds and keep the doctor in there and keep calm.
#TULLY.
Everything's going splendidly. Everything's going splendidly.
#JOHN GALE.
Go on, get behind that screen.
#TULLY.
If ever I get out of this I'll leave the neighbourhood.
#JOHN GALE.
Don't talk like that.
#MAMIE.
Jack, I can't wait any longer. Where's the necklace?
#JOHN GALE.
It's all right, only wait.
#MAMIE.
My darling, what have you been doing?
#JOHN GALE.
What?
#MAMIE.
That dreadful moustache.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, they've been putting me under glass. Don't you groan. I'm the patient now!
#PAMELA.
John, the doctor says he must examine you before discussing the case with Mr. Trippett.
#JOHN GALE.
Good heavens! Can't they make up their minds? They must be a couple of weathercocks. All right - send the doctor in - wait till you hear Tully groan.
#PAMELA.
Mr. Tully will be in the chair?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, yes. We're quite prepared. Wait till he groans, that's all. Go on, get into that chair. The doctor's coming in.
#PAMELA.
John, Mr. Trippett and the doctor are both coming in together!
#JOHN GALE.
Both together! Wait, I know. Say there's an escape of gas.
#PAMELA.
Electric light! Look!
#TULLY.
Say the lease of the flat is up!
#JOHN GALE.
Don't be a fool. Say I'm dead!
#PAMELA.
John, there's a coloured man at the door! coloured man! Good heavens, it's the Rajah!
#PAMELA.
The Rajah?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes! Tell him I'm buried and won't be back for a week!
#PAMELA.
But who is the Rajah?
#JOHN GALE.
Just a friend of mine.
#MAMIE.
Excuse me, he's a friend of mine.
#PAMELA.
Yours!
#MAMIE.
Yes, a friend of mine, and I must have that necklace. Will you kindly give it to me, Mrs. Ayers?
#PAMELA.
This necklace - how dare you - it's mine.
#TULLY.
Not that way, John! Not that way!
#URSULA.
You can come h'in.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh, dear me, I am glad to sit down. Phew! I only left the hospital this morning.
#URSULA.
You don't say.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Yes. I was in a terrible 'bus accident about three weeks ago, and I had three of my ribs broken.
#URSULA.
You don't say.
#AUNT HANNAH.
It was my first experience of a motor 'bus too. They're most dangerous things. Aren't you afraid of them?
#URSULA.
I ain't afraid of nothink.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Dear me, what courage! What courage!
#URSULA.
Take anything?
#AUNT HANNAH.
N - o, no thank you. I've had my tea. And so my nephew's out?
#URSULA.
Been h'out since lunch.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Didn't he say he expected me?
#URSULA.
About three weeks ago he mentioned your name, but not since.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Yes, that was when I came up from Exeter. I was coming on to see him then when I was injured in the 'bus, and they took me straight away to the hospital.
#URSULA.
You don't say!
#AUNT HANNAH.
But I do say. But I sent him a telegram saying I was coming to - day.
#URSULA.
Telegram.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Oh yes. Oh yes! Unopened?
#URSULA.
Come h'after the master left.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Oh dear! What a pity! But he'll be home shortly, I suppose, or doesn't he keep good respectable hours?
#URSULA.
Nothing to find fault with.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Has he any - er - lady friends?
#URSULA.
H'only one - h'Ag - er - ness.
#AUNT HANNAH.
I hope she's a good girl. Oh, what's that?
#URSULA.
People next door, I suppose.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Dear me! It's close!
#URSULA.
Removing your things?
#AUNT HANNAH.
Yes, I should like to.
#URSULA.
Bedroom this way.
#AUNT HANNAH.
How very convenient. And I find every one in London so very kind and polite.
#URSULA.
In there!!
#AUNT HANNAH.
Thank you. Thank you!
#URSULA.
'Orrible neighbours - 'orrible neighbours!
#TULLY.
Home at last. Home at last!
#JOHN GALE.
It's all right! I've made a barricade with the geranium pots. Nobody could get over without making a terrible smash. We should be sure to hear them.
#TULLY.
Good, then we're safe for the moment.
#JOHN GALE.
Don't make a scene! Don't make a scene!
#JOHN GALE.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
#TULLY.
I distinctly heard a woman's voice.
#JOHN GALE.
'Sh! Don't make a noise. I'm listening for the flower - pots to fall.
#TULLY.
What will happen if Mr. Trippett and the doctor come in and find us gone?
#JOHN GALE.
They dare not enter while the two women are arguing, perhaps fighting. I'm only thinking what a little cat Mamie was to come out just when everything was going so splendidly.
#TULLY.
Whatever induced you to run after a girl like that?
#JOHN GALE.
Is there anybody in this flat?
#TULLY.
Only the maid.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, send her out.
#TULLY.
She's just been out.
#JOHN GALE.
Never mind - send her out fifty times if it'll only help us. Don't give way! Don't give way! I've got an idea. I'm going to cut the electric wires of the whole block of flats. I think I know where they run. Now you go and get her out of the house. Don't lose a moment. Please go, Bertram! It isn't often I ask you to do anything! No, that's not it. Ah, that looks more like it. Yes. Got it! Got it! Oh, damn, confound!
#TULLY.
Help! Help! Help!
#JOHN GALE.
What's up? What's the matter with you?
#TULLY.
The maid doesn't recognize me without a moustache. She thinks I'm a burglar - and she's chasing me with a poker.
#JOHN GALE.
Chasing you?
#TULLY.
Yes, and if this woman gets in, she'll brain us both. Come and help, for heaven's sake!
#JOHN GALE.
I can't let go here.
#TULLY.
Why not?
#JOHN GALE.
I thought if I could cut the main electric cable and put out the lights next door, that the doctor and Trippett would be compelled to leave the flat -
#TULLY.
Good! Go on, cut the cable.
#JOHN GALE.
I have tried, I have tried! And I've cut the water - pipe instead. It'll flood the place.
#TULLY.
Oh, I'd do anything to get out of this.
#JOHN GALE.
For heaven's sake don't be so selfish, just when everything's going so splendidly!
#JOHN GALE.
Don't do it! Don't do it!
#TULLY.
I didn't do anything. If you shout like that I shall have a fit in a moment.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, we don't want to stand here all night.
#TULLY.
Can you reach that key out of the other door?
#JOHN GALE.
I've told you I can't let go here.
#TULLY.
If this woman gets in our lives won't be worth having.
#JOHN GALE.
Whatever made you engage such a brute?
#TULLY.
I can't live here alone without protection.
#JOHN GALE.
What's her name?
#TULLY.
Ursula!
#JOHN GALE.
Ursula! Give her a month's notice.
#TULLY.
No, I don't want to lose her.
#JOHN GALE.
Women - are - no - use - unless - they - are - mastered!
#TULLY.
I've always heard that it was best to avoid women who are mustard.
#JOHN GALE.
Mastered - not mustard! And take off those pyjamas!
#TULLY.
And I ought to be playing the flute to - night down at the Mission.
#JOHN GALE.
Hang your mission! I'm trying to think what I can do here. Lend me your handkerchief - I'll plug it up with mine and then tie it up.
#TULLY.
Catch! Catch!
#JOHN GALE.
How can I catch from here? You'll split those pyjamas!
#TULLY.
This is the most awful afternoon I've ever had in my life. I shall never be the same man again.
#JOHN GALE.
There, that'll hold, I think. Now, I'll go and cover your retreat.
#TULLY.
Oh! Here's a telegram! Telegrams always make me feel so nervous! It's from Aunt Hannah, she's coming up to - day. I've been expecting her for the last three weeks. I am the only relation she has, and in order to avoid the death - duties she's going to make a Deed of Gift to me amounting to several thousand pounds!
#JOHN GALE.
Several thousand pounds! Now that is mean. Look at the trouble you've put me to. You might have lent me the money and so saved me a fortnight's illness.
#TULLY.
Will you accept the £500 from me?
#JOHN GALE.
I suppose I must.
#TULLY.
That is good of you!
#JOHN GALE.
Not at all! You have such a winning way with you. One can't help doing as you wish.
#TULLY.
That's taken a great load off my mind. The old lady is very generous. Directly she arrives we must both be very nice to her.
#JOHN GALE.
Trust me for that. And I can be nice when I like.
#TULLY.
I know you can. But what about the 'Bus Company?
#JOHN GALE.
Oh yes. I'll get you to go back and say I withdraw my claim.
#TULLY.
Yes. I'd love to do that.
#JOHN GALE.
I'll buy Mamie a new necklace, and tell Pam the whole truth - that Mamie is not your wife, but your little bit of fluff named Agnes.
#TULLY.
No, I draw the line there, Mamie's your fluff. You must shoulder that responsibility.
#JOHN GALE.
But you're a single man. It doesn't matter about you.
#TULLY.
Oh yes it does. I've got to think of my reputation down at the Mission.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, hang your mission!
#TULLY.
Oh, dear!
#JOHN GALE.
What's up?
#TULLY.
It's a letter from the Motor 'Bus Company.
#JOHN GALE.
Motor 'Bus Company?
#TULLY.
They're going to sue me.
#JOHN GALE.
Sue you, what for?
#TULLY.
The fat woman who had three ribs broken says that I am liable - that my fall on her was premeditated and nothing to do with the accident. Oh, and listen to this. "Our representative will have much pleasure in calling upon you this evening at seven o'clock."
#JOHN GALE.
It's gone seven now.
#TULLY.
They're sending some one here to - night?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, who will they send - either Trippett or the doctor. They are both in the neighbourhood.
#TULLY.
Then they may be here at any moment!
#JOHN GALE.
But this is a simple matter now you've got the necessary money coming in.
#TULLY.
But which one will they send, because it depends on that who you are and who I am.
#JOHN GALE.
Well, I'll get you to creep back and tell Pam that I withdraw my claim - then, if the doctor calls you must get back in time to see him, and if Trippett calls, I'll see Trippett.
#TULLY.
But that won't help me out - if they are going to sue me - possibly for hundreds - I'm not going to lend you this money unless I can see a clean sheet for myself - you got me into this mess, you must get me out of it!
#JOHN GALE.
You are ungrateful. After all I've done for you. Are you going to lend me the £500 or are you not?
#TULLY.
Certainly. But I didn't fall on top of this fat woman, and I'm not going to be made to pay. You had the fun, you ought to suffer. What are you going to do?
#JOHN GALE.
Do as you wish. I'm going to get you out of this trouble. I've rung for Ursula.
#TULLY.
Ursula!
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, er, good evening Ursula!
#URSULA.
Evening!
#JOHN GALE.
We want you to do us a favour, if you will? favour?
#JOHN GALE.
We want you to lend us some ladies' clothes - just for an hour or so.
#URSULA.
What sort of clothes?
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, nothing - er - white - nothing under - underhand - just super clothes - and if you do this, your master will be very much obliged to you and he'll raise your wages.
#URSULA.
I'll see - I'll see.
#TULLY.
John! What are you going to do?
#JOHN GALE.
I think you will acknowledge this is an inspiration. These 'bus people think they are going to corner us, I can see their move. But you and I are far too smart for them.
#TULLY.
Are we?
#JOHN GALE.
It has only just struck me, but you are the living image of the fat old lady in the 'bus!
#TULLY.
Oh! John!
#JOHN GALE.
Without the fat, of course. If you get into these clothes and pad yourself all round, no one will know the difference.
#TULLY.
No, I couldn't do that. It's illegal!
#JOHN GALE.
I'm doing this to get you out of the pickle. I'm not doing it for my own sake, please bear that in mind.
#TULLY.
But what good will it do?
#JOHN GALE.
If the doctor or Trippett calls here, I shall say that I am Tully, that is Tully's brother, that I have had an interview with the lady in the 'bus accident and she is strongly of opinion that the 'Bus Company is liable.
#TULLY.
But they'll dispute it at once.
#JOHN GALE.
Naturally - then we are prepared. I shall just bring you into the room dressed as the lady, with nothing to do but to bear out my statement.
#TULLY.
No, I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it!
#JOHN GALE.
Bertram! I have an idea - an idea that wouldn't occur to one man in a million, and you want to ignore it. Bertram! Bertram!
#URSULA.
Clothes!
#JOHN GALE.
Thank you, Ursula, thank you. The very thing - but you'll want a fearful lot of padding - you're so thin. Here we are, top - hole, beautiful padding!
#TULLY.
But, John, what about a bodice. I must have a bodice!
#JOHN GALE.
What do you want a bodice for?
#TULLY.
For all this part.
#JOHN GALE.
I'll go and get a bodice off Ursula. Meanwhile you go into the bedroom and get into these clothes as quickly as you can. Shave your top lip clean. Don't forget the cushions. Arrange them - diplomatically - you know - come out and go in - and all that sort of thing, and I'll go and get the bodice.
#TULLY.
I don't know where a woman comes out and goes in!
#MAMIE.
Oh, there you are, Bertie! Where's Jack? Where is he?
#TULLY.
Somewhere in the house.
#MAMIE.
Is there anyone else in the house besides Jack?
#TULLY.
Only the maid - and Bogie.
#MAMIE.
Bogie - who's Bogie?
#TULLY.
My little dog.
#MAMIE.
Do you know that Mrs. Ayers still thinks I am your wife.
#TULLY.
Yes, I'm so sorry.
#MAMIE.
What?
#TULLY.
I mean - delighted.
#MAMIE.
Oh, don't wriggle! Things are far too serious for wriggling. You heard about the necklace that was lent to me by my friend the Rajah?
#TULLY.
Yes, I have heard about it.
#MAMIE.
Then I want you, as my husband, to take the matter into your hands and tell Mrs. Ayers that unless the necklace is returned to me at once, you will take proceedings.
#TULLY.
Oh, I couldn't do that, I'll call John.
#MAMIE.
No, don't call John. It's only natural if you are supposed to be my husband that you should help me in this matter. And if you don't, you'll get it in the neck right where the chicken got the axe. Just read this letter. It's from the Rajah - I've never had such things said to me in my life - boo - boo - boo!
#TULLY.
Don't cry, child, don't cry.
#MAMIE.
Where did I put it? In my bag? No! I remember, I put it in my dress for safety.
#TULLY.
Oh! oh!
#MAMIE.
Would you mind unhooking my dress at the back, please.
#TULLY.
Really I'm a single man!
#MAMIE.
Well, these are single hooks.
#TULLY.
I'll call John!
#MAMIE.
Please don't call John.
#TULLY.
I must have some one in the room - Bogie! Bogie! Bogie!
#MAMIE.
Bertie! Bertram! Come here! I want to show you something very important.
#TULLY.
I'll take your word for it!
#MAMIE.
It's the Rajah's letter. Just the top two hooks, please - as quickly as you can.
#TULLY.
Really, I don't understand. I'm quite a novice.
#MAMIE.
You don't want me to tear the thing off?
#TULLY.
For heaven's sake, don't do that!
#MAMIE.
Well, pull your socks up, Bertie, and undo the top one. What are you doing?
#TULLY.
Pulling my socks up.
#MAMIE.
Go on, the top one. Ah, that's better. Now, the next one.
#TULLY.
No, no more.
#MAMIE.
Now the next one.
#TULLY.
No more!
#MAMIE.
Do please, Bertie dear! Bertie darling! Bertie sweetheart!
#TULLY.
Well, just this one. No more after that.
#MAMIE.
No, no more after that.
#TULLY.
They are nice little hooks. Shall I go any further?
#MAMIE.
No, not at present. I've got it. Just read that! It's the Rajah!
#TULLY.
No, more flower - pots. More creepers! It's Mrs. Ayers!
#MAMIE.
I'll hide here and listen. Come and hide me, Bertie.
#PAMELA.
Oh - Mr. Tully - where is John?
#TULLY.
He's very busy with my maid.
#PAMELA.
With your maid?
#TULLY.
Yes, he's trying to get some clothes off her.
#PAMELA.
What?
#TULLY.
Trying to borrow some clothes I should say.
#PAMELA.
Well, someone must come at once. Mr. Trippett refuses to leave the flat until he has seen John, and the doctor is coming round to your door.
#TULLY.
But John is going to withdraw his claim against the Company, and I'm going to tell Mr. Trippett so.
#PAMELA.
Then please come at once.
#MAMIE.
Stop! Before you go, I'd like you to ask Mrs. Ayers to give me back my necklace.
#PAMELA.
I've already told you, Mrs. Tully, that this necklace does not belong to you. And please ask your wife to apologize.
#TULLY.
Miss Scott - Miss Fluff - my wife - will you apologize?
#MAMIE.
Certainly not! You know as well as I do that that necklace does not belong to Mrs. Ayers. Please ask her to return it to me.
#TULLY.
Mrs. Ayers, will you please return the necklace to Mrs. - er - Mrs. wife?
#PAMELA.
I shall do nothing in the matter until I've seen John.
#TULLY.
She will do nothing in the matter -
#MAMIE.
Out of my way! Now, Mrs. Ayers, that necklace was lent to me and its real owner is waiting at the door of your flat. If I don't take it back to him at once you'll have the police on your track. Am I to take it back or not? You refuse? You refuse?
#PAMELA.
Oh, very well, take it to him. I don't want a vulgar scene over a paltry thirty - shilling necklace.
#MAMIE.
Thirty shillings! That shows how much you know, and also that this necklace cannot possibly be your property - I'm sorry you made such a mistake. Thirty shillings - that's really good - I must tell the Rajah that! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
#PAMELA.
John! John!
#URSULA.
What are you doing 'ere? What are you doing 'ere?
#PAMELA.
I beg your pardon, I was looking for my husband.
#URSULA.
Well, he's not 'ere. He's not 'ere!
#PAMELA.
No, I'm sure he wouldn't be -
#URSULA.
It's all right. You can come in now, little man. All gone!
#JOHN GALE.
Thank you, Ursula, thank you! Here you are, it's the best she's got! Eh? What's that, speak up, I can't hear.
#AUNT HANNAH.
You dare not attack a woman even if you are a burglar!
#JOHN GALE.
Excellent! Splendid! The very thing. I shouldn't have known you.
#AUNT HANNAH.
I want to leave this house.
#JOHN GALE.
Ha! Ha! Ha! You are the living image of the fat old woman in the 'bus.
#AUNT HANNAH.
I am the lady who was in the 'bus, sir, and I know you - I know you now. You were the coward who, to save his own skin, so cruelly tried to crush me.
#JOHN GALE.
Good! Good! If you only keep it up like that you'll be splendid.
#AUNT HANNAH.
I tell you, sir, I had three of my ribs broken.
#JOHN GALE.
Ribs! You don't look as if you had any ribs. You are all, cushions! Ha! Ha! Ha!
#AUNT HANNAH.
Oh! Oh! Oh, my poor side - oh, my poor heart.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, my poor side, oh, my poor heart! Ha! Ha! Ha! Oh, don't make me laugh! You've got the funniest mug I've ever seen. And you do "go out" and "come in" a lot, more "come in" than "go out."
#AUNT HANNAH.
I'm going to leave this house, sir, and if you attempt to stop me, I'll call for the police.
#JOHN GALE.
If you jump about like that, your clothes will fall off.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Ouch! Ouch!
#JOHN GALE.
Oh! You ought to see your back view! Ha! Ha!
#AUNT HANNAH.
How dare you! How dare you!
#JOHN GALE.
Hark, that may be our man. Pull yourself together.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Don't you touch me!
#JOHN GALE.
Stop it, you idiot. Don't forget if that's the doctor, you're here to discuss the 'bus accident with me. Now, go into that bedroom, and don't come out till I call you!
#AUNT HANNAH.
I wish to leave this house.
#JOHN GALE.
Come on, don't play the giddy ox. Kennel! Kennel!
#AUNT HANNAH.
Don't you touch me! How dare you! Oh - o - o - oh!
#JOHN GALE.
What is it? What is it?
#URSULA.
Dr. Bigland to see the master.
#JOHN GALE.
Dr. Bigland! Good! Show him in!
#JOHN GALE.
Who am I now? I know, I'm Tully. No, I'm not, I'm Tully's brother, Tully's twin brother.
#URSULA.
Dr. Bigland!
#DR. BEVAN.
Yes. I expected something of this kind.
#JOHN GALE.
I haven't the pleasure of your acquaintance.
#DR. BEVAN.
You are Mr. Tully.
#JOHN GALE.
Tully is my name.
#DR. BEVAN.
Hadn't I the pleasure of meeting you a short while ago next door?
#JOHN GALE.
No, that was my brother.
#DR. BEVAN.
Your brother? Good heavens! What a likeness!
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, we're often mistaken for each other. If the true facts of the case were known I believe we were very nearly twins.
#DR. BEVAN.
Remarkable! I apologize.
#JOHN GALE.
Not at all. But didn't my brother tell you it was my brother? I mean, didn't he tell you it was me?
#DR. BEVAN.
He said it was his brother who was in the motor 'bus accident.
#JOHN GALE.
Quite correct.
#DR. BEVAN.
The object of my visit is in reference to that matter.
#JOHN GALE.
Will you take a seat?
#DR. BEVAN.
I thank you. Now, as regards yourself. At the time of the accident there was a lady in the 'bus who had three ribs broken, and we understand that this was caused by your fall on top of the lady.
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, but I make no claim against the lady.
#DR. BEVAN.
No, but the lady wishes to make a claim against you.
#JOHN GALE.
I don't think so. The lady herself is here, now, and quite ready to deny your allegations against me. You can come in! It's the doctor.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Oh! O - h - h! It's Dr. Bigland.
#DR. BEVAN.
Now, my dear lady, calm yourself; remember what I told you, you must keep calm.
#JOHN GALE.
You see, the poor woman's nerves are shattered, and all through riding in your beastly 'buses.
#DR. BEVAN.
You know this gentleman who was in the 'bus accident with you?
#AUNT HANNAH.
Yes, and I live in fear of him.
#DR. BEVAN.
That's quite all right. There's nothing to be frightened of. Now sit down, sit down and compose yourself. Ah! Not on my hat!
#AUNT HANNAH.
Oh dear, dear, dear! O - h - h!
#DR. BEVAN.
Now I understand you wish to thrash out this matter of the accident.
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, we are both desirous that it should be cleared up, aren't we?
#AUNT HANNAH.
Doctor, I am.
#JOHN GALE.
Will you begin?
#DR. BEVAN.
No, I will not begin. I will hear what the lady has to say and make my report.
#JOHN GALE.
Good! Well - er - madam - the Doctor and I have been discussing the matter, and he is under the impression that you think that I am to blame for the injury you have suffered. Now I want you to prove to him that such is not the case.
#AUNT HANNAH.
But it is the case. The Doctor is quite right!
#JOHN GALE.
I say, the Doctor thinks that I was to blame, and I want you to deny this scandalous accusation.
#AUNT HANNAH.
I can't deny it.
#JOHN GALE.
But you don't understand.
#AUNT HANNAH.
I beg to state that I do understand.
#JOHN GALE.
Let me explain. A short while ago when you and I were discussing this matter, you agreed with me that the 'Bus Company and they alone were responsible for your injuries.
#AUNT HANNAH.
I did not agree with you in any way! It's a wicked falsehood.
#DR. BEVAN.
Exactly as I thought.
#JOHN GALE.
You silly fool! Oh, I beg your pardon - think - think - didn't you distinctly say you were going to sue the 'Bus Company?
#AUNT HANNAH.
I don't remember discussing the matter with you at all, sir.
#JOHN GALE.
Then the accident must have affected your memory. You half - witted idiot, you'll spoil everything.
#AUNT HANNAH.
And abuse will certainly not make me alter my decision.
#DR. BEVAN.
Now, my dear lady, you are firmly of the opinion that the injury you sustained was due to the premeditated action of this gentleman when riding on one of the Company's vehicles?
#AUNT HANNAH.
That is my case exactly.
#DR. BEVAN.
Very well. And the amount of damages you claim?
#AUNT HANNAH.
I claim - I claim - I -
#DR. BEVAN.
I claim! I claim! What do you claim?
#AUNT HANNAH.
I claim - Five hundred pounds!
#DR. BEVAN.
Five hundred pounds.
#DR. BEVAN.
Now, sir, are you prepared in any way to accept this liability?
#JOHN GALE.
No - most certainly not!
#DR. BEVAN.
Then there's nothing more to be said.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh yes there is, I'm a little smarter than you imagine, and I can tell you something. That isn't a woman you've been talking to, that's a man! Oh, you can laugh, you can laugh, but I can prove it.
#DR. BEVAN.
You can do what, sir?
#JOHN GALE.
Prove it!
#DR. BEVAN.
Not in my presence, you don't!
#AUNT HANNAH.
Don't you look at me like that, sir. Don't you look at me like that!
#JOHN GALE.
Take off those pads.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Pads!
#JOHN GALE.
Take off those pads!
#AUNT HANNAH.
I don't wear pads.
#JOHN GALE.
You cheat! You dirty little turncoat - to make a fool of me like that.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Don't you touch me, sir. Don't you touch me!
#JOHN GALE.
Take off those rags, or I'll thrash you!
#PAMELA.
John! John! I'm surprised at you - treating a woman like that. woman! Oh, good lor', it's a woman!
#PAMELA.
Yes, a woman. There, there, calm yourself, calm yourself. Mr. Tully told me you were trying to get clothes off someone!
#JOHN GALE.
Where - is - TULLY?
#PAMELA.
I left him in our flat. He was telling Mr. Trippett that you withdraw your claim. John, she's fainted! Get some water, get some water, John.
#JOHN GALE.
I haven't the faintest idea where to get water - I don't know this beastly flat - Ah! I know. Stand back. Pam - stand back!
#JOHN GALE.
Why, who are you?
#AUNT HANNAH.
I'm Mr. Tully's aunt.
#JOHN GALE.
Mr. Tully's aunt!
#AUNT HANNAH.
Yes, I am Aunt Hannah!
#JOHN GALE.
Aunt Hannah! Go and look after her, Pam.
#JOHN GALE.
Another five hundred gone.
#TULLY.
Everything's going splendidly! Everything's going splendidly!
#JOHN GALE.
Take it away! Take it away! You're too late!
#TULLY.
Don't I look all right?
#JOHN GALE.
All right? You look more like a goat than a woman!
#TULLY.
I thought I looked like a little bit of fluff. What's happened?
#JOHN GALE.
Do you realize that the stout - lady - in the 'bus accident was - your - aunt!!!
#TULLY.
The fat woman was Aunt Hannah? How do you know this? How do you know this?
#JOHN GALE.
Because she is here now - in your bedroom.
#TULLY.
Really. You've seen her? Have you been very nice to the old lady?
#JOHN GALE.
Nice! You should have seen what I did to her!
#TULLY.
Oh, it's not as bad as all that surely?
#PAMELA.
What's that?
#JOHN GALE.
That's Tully; I think he's gone mad.
#PAMELA.
And so has Mrs. Tully. Do you know she swore the pearl necklace you gave me belonged to her?
#JOHN GALE.
Did she really?
#PAMELA.
Yes. I can't help laughing. I gave it to her.
#JOHN GALE.
You gave her the necklace.
#PAMELA.
Yes. I certainly didn't want a scene with a woman like that.
#JOHN GALE.
Ha! Ha! You gave it to her. You gave it to her. Then the Rajah's got it back again - the Rajah's got it back again.
#PAMELA.
Don't give way, John.
#JOHN GALE.
Ha! Ha! I must give way.
#PAMELA.
But you don't know what I gave her. I didn't give her the real necklace. I was wearing the imitation one that cost thirty shillings.
#JOHN GALE.
You gave her the imitation one?
#PAMELA.
Yes.
#JOHN GALE.
Are you sure?
#PAMELA.
Yes, I have the real one here. It has a crown on the clasp. See! John! John! I've - I've given her the real one - I remember now - I changed it at mother's. I did change it. John, I've given her the real necklace!
#JOHN GALE.
There, there, dear, don't go mad. It can't be helped. We all make mistakes.
#PAMELA.
Something must be done. This will kill mother.
#JOHN GALE.
We must chance that.
#PAMELA.
Couldn't Mr. Tully get the necklace back for me?
#JOHN GALE.
No, impossible!
#PAMELA.
Impossible, why?
#JOHN GALE.
I'll tell you a secret, Pam, Tully's a wrong 'un. wrong 'un?
#JOHN GALE.
Yes, he's a dark horse. And I'll tell you something else. That isn't Mrs. Tully; that's Tully's little weakness. He calls her Agnes, and that's the type of man Mr. Tully is.
#PAMELA.
I had my suspicions. Then perhaps there's time for me to catch her before she finds the Rajah.
#JOHN GALE.
Come back, Pam. Come back!
#AUNT HANNAH.
Where is my nephew, sir? Where is my nephew?
#JOHN GALE.
Ah, Aunt Hannah! He's afraid to meet you until you forgive me for all I've done. There's been a most absurd mistake caused by your likeness to Bertram. If you'll only let me explain.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Really, I don't think it matters.
#JOHN GALE.
But you've no idea what a wonderful likeness there is - except of course - you look the younger.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Oh, no, I don't.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh yes you do.
#AUNT HANNAH.
Oh, no, I don't!
#JOHN GALE.
Then all is forgiven?
#AUNT HANNAH.
Why, of course!
#TULLY.
Aunt Hannah!
#AUNT HANNAH.
Bertie, my boy, my boy!
#PAMELA.
John, it's too late; the Rajah's gone and taken the necklace with him!
#JOHN GALE.
Thank heaven! And I'll save up your money and buy you another - and that's the truth!
#PAMELA.
But you always do tell me the truth, John.
#JOHN GALE.
But in future I'm going to tell you better truth. And now we can go home in safety. Oh, Bertram, where are you going?
#TULLY.
I'm going to take Auntie down to the Mission.
#JOHN GALE.
Then, good - night!!
#AUNT HANNAH.
Bertie, I'll just go and put my bonnet on.
#MAMIE.
Bertie!
#TULLY.
Oh!
#MAMIE.
I've got rid of the Rajah. Will you take me out to supper?
#TULLY.
Certainly not!
#MAMIE.
Don't be unkind.
#TULLY.
I couldn't dream of such a thing.
#MAMIE.
Oh, Bertie, why not?
#TULLY.
I've promised to take Auntie down to the Mission.
#MAMIE.
Tell Auntie you're going on a much nicer mission. You will come - say yes - Bertie! Bertie!
#TULLY.
Oh, Fluffie!!
