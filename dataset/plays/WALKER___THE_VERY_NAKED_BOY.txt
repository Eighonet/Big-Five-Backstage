#HE.
Genevieve!
#SHE.
Well?
#HE.
Why did you -
#SHE.
I didn't.
#HE.
I beg your pardon, you may not have known it, but you did.
#SHE.
I didn't.
#HE.
If you'll only say you didn't mean it.
#SHE.
I didn't do it.
#HE.
Now, Genevieve, you know -
#SHE.
I didn't.
#HE.
Well, why did you - ?
#SHE.
I didn't do it!
#HE.
Well, if you didn't do it, dear - Why did you run away the moment I came up to you?
#SHE.
I didn't run away - I just came out here.
#HE.
But you seemed to be trying to avoid me.
#SHE.
Why should I avoid you?
#HE.
Genevieve! You make it impossible for me to talk to you... I'll apologise if it will help.
#SHE.
Why should you apologise?
#HE.
Perhaps I've misconstrued your meaning.
#SHE.
I didn't mean anything - - because I didn't do it.
#HE.
Now, Genevieve, I saw you do it.
#SHE.
You'll have to excuse me, Mr. Gordon, from further discussion.
#HE.
But, Genevieve -
#SHE.
I didn't do it - and besides if I did what difference does it make? I'm free white and twenty - one.
#HE.
How old did you say?
#SHE.
I said I was free white.
#HE.
But, Genevieve, you must admit that -
#SHE.
Mr. Gordon!
#HE.
Please call me Henry.
#SHE.
I don't see why I should.
#HE.
You did last night.
#SHE.
That was different. You were Dr. Jekyll last night.
#HE.
Oh, Genevieve -
#SHE.
You're showing your true colors tonight.
#HE.
I'm - sorry -
#SHE.
You're a tyrant.
#HE.
I don't mean to be. I think you're wo -
#SHE.
Now don't be personal. I'm not interested in your thoughts.
#HE.
But, Genevieve, won't you tell me why you did it?
#SHE.
I did it because - I've told you often enough I didn't do it.
#HE.
Joe -
#SHE.
Joe - what?
#HE.
Joe squeezed your hand.
#SHE.
Well, it's my hand, and besides I don't see why I should be cross - questioned by you.
#HE.
You know I'm -
#SHE.
You're what?
#HE.
I'm crazy about you.
#SHE.
Please, Mr. Gordon!
#HE.
Call me Henry! Just once.
#SHE.
I don't see why I should.
#HE.
Please, Genevieve.
#SHE.
Now don't be silly!
#HE.
Oh, Genevieve, if you only knew how it hurt me when you did it!
#SHE.
Did it hurt you?
#HE.
I could have killed Joe - gladly.
#SHE.
Honest!
#HE.
You know - you must know!
#SHE.
You certainly are calm about it.
#HE.
What can I do? I can't be ridiculous.
#SHE.
Did you really see us?
#HE.
Yes, I saw you.
#SHE.
You seemed terribly tied up with Ethel.
#HE.
I had to sit by her.
#SHE.
I don't see why.
#HE.
I didn't have any place else to go.
#SHE.
I knew you were looking.
#HE.
Then why did you do it?
#SHE.
Don't ask me why. I loathe why.
#HE.
But oh, Genevieve, I love you so!
#SHE.
Please, let go of my hand.
#HE.
Genevieve, isn't there any chance for me?
#SHE.
I've never thought of such a thing. What do you mean!
#HE.
I mean I love you.
#SHE.
.. Yes?
#HE.
Aren't you interested?
#SHE.
Why, really, Mr. Gordon, you ask such strange questions.
#HE.
Oh, Genevieve - Genevieve -
#SHE.
Don't be silly.
#HE.
When a man's in love he always does silly things.
#SHE.
Always?
#HE.
Oh, Genevieve -
#SHE.
I have the next dance with -
#HE.
Joe, I suppose.
#SHE.
Excuse me, please.
#HE.
You shall not go. You shall listen to me. You have no right to treat me as a plaything when I love you so! I love you so! I love you so! I think of you all day long, I lie awake at night wondering what stars are looking upon you and I find myself envying them - every one of them. I won't listen. You must hear me out. I've waited days and days and days for this chance to speak to you, and you've trailed me about like - like - like a poodle. I'm tired of it because I love you so.
#HE.
I want you to marry me, and marry me you shall if I have to carry you away with me. Oh, Genevieve, my darling Genevieve, just know that for this moment I am almost completely happy. You are close to me and I do not feel any struggle against me. Oh, if you will only listen to me, I do not mean to be brutal. I have torn your dress. I have mussed your precious hair. But I love you so! I love you so!
#SHE.
Oh, Henry - Henry - You are so wonderful!
#BOY.
Get her out of here!
#SHE.
Oh, Henry, Henry, have I been cruel to you?
#HE.
We'd better go.
#SHE.
Please let's stay here.
#SHE.
I saw you first - do you remember - at Poughkeepsie.
#HE.
Yes, yes -
#SHE.
I think - I liked you then... But I never thought you'd be so wonderful.
#HE.
Let's go Darling, let's go.
#SHE.
No, I want to stay here. I love this nook. I should love to fill it full of great tall lilies. Henry, there's a man behind those curtains!
#HE.
I think we'd better go.
#SHE.
Oh, Henry, you're not going to leave him here.
#HE.
We'd better.
#BOY.
Yes, you'd better, because I'm going to get out of here.
#SHE.
Bob! You get your clothes on!
#BOY.
I told Mr. Gordon to get my clothes.
#SHE.
Mr. Gordon -
#BOY.
Call him Henry - just once - please, Genevieve.
#HE.
I'll get your clothes. Where are they?
#BOY.
In my room.
#HE.
What do you want?
#BOY.
Everything.
#SHE.
Don't be common, Robert.
#HE.
No, I'm not going.
#SHE.
Hen - Mr. Gordon!... Very well. I'll go!
#HE.
No, you won't go either!
#SHE.
Please!
#BOY.
Well, I'll go.
#SHE.
Oh, Bob, if you won't get out I'll do anything for you.
#BOY.
Well, I'm cold.
#SHE.
Mr. Gordon, please go.
#HE.
I won't go!
#SHE.
You are very strange, indeed... I'll go!
#SHE.
Never mind.
#BOY.
Oh, Henry, it's Ethel.
#HE.
Bob, won't you be a good sport? We'll turn our backs.
#BOY.
But will everybody else turn their back?
#HE.
Old man, can't you see how it is? We're - we're going to be engaged - and Ethel is out there - and - and - well -
#BOY.
Joe's out there, too.
#HE.
Well, yes.
#SHE.
Bob, I shall tell Father on you.
#BOY.
All right, go ahead. I'll tell Ethel.
#SHE.
Just wait.
#BOY.
I'll get out of here!
#HE.
Bob, be a man! You are childish and common. You are old enough to know better and I think it's an outrage for you to subject your sister to this fright. We can't go out of here just now - and you're making it very embarrassing for us.
#SHE.
Mr. Gordon - there's a cape in that closet. Will you get it for Bob... He says he's cold.
#SHE.
Bob, I'll get even with you. You ought to be ashamed. I'm humiliated.
#BOY.
Why - Sis?
#SHE.
Imagine my being with a gentleman and having a very naked boy pop into the conversation.
#HE.
Here's the cape.
#BOY.
Why don't you smother me!
#SHE.
Bob, be careful.
#BOY.
I can't go through the hall looking like this.
#SHE.
You must.
#HE.
Go away, Bob. Your sister is very nervous.
#HE.
Why -
#SHE.
Bob - I thought - How did you - Why didn't you - What were you doing in there?
#BOY.
Father was going to get strict and keep me off the water tonight and just as I came down here to get my sweater I heard him coming to the coat room so I jumped behind the curtains and let him pass and then Joe and Ethel came in and I couldn't let them see me this way. And then somebody else came and then you came in - well, I got cold.
#HE.
Run on now, Bob, the hall is clear.
#BOY.
What was it you did, Sis?
#SHE.
I didn't do it.
#BOY.
Why didn't you do it?
#SHE.
I didn't do anything.
#BOY.
He said Joe squeezed your hand.
#SHE.
Absurd!
#BOY.
Well, I hope not, because he and Ethel got engaged in here too! as he reaches out for her]. "Bob."
