#O-SODE-SAN.
Oi!... Oi!... Obaa - San!
#O-KATSU-SAN.
Obaa - San!... Grandmother!
#O-SODE-SAN.
She is not there.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
Poor Obaa - San.
#O-SODE-SAN.
Why do you always pity Obaa - San? Are her clothes not whole? Has she not her full store of rice?
#O-KATSU-SAN.
Ay!
#O-SODE-SAN.
Then what more can one want - a full hand, a full belly, and a warm body! full heart, perhaps.
#O-SODE-SAN.
What does Obaa - San know of a heart, silly O - Katsu? She has had no husband to die and leave her alone. She has had no child to die and leave her arms empty.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
Hai! Hai! She does not know.
#O-SODE-SAN.
She has had no lover to smile upon her and then - pass on.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
But Obaa - San is not happy.
#O-SODE-SAN.
Pss - s!
#O-KATSU-SAN.
She may be lonely because she has never had any one to love or to love her.
#O-SODE-SAN.
How could one love Obaa - San? She is too hideous for love. She would frighten the children away - and even a drunken lover would laugh in her ugly face. Obaa - San! The grandmother!
#O-KATSU-SAN.
O - Sode, might we not be too cruel to her?
#O-SODE-SAN.
If we could not laugh at Obaa - San, how then could we laugh? She has been sent from the dome of the sky for our mirth.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
I do not know! I do not know! Sometimes I think I hear tears in her laugh!
#O-SODE-SAN.
Pss - s! That is no laugh. Obaa - San cackles like an old hen.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
I think she is unhappy now and then - always, perhaps.
#O-SODE-SAN.
Has she not her weeping willow tree - the grandmother?
#O-KATSU-SAN.
Ay. She loves the tree.
#O-SODE-SAN.
The grandmother of the weeping willow tree! It's well for the misshapen, and the childless, and the loveless to have a tree to love.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
But, O - Sode, the weeping willow tree can not love her. Perhaps even old Obaa - San longs for love.
#O-SODE-SAN.
Do we not come daily to her to talk to her? And to ask her all about her weeping willow tree?
#O-KATSU-SAN.
Oi! Obaa - San.
#O-SODE-SAN.
What was that, O - Katsu?
#O-KATSU-SAN.
Someone sighed - a deep, hard sigh.
#O-SODE-SAN.
Oi! Obaa - San! Grandmother!
#O-KATSU-SAN.
It seemed to come from the weeping willow tree.
#O-SODE-SAN.
O - Katsu! Perhaps some evil spirit haunts the tree.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
Some hideous Gaki! Like the Gaki of Kokoru - the evil ghost that can feed only on the unrest of humans. Their unhappiness is his food. He has to find misery in order to live, and win his way back once more to humanity. To different men he changes his shape at will, and sometimes is invisible.
#O-SODE-SAN.
Quick, Katsu, let us go to the shrine - and pray - and pray.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
Ay. There!
#THE GAKI.
Why did you sigh?
#THE TREE.
O Gaki of Kokoru! My heart hangs within me like the weight of years on Obaa - San.
#THE GAKI.
Why did you moan?
#THE TREE.
The tree is growing - and it tears my heart.
#THE GAKI.
I live upon your unrest. Feed me! Feed me!
#THE TREE.
Please! Please! Give me my freedom.
#THE GAKI.
Where then should I feed? Unless I feed on your unhappiness I should cease to live - and I must live.
#THE TREE.
Someone else, perchance, may suffer in my stead.
#THE GAKI.
I care not where or how I feed. I am in the sixth hell, and if I die in this shape I must remain in this hell through all the eternities. One like me must feed his misery by making others miserable. I can not rise through the other five hells to human life unless I have human misery for my food.
#THE TREE.
Oh, can't you feed on joy - on happiness, on faith?
#THE GAKI.
Faith? Yes, perhaps - but only on perfect faith. If I found perfect faith - ah, then - I dare not dream. - There is no faith.
#THE TREE.
Do not make me suffer more. Let me enjoy the loveliness of things.
#THE GAKI.
Would you have someone else suffer in your stead?
#THE TREE.
Someone else - someone else -
#THE GAKI.
Ay - old Obaa - San - she whom they call the grandmother.
#THE GAKI.
She will suffer in your stead.
#THE TREE.
No! No! She loves me! She of all the world loves me! No - not she!
#THE GAKI.
It shall be she!
#THE TREE.
I shall not leave!
#THE GAKI.
You give me better food than I have ever known. You wait! You wait!
#THE TREE.
Here comes Obaa - San! Do not let her suffer for me!
#THE GAKI.
You shall be free - as free as anyone can be - when I have made the misery of Obaa - San complete.
#THE TREE.
She has never fully known her misery. Her heart is like an iron - bound chest long - locked, with the key lost.
#THE GAKI.
We shall find the key! We shall find the key!
#THE TREE.
I shall warn her.
#THE GAKI.
Try!
#THE TREE.
Alas! I can not make her hear! I can not tell her anything.
#THE GAKI.
She can not understand you! She can not see me unless I wish! Earth people never see or hear!
#THE TREE.
Hai! Hai! Hai!
#OBAA-SAN.
My tree! My little tree! Why do you sigh?
#THE TREE.
Hai! Hai! Hai!
#OBAA-SAN.
Sometimes I think I pity you. Yes, dear tree!
#THE TREE.
Hai! Hai! Hai!
#THE GAKI.
Now I am a traveller. She sees me pleasantly. - Grandmother!
#OBAA-SAN.
Ay, sir!
#THE GAKI.
Which way to Kyushu?
#OBAA-SAN.
You have lost your way. Far, far back beyond the ferry landing at Ishiyama to your right. That is the way to Kyushu.
#THE GAKI.
Ah, me!
#OBAA-SAN.
You are tired. Will you not sit and rest? - Will you not have some rice?
#THE GAKI.
Oh, no. - Where is your brood, grandmother?
#OBAA-SAN.
I have no brood. I am no grandmother. I am no mother.
#THE GAKI.
What! Are there tears in your voice?
#OBAA-SAN.
Tears! Why should I weep?
#THE GAKI.
I do not know, grandmother!
#OBAA-SAN.
I am no grandmother! - Who sent you here to laugh at me? - O - Sode - San? 'Tis she who laughs at me, because -
#THE GAKI.
No one, old woman -
#OBAA-SAN.
Yes, yes, old woman. That is it. Old woman! - Who are you? I am not wont to cry my griefs to any one.
#THE GAKI.
Griefs? You have griefs?
#OBAA-SAN.
Ay! Even I - she whom they call Obaa - San - have griefs. - Even I! But they are locked deep within me. No one knows!
#THE GAKI.
Someone must know.
#OBAA-SAN.
I shall tell no one.
#THE GAKI.
Someone must know!
#OBAA-SAN.
You speak like some spirit - and I feel that I must obey.
#THE GAKI.
Someone must know!
#OBAA-SAN.
I shall not speak. Who cares? - What is it I shall do? Tell my story - unlock my heart - so that O - Sode - San may laugh and laugh and laugh. Is it not enough that some evil spirit feeds upon my deep unrest?
#THE GAKI.
How can one feed upon your unrest when you lock it in your heart? Here come some friends of yours. Tell them your tale.
#OBAA-SAN.
Strange. I feel that I must speak out my heart.
#O-SODE-SAN.
Good morning, grandmother!
#OBAA-SAN.
Good morning, O - Sode - San. Good morning, O - Katsu - San. May the bright day bring you a bright heart.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
And you, Obaa - San.
#O-SODE-SAN.
How is the weeping willow tree, grandmother?
#OBAA-SAN.
It is there - close to me.
#O-SODE-SAN.
And does it speak to you, grandmother -
#OBAA-SAN.
I am no grandmother! I am no grandmother! I am no mother! O - Sode, can you not understand? I am no mother. - I am no wife. - There is no one. - I am only an old woman. - In the spring I see the world turn green and I hear the song of happy birds and feel the perfumed balmy air upon my cheek - and every spring that cheek is older and more wrinkled and I have always been alone. I see the stars on a summer night and listen for the dawn - and there never has been a strong hand to touch me nor tiny fingers to reach out for me. I have heard the crisp autumn winds fight the falling leaves and I have known that long winter days and nights were coming - and I have always been alone - alone. I have pretended to you - what else could I do? Grandmother! Grandmother! Every time you speak the name, the emptiness of my life stands before me like a royal Kakemono all covered with unliving people.
#O-SODE-SAN.
You never seemed to care.
#OBAA-SAN.
Did I not care! Grandmother! Grandmother! Why? Because I loved a weeping willow tree. Because to me it was real. It was my baby. But no lover ever came to woo. No words ever came to me. - Think you, O - Sode - San, that the song of birds in the branches is ease to an empty heart. Think you that the wind amongst the leaves soothes the mad unrest in here. I have no one - no one. I talk to my weeping willow tree - but there is no answer - no answer, O - Sode - San - only stillness - and yet - sometimes I think I hear a sigh. - Grandmother! Grandmother! There! Is that enough? I've bared my heart to you. Go spread the news - I am lonely and old - old. - I have always been lonely. Go spread the news.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
No, Obaa - San. We shall not spread the news. No one shall know.
#O-SODE-SAN.
But - we pity you.
#OBAA-SAN.
I need no pity. - Now my heart is unlocked. The dread Gaki of Kokoru who feeds upon unrest can come to me and feed upon my pain. I care not.
#THE TREE.
Hai! Hai! Hai!
#O-KATSU-SAN.
Someone sighs.
#OBAA-SAN.
Yes. It is my tree. Perhaps there, too, someone in deep distress is imprisoned - as I am imprisoned in this body. - Hai! You do not know. You do not know!
#O-SODE-SAN.
Obaa - San - we have been hurting. I never knew - I am sorry, Obaa - San.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
You have been lonely, Obaa - San, but you have always been lonely. I know the having and I know the losing.
#O-SODE-SAN.
Ay. 'Tis better to long for love than to have it - and then lose. Look at me, whom the villagers call the bitter one. He came to me so long ago. - It was spring, Obaa - San, and perfume filled the air and birds were singing and his voice was like the voice from the sky - dome - all clear and wonderful. Together we saw the cherry trees bloom - once: and on a summer night we saw the wonder of the firefly fÃªte. My heart was young and life was beautiful. We watched the summer moon - and when the autumn came - Ai! Ai! Ai! Obaa - San. - I knew a time of love - and oh, the time of hopelessness! And I shut my heart. I did not see, Obaa - San.
#OBAA-SAN.
You knew his love, O - Sode - San. You touched his hand.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
But what is that? To her - my little girl - I gave all my dreams. I felt her baby hands in mine and in the night I could reach out to her. I lived for her. And then, one day - Obaa - San, I had known the joy of motherhood and I had known the ecstasy of - child - and now - Her little life with me was only a dream of spring, but still my back is warm with the touch of her babyhood. The little toys still dance before my eyes. Oh, that was long ago. - Now all is black.
#OBAA-SAN.
All blackness can never fill a mother's heart. - O - Katsu - San, you have known the baby's hand in yours. But I am old - and I have never known, can never know. - I'd go to the lowest hells if once I might but know the touch of my own child's hand.
#THE TREE.
Hai! Hai! Hai
#OBAA-SAN.
Just once - for one short day - to fill the empty place in my heart that has always been empty - and a pain -
#O-SODE-SAN.
Who is that man, Obaa - San?
#OBAA-SAN.
There? That is a stranger seeking for Kyushu.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
He seems to wish to speak to you. strange man. 'Twas he who seemed to make me unlock my heart to you.
#O-SODE-SAN.
Then shall we go. - And we'll return, Obaa - San.
#OBAA-SAN.
Grandmother!
#O-KATSU-SAN.
We'll laugh no more.
#THE GAKI.
Obaa - San, for so they called you, tell me - did you say you'd go to the lowest hells if you might know the touch of your own child?
#OBAA-SAN.
Forever - could I but fill this emptiness in my mother - heart.
#THE GAKI.
Would you really pay?
#OBAA-SAN.
Yes, yes. But why do you ask? - Who are you?
#THE GAKI.
I am a stranger bound for Kyushu.
#OBAA-SAN.
Why do you, too, make sport of me?
#THE GAKI.
Go you into your house and come not till I call.
#THE TREE.
Hai! Hai! Hai
#THE GAKI.
You can not feed me now. That cry was the wind amongst your branches. Come. I bid you come to life, to human form.
#THE TREE.
I do not wish to come.
#THE GAKI.
I bid you come!
#THE GAKI.
You are free.
#AOYAGI.
Free!
#THE GAKI.
As free as one in life. You are bound to the tree as one might be bound to his body in a dream - but you may wander as one wanders in a dream - free until the waking - then when the tree suffers, you shall suffer. Though you be leagues away, you shall suffer. - But first you shall dream. - Now you are to be the daughter of Obaa - San.
#AOYAGI.
Oi!
#THE GAKI.
Do not call yet. - You are to wed the first young man who passes here and you are to follow him.
#AOYAGI.
But - Obaa - San?
#THE GAKI.
She shall feed me with her new - made misery.
#AOYAGI.
No - no - she loved me so!
#THE GAKI.
She shall feed me. You will be happy.
#AOYAGI.
Free! And happy!
#AOYAGI.
Hai. dream!
#AOYAGI.
Mother -
#OBAA-SAN.
Have you lost your way?
#AOYAGI.
No, mother -
#OBAA-SAN.
How beautiful the name! But I am only Obaa - San. Your mother -
#AOYAGI.
Obaa - San, my mother.
#OBAA-SAN.
Obaa - San - your mother - where is my pain? And you - who are you?
#AOYAGI.
I am Aoyagi, mother.
#OBAA-SAN.
You have not lost your way?
#AOYAGI.
I have but just found my way.
#OBAA-SAN.
My pain is stilled. There is no emptiness. It is a dream - a dream of spring and butterflies - Aoyagi!
#OBAA-SAN.
I seem never to have known a time when you were not here.
#AOYAGI.
Oh, mother dear, it is now - and now is always, if we will.
#OBAA-SAN.
It seems as though the weeping willow tree had warmed and shown its heart to me.
#AOYAGI.
I am the Lady of the Weeping Willow tree!
#OBAA-SAN.
I care not who or what you are. You are here - close to my heart and I have waited always. I know I dream - I know.
#AOYAGI.
How long I've tried to speak to you!
#OBAA-SAN.
How long my heart has yearned for you!
#AOYAGI.
Mother!
#THE GAKI.
Such happiness. Already she has forgotten the coming of the man.
#OBAA-SAN.
Oh, how I've dreamed of you! When I was very, very young and had my little doll, I dreamed of you. I used to sing a lullaby and still I sing it in my heart: I grew into womanhood and still I dreamed of you. And, dreaming still, I grew old. And all the world it seemed to me, made sport of my longing and my loneliness. The people of the village called me grandmother. The children echoed the grownups' cry and ran from me. Now - Aoyagi - you are here. Oh, the warmth - the peace. Come let me gather flowers for the house. Let me -
#AOYAGI.
Oh, mother, dear. I am so happy here.
#OBAA-SAN.
Are you - truly? - Are you warm? - You are hungry!
#AOYAGI.
No - I am just happy.
#OBAA-SAN.
I shall bring you - a surprise.
#THE GAKI.
You seem very happy, Aoyagi. And your mother is very happy, too. - And I am hungry now.
#AOYAGI.
You will not hurt her! Let me go back to the Weeping Willow Tree -
#THE GAKI.
That would kill her - perhaps.
#AOYAGI.
No - no - I should be near her then - always.
#THE GAKI.
But where would I have my food? Not in your heart, not in hers - I should starve and I must live.
#AOYAGI.
What then?
#THE GAKI.
See!
#RIKI.
You are she!
#AOYAGI.
My - who - are - you?
#RIKI.
I am a poet - I have sought everywhere for you.
#AOYAGI.
I am the Lady of the Weeping Willow Tree!
#RIKI.
You are my love.
#AOYAGI.
I am the daughter of Obaa - San.
#RIKI.
I love you so!
#AOYAGI.
Yes - I love you so! - But I love Obaa - San, my mother -
#RIKI.
Come with me.
#AOYAGI.
But Obaa - San -
#RIKI.
Come with me. Butterfly, butterfly, alight upon the Willow Tree And if you rest not well, then fly home to me. See! I make a little verse for you.
#AOYAGI.
But - Obaa - San - is very old and very lonely.
#RIKI.
She is your mother. - She must be glad to let you go.
#AOYAGI.
She does not know you.
#RIKI.
I know you.
#AOYAGI.
Yes - but I can not leave Obaa - San.
#RIKI.
We can not stay with Obaa - San.
#AOYAGI.
Can we not take her with us?
#RIKI.
No - like the Oshidori - we can go only by two and two along the silent stream - and as Oshidori in silence and in happiness float on and on and seem to cleave the mirrored sky that lies deep within the dark waters, so we must go, we two, just you and I, to some silent place where only you and I may be - and look and look until we see the thousand years of love in each other's hearts.
#AOYAGI.
Something speaks to me above the pity for poor Obaa - San.
#RIKI.
It is love.
#AOYAGI.
I love Obaa - San.
#RIKI.
This is love beyond love. This is earth and air - sea and sky.
#AOYAGI.
I do not even know your name.
#RIKI.
What does my name matter? I am I - you are you.
#AOYAGI.
I love Obaa - San, my mother. - I feel happy in her arms; - I felt at peace; - but now I feel that I must go to you. - I am fearful - yet I must go. - You are -
#RIKI.
I am Riki. But what can Riki mean that already my eyes have not said?
#AOYAGI.
I feel a strange unrest - that is happiness.
#RIKI.
Come!
#AOYAGI.
First let me speak to Obaa - San.
#RIKI.
Look - out there - a mountain gleaming in the fresh spring air. - Amongst the trees I know a glade that waits for you and me. - A little stream comes plashing by and silver fishes leap from pool to pool - dazzling jewels in the leaf - broken sunlight. Tall bamboo trees planted deep in the father earth reach up to the sky. - And there the hand of some great god can reach down to us and feed our happiness -
#AOYAGI.
Riki - I must go - I feel the strong hand leading me - I feel the happy pain - I long - I would stay with Obaa - San; but, Riki, I must go. - Yon mountain gleaming in the sun - the bamboo trees - the silver fishes - you -
#OBAA-SAN.
When do you go?
#AOYAGI.
Obaa - San, my mother - something outside of me calls and I must obey.
#OBAA-SAN.
I understand. - It must be wonderful, my little daughter.
#AOYAGI.
Mother! - This is Riki.
#OBAA-SAN.
Riki! - See that you bring her happiness.
#RIKI.
I could not fail. I have searched for her always.
#OBAA-SAN.
We always search for someone - we humans. - Sometimes we find - sometimes we wait always.
#AOYAGI.
Riki, I must not go. Obaa - San is my mother - and I am all she has.
#OBAA-SAN.
Yes, Aoyagi, you are all I have and that is why I can let you go. Be happy -
#AOYAGI.
But you, my mother.
#OBAA-SAN.
For my sake, be happy. Some day I shall be Obaa - San no more - and what of you then? Go, my little darling, go with Riki. - Some day, you will return.
#RIKI.
We shall return some day, Obaa - San.
#AOYAGI.
Farewell.
#OBAA-SAN.
Hai! - Hai!
#THE GAKI.
Oi! Obaa - San!
#OBAA-SAN.
Did you not find your way?
#THE GAKI.
I found my way. - But why this unhappiness in your eyes?
#OBAA-SAN.
I am very lonely. I have lived my lifelong dream of spring and butterflies a single instant - and it is gone.
#THE GAKI.
I feed! I feed! Here are your friends again.
#O-SODE-SAN.
Hai! Obaa - San, a little lady passed and told us you were lonely.
#OBAA-SAN.
I am lonely. - But I have always been lonely.
#O-SODE-SAN.
What has happened?
#OBAA-SAN.
I waited, oh so long - you know. - I opened my arms. - My dream came true. - I sang my lullaby - to my child. - A lover came; - they have gone.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
She is a - wander in her mind.
#OBAA-SAN.
I opened my arms here - like this. - She stepped into them as though she had been there always - and now she has gone. - In one short moment I lived my mother - life.
#O-SODE-SAN.
It was magic! Come, Obaa - San, we'll make some prayers to burn.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
Some evil ghost.
#OBAA-SAN.
No! No! Some kindly spirit from the sky - dome came to me. - I have had one moment of happiness complete. - I dreamed and I have known. Now I shall dream again - a greater dream - a greater dream.
#THE GAKI.
What! I can not feed! My Lady of the Weeping Willow Tree is gone! Obaa - San has built a circle of happiness about her head. Hai! I shall die in this shape. - I must feed. - Perhaps she tries to trick me. - I shall listen. - Why does she not weep? - Why do they not wail? :
#THE GAKI.
I'll find them in the bamboo glade. Perhaps I can make unhappiness there. Riki and Aoyagi!
#THE GAKI.
This is the glade on the mountain side - the glade where Aoyagi and Riki think to find their happiness. Here must I feed or I shall die in this shape. - Hai! - They come.
#RIKI.
.. and so like every other prince who is a real prince, he charged to the top of the hill before his men; and they, following him, fell upon the enemy and victory was theirs.
#AOYAGI.
And then - ?
#RIKI.
And then the Princess laid her hand upon her heart.
#AOYAGI.
Is that all?
#RIKI.
Is that all? What more need there be?
#AOYAGI.
Did they not wed and have great happiness?
#RIKI.
You can answer that. I never heard the story before.
#RIKI.
One may always end a story - just right.
#AOYAGI.
Not a weeping willow tree?
#RIKI.
Even a weeping willow tree!
#AOYAGI.
How?
#RIKI.
I'll show you. - Stand right here. - So! I stand here. - Now look at me.
#AOYAGI.
I am looking.
#RIKI.
Place your hand upon your heart.
#AOYAGI.
Ay.
#RIKI.
Now I am the Prince. With sword in hand I come to you. From Kyushu to Koban I've fought my way to you; - through forest, marsh and mountain path I've striven for you. Now I am here. - Look at me.
#AOYAGI.
Ah!
#RIKI.
And did they wed?
#AOYAGI.
Ah, love beyond love.
#RIKI.
And did they have great happiness?
#AOYAGI.
Ah!
#RIKI.
My little princess! I did not come to you sword in hand; I did not fight my way from Kyushu to Koban. But I strove for you through forest, marsh and mountain pass. - Within me throbbed a mighty song that I could not sing. I saw almost all the world, it seems, and once I heard a voice that seemed to call to me alone. It was at the ferry of Ishiyama. I followed the sound - and there she stood all aglow in the morning sunlight. But when I saw, the song still throbbed within my heart and I could not sing to her. - Someone else called to me - "Hai! Hai! Hai!"
#AOYAGI.
And what of her - the vision at the ferry of Ishiyama?
#RIKI.
For all I know she may still be standing there in the morning sunlight all aglow. - I have found you!
#AOYAGI.
And was she - fair?
#RIKI.
Ay - how can I say? Now all the world is fair because I see only you in earth and sky and everything.
#AOYAGI.
She was aglow in the morning sun.
#RIKI.
How can I say? I heard her voice; - a song was in my heart - a song for you. - I saw her - the song staid locked in my heart for you.
#AOYAGI.
Riki - Riki - dream that's true.
#AOYAGI.
I do not understand it all. - Obaa - San - you - this happiness. - I have known happiness, but not like this. - When I was in the weeping willow tree - sometimes I was happy and sometimes I was hurt. - Oh, Riki, Riki, this glade is like the weeping willow tree! Whenever the soft air sways the leaves, I feel the same sweet joy as when the little breezes played amongst my branches. The rain - oh, the gentle little rain that cooled me in the hot summer - the drops that danced from leaf to leaf and felt like smiles upon my face. Tears! The rain is not like tears, Riki.
#RIKI.
The dew is tears, perhaps.
#AOYAGI.
The dew! It came to me like a cool veil that the morning sun would lift and little breezes bear away. Then sometimes - the voice, the loneliness of Obaa - San.
#RIKI.
Look where her home lies. Far down there beyond that stream, see - there is Kyushu.
#AOYAGI.
Oh, Riki, my Riki, my august lord, why, why can I stay here in happiness with you when I know that Obaa - San is miserable and alone?
#RIKI.
I can not say? I only know that we are here - you and I - and we are happy. Two make a world, Aoyagi. Why? How? I do not know.
#AOYAGI.
Can we not send a message to Obaa - San?
#RIKI.
Yes. I shall go down the mountain to the road and tell some passer - by.
#AOYAGI.
And I?
#RIKI.
Sit here and rest - and watch the silver stream at Kyushu.
#AOYAGI.
I shall wait - I shall wait.
#RIKI.
Sayonara.
#AOYAGI.
Sayonara. - Sayonara, my august lord. Oh, Kyushu! The silver stream at Kyushu! : Poor Obaa - San!
#THE GAKI.
I have lost my way.
#AOYAGI.
Whither are you bound?
#THE GAKI.
I am a stranger bound for Kyushu.
#AOYAGI.
There is Kyushu.
#THE GAKI.
I am told there is a ferry on the way to Kyushu.
#AOYAGI.
Yes, - at Ishiyama.
#THE GAKI.
At - Ishiyama.
#AOYAGI.
Why do you speak so?
#THE GAKI.
I merely echoed your own words.
#AOYAGI.
I did not say them so terribly.
#THE GAKI.
What is in your heart came into your voice, perhaps.
#AOYAGI.
There is the way to Kyushu.
#THE GAKI.
Down that path?
#AOYAGI.
Yes. Did you not meet Riki?
#THE GAKI.
Riki?
#AOYAGI.
Yes, my august lord.
#THE GAKI.
I passed no one - except - a tall woman who was climbing slowly and singing a wonderful song - which I had heard once near the ferry at Ishiyama.
#AOYAGI.
But Riki just left me here. You must have passed him on the way.
#THE GAKI.
The by - paths are many and the trysting places are secret - like this.
#AOYAGI.
Riki would take no by - path. My august lord needs no trysting place save this.
#THE GAKI.
I do not know. I saw no Riki.
#AOYAGI.
My lord needs no trysting place. I am here. He knows I am here - waiting.
#THE GAKI.
Riki?
#AOYAGI.
He knows I am waiting -
#THE GAKI.
Riki? - Oh, yes the name - I heard it - once - at the ferry at Ishiyama. He has been there.
#AOYAGI.
Yes. poet?
#AOYAGI.
Yes.
#THE GAKI.
He writes wonderful love - songs - they say.
#AOYAGI.
They?
#THE GAKI.
Yes, - the people at Ishiyama. I heard one. - It goes - let me see: "Butterfly, butterfly, alight upon the willow tree - "
#AOYAGI.
He did not speak that at Ishiyama. He made that for me.
#THE GAKI.
I heard it, strange to say, at Ishiyama. Perhaps they brought it from - where did you say?
#AOYAGI.
He made that for me only yesterday.
#THE GAKI.
And I heard it - yesterday - at Ishiyama. There the wonderful woman was singing. The one I passed just now.
#AOYAGI.
That is a mistake. - You are wrong. - I know my - Ah! what is it here - that hurts me, tears me, seems to choke me! Riki! - I am all in all to him - he told me that. - He can not make poems for another.
#THE GAKI.
I should not have told anything. - Forgive me. - I did not know. - To speak truth is deep in my heart. - I have no gracious subtleties. - I am sorry -
#AOYAGI.
In the valley there is a mist. I can no longer see the silver stream at Kyushu. - Who are you? - I am afraid! - Riki - Riki -
#THE GAKI.
He does not seem to hear. - I shall go to meet him. He went this way, you say?
#AOYAGI.
Yes. - There is a mist in the valley and I can not see the silver stream at Kyushu - Oh, the little day - the little day - of love beyond love. - Riki - my mother, Obaa - San. - Yesterday the mountain - top gleamed like the topmost heaven in the spring sunlight. Today - the valley dies in mist and the mountain - top is lost in the sky.
#RIKI.
Hai! Hai! Hai!
#RIKI.
Aoyagi!
#AOYAGI.
I must go back to Obaa - San, my mother.
#RIKI.
What has happened, Aoyagi?
#AOYAGI.
We came up the mountain path side by side, Riki. Without question I gave myself to you.
#RIKI.
Aoyagi!
#AOYAGI.
I gave my love - my love beyond love. I believed.
#RIKI.
Why not believe?
#AOYAGI.
Your first words were - "You are she!" I did not question. And now -
#RIKI.
Oh, my little love, was I gone too long?
#AOYAGI.
My love knows no time, Riki. - You were gone - how can I say? - ages.
#RIKI.
It was ages, too, to me, Aoyagi.
#AOYAGI.
I watched the silver stream at Kyushu - and I waited.
#RIKI.
What, are those tears?
#AOYAGI.
Nothing, Riki - but I feel so far away - from Obaa - San.
#RIKI.
She can bridge the distance with her heart. A mother can always bridge all distance with her heart.
#AOYAGI.
Hai!
#RIKI.
Our happiness is all she wants.
#AOYAGI.
Our happiness -
#RIKI.
Why -
#AOYAGI.
The silver fishes -
#RIKI.
What has happened, Aoyagi?
#AOYAGI.
Did you send the message to Obaa - San?
#RIKI.
Yes.
#AOYAGI.
Did you go down the path?
#RIKI.
Yes.
#AOYAGI.
Did you pass a stranger on the way?
#RIKI.
No. stranger just came by. - He came up the mountain path.
#RIKI.
I crossed the stream.
#AOYAGI.
You crossed the stream.
#RIKI.
Aoyagi - little sweetheart - I cannot understand. - What do you mean?
#AOYAGI.
Oh, Riki, Riki, I am so alone. Tell me what - why - why -
#RIKI.
Aoyagi, was I gone too long? Has some demon come to you?
#AOYAGI.
No demon came. You were gone too long.
#RIKI.
I went down the path and crossed the stream to take a shorter way. I met a stranger -
#AOYAGI.
Singing?
#RIKI.
Yes - I think she was singing.
#AOYAGI.
She was singing.
#RIKI.
What do you mean, Aoyagi?
#AOYAGI.
Who was she?
#RIKI.
I do not know. - She said she would pass Ishiyama.
#AOYAGI.
Where did you see her?
#RIKI.
Beyond the stream - in a little glade.
#AOYAGI.
Did she sing your song?
#RIKI.
My song? No.
#AOYAGI.
Did she know your songs?
#RIKI.
Aoyagi! What do you want to know?
#AOYAGI.
Did she know your song to me - "Butterfly, butterfly, alight upon the willow tree"?
#RIKI.
Perhaps. - I made that to you years ago - when you were a dream in my heart.
#AOYAGI.
At Ishiyama?
#RIKI.
Perhaps.
#AOYAGI.
Hai! - Obaa - San, my mother! - Oh, my heart - my heart -
#RIKI.
Aoyagi - what have I done? Let me comfort you!
#AOYAGI.
You leave me nothing in all the world.
#RIKI.
I give you all my world.
#AOYAGI.
Hai! Hai! Hai!
#RIKI.
Let me go and call the lady bound for Ishiyama.
#AOYAGI.
Riki! - ah!
#RIKI.
Little Aoyagi - my love - she will be tender with you. - And when your tears are gone, she'll bear your message on to Obaa - San. I'll bring her back to you.
#AOYAGI.
Riki! - No! - We came up the mountain - path together - side by side. - We - but now, Riki, we go two ways. - I to Obaa - San - you to -
#RIKI.
What do you mean?
#AOYAGI.
Go sing your songs at Ishiyama! Go make your poems to the butterfly. - I -
#RIKI.
I have made songs only for you.
#AOYAGI.
But the songs for me are on every tongue.
#RIKI.
Ay - I am proud of that.
#AOYAGI.
The lady at the ferry at Ishiyama -
#RIKI.
She learned the song to you!
#AOYAGI.
Ah!
#RIKI.
I shall find the stranger - woman and send her to you. - I can no longer help you.
#AOYAGI.
You can no longer help. - Oh - life - oh, love - this too short day -
#RIKI.
I shall stay near at hand until you return to Obaa - San.
#AOYAGI.
I shall find the path alone.
#RIKI.
I'll send the stranger - woman to you.
#AOYAGI.
Hai! Hai! Hai! I watched the sunrise only yesterday and I trembled with the wonder of the dew - cooled dawn. Life seemed all peace and - today - I have known a mother's love and my mother. - I have known a lover's touch - love beyond love. - I am waking from a dream. The Gaki said I'd waken - I'd be as free as one in life. Oh, what is this thing they call life? No happiness complete - a vision of a mountain top - a climbing to the goal - a bamboo glade - oh, the mist at Kyushu. - When I go back to Obaa - San - I shall love her so - but oh, the memory of Riki - the mountain gleaming in the sun -
#THE GAKI.
Lady, I am here again. It seemed to me that I must return to you. Something seemed to call. I feed! I feed!
#AOYAGI.
I can not go!
#THE GAKI.
You seem to suffer.
#AOYAGI.
Oh - I have lost my way in life -
#THE GAKI.
Lost your way in life? Let me help you.
#AOYAGI.
I have stood on the mountain side and I have seen the green valleys far below.
#THE GAKI.
Talk to me - as you would to yourself. - I hear but I shall not speak what I hear.
#AOYAGI.
Riki - no, I can not speak even to myself. Deep in me there is a hurt. - I can not tell - woman gives all; - the man forgets.
#AOYAGI.
But to Riki - he knows - I brought him my full belief - my all - in - all.
#THE GAKI.
Your perfect faith.
#AOYAGI.
Ay, my perfect faith. - He spoke to me and then I bowed to my august lord. - I followed him without question. - And he forgets so soon.
#THE GAKI.
Are you sure he has forgotten?
#AOYAGI.
You know - you saw the lady from Ishiyama.
#THE GAKI.
True. - I saw her.
#AOYAGI.
You did not meet him on the path.
#THE GAKI.
True. - I did not meet him on the path.
#AOYAGI.
He crossed the stream.
#THE GAKI.
Perhaps to shorten the way.
#AOYAGI.
He met her in a little glade. - Hai!
#THE GAKI.
What shall you do?
#AOYAGI.
I'll go my way. I'll return to Obaa - San.
#THE GAKI.
I'll guide you down the mountain side. - Come, we'll take the shorter way - the by - paths - across the stream - through the little glade -
#AOYAGI.
Hai!
#THE GAKI.
Come!
#AOYAGI.
No, let us go down the path. - I want to see my footprints - side by side with his.
#THE GAKI.
Perhaps they're being crushed under the feet of the lady from Ishiyama! We'll go up - up - sweet Aoyagi, to the snow peak - gleaming in the sun. - You'll find the mountain - top - not lost in the sky. - Your perfect faith! - Oh, you silly human - oh, futile love - climb, Aoyagi - climb without love. - But first we'll make footprints for the lover's eyes. - Blindness will lead him to the mists at Kyushu. - Jealousy will lead you to the lonely stars. Aoyagi! Aoyagi!... Oi!
#RIKI.
Aoyagi! - Aoyagi! Oi! - Aoyagi! Aoyagi! - Aoyagi!
#RIKI.
Aoyagi! - Aoyagi! Aoyagi! - Aoyagi!
#RIKI.
Aoyagi! - Aoyagi! - Aoyagi! - Aoyagi! Oi! Aoyagi!
#OBAA-SAN.
Oi!
#RIKI.
Obaa - San! Where is Aoyagi?
#OBAA-SAN.
Where is Aoyagi?
#RIKI.
Is she not here?
#OBAA-SAN.
She is not here. Where - Riki!
#RIKI.
I left her in the bamboo glade - and when I returned she was gone. Her footprints pointed toward the path - and then were lost.
#OBAA-SAN.
Why did you leave her?
#RIKI.
I left her because she - I left her.
#OBAA-SAN.
I do not know, Riki, what has come to pass - but this I know - I am waiting for her. - I am waiting for her. Go seek for her - and bring her back to me.
#RIKI.
I shall search for her. - Obaa - San, she -
#OBAA-SAN.
I care not what she did. I am waiting here for her.
#RIKI.
Aoyagi!
#OBAA-SAN.
She will come back to me.
#THE GAKI.
Foolish Riki! He searches in the valley. Mad Aoyagi! Alone with the lonely stars! - Oh, wondrous misery that makes itself. Good - morning, Obaa - San, my friend.
#OBAA-SAN.
Good - morning, traveller.
#THE GAKI.
Why do you rise before the dawn?
#OBAA-SAN.
I could not rest. - Why are you not at Kyushu?
#THE GAKI.
There is a mist at Kyushu - and I feared to lose my way.
#OBAA-SAN.
Did you pass a little lady - Aoyagi, by name - alone -
#THE GAKI.
It seems - I met a little lady. - She was not happy. - That one?
#OBAA-SAN.
Where?
#THE GAKI.
I am a stranger here - I cannot say. Over there - or over there.
#OBAA-SAN.
She will come to me, perhaps.
#THE GAKI.
Do you know her?
#OBAA-SAN.
She is my daughter, - Aoyagi.
#THE GAKI.
Do you not fear for her?
#OBAA-SAN.
Perhaps. - She will be here soon. - Riki has gone for her.
#THE GAKI.
She must know the way. This has been a restless night for age.
#OBAA-SAN.
Good - morning, O - Sode - San. Good - morning, O - Katsu - San. - The lily hands of sleep have passed you by. strange unrest has seized upon me. I think - and think of my little one. She is glorious in my heart, and words with wings seem to flash before my eyes like fireflies in the darkness.
#O-SODE-SAN.
I, too, have lived in words.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
Obaa - San, is it not wonderful to put a joy or pain in words?
#OBAA-SAN.
Ah, yes - if there is anyone to hear them. All my long, long years before Aoyagi came to me, my heart sang, and words freighted with my dreams and my love would come to me - here; and they would die because they found no ear attuned to them. - Tell me what you thought, O - Sode - San.
#O-SODE-SAN.
The moon in calm restlessness
#OBAA-SAN.
Every one has a poem in his heart, I believe. - What was your poem, O - Katsu?
#O-KATSU-SAN.
Oh, messenger of the other world,
#O-SODE-SAN.
And you, Obaa - San, - was it words that kept sleep from your eyes?
#OBAA-SAN.
Ay, bitter dream - words. And for the bitterness I am paying dearly. - Over and over the words came to me: Oh, I am ashamed - ashamed. - And just now Riki came to me - and told me he could not find Aoyagi.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
Hai!
#O-SODE-SAN.
Hai!
#O-SODE-SAN.
Can we not search for her?
#OBAA-SAN.
I am waiting here. - She may find her way back. - I would not have her come to an empty house. - Come - let's go within - and dream that yours and yours and mine are on their way to us. :
#AOYAGI.
Hai! Hai! Hai!
#THE GAKI.
So you have found your way - in life.
#AOYAGI.
Oh, let me go back to my tree!
#THE GAKI.
No, little Aoyagi - you would be happy then.
#AOYAGI.
Let me die!
#THE GAKI.
One can not die.
#AOYAGI.
Hai!
#THE GAKI.
Where have you been?
#AOYAGI.
So far - so far! - I am weary. - When I awoke, I was on the mountain - top - alone.
#THE GAKI.
Were there no stars?
#AOYAGI.
Oh - the stars, the lonely, lonely stars! I tried to touch them - they seemed so near. - I found the path - the glade - our footprints - strange people - I am here. Let me back! Let me back!
#THE GAKI.
And what of Riki?
#AOYAGI.
He does not care.
#THE GAKI.
And what of Obaa - San?
#AOYAGI.
What can I give to Obaa - San now - but misery? Am I never to be free?
#THE GAKI.
What would you do if you were free - climb to the mountain top to see the lonely stars?
#AOYAGI.
Hai! - Riki! - Obaa - San!
#OBAA-SAN.
Was my name spoken in the dawn?
#AOYAGI.
Mother!
#OBAA-SAN.
Nadeshiko! My little girl!
#AOYAGI.
Where is Riki?
#OBAA-SAN.
He has gone to search for you.
#AOYAGI.
Was he alone?
#OBAA-SAN.
Alone?
#AOYAGI.
Yes. Was there no woman with him - a lady from Ishiyama? lady from -
#AOYAGI.
Yes - tall - fair - singing -
#OBAA-SAN.
He was alone. A lady from Ishiyama - brought me a message in the early night -
#AOYAGI.
It was she - young?
#OBAA-SAN.
No - old.
#AOYAGI.
Had she seen Riki?
#OBAA-SAN.
Yes. On the mountain - side -
#AOYAGI.
The stranger said she was young and fair.
#OBAA-SAN.
Perhaps the stranger did not see with honest eyes.
#AOYAGI.
He would not lie.
#OBAA-SAN.
Sometimes the eyes and the ears lie.
#AOYAGI.
Ah!
#OBAA-SAN.
And if she had been young and fair?
#AOYAGI.
Riki met her in a glade.
#OBAA-SAN.
Did you see them meet?
#AOYAGI.
No - she was singing. happy song, perhaps.
#AOYAGI.
She sang the song he made to me.
#OBAA-SAN.
How do you know?
#AOYAGI.
Riki said she knew his song to me.
#OBAA-SAN.
Ah, that is beautiful, that she should love his song to you.
#AOYAGI.
He -
#OBAA-SAN.
My little darling, I do not know what really happened; but this I know, you did not speak fairly to Riki or Riki did not speak fairly to you. Almost every unhappiness comes because we speak too much of our pride and speak too little of our hearts.
#AOYAGI.
I asked him if he saw her.
#OBAA-SAN.
Why? stranger told me -
#OBAA-SAN.
Was it the stranger you believed before Riki could defend himself?
#AOYAGI.
But, mother, I gave my all in all to Riki. He does not care.
#OBAA-SAN.
Do you know?
#AOYAGI.
I asked Riki if they met?
#OBAA-SAN.
Did he tell you?
#AOYAGI.
He seemed to be proud to tell.
#OBAA-SAN.
Then he was unashamed to tell -
#AOYAGI.
I asked him questions.
#OBAA-SAN.
But did you ask him the great question in your heart?
#AOYAGI.
Oh -
#OBAA-SAN.
Did you say, "Riki, my love, you are in all my heart. Am I in all yours?"
#AOYAGI.
He told me that.
#OBAA-SAN.
And did you believe?
#AOYAGI.
Above all the world!
#OBAA-SAN.
Then why doubt him later?
#AOYAGI.
The lady from Ishiyama passed by.
#OBAA-SAN.
My child, a lady bound for Ishiyama passed by! Had she been singing all the love - songs of all the worlds; had she been fairer than the lotus - flower, why should you have doubted Riki? stranger - stranger! - a stranger! - Oh, why - why - why do the eyes of love grow blind because a stranger speaks? You, Aoyagi, did not see the lady bound for Ishiyama. You did not hear her song - and yet upon the ears and eyes of a stranger you would shatter your love. - I saw the lady. - She was singing. - She was not fair. - If she had been - Oh, my little child - Riki is Riki, your august lord, the lord of your life. When he comes back, go to him and speak from your heart.
#AOYAGI.
What shall I say?
#OBAA-SAN.
I need not tell your heart. - It is only your head that can not learn to speak unprompted. - Do you love Riki?
#AOYAGI.
Ay - so dearly!
#RIKI.
Aoyagi!
#AOYAGI.
He is coming!
#RIKI.
Aoyagi!
#AOYAGI.
Riki, my august lord, listen to my heart. - Forget my anger. - Tell me once again that you love me. - I'll believe.
#RIKI.
You know - I have always loved you. - When you were a song in my heart, I loved you so! And now -
#AOYAGI.
Oh, Riki, can we ever forget the blow I struck?
#RIKI.
That was yesterday - see, this is today: the dawn has spread across the sky. What shall we do? Look back upon the bitterness of yesterday, or try to see the fears of tomorrow, or live in the gladness of today?
#AOYAGI.
The Gaki of Kokoru is here at the tree. He will not let us live in happiness. He let me go with you because he meant to feed upon the misery of poor Obaa - San.
#RIKI.
He has not come upon us yet. We are struggling against tomorrow. This is the dawning of today.
#AOYAGI.
Then shall we live - today.
#OBAA-SAN.
Come, Aoyagi; come, Riki. We have found happiness at our door. Within there is rice and tea. Come.
#THE GAKI.
There is love! - Now what shall I do for misery? Old Obaa - San remembers happiness. She has taught O - Katsu and O - Sode to remember happiness. The lovers are reunited; - now they understand. - And I - I, ah, I must die in this dread shape and stay in this hell through all the eternities unless I bring new misery to them. What can I do? Ah - I shall kill the tree - slowly - slowly - and I'll feed upon them all. Aoyagi is bound to the tree as one is bound to his body in a dream. - I'll kill the tree.
#RIKI.
Aoyagi! Oh, whatever power gave strength to me and led me to my love, give me the chance to save my love.
#AOYAGI.
The tree! - The tree!
#RIKI.
The Gaki of Kokoru! Ay, I know! I know! I fight a fear, Obaa - San. Hold Aoyagi fast - with all your love. - I shall find the Gaki of Kokoru! All strength! All faith to me! Into my hands give the power to break the bitterest hell asunder! Into my eyes put light that I may see the cowardly fears that infest our way. - Gaki! Gaki! where are you? - I pass about you and in my heart I carry fearlessness and faith. - Upon your wickedness I hurl belief. - Ah, now, I see you.
#THE GAKI.
Let me go! Let me go!
#RIKI.
You shall bring misery into no more hearts!
#THE GAKI.
Ah, pity me! Let me go! I must feed or I shall die!
#RIKI.
You shall feed no more!
#THE GAKI.
Do not let me die in this sixth hell! Do not let me die! Once I was human - like you and you. I came into this hell because I was bitter in life. - I made misery for others. - I put mischief in their minds. -
#RIKI.
You shall make no more misery.
#THE GAKI.
Let me feed! Let me live! I can not die thus.
#RIKI.
Dread demon, the end has come!
#THE GAKI.
Please - please - hear me.
#RIKI.
Nay, you have made your last horror in our lives.
#OBAA-SAN.
Riki! Hear him - hear him. - We know not what we do, perhaps.
#RIKI.
Then speak.
#THE GAKI.
Let me go! Do you think it did not punish me to see your misery, to bring misery upon you? That is what these hells are. In life we can not always see what wretchedness we make; in the hells we see and know and understand, but we can not escape our evil until we've sucked the bitterness, the horror to the blackest end. Oh - five hells lie between me and human life. In each I may perchance forget the lesson learned before. Let me live! Let me live! - I can not fight your faith! - Let me live!
#RIKI.
What further harm will you do?
#THE GAKI.
I cannot help myself. I must live on you. - You are young -
#RIKI.
Die!
#THE GAKI.
Let me go! Let me live! - I promise anything - I -
#RIKI.
Too late! - You shall harm no more!
#THE GAKI.
I shall live! I shall live!
#RIKI.
Aoyagi!
#THE GAKI.
Come not near me, Riki, or I shall crush her at your feet. I shall live!
#OBAA-SAN.
Give her back to us! Feed on me!
#THE GAKI.
In your heart there is only hope and beautiful memory. Old fool, I can not feed on you. - But now in my arms I hold the precious gift by which I shall pass from hell to hell.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
Take me!
#THE GAKI.
Silly old woman, you, too, like Obaa - San, can not feed me. Age learns to grasp at bubbles and pretend that they are stars.
#O-KATSU-SAN.
But I shall dream of my little girl.
#THE GAKI.
Ay, dream of her and have tender memories that are not pain.
#O-SODE-SAN.
I shall think of him and long for him, my lover.
#THE GAKI.
Ay, and in the memory of the firefly fÃªte you'll make a poem that will leave you all melting - like and holy - then where shall I feed?
#RIKI.
Obaa - San, are you content? I'll let her die at my own hand before I'll let him live.
#OBAA-SAN.
Riki! Would you kill the evil by killing the joy of us all?
#RIKI.
But the joy - my little Aoyagi - can not live so. See -
#OBAA-SAN.
O Gaki of Kokoru - I stand before you, no longer a suppliant. I am old and in my years I have known all the wanting, all the hopelessness one can know in life. But in your evil way, you brought to me a moment of happiness yesterday and in that moment I saw the beauty that I had always believed must be and yet that I had never known. In your evil arms you hold the treasure of my life - you hold the songs that filled the heart of Riki. But you do not feed, oh, Gaki of Kokoru. You can not feed. Oh, Gaki, what is this sixth hell of yours? - Who made it? Some man who was afraid of the joy of life; - it was too beautiful for his belief. Misery makes itself: so happiness makes itself. You stand before us, holding the darling of our dreams, but there is no misery so great as yours. See! I stand before you - unafraid - and in my heart lies happiness. - Aoyagi rested in my arms and my breast is warm and there is a glory where her dear head lay. In my life - if you take her from me - there will be an emptiness. - There will be long silences in the days to come; but my breast will still be warm with her touch and my ears will still hear the sweet words you cannot unsay - the lullaby I sang. - Oh, Gaki - it has been sung to her. - The climbing to the mountain gleaming in the sun - the glade where love found the perfect mystery - that cannot be undone whether we live or die. - Love that has been can never be undone.
#THE GAKI.
She is yours! - I have met perfect faith. - Five hells lie before me - but I have met a perfect faith. - You cannot know what wonder I am knowing. From the sixth hell I have seen a perfect faith. - I am content to die in this shape. Strike, Riki!
#RIKI.
I have my love.
#THE GAKI.
But a peace has come upon me, a peace that I have never known. - I seem to be on wings - afloat in the sky. - Stars and suns swing gently by - and cool clouds brush my brow. - Five hells lie before me. - Can it be, in each I shall find peace like this? - Now a fire rages deep in me - a pain - I'm torn. - Oh, Obaa - San, I die - I die. - Come to me - touch me - let me feel your gentle hands. - So! So! - I have never known such gentleness. - Oh, I am cold - cold! Hold me - Obaa - San - I see - I see. - The hells were made by some man afraid of the joy of life. - It was too beautiful for his belief. - Riki - Aoyagi, there is the mountain gleaming in the morning light. - Go - see your footprints side by side. - A Gaki's feet trod upon them, but left no mark - and they are there side by side. - O - Sode - San, I look across the River of Heaven; - there stands your lover waiting for you - an empty boat is here to bear you to him. - O - Katsu - San, - the messenger of the other world bears your little one upon his broad, warm back. - They are smiling, O - Katsu - San - Obaa - San -
#OBAA-SAN.
My little girl! - my little boy! - Today the sun is very bright.
