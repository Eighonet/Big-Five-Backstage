#PUBLIA.
No, they'll niver be lavin' the ould land, the green land, the home land. I'm wishing I was there wid thim. Maybe we'd have a duck an' potatoes, an' maybe something to drink to kape us warm against the cold. An' the boys would all be dancin' an' the girls have rosy cheeks.
#THE NEIGHBOR.
God avnin' to ye; I came in to ask if I might borrow the loan o' a bit o' tay, not havin' a leaf of it left.
#THE WOMAN.
We have a little left, just enough we was savin' for ourselves to - night, but you're welcome to it - maybe the girls will bring some. Will ye get it for her, mother? Or she can help herself - it's in the safe. It's on the lower shelf among the cups an' saucers an' plates.
#THE NEIGHBOR.
It's just a scrap!
#PUBLIA.
To be sure! We use so much tay! We're that exthravagant!
#THE NEIGHBOR.
It hurts me to take it from ye - maybe I'd better not.
#PUBLIA.
The girls will bring more. We always have a cupboard full o' things. We're always able to lend to our neighbors.
#THE NEIGHBOR.
It's in great luck, ye are. For some of us be so poor we don't know where the next bite's comin' from. An' this winter whin iverything's so high an' wages not raised, a woman can't find enough to cook for her man's dinner. It isn't that ye don't see things - oh, they're in the markets an' the shops, an' it makes yer mouth wather as ye walk along the sthrates this day before the Christmas to see the turkeys an' the ducks ye'll niver ate, an' the little pigs an' the or'nges an' bananies an' cranberries an' the cakes an' nuts an' - it's worse, I'm thinkin', to see thim whin there's no money to buy than it was in the ould counthry, where there was nothing to buy wid the money ye didn't have.
#THE WOMAN.
It's all one to us poor folk whether there be things to buy or not. I'm on'y thinkin' o' the clane air at home - if I could have a mornin' o' fresh sunshine - these fogs an' smoke choke me so. The girls would take me out to the counthry if they had time an' I'd get well. But they haven't time.
#PUBLIA.
But it's like to be bright on Christmas Day. It wouldn't iver be cloudy on Christmas Day, an' maybe even now the stars would be crapin' out an' the air all clear an' cold an' the moon a - shinin' an' iverything so sthill an' quiet an' bleamin' an' breathless , awaitin' on the Blessed Virgin. No, there's not a sthar, not one little twinklin' sthar, an' how'll the shepherds find their way? Iverything's dull an' black an' the clouds are hangin' down heavy an' sthill. How'll the shepherds find their way without the sthar to guide thim? An' David an' Michael will niver be crossin' that wet, black sea! An' the girls - how'll they find their way home? They'll be lost somewhere along by the hedges. Ohone, ohone!
#THE NEIGHBOR.
Now, grannie, what would ye be sayin'? There's niver a hedge anywhere but granite blocks an' electric light poles an' plenty o' light in the city for thim to see all their way home. Ain't they late?
#THE WOMAN.
They're always late, an' they kape gettin' lather an' lather.
#THE NEIGHBOR.
Yis, av coorse, the sthores is all open in the avnin's before Christmas.
#THE WOMAN.
They go so early in the mornin' an' get home so late at night, an' they're so tired.
#THE NEIGHBOR.
They're lucky to be young enough to work an' not be married. I've got to go home to the childer an' give thim their tay. Pat's gone to the saloon again, an' to - morrow bein' Christmas I misdoubt he'll be terrible dhrunk again, an' me on'y jist well from the blow in the shoulder the last time.
#PUBLIA.
Sthay an' kape Christmas wid us. We're goin' to have our celebratin' to - night on Christmas Eve, the way folks do here. I like it best on Christmas Day, the way 'tis in the ould counthry, but here 'tis Christmas Eve they kape. We're waitin' for the girls to come home to start things - they knowin' how - Mary an' me on'y know how to kape Christmas Day as 'tis at home. But the girls'll soon be here, an' they'll have the three an' do the cookin' an' all, an' we'll kape up the jollity way into the night.
#THE NEIGHBOR.
Nay, if Pat came home dhrunk an' didn't find me, he'd kill me. We have all to be movin' on to our own throubles.
#THE WOMAN.
If I could on'y be in the counthry!
#PUBLIA.
Maybe that would be the girls! If David and Michael was to come now an' go by - there bein' no sthar to guide thim!
#THE WOMAN.
Nay, mother, 'twas the shepherds that was guided by the sthar an' to the bed o' the Blessed Babe.
#PUBLIA.
Aye, so 'twas. What be I thinkin' of? The little Blessed Babe! But they could not find Him to - night. 'Tis so dark an' no sthars shinin.' An' what would shepherds do in a ghreat city? 'Twould be lost they'd be, quicker than in any bog. Think ye, Mary, that the boys would be hootin' thim an' the p'lice, maybe, would want to be aristin' thim for loitherin'. They'd niver find the Blessed Babe, an' they'd have to be movin' on. - That would sure be the girls this time! Ah, but 'tis weary waitin'! 'Twas on that day that David an' me was plighted - a brave Christmas Day wid a shinin' sun an' a sky o' blue wid fair, white clouds. An' David an' me met at the early mass in the dark o' the frosty mornin' afore the sun rose - an' there was all day good times an' a duck for dinner and puddin's an' a party at the O'Brady's in the evenin', whin David an' me danced. Ah, but he was a beautiful dancer, an' me, too - I was as light on my feet as a fairy. Aye, but I danced like a fairy, an' there was not another couple so sprightly an' handsome in all the country. Ah, but I be old now, and the strength fails me. 'Twas the day before the little man, the little white dove, my next Christmas that Michael was born - little son!
#THE WOMAN.
Mother, could ye get me a cup o' wather? If the girls was here to get me a bite to ate, maybe it would kape the breath in me the night.
#PUBLIA.
Ye should thry to get up an' move about some, so ye can enjoy the Christmas threat. 'Tis bad bein' sick on Christmas. Thry, now, Mary, to sit up a bit. The girls'll be wantin' ye to be merry wid the rest av us.
#THE WOMAN.
I wouldn't spoil things for the girls if I could help. Maybe, mother, if ye'd lift me a little I could sit up. Maybe I'll feel sthronger lather whin the girls come home - they could help me - they be so late! Maybe I'll be sthrong again in the mornin' - if I'd had a cup of coffee. - Maybe I could get up - an' walk about - an' do the cookin'.
#THE WOMAN.
Why, Tim, boy, come in. Sit ye down an' rest, ye're lookin' weary.
#PUBLIA.
Come to the stove, Timmie, man, an' warm yourself. We always kape a warm room an' a bright fire for visitors.
#THE BOY.
I was awful cold an' hungry an' I come home to get somethin' to eat before. I started out on another trip, but my sisters ain't home from the store yit, an' the fire's gone out in the stove, an' the room's cold as outside. I thought maybe ye'd let me come in here an' git warm.
#PUBLIA.
Poor orphan! Poor lamb! To be shure ye shall get warm by our sthove.
#THE BOY.
The cars are so beastly col' an' so crowded a feller mostly has to stand on the back platform.
#THE BOY.
No, thank ye - I don't want to go so near yet; my feet's all numb an' they allays hurt so when they warms up fast.
#PUBLIA.
Thin sit ye down off from the sthove.
#THE BOY.
If ye don't mind I'd rather stand on 'em 'til they gets a little used to it. They been numb off an' on mos' all day.
#THE WOMAN.
Soon as yer sisters come, Timmie, ye'd betther go to bed - 'tis the best place to get warm.
#THE BOY.
I can't - I got most a three - hour trip yet. I won't get home any 'fore midnight if I don't get lost, and maybe I'll get lost - I did once out there. I've got to take a box o' 'Merican Beauty roses to a place eight mile out, an' the house ain't on the car track, but nearly a mile off, the boss said. I wisht they could wait till mornin', but the orders was they just got to get the roses to - night. You see, out there they don' have no gas goin' nights when there's a moon, an' there'd ought to be a moon to - night, on'y the clouds is so thick there ain't no light gets through.
#PUBLIA.
There's no sthar shinin' to - night, Tim. Niver a sthar. An' the shepherds will be havin' a hard time, Tim, like you, findin' their way.
#THE BOY.
Shepherds? In town? What shepherds?
#THE WOMAN.
She means the shepherds on Christmas Eve that wint to find the Blessed Babe, Jesus.
#PUBLIA.
'Tis Christmas Eve, Timmie; ye haven't forgot that, have ye?
#THE BOY.
You bet I ain't. I know pretty well when Christmas is comin', by the way I got to hustle, an' the size of the boxes I got to carry. Seems as if my legs an' me would like to break up pardnership. I got to work till midnight every night, an' I'm so sleepy I drop off in the cars whenever I get a seat. An' the girls is at the store so early an' late they don't get time to cook me nothin' to eat.
#THE WOMAN.
Be ye hungry, Timmie?
#THE BOY.
No, I ain't hungry now.
#THE WOMAN.
Be ye shure, Timmie?
#THE BOY.
Oh, I kin go till I git home.
#THE WOMAN.
Mother, can't you find something for him to eat?
#PUBLIA.
To be shure, to be shure. We always kapes a full cupboard to thrate our neighbors wid whin they comes in. Ah, Timmie, lad, what would ye like to be havin', now? If you had the wish o' yer heart for yer Christmas dinner an' a good fairy to set it all afore ye? Ye'd be wishin' maybe, for a fine roast duck, to begin wid, in its own gravies an' some apple sauce to go wid it; an' ye'd be thinkin' o' a little bit o' pig nicely browned an' a plate of potaties; an' the little fairy woman would be bringin' yer puddin's an' nuts an' apples an' a dish o' the swatest tay.
#THE WOMAN.
But, mother, you're not gettin' Tim something to ate.
#THE BOY.
She's makin' me mouth water all right.
#PUBLIA.
Maybe ye'll meet that little fairy woman out there in the counthry road where ye're takin' the roses! Here's salt an' here's pepper an' here's mustard an' a crock full o' sugar, an', oh! Tim, here's some fine cold bacon - fine, fat, cold bacon - an' here's half a loaf o' white wheat bread! Why, Timmie, lad, that's just the food to make boys fat! Ye'll grow famously on it. 'Tis a supper, whin ye add to it a dhrop o' iligant milk, that's fit for a king.
#THE BOY.
I ain't had nothin' since a wienerwurst at eleven o'clock.
#PUBLIA.
Now, dhraw up, Timmie, boy, an' ate yer fill; ye're more thin welcome.
#THE WOMAN.
Don't they niver give ye nothin' to ate at the gran' houses when ye'd be takin' the roses?
#THE BOY.
Not them. They'd as soon think o' feedin' a telephone or an automobile as me.
#THE WOMAN.
But don't they ask ye in to get warm whin ye've maybe come so far?
#THE BOY.
No, they don't seem to look at me 'zacly like a caller. They generally steps out long enough to sign the receipt - book an' shut the front door behin' 'em so as not to let the house get col' the length o' time I'm standin' there. Well, I'm awful much obleeged to ye. Now, I got to be movin' on.
#PUBLIA.
Sthop an' cilibrate the Christmas wid us. We ain't started to do nothin' yet because the girls haven't come - they know how - an' they're goin' to bring things - all kinds o' good things to ate an' a branch of rowan berries - ah, boy, a great branch o' rowan wid scarlet berries shinin' , an' we'll all be merry an' kape it up late into the night.
#THE BOY.
I guess it's pretty late now. I got to make that trip an' I guess when I get home I'll be so sleepy I'll jus' tumble in. Ye've been awful good to me, an' it's the first time I been warm to - day. Good - by.
#PUBLIA.
Ah, don't ye go, Michael, lad! Now, bide wid us a bit. Ah, boy, ah, Mike, bide wid us, now ye've come! We've been that lonesome widout ye!
#THE BOY.
I've got to be movin'.
#PUBLIA.
No, Michael, little lamb, no!
#THE BOY.
I got to go!
#PUBLIA.
Oh, to have him come an' go again, my little Michael, my own little lad!
#THE WOMAN.
Don't ye, dearie; now, then, don't ye! 'Twas not Michael, but just our little neighbor boy, Tim. Ye know, poor lamb, now if ye'll thry to remember, that father an' Michael is gone to the betther land an' us is left.
#PUBLIA.
Nay, nay, 'tis the fairies that took thim an' have thim now, kapin' thim an' will not ever give thim back.
#THE WOMAN.
Whisht, mother! Spake not of the little folk on the Holy Night! Have ye forgot the time o' all the year it is? Now, dhry yer eyes, dearie, an' thry to be cheerful like 'fore the girls be comin' home. Thim be the girls now, shure they be comin' at last. But they'll be comin' soon.
#PUBLIA.
Good avnin' to ye! We're that pleased to see our neighbors!
#THE NEIGHBOR.
How's yer cough?
#THE WOMAN.
Oh, it's jist the same - maybe a little betther. If I could on'y get to the counthry! But the girls must be workin' - they haven't time to take me. Sit down, won't ye?
#THE NEIGHBOR.
I'm most dead, I'm so tired. I did two washin's to - day - went out and did one this mornin' and then my own after I come home this afternoon. I jus' got through sprinklin' it an' I'll iron to - morrow.
#THE WOMAN.
Not on Christmas Day!
#THE NEIGHBOR.
Christmas Day! Did ye hear 'bout the Beckers? Well, they was all put out on the sidewalk this afternoon. Becker's been sick, ye know, an' ain't paid his rent an' his wife's got a two weeks' old baby. It sort o' stunned Mis' Becker, an' she sat on one of the mattresses out there an' wouldn't move, an' nobody couldn't do nothin' with her. But they ain't the only ones has bad luck - Smith, the painter, fell off a ladder an' got killed. They took him to the hospital, but it wasn't no use - his head was all mashed in. His wife's got them five boys an' Smith never saved a cent, though he warn't a drinkin' man. It's a good thing Smith's children is boys - they can make their livin' easier!
#THE WOMAN.
Ain't ye got no cheerful news to tell? It's Christmas Eve, ye know.
#THE NEIGHBOR.
Christmas Eve don't seem to prevent people from dyin' an' bein' turned out o' house an' home. Did ye hear how bad the dipthery is? They say as how if it gits much worse they'll have to close the school in our ward. Two o' the Homan children's dead with it. The first one wasn't sick but two days, an' they say his face all turned black 'fore he died. But it's a good thing they're gone, for the Homans ain't got enough to feed the other six. Did ye hear 'bout Jim Kelly drinkin' again? Swore off for two months, an' then took to it harder'n ever - perty near killed the baby one night.
#THE WOMAN.
Won't you please not tell me any more? It just breaks me heart.
#THE NEIGHBOR.
I ain't got no other kind o' news to tell. I s'pose I might's well go home.
#THE WOMAN.
No, don't ye go. I like to have ye here when ye're kinder.
#THE NEIGHBOR.
Well, it's gettin' late, an' I guess ye ought to go to sleep.
#THE WOMAN.
Oh, no, I won't go to slape till the girls come. They'll bring me somethin' to give me strength. If they'd on'y come soon.
#THE NEIGHBOR.
Ye ain't goin' to set up 'til they git home?
#PUBLIA.
That we are. We're kapin' the cilebratin' till they come.
#THE NEIGHBOR.
What celebratin'?
#PUBLIA.
Why, the Christmas, to be shure. We're goin' to have high jinks to - night. In the ould counthry 'tis always Christmas Day, but here 'tis begun on Christmas Eve, an' we're on'y waitin' for the girls, because they know how to fix things betther nor Mary an' me.
#THE NEIGHBOR.
But ain't they workin' in the store?
#PUBLIA.
Yes, but they're comin' home early to - night.
#THE NEIGHBOR.
Don't ye fool yerselves. Why, they've got to work harder to - night than any in the whole year.
#THE WOMAN.
But they did say they'd thry to come home early.
#THE NEIGHBOR.
The store's all crowded to - night. Folks 'at's got money to spend never remembers it till the last minute. If they didn't have none they'd be thinkin' 'bout it long ahead. Well, I got to be movin'. I wouldn't stay awake, if I was you.
#PUBLIA.
Sthay and kape the Christmas wid us! We'll be havin' high jinks by an' by. Sthay, now, an' help us wid our jollity!
#THE NEIGHBOR.
Nay, I left my children in bed, an' I got to go back to 'em. An' I got to get some rest myself - I got that ironin' ahead o' me in the mornin'. You folks better get yer own rest.
#PUBLIA.
David an' Michael's comin'.
#PUBLIA.
Yis, we're goin' to have a gran' time.
#PUBLIA.
David an' Michael's comin' an' the shepherds for the fairies will show thim the way.
#THE WOMAN.
If the girls would on'y come! If they'd give me somethin' so as I wouldn't be so tired!
#PUBLIA.
There's niver a sthar an' there's nobody to give thim a kind word an' the counthry roads are dark an' foul, but they've got the little folk to guide thim! An' whin they reach the city - the poor, lonesome shepherds from the hills! - they'll find naught but coldness an' hardness an' hurry. Will the fairies show thim the way? Fairies' eyes be used to darkness, but can they see where it is black night in one corner an' a blaze o' light in another?
#PUBLIA.
Nay, there's niver a sthar, an' the clouds are hangin' heavier an' lower an' the flakes o' snow are fallin'. Poor little folk guidin' thim poor lost shepherds, leadin' thim by the hand so gently because there's no others to be kind to thim, an' bringin' thim to the manger o' the Blessed Babe. Poor little mite of a babe, so cold an' unwelcome an' forgotten save by the silly ould shepherds from the hills! The silly ould shepherds from the strength o' the hills, who are comin' through the darkness in the lead o' the little folk!
