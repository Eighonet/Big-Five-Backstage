#POET.
My darling!
#MISS.
Oh! It’s very pretty here! Only you can’t see anything!
#POET.
Your eyes will have to get used to this semi - darkness.—Those sweet eyes—
#MISS.
But there won’t be time enough.
#POET.
Why not?
#MISS.
Because I can only stop a moment.
#POET.
But, you can take your hat off, can’t you?
#MISS.
Just for the sake of a minute?
#POET.
And your coat—
#MISS.
The idea!—I have to leave right away.
#POET.
But you must rest a while first. We have been walking for three hours.
#MISS.
Riding, you mean.
#POET.
Yes, we rode home—but we ran around for a full three hours in the country. Now come, sit down, child … wherever you like—here at my desk;—no, that’s not comfortable. Sit down on the sofa.—That’s it. If you are very tired, you may as well lie down. So. There, put your head on the cushion.
#MISS.
But I’m not tired at all!
#POET.
You merely imagine you’re not. So—and if you are sleepy, you can go to sleep. I shall be very quiet. And what’s more I can play you a lullaby … one of my own…
#MISS.
One of yours.
#POET.
Yes.
#MISS.
But I thought, Robert, you were a professor. But I told you I was a writer. But what made you think of that?
#MISS.
Because you said the piece you are playing is your own.
#POET.
Yes … perhaps it is, perhaps it isn’t. But that doesn’t matter. Well? Anyway it doesn’t matter who composed it, if only it is beautiful. Don’t you agree?
#MISS.
Of course … it must be beautiful … that’s the chief thing!—
#POET.
Do you know what I meant by that?
#MISS.
By what?
#POET.
By what I just said.
#MISS.
Of course I do.
#POET.
You didn’t understand a word.
#MISS.
I’m not as stupid as that.
#POET.
Certainly you are, but that is just the reason why I love you. It is so beautiful, when girls are stupid. I mean in the way you are.
#MISS.
Go on, you are talking nonsense.
#POET.
Angel, little one! Isn’t it comfy on this soft, Persian couch cover?
#MISS.
Indeed, it is. Won’t you play something else on the piano?
#POET.
No, I’d rather stay near you.
#MISS.
But hadn’t you better light the lamp?
#POET.
Oh, no… The dim light is so restful. We were as if bathed in sunbeams all day. Now we’ve just climbed out of the bath and slipped on … the twilight like a bathrobe— No—that ought to be expressed differently… Don’t you think so?
#MISS.
I don’t know.
#POET.
Absolutely divine, this stupidity!
#MISS.
What are you doing? What are you writing?
#POET.
Sun, bath, twilight, cloak … so… Nothing… Now tell me, sweetheart, wouldn’t you like something to eat or drink?
#MISS.
I’m not thirsty, but I am hungry.
#POET.
Hm … it would suit me better, if you were thirsty. I have some cognac at home, but I have to send out for food.
#MISS.
Can’t you send somebody?
#POET.
That is difficult, my servant isn’t here now—but, wait a minute—I will go myself … what would you like?
#MISS.
Oh, really don’t bother; I have to go home anyway.
#POET.
Child, that’s out of the question. Now I will tell you something; when we leave, we will go together somewhere for supper.
#MISS.
Oh, no. I haven’t time for that. And, then, where could we go? Somebody we know might see us.
#POET.
Do you know such a lot of people?
#MISS.
Well, it takes only one to make trouble for us.
#POET.
Why trouble?
#MISS.
Well, suppose mother should hear about it…
#POET.
We can go somewhere, where no one can see us. There are plenty of restaurants with private dining - rooms.
#MISS.
“Let’s dine in a chambre separée!”
#POET.
Have you ever been in a private dining - room?
#MISS.
To tell the truth—yes.
#POET.
Who was the happy man?
#MISS.
Oh, it wasn’t the way you imagine… I went with a friend and her fiancé. They took me along.
#POET.
And you expect me to believe that?
#MISS.
You needn’t believe it!
#POET.
Did you blush? You can hardly see anything. I can’t even distinguish your features. But even so I recognize you.
#MISS.
Well, be careful that you don’t take me for some one else.
#POET.
It is strange, I don’t seem to remember how you look.
#MISS.
Thank you!
#POET.
It is almost uncanny. I can’t imagine any longer how you look—In a certain way I have already forgotten you—Now, if I couldn’t remember even the sound of your voice … what would you do then?—Something near and far away at the same time … it’s uncanny.
#MISS.
What are you talking about?
#POET.
Nothing, my angel, nothing. Where are your lips?…
#MISS.
Wouldn’t it be better to light the lamp?
#POET.
No… Tell me, do you love me?
#MISS.
Very much … oh, so much!
#POET.
Have you ever loved any one as much as me?
#MISS.
I told you already that I didn’t.
#POET.
But…
#MISS.
He was my fiancé.
#POET.
I’d rather you wouldn’t think of him now.
#MISS.
Why … what’s the difference … look…
#POET.
We might imagine now that we were in a palace in India.
#MISS.
I’m sure people there wouldn’t be as wicked as you are.
#POET.
How idiotic! Perfectly divine—Ah, if you only know what you are to me…
#MISS.
Well?
#POET.
Don’t always push me away, I’m not going to hurt you—
#MISS.
My corset hurts me.
#POET.
Take it off.
#MISS.
Yes. But you must behave.
#POET.
Of course!
#POET.
Tell me, aren’t you at all curious to know my name?
#MISS.
Yes, what is it?
#POET.
I’d rather not tell you my real name, but the name I go by.
#MISS.
What is the difference?
#POET.
I mean the name I use as a writer.
#MISS.
Oh, you don’t write under your real name?
#MISS.
Oh … stop … don’t.
#POET.
What fragrance! How sweet.
#MISS.
You are tearing my chemise.
#POET.
Away with it … away with it … everything is superfluous.
#MISS.
Oh, Robert.
#POET.
And now enter into our Indian palace.
#MISS.
Tell me first—do you really love me?
#POET.
I adore you. I adore you, my sweetheart, my springtime … my…
#MISS.
Robert … Robert…
#POET.
It was heaven… My name is…
#MISS.
Robert—oh, my Robert!
#POET.
I call myself Biebitz.
#MISS.
Why do you call yourself Biebitz?
#POET.
My name is not Biebitz—I just use it as a pseudonym … well, don’t you recognize the name?
#MISS.
No.
#POET.
You don’t know the name Biebitz? Ah—Perfectly divine! Really? You are just pretending you don’t know it, aren’t you?
#MISS.
No really, I never heard it.
#POET.
Don’t you ever go to the theater?
#MISS.
Oh, yes—I was at the opera only the other day with—you know, with one of my friends and her uncle, to hear Cavalleria Rusticana.
#POET.
Hm, you don’t go then to see plays.
#MISS.
I never get tickets for them.
#POET.
I’ll send you a ticket soon.
#MISS.
Oh, do! And don’t forget it. But for something funny.
#POET.
Oh … something funny … you don’t care to see anything sad?
#MISS.
Not very much.
#POET.
Not even if it is a play of mine. play of yours? Do you write for the theater?
#POET.
Let me light a candle now. I haven’t seen you since you have become my best beloved—Angel!
#MISS.
Don’t. I’m ashamed. Give me a cover at least.
#POET.
Later!
#MISS.
Go away, Robert!
#POET.
You are beautiful, you are Beauty itself. You are Nature herself. You are the simplicity which is holy.
#MISS.
Ouch! You are dropping wax on me. Look, why aren’t you more careful?
#POET.
You are that for which I have long sought. You love me for my own sake. You would love me even if I were only a counter - jumper. That’s balm to one’s heart. I must confess I was suspicious until this moment. Tell me, honestly, you didn’t have any notion that I am Biebitz?
#MISS.
Oh, pshaw, I don’t even know what you are talking about. I never heard of any Biebitz.
#POET.
What is fame! No, forget what I have told you. Forget even the name. I am Robert and I want to remain Robert to you. I was only joking. I am not a writer at all. I’m a clerk, and in the evening I play the piano in a dancehall.
#MISS.
But now I’m all mixed up … and the way you look at one. What is the matter, yes, what do you mean?
#POET.
It is very strange—something that has never happened to me, sweetheart; I am on the verge of tears. You move me deeply. We ought to live together. Will you? We will be very much in love with each other.
#MISS.
Is it true about the dancehall?
#POET.
Yes, but don’t ask any more about it. If you love me, don’t ask me anything. Tell me, can’t you get away for a few weeks?
#MISS.
How do you mean get away?
#POET.
Well, I mean, leave home?
#MISS.
How absurd! How could I! What would mother say? And without me everything would be topsy - turvy at home in no time.
#POET.
It would be so wonderful to live with you a few weeks, all alone with you, somewhere far away, in the forest, in the world of nature… Nature. And then, some day, “Good - by”—each going, without the other knowing where.
#MISS.
You are talking already about saying good - by. And I thought that you loved me such a lot.
#POET.
That is just the reason— You sweet darling!
#MISS.
Please, hold me tight. I feel so cold.
#POET.
I fancy it’s time for you to dress. Wait, I’ll light a few more candles for you.
#MISS.
Don’t look this way.
#POET.
No. Tell me, child, are you happy?
#MISS.
What do you mean?
#POET.
I mean are you happy the way things are in general?
#MISS.
Well, they might be better.
#POET.
You misunderstand me. You have told me enough about your conditions at home. I know you are not a princess. Leaving all that aside, do you feel alive. Do you feel life pulsing through you?
#MISS.
Come, have you a comb?
#POET.
Good Lord, how lovely you look!
#MISS.
Please … don’t!
#POET.
Please, stay a while yet. I’ll get something for supper, and…
#MISS.
But it is awfully late already.
#POET.
It is not yet nine.
#MISS.
Dear me, I must hurry. Please!
#POET.
When shall I see you again?
#MISS.
When would you like to see me?
#POET.
To - morrow.
#MISS.
What day is to - morrow?
#POET.
Saturday.
#MISS.
Oh, then I can’t. I must take my little sister to her guardian.
#POET.
Then Sunday … hm … Sunday … on Sunday … now I’ll have to explain something to you.—I’m not Biebitz, but Biebitz is a friend of mine. I’ll introduce him to you sometime. Biebitz’s play will be given Sunday. I’ll send you tickets, and take you home after the performance. You will tell me then how you liked the play. Won’t you?
#MISS.
Here you are talking about this Biebitz again.—I don’t understand what it is all about.
#POET.
I won’t know you really, until I know what impression the play made on you.
#MISS.
Now … I’m ready.
#POET.
Come, sweetheart.
