#ROSE.
Well, ’tis like to be a fine set out, this May Day.
#MARION.
I can make naught of it myself.
#ROSE.
Why, ’tis Lord Cullen putting it about as how he be back from the war and thinking of getting himself wed, like.
#MARION.
I understands that much, I do.
#ROSE.
Only he can’t find the maid what he’s lost his heart to.
#MARION.
The wench what his lordship did see a - dancing all by herself in the forest when he was hid one day all among the brambles, a - rabbiting or sommat.
#ROSE.
And when my lord would have spoke with her, the maid did turn and fled away quick as a weasel.
#MARION.
And his lordship off to the fighting when ’twas next morn.
#ROSE.
So now, each maid of us in the village and all around be to dance upon the green come May Day so that my lord may see who ’twas that pleased his fancy.
#MARION.
And when he do pitch upon the one, ’tis her as he will wed.
#ROSE.
’Twill be a thing to sharpen the claws of th’ old countess worse nor ever—that marriage.
#MARION.
Ah, I reckon as her be mortal angered with all the giddle - gaddle this business have set up among the folk.
#ROSE.
I’ve never danced among the trees myself.
#MARION.
Nor I, neither, Rose.
#ROSE.
I’d dearly like to be a countess, Marion.
#MARION.
His lordship might think I was the maid. I’m spry upon my feet you know.
#MARION.
Well, Princess Rags, ’tisn’t likely as ’twas you a - dancing one of your Morris dances in the wood that day!
#ROSE.
’Tisn’t likely as his lordship would set his thoughts on a wench what could caper about like a Morris man upon the high road. So there.
#SUSAN.
I never danced upon the high road, I dances only where ’tis dark with gloom and no eyes upon me. No mortal eyes.
#MARION.
Get along with you, Princess Royal. Go off to th’ old gipsy Gran’ma yonder. We don’t want the likes of you along of us.
#ROSE.
Go off and dance to your own animals, Miss Goatherd. All of us be a - going to practise our steps against May Day. Come along girls.
#SUSAN.
They mock me in the name they have fixed to me—Princess Royal.
#GRANDMOTHER.
Let them mock. I’ll bring the words back to them like scorpions upon their tongues.
#SUSAN.
“As I walked out one May morning, So early in the Spring; I placed my back against the old garden gate, And I heard my true love sing.” {1}
#GRANDMOTHER.
It might be the blackcap a - warbling all among of the branches. So it might.
#SUSAN.
Ah, ’twas I that was a - dancing in the shade of the woods that day.
#GRANDMOTHER.
He’ll never look on the likes of you—that’s sure enough, my little wench.
#SUSAN.
I wish he was a goat - herd like myself—O that I do.
#GRANDMOTHER.
Then there wouldn’t be no use in your wedding yourself with him as I can see.
#SUSAN.
’Tis himself, not his riches that I want.
#GRANDMOTHER.
You be speaking foolishness. What do you know of him—what do us blind worms know about the stars above we?
#SUSAN.
I see’d him pass by upon his horse one day. All there was of him did shine like the sun upon the water—I was very near dazed by the brightness. So I was.
#SUSAN.
And ’twas then I lost the heart within me to him.
#SUSAN.
Come, Jockie, I have a mind to dance a step or two. Tears be for them as have idle times and not for poor wenches what mind cattle and goats. Come, play me my own music, Jock. And play it as I do like it best.
#LADY MILLICENT.
A wondrous bold dance, upon my word—could it have been that which captivated my lord, Alice?
#ALICE CHASE.
O no, mistress. His lordship has no fancy for boldness in a maid.
#LADY MILLICENT.
Immodest too. A Morris dance. The girl should hide her face in shame.
#ALICE CHASE.
And there she is, looking at your ladyship with her gipsy eyes, bold as a brass farthing.
#SUSAN.
I’ll not be taunted for my dancing—I likes to dance wild, and leap with my body when my spirit leaps, and fly with my limbs when my heart flies and move in the air same as the birds do move when ’tis mating time.
#GRANDMOTHER.
Ah, ’tis so with she. She baint no tame mouse what creeps from its hole along of t’others and who do go shuffle shuffle, in and out of the ring, mild as milk and naught in the innards of they but the squeak.
#SUSAN.
’Twas my dance gained his lordship’s praise—so there, fine madam.
#LADY MILLICENT.
Your dance? Who are you then? gipsy wench, mistress, who minds the goats and pigs for one of they great farms.
#GRANDMOTHER.
Have a care for that tongue of yours, madam waiting maid. For I know how to lay sommat upon it what you won’t fancy.
#LADY MILLICENT.
Now tell me your name, my girl.
#SUSAN.
They call me Princess Royal.
#LADY MILLICENT.
O that must be in jest. Why, you are clothed in rags, poor thing.
#SUSAN.
I’d sooner wear my own rags nor the laces which you have got upon you.
#LADY MILLICENT.
Now why do you say such a thing?
#SUSAN.
’Twas in these rags as I danced in the wood that day, and ’tis by these rags as my lord will know me once more.
#LADY MILLICENT.
Listen, I will cover you in silk and laces, Princess Royal.
#ALICE CHASE.
Susan is the maid’s name.
#SUSAN.
I don’t want none of your laces or silks.
#LADY MILLICENT.
And feed you with poultry and cream and sweetmeats.
#SUSAN.
I want naught but my crust of bread.
#LADY MILLICENT.
I’ll fill your hands with gold pieces.
#GRANDMOTHER.
Do you hear that, Sue?
#SUSAN.
I hear her well enough, Gran.
#LADY MILLICENT.
If you’ll teach me your dance against May Day. Then, I’ll clothe myself much after your fashion and dance upon the green with the rest.
#SUSAN.
I’ll not learn you my dance. Not for all the gold in the world. You shan’t go and take the only thing I have away from me.
#LADY MILLICENT.
Neither shall a little gipsy wretch like you take my love from me. We were as good as promised to each other at our christening.
#ALICE CHASE.
Don’t put yourself out for the baggage, madam. His lordship would never look on her.
#GRANDMOTHER.
Gold, did you say, mistress?
#LADY MILLICENT.
Gold? O yes—an apron full of gold, and silver too.
#GRANDMOTHER.
Do you hear that, Susan?
#SUSAN.
I’ll not do it for a King’s ransom.
#GRANDMOTHER.
You will. You’ll do it for the sake of poor old Gran, what’s been father and mother to you—and what’s gone hungered and thirsty so that you might have bread and drink.
#SUSAN.
O I can never give him up.
#GRANDMOTHER.
He’ll never be yourn to give—Dance till your legs is off and he’ll have naught to say to a gipsy brat when ’tis all finished.
#ALICE CHASE.
Whilst my lady belongs to his lordship’s own class, ’tis but suitable as she should be the one to wed with him—knowing the foreign tongues and all, and playing so sweetly on her instruments. There’s a lady anyone would be proud to take before the Court in London.
#GRANDMOTHER.
I could do with a little pig up at our place if I’d the silver to take into the market for to buy him with.
#GRANDMOTHER.
And I could do with a pair of good shoes to my poor old feet come winter time when ’tis snowing.
#GRANDMOTHER.
And ’twould be good not to go to bed with the pain of hunger within my lean old body—so ’twould.
#SUSAN.
I’ll do it, Gran. I’ll do it for your sake. ’Tis very likely true what you do say, all of you. I’d but dance my feet off for naught. When he came to look into my gipsy eyes, ’twould all be over and done with.
#LADY MILLICENT.
Sensible girl.
#ALICE CHASE.
’Tis time she should see which way her bread was spread.
#SUSAN.
Come, Jockie, come ladies—come Gran—we’ll be off to the quiet of our own place where I can learn her ladyship the steps and capers.
#GRANDMOTHER.
You’d best make haste. The mice be a - running from their holes once more—t’wouldn’t do for they to know aught about this.
#SUSAN.
Let us go quickly then.
#MARION.
How slow the time do pass, this May Day.
#ROSE.
Let’s while it away with a song or two.
#ROSE.
Good afternoon, Princess Royal Rags. Are we to see you cutting capers before his lordship this afternoon?
#MARION.
Get along and hide your bare feet behind the tree, Royal. I’d be ashamed to go without shoes if ’twas me.
#SUSAN.
O leave me alone—you be worse nor a nest of waspes—that you be.
#GRANDMOTHER.
Us’ll smoke them out of their holes one day—see if us do not.
#MARION.
Who are those yonder, Rose?
#ROSE.
I’m sure I don’t know, Marion—strangers, may be.
#MARION.
O my heart goes wild this afternoon.
#ROSE.
Mine too. Look, there they come.
#LADY CULLEN.
Dear me, what a gathering to be sure.
#HER LADY.
Indeed it is an unusual sight.
#LADY CULLEN.
And O what a sad infatuation on the part of my poor boy.
#HER LADY.
The war has been known to turn many a brain.
#LADY CULLEN.
And yet my son holds his own with the brightest intelligences of the day.
#HER LADY.
Only one little spot of his lordship’s brain seems to be affected.
#LADY CULLEN.
Just so. But here he comes, poor misguided youth.
#LORD CULLEN.
No, no—that was not the music of it, that was not the dance—not a face among them resembles the image I carry in my heart.
#LADY CULLEN.
Thank goodness. May that face never be seen again.
#LORD CULLEN.
Worse and worse. Could I have dreamed both the music and the dance and the dancer?
#LADY CULLEN.
I am sure this was the case, my dear son.
#LORD CULLEN.
I heard her voice singing in the forest before ever she began to dance. It was the sweetest voice and song I ever heard. Can any of these maid, sing to me, I wonder?
#MARION.
I only know one song, my lord.
#LORD CULLEN.
No, no—that is not in the least what I remember. You try now.
#ROSE.
I don’t sing, my lord—but— she has a sweet voice, and she knows a powerful lot of songs.
#LORD CULLEN.
Not that. Mine was a song to stir the depths of a man’s heart and bring tears up from the fountains of it.
#LORD CULLEN.
I seem to know that russet skirt—those bare, small feet. Mother, look at that maid with the red kerchief on her head.
#LADY CULLEN.
Some sort of a gipsy dress, to all appearance.
#LORD CULLEN.
The skirt she wore was torn and ragged—that day in the forest. She had no gold rings to her ears, nor silken scarf upon her head—But this might be her dress for holidays.
#LORD CULLEN.
That is the right music—O is it possible my quest is ended! watches them for a moment and then claps his hands angrily as a sign for the music to stop. The dancers pause.]
#LORD CULLEN.
This is a sad mimicry of my beautiful love. But there lies something behind the masquerade which I shall probe.
#LORD CULLEN.
From whom did you take the manner and the colour of your garments, my maid?
#LORD CULLEN.
Perhaps you have a tongue in your head. From whom did you try to learn those steps?
#JOCKIE.
I’ll tell your lordship all about it, and I’ll take your lordship straight to the right wench, that I will, if so be as your lordship will give a shilling to a poor little swine - herd what goes empty and hungered most of the year round. handful of gold, my boy, if you lead me rightly.
#GRANDMOTHER.
You might curtsey to the gentleman, Susan.
#LORD CULLEN.
No—there’s no need of that, from her to me. Here, my boy, is a golden pound for you—and more shall follow later.
#LORD CULLEN.
Will you dance for me again, Susan?
#SEVERAL OF THE GIRLS.
Princess Royal is her name.
#MARION.
Or Princess Rags.
#SUSAN.
’Tis all took out of my hands now, I can but do as your lordship says. Jockie, play me my music, and play it bravely too.
#LADY CULLEN.
I wonder if the young person understands that my poor boy is a little touched in the brain?
#LORD CULLEN.
Here is your daughter, mother.
#SUSAN.
I’m a poor ragged thing to be daughter to the likes of she. But the heart within of me is grander nor that of any queen, because of the love that it holds for you, my lord.
#LORD CULLEN.
We will be married to - morrow, my princess. And all these good people shall dance at our wedding.
#MARION.
And we’ll do a bit of dancing now as well. Come, Jockie, give us the tune of “Haste to the Wedding.”
#ROSE.
That’s it. Come girls—
#LADY MILLICENT.
I pray he won’t find out about me.
#GRANDMOTHER.
Ah, and my little wench will know how to pay back some of the vipers tongues which slandered her, when she sits on her velvet chair as a countess, the diamonds a - trickling from her neck and the rubies a - crowning of her head. Her’ll not forget the snakes what did lie in the grass. Her’ll have her heel upon they, so that their heads be put low and there shan’t go no more venom from their great jaws to harm she, my pretty lamb—my little turtle.
