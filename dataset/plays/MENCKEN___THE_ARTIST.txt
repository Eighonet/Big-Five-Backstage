#THE JANITOR.
Now all of them people think I'm the professor's tuner. I guess them tuners make pretty good money. I wish I could get the hang of the trick. It looks easy.
#FOUR HUNDRED OF THE WOMEN.
Oh, I do certainly hope he plays that lovely Valse Poupée as an encore! They say he does it better than Bloomfield - Zeisler.
#ONE OF THE CRITICS.
I hope the animal doesn't pull any encore numbers that I don't recognize. All of these people will buy the paper to - morrow morning just to find out what they have heard. It's infernally embarrassing to have to ask the manager. The public expects a musical critic to be a sort of walking thematic catalogue. The public is an ass.
#THE SIX OTHER MEN.
Oh, Lord! What a way to spend an afternoon!
#A HUNDRED OF THE WOMEN.
I wonder if he's as handsome as Paderewski.
#ANOTHER HUNDRED OF THE WOMEN.
I wonder if he's as gentlemanly as Josef Hofmann.
#STILL ANOTHER HUNDRED WOMEN.
I wonder if he's as fascinating as De Pachmann.
#YET OTHER HUNDREDS.
I wonder if he has dark eyes. You never can tell by those awful photographs in the newspapers.
#HALF A DOZEN WOMEN.
I wonder if he can really play the piano.
#THE CRITIC AFORESAID.
What a hell of a wait! These rotten piano - thumping immigrants deserve a hard call - down. But what's the use? The piano manufacturers bring them over here to wallop their pianos - and the piano manufacturers are not afraid to advertise. If you knock them too hard you have a nasty business - office row on your hands.
#ONE OF THE MEN.
If they allowed smoking, it wouldn't be so bad.
#ANOTHER MAN.
I wonder if that woman across the aisle -
#THE VIRGIN.
Oh!
#THE MARRIED WOMEN.
Oh!
#THE OTHER WOMEN.
Oh! How dreadfully handsome!
#THE VIRGIN.
Oh, such eyes, such depth! How he must have suffered! I'd like to hear him play the Prélude in D flat major. It would drive you crazy!
#A HUNDRED OTHER WOMEN.
I certainly do hope he plays some Schumann.
#OTHER WOMEN.
What beautiful hands! I could kiss them!
#THE VIRGIN.
Oh, perfect! I could love him! Paderewski played it like a fox trot. What poetry he puts into it! I can see a soldier lover marching off to war.
#ONE OF THE CRITICS.
The ass is dragging it. Doesn't con brio mean - well, what the devil does it mean? I forget. I must look it up before I write the notice. Somehow, brio suggests cheese. Anyhow, Pachmann plays it a damn sight faster. It's safe to say that, at all events.
#THE MARRIED WOMAN.
Oh, I could listen to that sonata all day! The poetry he puts into it - even into the allegro! Just think what the andante will be! I like music to be sad.
#ANOTHER WOMAN.
What a sob he gets into it!
#MANY OTHER WOMEN.
How exquisite!
#THE GREAT PIANIST.
That American beer will be the death of me! I wonder what they put in it to give it its gassy taste. And the so - called German beer they sell over here - du heiliger Herr Jesu! Even Bremen would be ashamed of it. In München the police would take a hand.
#TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY WOMEN.
What new beauties he gets out of it!
#A MAN.
He can tickle the ivories, all right, all right!
#A CRITIC.
Well, at any rate, he doesn't try to imitate Paderewski.
#THE GREAT PIANIST.
Well, it's lucky for me that I'm not in Leipzig to - day! But in Leipzig an artist runs no risks: the beer is pure. The authorities see to that. The worse enemy of technic is biliousness, and biliousness is sure to follow bad beer.
#THE VIRGIN.
How I envy the woman he loves! How it would thrill me to feel his arms about me - to be drawn closer, closer, closer! I would give up the whole world! What are conventions, prejudices, legal forms, morality, after all? Vanities! Love is beyond and above them all - and art is love! I think I must be a pagan.
#THE GREAT PIANIST.
And the herring! Good God, what herring! These barbarous Americans -
#THE VIRGIN.
Really, I am quite indecent! I should blush, I suppose. But love is never ashamed - How people misunderstand me!
#THE MARRIED WOMAN.
I wonder if he's faithful. The chances are against it. I never heard of a man who was.
#THE GREAT PIANIST.
I wonder whatever became of that girl in Dresden. Every time I think of her, she suggests pleasant thoughts - good beer, a fine band, Gemütlichkeit. I must have been in love with her - not much, of course, but just enough to make things pleasant. And not a single letter from her! I suppose she thinks I'm starving to death over here - or tuning pianos. Well, when I get back with the money there'll be a shock for her. A shock - but not a Pfennig!
#THE MARRIED WOMAN.
Still, you can hardly blame him. There must be a good deal of temptation for a great artist. All of these frumps here would -
#THE VIRGIN.
Ah, how dolorous, how exquisite is love! How small the world would seem if -
#THE MARRIED WOMAN.
Of course you could hardly call such old scarecrows temptations. But still -
#THE GREAT PIANIST.
I wonder why the American women always wear raincoats to piano recitals. Even when the sun is shining brightly, one sees hundreds of them. What a disagreeable smell they give to the hall. An American audience always smells of rubber and lilies - of - the - valley. How different in London! There an audience always smells of soap. In Paris it reminds you of sachet bags - and lingerie. And now comes that verfluchte adagio.
#ONE OF THE CRITICS.
What rotten pedaling! touch like a xylophone player, but he knows how to use his feet. That suggests a good line for the notice - "he plays better with his feet than with his hands," or something like that. I'll have to think it over and polish it up.
#ONE OF THE OTHER MEN.
Now comes some more of that awful classical stuff.
#THE VIRGIN.
Suppose he can't speak English? But that wouldn't matter. Nothing matters. Love is beyond and above -
#SIX HUNDRED WOMEN.
Oh, how beautiful!
#THE MARRIED WOMAN.
Perfect!
#THE DEAN OF THE CRITICS.
C - c - c - c - c - c - c - c - c - c - h - h - h - h - h - h - h - h!
#THE YOUNGEST CRITIC.
There is that old fraud asleep again. And to - morrow he'll print half a column of vapid reminiscence and call it criticism. It's a wonder his paper stands for him. Because he once heard Liszt, he....
#THE GREAT PIANIST.
That plump girl over there on the left is not so bad. As for the rest, I beg to be excused. The American women have no more shape than so many matches. They are too tall and too thin. I like a nice rubbery armful - like that Dresden girl. Or that harpist in Moscow - the girl with the Pilsner hair. Let me see, what was her name? Oh, Fritzi, to be sure - but her last name? Schmidt? Kraus? Meyer? I'll have to try to think of it, and send her a postcard.
#THE MARRIED WOMAN.
What delicious flutelike tones!
#ONE OF THE WOMEN.
If Beethoven could only be here to hear it! He would cry for very joy! Maybe he does hear it. Who knows? I believe he does. I am sure he does.
#THE DEAN OF THE CRITICS.
Oh, piffle! Compared to Gottschalk, the man is an amateur. Let him go back to the conservatory for a couple of years.
#ONE OF THE MEN.
Next comes the shirt - so. I hope it has some tune in it.
#THE VIRGIN.
The adagio is love's agony, but the scherzo is love triumphant. What beautiful eyes he has! And how pale he is!
#THE GREAT PIANIST.
Well, there's half of it over. But this scherzo is ticklish business. That horrible evening in Prague - will I ever forget it? Those hisses - and the papers next day!
#ONE OF THE MEN.
Go it, professor! That's the best you've done yet!
#ONE OF THE CRITICS.
Too fast!
#ANOTHER CRITIC.
Too slow!
#A YOUNG GIRL.
My, but ain't the professor just full of talent!
#THE GREAT PIANIST.
Well, so far no accident. What a way for a man to make a living!
#THE VIRGIN.
What passion he puts into it! His soul is in his finger - tips. human pianola!
#THE GREAT PIANIST.
This scherzo always fetches the women. I can hear them draw long breaths. That plump girl is getting pale. Well, why shouldn't she? I suppose I'm about the best pianist she has ever heard - or ever will hear. What people can see in that Hambourg fellow I never could imagine. In Chopin, Schumann, Grieg, you might fairly say he's pretty good. But it takes an artist to play Beethoven.
#THE DEAN OF THE CRITICS.
Too loud! Too loud! It sounds like an ash - cart going down an alley. But what can you expect? Piano - playing is a lost art. Paderewski ruined it.
#THE GREAT PIANIST.
I ought to clear 200,000 marks by this tournee. If it weren't for those thieving agents and hotelkeepers, I'd make 300,000. Just think of it - twenty - four marks a day for a room! That's the way these Americans treat a visiting artist! The country is worse than Bulgaria. I was treated better at Bucharest. Well, it won't last forever. As soon as I get enough of their money they'll see me no more. Vienna is the place to settle down. A nice studio at fifty marks a month - and the life of a gentleman. What was the name of that little red - cheeked girl at the café in the Franzjosefstrasse - that girl with the gold tooth and the silk stockings? I'll have to look her up.
#THE VIRGIN.
What an artist! What a master! What a -
#THE MARRIED WOMAN.
Has he really suffered, or is it just intuition?
#THE GREAT PIANIST.
No, marriage is a waste of money. Let the other fellow marry her. And now for a breathing spell and a swallow of beer. American beer! Bah! But it's better than nothing. The Americans drink water. Cattle! Animals! Ach, München, wie bist du so schön!
#THE JANITOR.
My, but them professors can put the stuff away!
