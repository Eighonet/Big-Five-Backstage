#BERTLEY.
My dear Wellwyn, the whole question of reform is full of difficulty. When you have two men like Professor Calway and Sir Thomas Hoxton taking diametrically opposite points of view, as we've seen to - night, I confess, I -
#WELLWYN.
Come in, Vicar, and have some grog.
#BERTLEY.
Not to - night, thanks! Christmas tomorrow! Great temptation, though, this room! Goodnight, Wellwyn; good - night, Ann!
#ANN.
Good - night, Canon Bertley.
#ANN.
Daddy!
#WELLWYN.
My dear?
#ANN.
You say you liked Professor Calway's lecture. Is it going to do you any good, that's the question? hope so, Ann.
#ANN.
I took you on purpose. Your charity's getting simply awful. Those two this morning cleared out all my housekeeping money.
#WELLWYN.
Um! Um! I quite understand your feeling.
#ANN.
They both had your card, so I couldn't refuse - didn't know what you'd said to them. Why don't you make it a rule never to give your card to anyone except really decent people, and - picture dealers, of course.
#WELLWYN.
My dear, I have - often.
#ANN.
Then why don't you keep it? It's a frightful habit. You are naughty, Daddy. One of these days you'll get yourself into most fearful complications.
#WELLWYN.
My dear, when they - when they look at you?
#ANN.
You know the house wants all sorts of things. Why do you speak to them at all?
#WELLWYN.
I don't - they speak to me.
#ANN.
They see you coming. Anybody can see you coming, Daddy. That's why you ought to be so careful. I shall make you wear a hard hat. Those squashy hats of yours are hopelessly inefficient.
#WELLWYN.
Calway wears one.
#ANN.
As if anyone would beg of Professor Calway.
#WELLWYN.
Well - perhaps not. You know, Ann, I admire that fellow. Wonderful power of - of - theory! How a man can be so absolutely tidy in his mind! It's most exciting.
#ANN.
Has any one begged of you to - day?
#WELLWYN.
No - no.
#ANN.
Will you have rum in your tea?
#WELLWYN.
Yes, my dear - a good deal.
#ANN.
Well, who was it?
#WELLWYN.
He didn't beg of me. Interesting old creature, Ann - real type. Old cabman.
#ANN.
Where?
#WELLWYN.
Just on the Embankment.
#ANN.
Of course! Daddy, you know the Embankment ones are always rotters.
#WELLWYN.
Yes, my dear; but this wasn't.
#ANN.
Did you give him your card?
#WELLWYN.
I - I - don't
#ANN.
Did you, Daddy?
#WELLWYN.
I'm rather afraid I may have!
#ANN.
May have! It's simply immoral.
#WELLWYN.
Well, the old fellow was so awfully human, Ann. Besides, I didn't give him any money - hadn't got any.
#ANN.
Look here, Daddy! Did you ever ask anybody for anything? You know you never did, you'd starve first. So would anybody decent. Then, why won't you see that people who beg are rotters?
#WELLWYN.
But, my dear, we're not all the same. They wouldn't do it if it wasn't natural to them. One likes to be friendly. What's the use of being alive if one isn't?
#ANN.
Daddy, you're hopeless.
#WELLWYN.
But, look here, Ann, the whole thing's so jolly complicated. According to Calway, we're to give the State all we can spare, to make the undeserving deserving. He's a Professor; he ought to know. But old Hoxton's always dinning it into me that we ought to support private organisations for helping the deserving, and damn the undeserving. Well, that's just the opposite. And he's a J.P. Tremendous experience. And the Vicar seems to be for a little bit of both. Well, what the devil - ? My trouble is, whichever I'm with, he always converts me. And there's no fun in any of them.
#ANN.
Oh! Daddy, you are so - don't you know that you're the despair of all social reformers? There's a tear in the left knee of your trousers. You're not to wear them again.
#WELLWYN.
Am I likely to?
#ANN.
I shouldn't be a bit surprised if it isn't your only pair. D'you know what I live in terror of?
#ANN.
That you'll take them off some day, and give them away in the street. Have you got any money? Do you know that your pockets are one enormous hole?
#WELLWYN.
No!
#ANN.
Spiritually.
#WELLWYN.
Oh! Ah! H'm!
#ANN.
Now, look here, Daddy! Don't imagine that it isn't the most disgusting luxury on your part to go on giving away things as you do! You know what you really are, I suppose - a sickly sentimentalist!
#WELLWYN.
It isn't sentiment. It's simply that they seem to me so - so - jolly. If I'm to give up feeling sort of - nice in here about people - it doesn't matter who they are - then I don't know what I'm to do. I shall have to sit with my head in a bag.
#ANN.
I think you ought to.
#WELLWYN.
I suppose they see I like them - then they tell me things. After that, of course you can't help doing what you can.
#ANN.
Well, if you will love them up!
#WELLWYN.
My dear, I don't want to. It isn't them especially - why, I feel it even with old Calway sometimes. It's only Providence that he doesn't want anything of me - except to make me like himself - confound him!
#ANN.
What you don't see is that other people aren't a bit like you.
#WELLWYN.
Well, thank God!
#ANN.
It's so old - fashioned too! I'm going to bed - I just leave you to your conscience.
#WELLWYN.
Oh!
#ANN.
Good - night - you old - Daddy!
#WELLWYN.
Bad lot. . Low type - no backbone, no stability!
#WELLWYN.
Ah dear! Tt! Tt! Tt!
#WELLWYN.
I can't, you know; it's impossible.
#WELLWYN.
Let's see - I don't know you - do I?
#WELLWYN.
Oh! Did I? Ah! When?
#MRS. MEGAN.
You 'ad some vi'lets off of me larst spring. You give me 'arf a crown.
#WELLWYN.
Ah! Well, come in - just for a minute - it's very cold - and tell us what it is.
#WELLWYN.
I don't remember you. Yes, I do. Only - you weren't the same - were you?
#MRS. MEGAN.
I seen trouble since.
#WELLWYN.
Trouble! Have some tea?
#WELLWYN.
Keeps the cold out! Drink it off!
#WELLWYN.
Cure for all evils, um?
#MRS. MEGAN.
It warms you.
#WELLWYN.
Well! You know, I oughtn't.
#MRS. MEGAN.
I wouldn't 'a come, but you told me if I wanted an 'and -
#WELLWYN.
Let me see - corner of Flight Street, wasn't it?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Yes, sir, an' I told you about me vi'lets - it was a luvly spring - day.
#WELLWYN.
Beautiful! Beautiful! Birds singing, and the trees, &c.! We had quite a talk. You had a baby with you.
#MRS. MEGAN.
Yes. I got married since then.
#WELLWYN.
Oh! Ah! Yes! And how's the baby?
#MRS. MEGAN.
I lost her.
#WELLWYN.
Oh! poor - Um!
#MRS. MEGAN.
You said something abaht makin' a picture of me. So I thought I might come, in case you'd forgotten.
#WELLWYN.
Things going badly?
#MRS. MEGAN.
I keep 'em covered up, but the cold gets to 'em. Thruppence - that's all I've took.
#WELLWYN.
Ho! Tt! Tt! Christmas, too!
#MRS. MEGAN.
They're dead.
#WELLWYN.
Got a good husband?
#MRS. MEGAN.
He plays cards.
#WELLWYN.
Oh, Lord! And what are you doing out - with a cold like that?
#MRS. MEGAN.
We was sold up this morning - he's gone off with 'is mates. Haven't took enough yet for a night's lodgin'.
#WELLWYN.
But who buys flowers at this time of night?
#WELLWYN.
Saints above us! Here! Come to the fire!
#WELLWYN.
Are your feet wet? Well, sit down here, and take them off. That's right.
#WELLWYN.
How old are you, my child?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Nineteen, come Candlemas.
#WELLWYN.
And what's your name?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Guinevere.
#WELLWYN.
What? Welsh?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Yes - from Battersea.
#WELLWYN.
And your husband?
#MRS. MEGAN.
No. Irish, 'e is. Notting Dale, 'e comes from.
#WELLWYN.
Roman Catholic?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Yes. My 'usband's an atheist as well.
#WELLWYN.
I see. How jolly! And how old is he - this young man of yours?
#MRS. MEGAN.
'E'll be twenty soon.
#WELLWYN.
Babes in the wood! Does he treat you badly?
#MRS. MEGAN.
No.
#WELLWYN.
Nor drink?
#MRS. MEGAN.
No. He's not a bad one. Only he gets playin' cards then 'e'll fly the kite.
#WELLWYN.
I see. And when he's not flying it, what does he do?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Same as me. Other jobs tires 'im.
#WELLWYN.
That's very nice! Well, what am I to do with you?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Of course, I could get me night's lodging if I like to do - the same as some of them.
#WELLWYN.
No! no! Never, my child! Never!
#MRS. MEGAN.
It's easy that way.
#WELLWYN.
Heavens! But your husband! Um?
#MRS. MEGAN.
He's after one I know of.
#WELLWYN.
Tt! What a pickle!
#MRS. MEGAN.
I'll 'ave to walk about the streets.
#WELLWYN.
Now how can I?
#WELLWYN.
You see, the fact is, I mustn't give you anything - because - well, for one thing I haven't got it. There are other reasons, but that's the - real one. But, now, there's a little room where my models dress. I wonder if you could sleep there. Come, and see.
#MRS. MEGAN.
Shall I put them on again?
#WELLWYN.
No, no; there's a nice warm pair of slippers. Why, you're wet all over. Here, wait a little!
#WELLWYN.
Now then! Hsssh! Will it do? There's a couch. You'll find some washing things. Make yourself quite at home. See!
#WELLWYN.
Have a good sleep, child! Forget that you're alive! Done it again! Chow - chow! Well - damn it, what could I have done? Not a farthing on me! Night like this!
#WELLWYN.
Ah! yes. By the fountain. I was sitting there, and you came and ate a roll, and drank the water.
#FERRAND.
My breakfast. I was in poverty - veree bad off. You gave me ten francs. I thought I had a little the right seeing you said that if I came to England -
#WELLWYN.
Um! And so you've come?
#FERRAND.
It was time that I consolidated my fortunes, Monsieur.
#WELLWYN.
And you - have -
#FERRAND.
One is not yet Rothschild.
#WELLWYN.
No. We talked philosophy.
#FERRAND.
I have not yet changed my opinion. We other vagabonds, we are exploited by the bourgeois. This is always my idea, Monsieur.
#WELLWYN.
Yes - not quite the general view, perhaps! Well - Come in! Very glad to see you again.
#FERRAND.
Pardon, Monsieur - your goodness - I am a little weak. I tighten him one hole for each meal, during two days now. That gives you courage.
#WELLWYN.
Have some of this. It'll buck you up.
#FERRAND.
Sometimes I think that I will never succeed to dominate my life, Monsieur - though I have no vices, except that I guard always the aspiration to achieve success. But I will not roll myself under the machine of existence to gain a nothing every day. I must find with what to fly a little.
#WELLWYN.
Yes; yes - I remember, you found it difficult to stay long in any particular - yes.
#FERRAND.
In one little corner? No - Monsieur - never! That is not in my character. I must see life.
#WELLWYN.
Quite, quite! Have some cake?
#FERRAND.
In your country they say you cannot eat the cake and have it. But one must always try, Monsieur; one must never be content. 'Grand merci', but for the moment I have no stomach - I have lost my stomach now for two days. If I could smoke, Monsieur!
#WELLWYN.
Rather! Roll yourself one.
#FERRAND.
If I had not found you, Monsieur - I would have been a little hole in the river to - night - I was so discouraged. Life! And to think that in a few minutes HE will be born! Monsieur! The world would reproach you for your goodness to me.
#WELLWYN.
You think so? Ah!
#FERRAND.
Monsieur, if HE himself were on earth now, there would be a little heap of gentlemen writing to the journals every day to call Him sloppee sentimentalist! And what is veree funny, these gentlemen they would all be most strong Christians. But that will not trouble you, Monsieur; I saw well from the first that you are no Christian. You have so kind a face.
#WELLWYN.
Oh! Indeed!
#FERRAND.
You have not enough the Pharisee in your character. You do not judge, and you are judged.
#WELLWYN.
Are you in pain?
#FERRAND.
I 'ave a little the rheumatism.
#WELLWYN.
Wet through, of course! Wait a bit! I wonder if you'd like these trousers; they've - er - they're not quite -
#WELLWYN.
Can you make these do for the moment?
#FERRAND.
'Je vous remercie', Monsieur. May I retire?
#WELLWYN.
Yes, yes.
#WELLWYN.
Good Lord!
#WELLWYN.
Who's that? Who are you?
#TIMSON.
'Appy to see you, sir; we 'ad a talk this morning. Timson - I give you me name. You invited of me, if ye remember.
#WELLWYN.
It's a little late, really.
#TIMSON.
Well, ye see, I never expected to 'ave to call on yer. I was 'itched up all right when I spoke to yer this mornin', but bein' Christmas, things 'ave took a turn with me to - day. I'm reg'lar disgusted - not got the price of a bed abaht me. Thought you wouldn't like me to be delicate - not at my age.
#WELLWYN.
The fact is, it so happens I haven't a copper on me.
#TIMSON.
Wouldn't arsk you if I could 'elp it. 'Ad to do with 'orses all me life. It's this 'ere cold I'm frightened of. I'm afraid I'll go to sleep.
#WELLWYN.
Well, really, I -
#TIMSON.
To be froze to death - I mean - it's awkward.
#WELLWYN.
Well - come in a moment, and let's - think it out. Have some tea!
#TIMSON.
Yer 'ealth. 'Ere's - soberiety! Blimey! Thish yer tea's foreign, ain't it?
#FERRAND.
With a needle, Monsieur, I would soon have with what to make face against the world.
#WELLWYN.
Too short! Ah!
#FERRAND.
Monsieur!
#WELLWYN.
Um! Afraid so!
#FERRAND.
It is an old cabby, is it not, Monsieur? 'Ceux sont tous des buveurs'.
#WELLWYN.
Now, my old friend, sit down a moment. Will you smoke?
#TIMSON.
Thank 'ee - smoke pipe of 'baccer. Old 'orse - standin' abaht in th' cold.
#FERRAND.
'Il est parti'.
#WELLWYN.
He hasn't really left a horse outside, do you think?
#FERRAND.
Non, non, Monsieur - no 'orse. He is dreaming. I know very well that state of him - that catches you sometimes. It is the warmth sudden on the stomach. He will speak no more sense to - night. At the most, drink, and fly a little in his past.
#WELLWYN.
Poor old buffer!
#FERRAND.
Touching, is it not, Monsieur? There are many brave gents among the old cabbies - they have philosophy - that comes from 'orses, and from sitting still.
#WELLWYN.
Drenched!
#FERRAND.
That will do 'im no 'arm, Monsieur - no 'arm at all. He is well wet inside, remember - it is Christmas to - morrow. Put him a rug, if you will, he will soon steam.
#TIMSON.
Tha's right. Put - the rug on th' old 'orse.
#WELLWYN.
What's the matter with him?
#FERRAND.
It is nothing, Monsieur; for the moment he thinks 'imself a 'orse. 'Il joue "cache - cache,"' 'ide and seek, with what you call - 'is bitt.
#WELLWYN.
But what's to be done with him? One can't turn him out in this state.
#FERRAND.
If you wish to leave him 'ere, Monsieur, have no fear. I charge myself with him.
#WELLWYN.
Oh! You - er - I really don't know, I - hadn't contemplated - You think you could manage if I - if I went to bed?
#FERRAND.
But certainly, Monsieur.
#WELLWYN.
You - you're sure you've everything you want?
#FERRAND.
'Mais oui, Monsieur'.
#WELLWYN.
I don't know what I can do by staying.
#FERRAND.
There is nothing you can do, Monsieur. Have confidence in me.
#WELLWYN.
Well - keep the fire up quietly - very quietly. You'd better take this coat of mine, too. You'll find it precious cold, I expect, about three o'clock.
#FERRAND.
I shall sleep in praying for you, Monsieur.
#WELLWYN.
Ah! Yes! Thanks! Well - good - night! By the way, I shall be down rather early. Have to think of my household a bit, you know.
#FERRAND.
'Tres bien, Monsieur'. I comprehend. One must well be regular in this life.
#WELLWYN.
Lord! I'd forgotten -
#FERRAND.
Can I undertake anything, Monsieur?
#WELLWYN.
No, no! You won't want this, will you?
#FERRAND.
'Merci, Monsieur'.
#FERRAND.
'Bon soir, Monsieur'!
#WELLWYN.
The devil! Er - good - night!
#FERRAND.
Poor pigeon! 'Espece de type anglais!'
#FERRAND.
'Pardon, Ma'moiselle'.
#MRS. MEGAN.
Oh!
#FERRAND.
All right, all right! We are brave gents!
#TIMSON.
'Old up, there!
#FERRAND.
Trust in me, Ma'moiselle!
#FERRAND.
We must be good comrades. This asylum - it is better than a doss - 'ouse.
#MRS. MEGAN.
You frightened me.
#TIMSON.
Purple foreigners!
#FERRAND.
Pay no attention, Ma'moiselle. He is a philosopher.
#MRS. MEGAN.
Oh! I thought 'e was boozed.
#FERRAND.
It is the same - veree 'armless.
#MRS. MEGAN.
What's that he's got on 'im?
#FERRAND.
It is a coronation robe. Have no fear, Ma'moiselle. Veree docile potentate.
#MRS. MEGAN.
I wouldn't be afraid of him. I'm afraid o' you.
#FERRAND.
It is because you do not know me, Ma'moiselle. You are wrong, it is always the unknown you should love.
#MRS. MEGAN.
I don't like the way you - speaks to me.
#FERRAND.
Ah! You are a Princess in disguise?
#MRS. MEGAN.
No fear!
#FERRAND.
No? What is it then you do to make face against the necessities of life? A living?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Sells flowers.
#FERRAND.
It is not a career.
#MRS. MEGAN.
You don't know what I do.
#FERRAND.
Ma'moiselle, whatever you do is charming.
#MRS. MEGAN.
You're a foreigner.
#FERRAND.
It is true.
#MRS. MEGAN.
What do you do for a livin'?
#FERRAND.
I am an interpreter.
#MRS. MEGAN.
You ain't very busy, are you?
#FERRAND.
At present I am resting.
#MRS. MEGAN.
How did you and 'im come here?
#FERRAND.
Ma'moiselle, we would ask you the same question.
#MRS. MEGAN.
The gentleman let me. 'E's funny.
#FERRAND.
'C'est un ange' An angel!
#MRS. MEGAN.
Me luck's out - that's why I come.
#FERRAND.
Ah! Ma'moiselle! Luck! There is the little God who dominates us all. Look at this old! He is finished. In his day that old would be doing good business. He could afford himself - Then come the motor cars. All goes - he has nothing left, only 'is 'abits of a 'cocher'! Luck!
#TIMSON.
Kick the foreign beggars out. real Englishman . . And look at me! My father was merchant of ostrich feathers in Brussels. If I had been content to go in his business, I would 'ave been rich. But I was born to roll - "rolling stone"to voyage is stronger than myself. Luck! . And you, Ma'moiselle, shall I tell your fortune? You were born for 'la joie de vivre' - to drink the wines of life. 'Et vous voila'! Luck!
#FERRAND.
Yes. You were born loving pleasure. Is it not? You see, you cannot say, No. All of us, we have our fates. Give me your hand. In each of us there is that against which we cannot struggle. Yes, yes!
#TIMSON.
Be'ave yourselves! Yer crimson canary birds!
#FERRAND.
Pay no attention, Ma'moiselle. He is a Puritan.
#MRS. MEGAN.
Let go my hand, please!
#FERRAND.
There is one thing I have never done - 'urt a woman - that is hardly in my character. Tell me, Ma'moiselle, what is it you think of all day long?
#MRS. MEGAN.
I dunno - lots, I thinks of.
#FERRAND.
Shall I tell you? It is of the streets - the lights - the faces - it is of all which moves, and is warm - it is of colour - it is of Love. That is for you what the road is for me. That is for you what the rum is for that old - See! I kiss you - Ah!
#TIMSON.
All right! I'm comin'!
#FERRAND.
Have no fear, Madame!
#ANN.
Look!
#WELLWYN.
Yes, yes, my dear! It - it happened.
#ANN.
Oh! Daddy!
#FERRAND.
HE is come, Monsieur! 'Appy Christmas! Bon Noel!
#WELLWYN.
Open your mouth.
#ANN.
Daddy!
#WELLWYN.
Well, my dear?
#ANN.
This note from Canon Bentley. He's going to bring her husband here this afternoon.
#WELLWYN.
Oh!
#ANN.
And I met Sir Thomas Hoxton at church this morning, and spoke to him about Timson.
#WELLWYN.
Um!
#ANN.
I'm going round now, Daddy, to ask Professor Calway what we're to do with that Ferrand.
#WELLWYN.
Oh! One each! I wonder if they'll like it.
#ANN.
They'll have to lump it.
#WELLWYN.
You can shut your mouth now.
#WELLWYN.
Ah! Now that's what I want. Dash! Light's gone! Off you get, child - don't tempt me!
#TIMSON.
Ah! Would yer!
#WELLWYN.
Want to have a look? Well - come on!
#WELLWYN.
Oh! You think so?
#MRS. MEGAN.
It's not like my picture that I had on the pier.
#WELLWYN.
No - it wouldn't be.
#MRS. MEGAN.
If I had an 'at on, I'd look better.
#WELLWYN.
With feathers?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Yes.
#WELLWYN.
Well, you can't! I don't like hats, and I don't like feathers.
#WELLWYN.
How much do I owe you?
#MRS. MEGAN.
You paid me for to - day - all 'cept a penny.
#WELLWYN.
Well! Here it is. Go and get your feet on!
#MRS. MEGAN.
You've give me 'arf a crown.
#WELLWYN.
Cut away now!
#TIMSON.
I've finished these yer brushes, sir. It's not a man's work. I've been thinkin' if you'd keep an 'orse, I could give yer satisfaction.
#WELLWYN.
Would the horse, Timson?
#TIMSON.
I knows of one that would just suit yer. Reel 'orse, you'd like 'im.
#WELLWYN.
Afraid not, Timson! Awfully sorry, though, to have nothing better for you than this, at present.
#TIMSON.
Of course, if you can't afford it, I don't press you - it's only that I feel I'm not doing meself justice. There's just one thing, sir; I can't bear to see a gen'leman imposed on. That foreigner - 'e's not the sort to 'ave about the place. Talk? Oh! ah! But 'e'll never do any good with 'imself. He's a alien.
#WELLWYN.
Terrible misfortune to a fellow, Timson.
#TIMSON.
Don't you believe it, sir; it's his fault I says to the young lady yesterday: Miss Ann, your father's a gen'leman , and so you are - I don't mind sayin' it - but, I said, he's too easy - goin'.
#WELLWYN.
Indeed!
#TIMSON.
Well, see that girl now! I never did believe in goin' behind a person's back - I'm an Englishman - but she's a bad hat, sir. Why, look at the street she comes from!
#WELLWYN.
Oh! you know it.
#TIMSON.
Lived there meself larst three years. See the difference a few days' corn's made in her. She's that saucy you can't touch 'er head.
#WELLWYN.
Is there any necessity, Timson?
#TIMSON.
Artful too. Full o' vice, I call'er. Where's 'er 'usband?
#WELLWYN.
Come, Timson! You wouldn't like her to -
#TIMSON.
I'm a man as always beared inspection.
#WELLWYN.
So I see.
#TIMSON.
It's not for me to say nothing - but I can tell a gen'leman as quick as ever I can tell an 'orse.
#WELLWYN.
I find it safest to assume that every man is a gentleman, and every woman a lady. Saves no end of self - contempt. Give me the little brush.
#TIMSON.
Would yer like me to stay and wash it for yer again? I will - I'll do it for you - never grudged workin' for a gen'leman.
#WELLWYN.
Thank you, Timson - very good of you, I'm sure. Just lend us a hand with this. Let's see! What do I owe you?
#TIMSON.
It so 'appens, you advanced me to - day's yesterday.
#WELLWYN.
Then I suppose you want to - morrow's?
#TIMSON.
Well, I 'ad to spend it, lookin' for a permanent job. When you've got to do with 'orses, you can't neglect the publics, or you might as well be dead.
#WELLWYN.
Quite so!
#TIMSON.
It mounts up in the course o' the year.
#WELLWYN.
It would. This is for an exceptional purpose - Timson - see. Not -
#TIMSON.
Certainly, sir. I quite understand. I'm not that sort, as I think I've proved to yer, comin' here regular day after day, all the week. There's one thing, I ought to warn you perhaps - I might 'ave to give this job up any day.
#WELLWYN.
I'd never stand in the way of your bettering yourself, Timson. And, by the way, my daughter spoke to a friend about you to - day. I think something may come of it.
#TIMSON.
Oh! Oh! She did! Well, it might do me a bit o' good. That foreigner! 'E sticks in my gizzard. It's not as if there wasn't plenty o' pigeons for 'im to pluck in 'is own Gawd - forsaken country. Reg - lar jay, that's what I calls 'im. I could tell yer something -
#WELLWYN.
What luck to - day?
#FERRAND.
Again I have beaten all London, Monsieur - not one bite. I think perhaps, that, for the bourgeoisie, there is a little too much colour in my costume.
#WELLWYN.
Let's see - I believe I've an old top hat somewhere.
#FERRAND.
Ah! Monsieur, 'merci', but that I could not. It is scarcely in my character.
#WELLWYN.
True!
#FERRAND.
I have been to merchants of wine, of tabac, to hotels, to Leicester Square. I have been to a Society for spreading Christian knowledge - I thought there I would have a chance perhaps as interpreter. 'Toujours meme chose', we regret, we have no situation for you - same thing everywhere. It seems there is nothing doing in this town.
#WELLWYN.
I've noticed, there never is.
#FERRAND.
I was thinking, Monsieur, that in aviation there might be a career for me - but it seems one must be trained.
#WELLWYN.
Afraid so, Ferrand.
#FERRAND.
Ah! You are always working at this. You will have something of very good there, Monsieur. You wish to fix the type of wild savage existing ever amongst our high civilisation. 'C'est tres chic ca'! In the figures of these good citizens, to whom she offers her flower, you would give the idea of all the cage doors open to catch and make tame the wild bird, that will surely die within. 'Tres gentil'! Believe me, Monsieur, you have there the greatest comedy of life! How anxious are the tame birds to do the wild birds good. For the wild birds it is not funny. There is in some human souls, Monsieur, what cannot be made tame.
#WELLWYN.
I believe you, Ferrand.
#ANN.
Daddy - I want you.
#WELLWYN.
Excuse me a minute!
#FERRAND.
La Valse!
#FERRAND.
One does not comprehend all this, Monsieur, without well studying. I was in train to interpret for Ma'moiselle the chiaroscuro.
#WELLWYN.
Don't take it too seriously, Ferrand.
#FERRAND.
It is a masterpiece.
#WELLWYN.
My daughter's just spoken to a friend, Professor Calway. He'd like to meet you. Could you come back a little later?
#FERRAND.
Certainly, Ma'moiselle. That will be an opening for me, I trust.
#ANN.
Mrs. Megan, will you too come back in half an hour?
#FERRAND.
'Tres bien, Ma'moiselle'! I will see that she does. We will take a little promenade together. That will do us good.
#ANN.
Oh! Daddy, they are rotters. Couldn't you see they were having the most high jinks?
#WELLWYN.
I seemed to have noticed something.
#ANN.
They were kissing.
#WELLWYN.
Tt! Tt!
#ANN.
They're hopeless, all three - especially her. Wish I hadn't given her my clothes now.
#WELLWYN.
Something of wild - savage.
#ANN.
Thank goodness it's the Vicar's business to see that married people live together in his parish.
#WELLWYN.
Oh! The Megans are Roman Catholic - Atheists, Ann.
#ANN.
Then they're all the more bound.
#ANN.
What's the matter?
#WELLWYN.
Didn't you say you spoke to Sir Thomas, too. Suppose he comes in while the Professor's here. They're cat and dog.
#ANN.
Oh! The samovar is lighted. It's all right. He won't.
#WELLWYN.
We'll hope not.
#ANN.
Daddy!
#WELLWYN.
Hi!
#ANN.
There were three bottles.
#WELLWYN.
Oh!
#ANN.
Well! Now there aren't any.
#WELLWYN.
That'll be Timson.
#ANN.
But it's awful!
#WELLWYN.
It is, my dear.
#ANN.
In seven days. To say nothing of the stealing.
#WELLWYN.
I blame myself - very much. Ought to have kept it locked up.
#ANN.
You ought to keep him locked up!
#WELLWYN.
Here's the Vicar!
#ANN.
What are you going to do about the rum?
#WELLWYN.
Come in, Vicar! Happy New Year!
#BERTLEY.
Same to you! Ah! Ann! I've got into touch with her young husband - he's coming round.
#ANN.
Thank Go - Moses!
#BERTLEY.
From what I hear he's not really a bad youth. Afraid he bets on horses. The great thing, WELLWYN, with those poor fellows is to put your finger on the weak spot.
#ANN.
That's not difficult. What would you do, Canon Bertley, with a man who's been drinking father's rum?
#BERTLEY.
Remove the temptation, of course.
#WELLWYN.
He's done that.
#BERTLEY.
Ah! Then - then I should - er -
#ANN.
Remove him.
#BERTLEY.
Before I say that, Ann, I must certainly see the individual.
#WELLWYN.
There he is!
#ANN.
Daddy, I do wish you'd have thick glass put in. It's so disgusting to be spied at! What do you want?
#TIMSON.
Arskin' yer pardon - thought it me duty to come back - found thish yer little brishel on me.
#ANN.
Nothing else?
#WELLWYN.
That'll do, Timson, thanks!
#TIMSON.
As I am 'ere, can I do anything for yer?
#ANN.
Yes, you can sweep out that little room. There's a broom in there.
#TIMSON.
Certainly; never make bones about a little extra - never 'ave in all me life. Do it at onsh, I will. You quite understand me - couldn't bear to 'ave anything on me that wasn't mine.
#ANN.
Old fraud!
#WELLWYN.
"In" and "on." Mark my words, he'll restore the - bottles.
#BERTLEY.
But, my dear WELLWYN, that is stealing.
#WELLWYN.
We all have our discrepancies, Vicar.
#ANN.
Daddy! Discrepancies!
#WELLWYN.
Well, Ann, my theory is that as regards solids Timson's an Individualist, but as regards liquids he's a Socialist . or 'vice versa', according to taste.
#BERTLEY.
No, no, we mustn't joke about it. I do think he should be spoken to.
#WELLWYN.
Yes, but not by me.
#BERTLEY.
Surely you're the proper person.
#WELLWYN.
It was my rum, Vicar. Look so personal.
#WELLWYN.
Isn't that the Professor's knock?
#WELLWYN.
Come in, Professor! So awfully good of you! You know Canon Bentley, I think?
#CALWAY.
Ah! How d'you do?
#WELLWYN.
Your opinion will be invaluable, Professor.
#ANN.
Tea, Professor Calway?
#CALWAY.
Thank you; no tea; milk.
#WELLWYN.
Rum? little - thanks! You were going to show me some one you're trying to rescue, or something, I think.
#ANN.
Oh! Yes. He'll be here directly - simply perfect rotter.
#CALWAY.
Really! Ah! I think you said he was a congenital?
#WELLWYN.
What!
#ANN.
Daddy! Yes; I - I think that's what you call him.
#CALWAY.
Not old?
#ANN.
No; and quite healthy - a vagabond.
#CALWAY.
I see! Yes. Is it, do you think chronic unemployment with a vagrant tendency? Or would it be nearer the mark to say: Vagrancy -
#WELLWYN.
Pure! Oh! pure! Professor. Awfully human.
#CALWAY.
Quite! And - er -
#ANN.
Before he comes, there's another -
#BERTLEY.
Yes, when you came in, we were discussing what should be done with a man who drinks rum - that doesn't belong to him.
#CALWAY.
Really! Dipsomaniac?
#BERTLEY.
Well - perhaps you could tell us - drink certainly changing thine to mine. The Professor could see him, WELLWYN?
#ANN.
Yes, do come and look at him, Professor CALWAY. He's in there.
#ANN.
No, really; we needn't open the door. You can see him through the glass. He's more than half -
#CALWAY.
Well, I hardly -
#ANN.
Oh! Do! Come on, Professor CALWAY! We must know what to do with him. You can stand on a chair. It's all science.
#ANN.
Come on!
#CALWAY.
Do you seriously wish me to?
#ANN.
Rather! It's quite safe; he can't see you.
#CALWAY.
But he might come out.
#ANN.
Well?
#CALWAY.
He appears to be - sitting on the floor.
#WELLWYN.
Yes, that's all right!
#CALWAY.
By the look of his face, as far as one can see it, I should say there was a leaning towards mania. I know the treatment.
#ANN.
Who's that?
#WELLWYN.
It sounds like Sir Thomas.
#CALWAY.
Sir Thomas Hoxton?
#WELLWYN.
Awfully sorry, Professor. You see, we -
#CALWAY.
Not at all. Only, I must decline to be involved in argument with him, please.
#BERTLEY.
He has experience. We might get his opinion, don't you think?
#CALWAY.
On a point of reform? A J.P.!
#BERTLEY.
My dear Sir - we needn't take it.
#ANN.
You'd better open the door, Daddy.
#HOXTON.
Afraid I didn't make myself heard.
#WELLWYN.
So good of you to come, Sir Thomas. Canon Bertley! Professor CALWAY you know, I think.
#HOXTON.
I do.
#ANN.
That old cabman I told you of's been drinking father's rum.
#BERTLEY.
We were just discussing what's to be done with him, Sir Thomas. One wants to do the very best, of course. The question of reform is always delicate.
#CALWAY.
I beg your pardon. There is no question here.
#HOXTON.
Oh! Is he in the house?
#ANN.
In there.
#HOXTON.
Works for you, eh?
#WELLWYN.
Er - yes.
#HOXTON.
Let's have a look at him!
#BERTLEY.
Well - the fact is, Sir Thomas -
#CALWAY.
When last under observation -
#ANN.
He was sitting on the floor.
#WELLWYN.
I don't want the old fellow to feel he's being made a show of. Disgusting to be spied at, Ann.
#ANN.
You can't, Daddy! He's drunk.
#HOXTON.
Never mind, Miss WELLWYN. Hundreds of these fellows before me in my time. The only thing is a sharp lesson!
#CALWAY.
I disagree. I've seen the man; what he requires is steady control, and the bobbins treatment.
#HOXTON.
Not a bit of it! He wants one for his knob! Brace 'em up! It's the only thing.
#BERTLEY.
Personally, I think that if he were spoken to seriously
#CALWAY.
I cannot walk arm in arm with a crab!
#HOXTON.
I beg your pardon?
#CALWAY.
You're moving backwards, Sir Thomas. I've told you before, convinced reactionaryism, in these days -
#BERTLEY.
D'you know, I'm rather afraid this may be our young husband, WELLWYN. I told him half - past four.
#WELLWYN.
Oh! Ah! Yes. Shall we go into the house, Professor, and settle the question quietly while the Vicar sees a young man?
#CALWAY.
The merest sense of continuity - a simple instinct for order -
#HOXTON.
The only way to get order, sir, is to bring the disorderly up with a round turn. You people without practical experience -
#CALWAY.
If you'll listen to me a minute.
#HOXTON.
I can show you in a mo -
#WELLWYN.
I was afraid of it.
#BERTLEY.
The two points of view. Pleasant to see such keenness. I may want you, WELLWYN. And Ann perhaps had better not be present.
#WELLWYN.
Quite so! My dear!
#WELLWYN.
Is that Megan?
#MEGAN.
Yus.
#WELLWYN.
Come in.
#BERTLEY.
Now, my boy, how is it that you and your wife are living apart like this?
#MEGAN.
I dunno.
#BERTLEY.
Well, if you don't, none of us are very likely to, are we?
#MEGAN.
That's what I thought, as I was comin' along.
#WELLWYN.
Have some tea, Megan? What d'you think of her picture? 'Tisn't quite finished.
#MEGAN.
I seen her look like it - once.
#WELLWYN.
Good! When was that?
#MEGAN.
When she 'ad the measles.
#WELLWYN.
I see - yes. I quite see feverish!
#BERTLEY.
My dear WELLWYN, let me - Now, I hope you're willing to come together again, and to maintain her?
#MEGAN.
If she'll maintain me.
#BERTLEY.
Oh! but - I see, you mean you're in the same line of business?
#MEGAN.
Yus.
#BERTLEY.
And lean on each other. Quite so!
#MEGAN.
I leans on 'er mostly - with 'er looks.
#BERTLEY.
Indeed! Very interesting - that!
#MEGAN.
Yus. Sometimes she'll take 'arf a crown off of a toff.
#WELLWYN.
I apologise to you, Megan.
#MEGAN.
I could do with a bit more of it.
#BERTLEY.
Yes! Yes! Now, my boy, I've heard you bet on horses.
#MEGAN.
No, I don't.
#BERTLEY.
Play cards, then? Come! Don't be afraid to acknowledge it.
#MEGAN.
When I'm 'ard up - yus.
#BERTLEY.
But don't you know that's ruination?
#MEGAN.
Depends. Sometimes I wins a lot.
#BERTLEY.
You know that's not at all what I mean. Come, promise me to give it up.
#MEGAN.
I dunno abaht that.
#BERTLEY.
Now, there's a good fellow. Make a big effort and throw the habit off!
#MEGAN.
Comes over me - same as it might over you.
#BERTLEY.
Over me! How do you mean, my boy?
#MEGAN.
To tork!
#BERTLEY.
A hit! But you forget, you know, to talk's my business. It's not yours to gamble.
#MEGAN.
You try sellin' flowers. If that ain't a - gamble
#BERTLEY.
I'm afraid we're wandering a little from the point. Husband and wife should be together. You were brought up to that. Your father and mother -
#MEGAN.
Never was.
#WELLWYN.
The question is, Megan: Will you take your wife home? She's a good little soul.
#MEGAN.
She never let me know it.
#WELLWYN.
Well, now come. Here she is!
#MEGAN.
I might, perhaps, to please you, sir.
#BERTLEY.
Capital, I thought we should get on in time.
#MEGAN.
Yus.
#BERTLEY.
Come in! Come in!
#BERTLEY.
Yes, yes, you'll like to get home at once - I know.
#TIMSON.
I forbids the banns. BERTLEY, Gracious!
#TIMSON.
Just cause and impejiment. There 'e stands. The crimson foreigner! The mockin' jay!
#WELLWYN.
Timson!
#TIMSON.
You're a gen'leman - I'm aweer o' that but I must speak the truth - an' shame the devil!
#BERTLEY.
Is this the rum - ?
#TIMSON.
I'm a teetotaler.
#WELLWYN.
Timson, Timson!
#TIMSON.
Seein' as there's ladies present, I won't be conspicuous. But what I do say, is: He's no better than 'er and she's worse.
#BERTLEY.
This is distressing.
#FERRAND.
On my honour, Monsieur!
#WELLWYN.
Now, now, Timson!
#TIMSON.
That's all right. You're a gen'leman, an' I'm a gen'leman, but he ain't an' she ain't.
#WELLWYN.
We shall not believe you.
#BERTLEY.
No, no; we shall not believe you.
#TIMSON.
Very well, you doubts my word. Will it make any difference, Guv'nor, if I speaks the truth?
#BERTLEY.
No, certainly not - that is - of course, it will.
#TIMSON.
Well, then, I see 'em plainer than I see
#WELLWYN.
Be quiet, Timson!
#BERTLEY.
Not even her husband believes you.
#MEGAN.
Don't I!
#WELLWYN.
Come, Megan, you can see the old fellow's in Paradise.
#BERTLEY.
Do you credit such a - such an object?
#MEGAN.
Naow!
#BERTLEY.
Well, then, my boy?
#MEGAN.
I seen 'em meself.
#BERTLEY.
Gracious! But just now you were will -
#MEGAN.
There wasn't nothing against me honour, then. Now you've took it away between you, cumin' aht with it like this. I don't want no more of 'er, and I'll want a good deal more of 'im; as 'e'll soon find.
#ANN.
What did I say, Daddy? Utter! All three.
#TIMSON.
Well, p'raps I'd better go.
#TIMSON.
Where to, sir?
#WELLWYN.
Ann!
#BERTLEY.
Young people, this is very dreadful. Very sad!
#MRS. MEGAN.
Megan's no better than what I am.
#BERTLEY.
Come, come! Here's your home broken up! Surely - surely - you mustn't smile. That's better. Now, what is to be done?
#FERRAND.
Believe me, Monsieur, I greatly regret.
#BERTLEY.
I'm glad to hear it.
#FERRAND.
If I had foreseen this disaster.
#BERTLEY.
Is that your only reason for regret?
#FERRAND.
Any reason that you wish, Monsieur. I will do my possible.
#MRS. MEGAN.
I could get an unfurnished room if I 'ad the money to furnish it.
#BERTLEY.
But suppose I can induce your husband to forgive you, and take you back?
#MRS. MEGAN.
'E'd 'it me.
#BERTLEY.
I said to forgive.
#MRS. MEGAN.
That wouldn't make no difference.
#BERTLEY.
That is sinful.
#MRS. MEGAN.
I'm a Catholic.
#BERTLEY.
My good child, what difference does that make?
#FERRAND.
Monsieur, if I might interpret for her.
#MRS. MEGAN.
If I 'ad the money to buy some fresh stock.
#BERTLEY.
Yes; yes; never mind the money. What I want to find in you both, is repentance.
#MRS. MEGAN.
I can't get me livin' off of repentin'.
#BERTLEY.
Now, now! Never say what you know to be wrong.
#FERRAND.
Monsieur, her soul is very simple.
#BERTLEY.
I do not know, sir, that we shall get any great assistance from your views. In fact, one thing is clear to me, she must discontinue your acquaintanceship at once.
#FERRAND.
Certainly, Monsieur. We have no serious intentions.
#BERTLEY.
All the more shame to you, then!
#FERRAND.
Monsieur, I see perfectly your point of view. It is very natural.
#MRS. MEGAN.
I don't want'im hurt'cos o' me. Megan'll get his mates to belt him - bein' foreign like he is.
#BERTLEY.
Yes, never mind that. It's you I'm thinking of.
#MRS. MEGAN.
I'd sooner they'd hit me.
#WELLWYN.
Well said, my child!
#MRS. MEGAN.
'Twasn't his fault.
#FERRAND.
I cannot accept that Monsieur. The blame - it is all mine.
#ANN.
Daddy, they're having an awful - !
#CALWAY.
The question is a much wider one, Sir Thomas.
#HOXTON.
As wide as you like, you'll never -
#BERTLEY.
Let me go in here a minute, Wellyn. I must finish speaking to her. We can't leave the matter thus.
#FERRAND.
Do you desire my company, Monsieur?
#WELLWYN.
You shouldn't have done this, Ferrand. It wasn't the square thing.
#FERRAND.
Monsieur, I feel that I am in the wrong. It was stronger than me.
#HOXTON.
No, Sir, I repeat, if the country once commits itself to your views of reform, it's as good as doomed.
#CALWAY.
I seem to have heard that before, Sir Thomas. And let me say at once that your hitty - missy cart - load of bricks regime -
#HOXTON.
Is a deuced sight better, sir, than your grand - motherly methods. What the old fellow wants is a shock! With all this socialistic molly - coddling, you're losing sight of the individual.
#CALWAY.
You, sir, with your "devil take the hindmost," have never even seen him.
#HOXTON.
Damnation!
#CALWAY.
How simultaneous!
#FERRAND.
Monsieur, it was true, it seems. They had lost sight of the individual.
#CONSTABLE.
Anything wrong, sir?
#HOXTON.
Wrong? Great Scott! Constable! Why do you let things lie about in the street like this? Look here, Wellyn!
#WELLWYN.
It's only the old fellow whose reform you were discussing.
#HOXTON.
How did he come here?
#CONSTABLE.
Drunk, sir. Just off the premises, by good luck. Come along, father.
#TIMSON.
Cert'nly, by no means; take my arm.
#ANN.
What's happened?
#CALWAY.
Might we have a brush?
#HOXTON.
Let it dry!
#WELLWYN.
Poor old Timson!
#FERRAND.
Must be philosopher, Monsieur! They will but run him in a little.
#BERTLEY.
Let's see, your Christian name is -
#MRS. MEGAN.
Guinevere.
#BERTLEY.
Oh! Ah! Ah! Ann, take Gui - take our little friend into the study a minute: I am going to put her into service. We shall make a new woman of her, yet.
#ANN.
Come on!
#BERTLEY.
Have you fallen?
#CALWAY.
Yes.
#BERTLEY.
Dear me! How was that?
#HOXTON.
That old ruffian drunk on the doorstep. Hope they'll give him a sharp dose! These rag - tags!
#FERRAND.
Monsieur, something tells me it is time I took the road again.
#WELLWYN.
Take this, then!
#FERRAND.
Non, Monsieur. To abuse 'ospitality is not in my character.
#BERTLEY.
We must not despair of anyone.
#HOXTON.
Who talked of despairing? Treat him, as I say, and you'll see!
#CALWAY.
The interest of the State -
#HOXTON.
The interest of the individual citizen sir -
#BERTLEY.
Come! A little of both, a little of both!
#FERRAND.
You are now debarrassed of us three, Monsieur. I leave you instead - these sirs. 'Au revoir, Monsieur'! 'Appy New Year!
#HOXTON.
My theory - !
#CALWAY.
My theory - !
#BERTLEY.
My theory - !
#HOXTON.
My - ! CALWAY. My - ! BERTLEY. My - !
#CHIEF HUMBLE-MAN.
We've about pinched this little lot, sir. Shall we take the - reservoir?
#WELLWYN.
Ah! Thanks - thanks - heavy work, I'm afraid.
#HUMBLE-MAN.
Thank'ee, sir. Much obliged, I'm sure. We'll 'ave to come back for this. Not a fixture, as I understand. Perhaps you'd like us to leave these 'ere for a bit.
#WELLWYN.
Ah! do.
#BERTLEY.
WELLWYN! It's ages since I saw you. No idea you were moving. This is very dreadful.
#WELLWYN.
Yes, Ann found this - too exposed. That tall house in Flight Street - we're going there. Seventh floor.
#BERTLEY.
Lift?
#BERTLEY.
Dear me! No lift? Fine view, no doubt. You'll be greatly missed.
#WELLWYN.
So Ann thinks. Vicar, what's become of that little flower - seller I was painting at Christmas? You took her into service.
#BERTLEY.
Not we - exactly! Some dear friends of ours. Painful subject!
#WELLWYN.
Oh!
#BERTLEY.
Yes. She got the footman into trouble.
#WELLWYN.
Did she, now?
#BERTLEY.
Disappointing. I consulted with CALWAY, and he advised me to try a certain institution. We got her safely in - excellent place; but, d'you know, she broke out three weeks ago. And since - I've heard hopeless, I'm afraid - quite!
#WELLWYN.
I thought I saw her last night. You can't tell me her address, I suppose?
#BERTLEY.
The husband too has quite passed out of my ken. He betted on horses, you remember. I'm sometimes tempted to believe there's nothing for some of these poor folk but to pray for death.
#BERTLEY.
Ah! Ann. I was telling your father of that poor little Mrs. Megan.
#ANN.
Is she dead?
#BERTLEY.
Worse I fear. By the way - what became of her accomplice?
#ANN.
We haven't seen him since.
#WELLWYN.
No, my dear; I have not.
#BERTLEY.
And the - old gentleman who drank the rum?
#ANN.
He got fourteen days. It was the fifth time.
#BERTLEY.
Dear me!
#ANN.
When he came out he got more drunk than ever. Rather a score for Professor Calway, wasn't it?
#BERTLEY.
I remember. He and Sir Thomas took a kindly interest in the old fellow.
#ANN.
Yes, they fell over him. The Professor got him into an Institution.
#BERTLEY.
Indeed!
#ANN.
He was perfectly sober all the time he was there.
#WELLWYN.
My dear, they only allow them milk.
#ANN.
Well, anyway, he was reformed.
#WELLWYN.
Ye - yes!
#ANN.
Daddy! You've been seeing him!
#WELLWYN.
My dear, I have not.
#ANN.
How do you know, then?
#WELLWYN.
Came across Sir Thomas on the Embankment yesterday; told me old Timso - had been had up again for sitting down in front of a brewer's dray.
#ANN.
Why?
#WELLWYN.
Well, you see, as soon as he came out of the what d'you call 'em, he got drunk for a week, and it left him in low spirits.
#BERTLEY.
Do you mean he deliberately sat down, with the intention - of - er?
#WELLWYN.
Said he was tired of life, but they didn't believe him.
#ANN.
Rather a score for Sir Thomas! I suppose he'd told the Professor? What did he say?
#WELLWYN.
Well, the Professor said he felt there was nothing for some of these poor devils but a lethal chamber.
#BERTLEY.
Did he really!
#WELLWYN.
And Sir Thomas agreed. Historic occasion. And you, Vicar H'm!
#ANN.
Well, there isn't.
#BERTLEY.
And yet! Some good in the old fellow, no doubt, if one could put one's finger on it. You'll let us know, then, when you're settled. What was the address? Ah! yes. Good - bye, Ann. Good - bye, Wellyn. What a wind!
#ANN.
Daddy, have you told those other two where we're going?
#WELLWYN.
Which other two, my dear?
#ANN.
The Professor and Sir Thomas.
#WELLWYN.
Well, Ann, naturally I -
#ANN.
Oh, dear! When I'm trying to get you away from all this atmosphere. I don't so much mind the Vicar knowing, because he's got a weak heart -
#WELLWYN.
Seventh floor! I felt there was something.
#ANN.
I'm going round now. But you must stay here till the van comes back. And don't forget you tipped the men after the first load.
#WELLWYN.
Oh! Yes, yes. Good sorts they look, those fellows!
#ANN.
What have you done?
#WELLWYN.
Nothing, my dear, really - !
#ANN.
What? rather think I may have tipped them twice.
#ANN.
Daddy! If it is the first of April, it's not necessary to make a fool of oneself. That's the last time you ever do these ridiculous things. I'm going to see that you spend your money on yourself. You needn't look at me like that! I mean to. As soon as I've got you away from here, and all - these -
#WELLWYN.
Don't rub it in, Ann!
#ANN.
Deeds, not words, Daddy!
#WELLWYN.
Bad lot - low type! No method! No theory!
#FERRAND.
Enchanted to see you, Monsieur. You are leaving?
#WELLWYN.
How goes it?
#FERRAND.
As you see, Monsieur. I have done of my best. It still flies from me.
#WELLWYN.
Ferrand, it will always fly.
#FERRAND.
Don't say that, Monsieur! It is too much the echo of my heart.
#WELLWYN.
Forgive me! I didn't mean to pain you.
#FERRAND.
That old cabby, Monsieur, you remember - they tell me, he nearly succeeded to gain happiness the other day.
#FERRAND.
And those Sirs, so interested in him, with their theories? He has worn them out? That goes without saying. And now they wish for him the lethal chamber.
#WELLWYN.
How did you know that?
#FERRAND.
Monsieur, while I was on the road this time I fell ill of a fever. It seemed to me in my illness that I saw the truth - how I was wasting in this world - I would never be good for any one - nor any one for me - all would go by, and I never of it - fame, and fortune, and peace, even the necessities of life, ever mocking me.
#FERRAND.
And I saw, Monsieur, so plain, that I should be vagabond all my days, and my days short, I dying in the end the death of a dog. I saw it all in my fever - clear as that flame - there was nothing for us others, but the herb of death. And so, Monsieur, I wished to die. I told no one of my fever. I lay out on the ground - it was verree cold. But they would not let me die on the roads of their parishes - they took me to an Institution, Monsieur, I looked in their eyes while I lay there, and I saw more clear than the blue heaven that they thought it best that I should die, although they would not let me. Then Monsieur, naturally my spirit rose, and I said: "So much the worse for you. I will live a little more." One is made like that! Life is sweet, Monsieur.
#WELLWYN.
Yes, Ferrand; Life is sweet.
#FERRAND.
That little girl you had here, Monsieur in her too there is something of wild - savage. She must have joy of life. I have seen her since I came back. She has embraced the life of joy. It is not quite the same thing. She is lost, Monsieur, as a stone that sinks in water. I can see, if she cannot. Oh! I am not to blame for that, Monsieur. It had well begun before I knew her.
#WELLWYN.
Yes, yes - I was afraid of it, at the time.
#FERRAND.
I do my best for her, Monsieur, but look at me! Besides, I am not good for her - it is not good for simple souls to be with those who see things clear. For the great part of mankind, to see anything - is fatal.
#WELLWYN.
Even for you, it seems.
#FERRAND.
No, Monsieur. To be so near to death has done me good; I shall not lack courage any more till the wind blows on my grave. Since I saw you, Monsieur, I have been in three Institutions. They are palaces. One may eat upon the floor - though it is true - for Kings - they eat too much of skilly there. One little thing they lack - those palaces. It is understanding of the 'uman heart. In them tame birds pluck wild birds naked.
#WELLWYN.
They mean well.
#FERRAND.
Ah! Monsieur, I am loafer, waster - what you like - for all that poverty is my only crime. If I were rich, should I not be simply veree original, 'ighly respected, with soul above commerce, travelling to see the world? And that young girl, would she not be "that charming ladee," "veree chic, you know!" And the old Tims - good old - fashioned gentleman - drinking his liquor well. Eh! bien - what are we now? Dark beasts, despised by all. That is life, Monsieur.
#WELLWYN.
We're our own enemies, Ferrand. I can afford it - you can't. Quite true!
#FERRAND.
Monsieur, do you know this? You are the sole being that can do us good - we hopeless ones.
#WELLWYN.
Not a bit of it; I'm hopeless too.
#FERRAND.
Monsieur, it is just that. You understand. When we are with you we feel something - here - If I had one prayer to make, it would be, Good God, give me to understand! Those sirs, with their theories, they can clean our skins and chain our 'abits - that soothes for them the aesthetic sense; it gives them too their good little importance. But our spirits they cannot touch, for they nevare understand. Without that, Monsieur, all is dry as a parched skin of orange.
#WELLWYN.
Don't be so bitter. Think of all the work they do!
#FERRAND.
Monsieur, of their industry I say nothing. They do a good work while they attend with their theories to the sick and the tame old, and the good unfortunate deserving. Above all to the little children. But, Monsieur, when all is done, there are always us hopeless ones. What can they do with me, Monsieur, with that girl, or with that old man? Ah! Monsieur, we, too, 'ave our qualities, we others - it wants you courage to undertake a career like mine, or like that young girl's. We wild ones - we know a thousand times more of life than ever will those sirs. They waste their time trying to make rooks white. Be kind to us if you will, or let us alone like Mees Ann, but do not try to change our skins. Leave us to live, or leave us to die when we like in the free air. If you do not wish of us, you have but to shut your pockets and - your doors - we shall die the faster.
#WELLWYN.
But that, you know - we can't do - now can we?
#FERRAND.
If you cannot, how is it our fault? The harm we do to others - is it so much? If I am criminal, dangerous - shut me up! I would not pity myself - nevare. But we in whom something moves - like that flame, Monsieur, that cannot keep still - we others - we are not many - that must have motion in our lives, do not let them make us prisoners, with their theories, because we are not like them - it is life itself they would enclose! I ask your pardon; I am talking. If I could smoke, Monsieur!
#FERRAND.
The good God made me so that I would rather walk a whole month of nights, hungry, with the stars, than sit one single day making round business on an office stool! It is not to my advantage. I cannot help it that I am a vagabond. What would you have? It is stronger than me. Monsieur, I say to you things I have never said.
#WELLWYN.
Go on, go on.
#FERRAND.
Monsieur! Are you really English? The English are so civilised.
#WELLWYN.
And am I not?
#FERRAND.
You treat me like a brother.
#TIMSON.
Take her in 'ere. I knows 'im.
#FERRAND.
Monsieur, it is that little girl!
#WELLWYN.
What's happened? Constable! What's happened!
#CONSTABLE.
'Tempted sooicide, sir; but she hadn't been in the water 'arf a minute when I got hold of her. Can't understand her collapsin' like this.
#WELLWYN.
I don't feel anything.
#FERRAND.
Let me try, Monsieur.
#CONSTABLE.
You keep off, my lad.
#WELLWYN.
No, constable - let him. He's her friend.
#CONSTABLE.
Here you! Cut off for a doctor - sharp now! Now then, stand away there, please - we can't have you round the body. Keep back - Clear out, now!
#FERRAND.
The rum!
#FERRAND.
Her soul is still away, Monsieur!
#CONSTABLE.
It's never drownin', sir - her head was hardly under; I was on to her like knife.
#FERRAND.
She has not yet her philosophy, Monsieur; at the beginning they often try. If she is dead! What fortune!
#CONSTABLE.
True enough, sir - that! We'd just begun to know 'er. If she 'as been taken - her best friends couldn't wish 'er better.
#WELLWYN.
Poor little thing! I'll try this hot tea.
#FERRAND.
'La mort - le grand ami!'
#WELLWYN.
Look! Look at her! She's coming round!
#CONSTABLE.
That's brave! Good lass! She'll pick up now, sir.
#WELLWYN.
There you are, my dear. There, there - better now! That's right. Drink a little more of this tea.
#FERRAND.
Bring her to the fire, Monsieur.
#WELLWYN.
Feeling better, my child?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Yes.
#WELLWYN.
That's good. That's good. Now, how was it? Um?
#MRS. MEGAN.
I dunno. I was standin' here just now when you was talkin', and when I heard 'im, it cam' over me to do it - like.
#WELLWYN.
Ah, yes I know.
#MRS. MEGAN.
I didn't seem no good to meself nor any one. But when I got in the water, I didn't want to any more. It was cold in there.
#WELLWYN.
Have you been having such a bad time of it?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Yes. And listenin' to him upset me. I feel better now I've been in the water.
#WELLWYN.
There, there! Shivery? Like to walk up and down a little?
#WELLWYN.
Beastly when your head goes under?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Yes. It frightened me. I thought I wouldn't come up again.
#WELLWYN.
I know - sort of world without end, wasn't it? What did you think of, um?
#MRS. MEGAN.
I wished I 'adn't jumped - an' I thought of my baby - that died - and - and I thought of d - dancin'.
#WELLWYN.
There, there - there!
#MRS. MEGAN.
Then 'e got hold o' me, an' pulled me out.
#WELLWYN.
Ah! what a comfort - um?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Yes. The water got into me mouth.
#WELLWYN.
My dear child! Don't think such things! As if anyone would - !
#MRS. MEGAN.
I thought they did. They used to look at me so sometimes, where I was before I ran away - I couldn't stop there, you know.
#WELLWYN.
Too cooped - up?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Yes. No life at all, it wasn't - not after sellin' flowers, I'd rather be doin' what I am.
#WELLWYN.
Ah! Well - it's all over, now! How d'you feel - eh? Better?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Yes. I feels all right now.
#WELLWYN.
No shivers, and no aches; quite comfy?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Yes.
#WELLWYN.
That's a blessing. All well, now, Constable - thank you!
#CONSTABLE.
First rate, sir! That's capital! Right as rain, eh, my girl?
#MRS. MEGAN.
Yes.
#CONSTABLE.
That's fine. Then I think perhaps, for 'er sake, sir, the sooner we move on and get her a change o' clothin', the better.
#WELLWYN.
Oh! don't bother about that - I'll send round for my daughter - we'll manage for her here.
#CONSTABLE.
Very kind of you, I'm sure, sir. But she seems all right. She'll get every attention at the station.
#WELLWYN.
But I assure you, we don't mind at all; we'll take the greatest care of her.
#CONSTABLE.
Well, sir, of course, I'm thinkin' of - I'm afraid I can't depart from the usual course.
#WELLWYN.
What! But - oh! No! No! That'll be all right, Constable! That'll be all right! I assure you.
#CONSTABLE.
I'll have to charge her, sir.
#WELLWYN.
Good God! You don't mean to say the poor little thing has got to be -
#CONSTABLE.
Well, sir, we can't get over the facts, can we? There it is! You know what sooicide amounts to - it's an awkward job.
#WELLWYN.
But look here, Constable, as a reasonable man - This poor wretched little girl - you know what that life means better than anyone! Why! It's to her credit to try and jump out of it!
#WELLWYN.
You said yourself her best friends couldn't wish her better! Everybody feels it! The Vicar was here a few minutes ago saying the very same thing - the Vicar, Constable! Ah! now, look here, I know something of her. Nothing can be done with her. We all admit it. Don't you see? Well, then hang it - you needn't go and make fools of us all by -
#FERRAND.
Monsieur, it is the first of April.
#CONSTABLE.
Can't neglect me duty, sir; that's impossible.
#WELLWYN.
Look here! She - slipped. She's been telling me. Come, Constable, there's a good fellow. May be the making of her, this.
#CONSTABLE.
I quite appreciate your good 'eart, sir, an' you make it very 'ard for me - but, come now! I put it to you as a gentleman, would you go back on yer duty if you was me?
#WELLWYN.
Well! God in heaven! Of all the d - d topsy - turvy - ! Not a soul in the world wants her alive - and now she's to be prosecuted for trying to be where everyone wishes her.
#CONSTABLE.
Come, sir, come! Be a man!
#FERRAND.
Do not grieve, Monsieur! This will give her courage. There is nothing that gives more courage than to see the irony of things. Go, my child; it will do you good.
#CONSTABLE.
That's my good lass. Come along! We won't hurt you.
#MRS. MEGAN.
I don't want to go. They'll stare at me.
#CONSTABLE.
Not they! I'll see to that.
#WELLWYN.
Take her in a cab, Constable, if you must - for God's sake! Here!
#CONSTABLE.
I will, sir, certainly. Don't think I want to -
#WELLWYN.
No, no, I know. You're a good sort.
#CONSTABLE.
Don't you take on, sir. It's her first try; they won't be hard on 'er. Like as not only bind 'er over in her own recogs. not to do it again. Come, my dear.
#MRS. MEGAN.
I want to take this off. It looks so funny.
#ANN.
What is it? What's happened? Daddy!
#FERRAND.
It is nothing, Ma'moiselle! She has failed to drown herself. They run her in a little.
#WELLWYN.
Lend her your jacket, my dear; she'll catch her death.
#CONSTABLE.
Thank you. Miss - very good of you, I'm sure.
#MRS. MEGAN.
It's warm!
#FERRAND.
That makes the third of us, Monsieur. We are not in luck. To wish us dead, it seems, is easier than to let us die.
#WELLWYN.
Here quick; take this, run after her! When they've done with her tell her to come to us.
#FERRAND.
"No. 7, Haven House, Flight Street!" Rely on me, Monsieur - I will bring her myself to call on you. 'Au revoir, mon bon Monsieur'!
#TIMSON.
Sir!
#WELLWYN.
What - you, Timson?
#TIMSON.
On me larst legs, sir. 'Ere! You can see 'em for yerself! Shawn't trouble yer long....
#WELLWYN.
Not now - TIMSON not now! Take this!
#TIMSON.
Yer new address! You are a gen'leman.
#ANN.
Daddy! Do you know what you've done? Given your card to those six rotters.
#WELLWYN.
Six?
#ANN.
What was the good of this?
#WELLWYN.
Ann! It is stronger than me.
#CHIEF HUMBLE-MAN.
This is the larst of it, sir.
#WELLWYN.
Oh! Ah! yes!
#WELLWYN.
You can finish the decanter.
#CHIEF HUMBLE-MAN.
Third time of arskin'! April fool! Not 'arf! Good old pigeon!
#SECOND HUMBLE-MAN.
'Uman being, I call 'im.
#CHIEF HUMBLE-MAN.
That's right. Tell you wot, I'd never 'a touched this unless 'e'd told me to, I wouldn't - not with 'im.
#SECOND HUMBLE-MAN.
Ditto to that! This is a bit of orl right! Good luck!
#THIRD HUMBLE-MAN.
Same 'ere!
#CHIEF HUMBLE-MAN.
Crikey! Bill! Tea! .....'E's got us! Curtain.
