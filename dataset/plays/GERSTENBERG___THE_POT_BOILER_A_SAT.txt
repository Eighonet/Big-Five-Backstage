#STAGE HAND.
Good morning, Mr. Sud.
#SUD.
Good morning, Gus. Just set two doors; that'll be all I'll need this morning. We're rehearsing for lines. Joe, I'm expecting a young man, it's all right, let him in.
#WOULDBY.
I'm here now, Mr. Sud.
#SUD.
Come up, Mr. Wouldby. Some more border lights, please.
#WOULDBY.
It's very good of you to let me in.
#SUD.
I was fond of your father. I am glad to see his son.
#WOULDBY.
I have written a play, too.
#SUD.
Too bad, too bad, you make the price of paper go up.
#WOULDBY.
It must be wonderful to be the master playwright of our day. Everybody knows Mr. Thomas Pinikles Sud.
#SUD.
Yes, it is a privilege to be a friend of mine!
#WOULDBY.
Will you read my manuscript, sir?
#SUD.
Never roll a manuscript. I see very well you don't even know the first principles.
#WOULDBY.
How can I learn the first principles? No one will tell me.
#SUD.
Wait, I will do a great thing for you, let you stay and see a dress rehearsal of my latest play, "The Pot Boiler." In it I have used all dramatic principles.
#WOULDBY.
What are they?
#SUD.
Well, for instance, this pencil is the woman in the case.
#WOULDBY.
Pencil!
#SUD.
This inkwell is the villain, although that's really too dark for him. Deep - eyed villains are out of fashion.
#WOULDBY.
Inkwell!
#SUD.
The heroine is Miss Ivory paper cutter.
#WOULDBY.
Ivory!
#SUD.
Mr. Ruler is the hero.
#WOULDBY.
Ruler!
#SUD.
I haven't finished writing it, but we're going through it this morning as far as I have written, then I shall see how to go on. Here are the players now. Line up, please, and let me see your costumes. Now to work - to work - clear the stage!
#SUD.
Mr. Wouldby, if you sit down here with me, we'll be out of the way. You must imagine that this room is the library in Mr. Ivory's house. Ready.
#SUD.
The adventuress - she comes in - she has been cut - she is worried - that nervous twitching of lips and narrowing of eyes are always full of suspense - she takes off her gloves, her hat - that's good business. A door opens - she starts - by starting she shows you she is guilty of something -
#MISS IVORY.
Oh, there you are, Mrs. Pencil.
#MRS. PENCIL.
Yes, I'm back.
#MISS IVORY.
I thought I should have to drink my tea without you.
#SUD.
That tells the audience what time of the day it is; besides, drinking afternoon tea shows Miss Ivory is in society.
#MRS. PENCIL.
Isn't your father going to join us?
#SUD.
That's merely to show the girl has a father.
#MISS IVORY.
No, he is talking business with Mr. Inkwell.
#MRS. PENCIL.
Inkwell!
#MISS IVORY.
Yes, do you know him?
#MRS. PENCIL.
I? Oh - no.
#MISS IVORY.
You've heard of him?
#MRS. PENCIL.
Yes - of course -
#SUD.
Do you catch it? Do you see how her nervousness and her few words at once suggest that there is a link between Mrs. Pencil and Inkwell? That's where I show my technique.
#WOULDBY.
Technique! How can I learn it?
#SUD.
It is the secret that every playwright locks in his breast. Keep the young ones out! Mum is the word!
#MISS IVORY.
I am so sorry father has all this trouble with the brick - layers. They shouldn't have gone on a strike - just now - when you are visiting us.
#SUD.
That tells that Mrs. Pencil is a guest in Miss Ivory's house.
#MISS IVORY.
When you were here last year my mother -
#SUD.
The girl hesitates - they both look sorrowful; we had to cut down the cast, so I killed off her mother.
#MRS. PENCIL.
Ah, my dear - we were such close friends - since my arrival in this country -
#SUD.
You see, I had to make her a foreigner. A villainess always talks with a foreign accent.
#MRS. PENCIL.
I haven't had much time to read particulars about the strike. Does your father still refuse to arbitrate?
#MISS IVORY.
What right have brick - layers to make rules for my father? He would show his weakness if he gave in - I have faith that what he does is right.
#SUD.
The innocent heroine, so cool and pure and white.
#SUD.
That's a dramatic scene. Doesn't it thrill your spine?
#MISS IVORY.
Mrs. Pencil, may I introduce Mr. Inkwell - Will you have a dish of tea?
#SUD.
Cup, cup of tea.
#MISS IVORY.
Dish; dish of tea, or I quit. Which is it?
#SUD.
Oh, very well, dish if you like.
#MISS IVORY.
Please tell me that you have ordered the strikers to come to father's terms?
#MR. INKWELL.
He is looking through his safe for more papers so he asked me to wait in here.
#SUD.
That's an explanation why he came in.
#MISS IVORY.
How many lumps?
#SUD.
That question of the number of lumps is very important; it gives a natural air to the scene.
#MISS IVORY.
I am going to the dining - room to get some arrack for your tea.
#MR. INKWELL.
Oh, please don't trouble -
#MISS IVORY.
No trouble at all.
#SUD.
When you want to get a character out, you've got to get 'em out.
#MR. INKWELL.
You here!
#MRS. PENCIL.
Sch! I had to come! I couldn't live without you any longer -
#INKWELL.
But in this house?
#MRS. PENCIL.
I was her mother's friend.
#INKWELL.
You are indiscreet -
#MRS. PENCIL.
I was desperate for you! You kept putting me off - when I read about this strike I had to come.
#SUD.
Mrs. Pencil is the dreadful woman! A play can't exist without her -
#WOULDBY.
You mean she was his -
#SUD.
Oh, yes - the more fuss we make about her the better.
#MRS. PENCIL.
Oh! Clem! You aren't glad to see me! Oh! that I have lived for this!!!
#SUD.
Idiot! Can't you talk! Do you think I write lines to be cut? How dare you cut my lines!!!
#MRS. PENCIL.
I've done just what it says. "Mrs. Pencil shows extreme despair and passionately - "
#SUD.
That's not the play! That's the moving picture version!!! Come here.
#WOULDBY.
Oh! Have you the same play ready for the movies?
#SUD.
I write in columns - alongside of each other. Dramatic version, moving picture, novelization - for magazines - newspapers and books.
#WOULDBY.
All at once!
#SUD.
Yes!
#WOULDBY.
What are all the pins for?
#SUD.
When I cut out a line one place - I keep it until I find a place somewhere else to patch it in. great playwright has to be economical with his great ideas!
#SUD.
Yes, if he wants a yacht.
#MRS. PENCIL.
Now I see, now I see - Mr. Sud. Shall I go on?
#SUD.
Yes, go on!
#MRS. PENCIL.
Oh! Clem - I was so frightened when I heard about the strikers. Even if you are their leader now, they might turn and murder you.
#INKWELL.
Nonsense, I control the strikers, they come to me for orders. I'll stop this strike as soon as old Ivory gives me my price.
#MRS. PENCIL.
What do the brick - layers want?
#INKWELL.
They want shorter hours, more pay, better light - better air -
#SUD.
Go on - go on - don't glare at me!
#INKWELL.
Pardon me, Mr. Sud - but you have me say the brick - layers want better air. It doesn't sound right. You see brick - layers work out of doors and the air there is - I beg your pardon - it's in no way of criticism, sir -
#SUD.
Come here. Leave out "light and air." That's a confusion from bad typing in the serial version. Go on, Mr. Inkwell.
#INKWELL.
See here, Kate, you keep out of this business - I'm not going to be spied on by any woman.
#MRS. PENCIL.
Who is spying on you?
#INKWELL.
You!!
#SUD.
Now we are coming to a big scene! There is nothing so effective as the repetition of the same words brought up to a climax. Begin again, Mrs. Pencil. "Who is spying on you?"
#MRS. PENCIL.
Who is spying on you?
#INKWELL.
You!
#INKWELL.
You!
#INKWELL.
You!
#SUD.
Parrots! Nothing but parrots! Increase the stress - build up the scene - build - build!
#INKWELL.
How can we build when you don't give us any lines?
#SUD.
What do you call yourselves actors for if you can't supply acting when the playwright uses dashes! - This is the biggest scene in the play. The very fact that I don't give you a lot of literary lines puts me in the class of the most forceful dramatists of the day! My plays are not wishy - washy lines! They are full of action - red - blood - of flesh and blood! Now you do your part - bing - bang stuff! - shake them in their chairs out there - make shivers run up their spines! Make 'em feel you! Compel their applause! Now go to it! Go to it!!!
#INKWELL.
You!
#INKWELL.
You!
#SUD.
Get it over! Get it over!
#INKWELL.
You!
#SUD.
Get it over! Mr. Wouldby, is it getting over?
#WOULDBY.
I don't see anything get over.
#SUD.
He doesn't see it! You hear? He doesn't see it! Begin again! And please, please, please - get it over - over!!
#MRS. PENCIL.
Who is spying on you?
#INKWELL.
You!
#INKWELL.
You!!
#INKWELL.
You!!!
#INKWELL.
You!!!!!
#INKWELL.
You!!!!!!!
#INKWELL.
What do you call it then, coming here after me like this?
#MRS. PENCIL.
What do you mean - like this?
#SUD.
Like what?
#MRS. PENCIL.
Like this?
#SUD.
Accent it - stress it - increase it! Like what?
#MRS. PENCIL.
Like this!
#SUD.
Like what?
#MRS. PENCIL.
Like this!
#SUD.
The best scene in the play - ruined - ruined! I'm noted for my strong, laconic scenes and you make me suffer like this. Perfectly hopeless - I say increase - you decrease; nothing but animal sounds! Nothing but a machine! Oh! What's the use! Go on, go on - now you see, Mr. Wouldby, how actors can make plays fail -
#MRS. PENCIL.
If you'd write us a decent play once we might -
#SUD.
No back - talk, madam! I haven't engaged you yet. If you can't play it any better, I'll let you out! Show us what you can do with the rest of the scene! By Heaven - if you can't pound his chest right the box office will lose money on you!
#WOULDBY.
Oh! Must she pound him?
#SUD.
Seeing a woman pounding a man's chest and hearing her scream is worth two dollars to anybody. Go on, Mrs. Pencil.
#MRS. PENCIL.
You are keeping something from me? You have deceived me! You dog! Tell me! Tell me! Who is she? Where is she? You are keeping something from me!
#WOULDBY.
Is she trying to yank it out of his chest?
#SUD.
Pound! Pound! Get it over! I wrote "applause" here. You've got to get applause here - so pound!
#INKWELL.
Would you mind skipping the scene to - day? I'll wear a foot - ball suit to - morrow.
#SUD.
Just like an actor to have a personal prejudice against a part.
#INKWELL.
I'm not "suited" to it yet - but with the proper costume -
#SUD.
You must not rely on costume! Think of your art!
#WOULDBY.
But why must she pound him so hard?
#SUD.
Because he is the villain and the audience likes to see him get it.
#MRS. PENCIL.
Who is she? You are keeping something from me!
#WOULDBY.
What has he done to make him the villain?
#SUD.
I didn't want an explanation here, so I had to interrupt them - sch - here comes Miss Ivory.
#SUD.
Such interruptions reek with dramatic intensity.
#MISS IVORY.
Here is the arrack for you, Mr. Inkwell -
#INKWELL.
Thank you.
#MRS. PENCIL.
I think I'll take my hat to my room -
#SUD.
Not a bad excuse, the hat! Eh? I had to get her out.
#WOULDBY.
Very natural - yes - indeed -
#MISS IVORY.
Well, Mr. Inkwell, I hope we may yet succeed in claiming you as a friend - instead of coddling you as an enemy.
#INKWELL.
If you treat all your enemies so well - what must you do for your friends?
#MISS IVORY.
We abuse those we love.
#SUD.
Quite epigrammatic, eh?
#INKWELL.
Even abuse at such fair hands could only please.
#SUD.
Did you catch the subtlety of that line?
#MISS IVORY.
Wi - wi - will you have some more tea?
#INKWELL.
I don't want tea - I want you! I love you!
#SUD.
Wait a moment! That's too abrupt! I've some more lines here somewhere. I cut some out of the beginning of the act. When the first curtain went up and the maid was discovered dusting the room I had the Irish butler make love to her. There, Inkwell, are the love lines I was looking for. Proceed, please.
#MISS IVORY.
Shall I go back?
#INKWELL.
To tea.
#MISS IVORY.
Wi - will - will you have some m - more - t - tea?
#INKWELL.
I don't want tea - I want you! I love you! Oh! My darlint, it is a terrible sensation I'ave for you, I'ave - 'and me your little 'and in moine, for the loikes of you I never - I beg pardon, Mr. Sud, but this is a butler making love - I am playing the part of a gentleman -
#SUD.
Haven't you any brains of your own? If a musician can transpose music by sight, can't you do the same to dialogue?
#INKWELL.
But a gentleman doesn't make love like a -
#SUD.
He means the same - now go on - I can't stand these arguments. They will give me apoplexy!
#MISS IVORY.
Oh! Come on, Robert, say anything.
#INKWELL.
Ahem!
#MISS IVORY.
Wi - wi - will you have some more t - tea?
#INKWELL.
I don't want tea! I want you! I love you! Oh! My darling - it is a wonderful feeling - this one - that - which I have for you - indeed - that one which I have for you - put your hand in mine - for a woman like you never before fr - fr - never before have I seen a woman such as you -
#SUD.
My stars! Leave out the h's. That - which - such! - Get it clear for to - morrow's rehearsal.
#INKWELL.
I ought to have my name on the program as co - author.
#SUD.
You ought to have it cut out of the program when you forget to act! Mr. Ruler - Mr. Ruler - Pay some attention to your cues, please! -
#RULER.
Beg pardon, sir - I didn't hear my cue!
#SUD.
It's your business to listen for it.
#RULER.
But they didn't give me the cue!
#SUD.
Well, what is your cue?
#RULER.
What is it?
#SUD.
I asked you what your cue was?
#RULER.
What is it?
#SUD.
Is your hearing perfectly clear?
#RULER.
Perfectly.
#SUD.
Then will you kindly tell me what your cue is?
#RULER.
What is it?
#SUD.
I shall go mad! I'm dealing with lunatics! Lunatics - Once again I ask you, Mr. Ruler - if you can hear - Kindly read from your book and tell me what your cue is -
#RULER.
I've been trying to tell you my cue is "WHAT IS IT!"
#SUD.
Heart disease! Heart disease - I shall die of it! That line was cut long ago!!! The trouble with you actors is you can't forget. Oh! If you could only forget!
#WOULDBY.
I always thought actors had to remember.
#SUD.
Any fool can remember -
#RULER.
See here, Mr. Sud - I don't take abuse! In fact, it's my first experience taking it from authors. In all the other companies I've been in the manager kept the playwright out. He wouldn't have him meddling about!
#SUD.
Mr. Ruler, I am backing the show. I haven't engaged you because you can act, but because you were born good - looking, which is scarcely a compliment to your own efforts. If you please we will proceed. I'll find a line here somewhere in my treasure note books.
#MISS IVORY.
Did you see the advance notices in the paper this morning, Jack - saying the Pot - Boiler is sold out three weeks in advance?
#RULER.
Bill told me there's a steady line outside of the box office.
#MISS IVORY.
I have visions of rehearsing all night outside the night before the opening.
#RULER.
I'm used to doing that, my dear. What gets me is the story of the plot the Sunday edition printed. How can the newspaper know the plot before the playwright does?
#MISS IVORY.
Doesn't Mr. Sud know his own plot?
#RULER.
Why! No, my part's not written after the second act.
#MISS IVORY.
My part isn't either, but it doesn't worry me. These authors - I don't memorize until dress rehearsal night. What's the use. They don't know themselves by that time what lines they told you to keep in or put in or take out. The next morning the critics re - write it anyway for the manager - I don't begin to memorize really - until we're settled for a run.
#RULER.
You'll throw me all out if you give wrong cues -
#MISS IVORY.
Oh! When I can't use my tongue, I let my eyes talk. The public doesn't know the difference. I don't have to act, just be myself. They engage me for my eyes.
#SUD.
Ah! Here's a precious line , take it down, Mr. Ruler. "I was in the neighborhood looking for some real estate." Now, Mr. Ruler, you enter in time - You enter in time to interrupt Mr. Inkwell's declaration of love to Miss Ivory. They spring apart - spring! Mr. Inkwell! No, the house is not on fire! - I didn't say jump.
#INKWELL.
Spring is the same as jump!
#SUD.
There is no time to discuss synonyms. Go on, Miss Ivory.
#MISS IVORY.
Oh! Jack - hello! - where'd you come from?
#RULER.
I was in the neighborhood looking at some real estate - Hello, Inkwell - how's the strike?
#INKWELL.
If you could persuade Mr. Ivory to -
#RULER.
No - Inkwell - I'm not converted to your view! I have my own theories!
#SUD.
Now we are coming to the kernel of the play's success. The new viewpoint - Use all the stock character and situations you want, but add a new twist.
#WOULDBY.
What does Ruler think?
#SUD.
Listen.
#RULER.
I believe sternly in justice - righteous expiation of sin - only in that way can we progress to higher things.
#SUD.
Forms, not things.
#RULER.
Beg pardon, forms - the position I hold to - day is the result of my desires in my previous life - when the trumpet calls me into the next - there I shall reap the harvest of what I have sown here. Why should we help the brick - layers?
#SUD.
Sch!
#RULER.
If they chose in their past life to be born brick - layers here, have we the right -
#SUD.
Sch!!
#RULER.
I ask you - have we the right to tear down the building they designed when they were here before? Have we the right to say to them how they shall lay the bricks in the foundation for their next life? Have we the right -
#MISS IVORY.
Mr. Sudd!!!
#SUD.
Well, what is it, Miss Ivory?
#MISS IVORY.
Excuse me, Mr. Sud - but all this time - while Ruler is talking - I don't know what to do with my hands! Couldn't you cut his lines?
#RULER.
I protest! Mr. Sud, I would resent having a part shortened on me because the leading lady doesn't know what to do with her hands. I really think in this speech of mine you have shown your talent. To cut one word of it would do you a great injustice!
#SUD.
Thank you! Quite so! Quite so! Miss Ivory, during this scene you might be - you might be - be - fanning yourself - to keep yourself the heroine, cool and white.
#WOULDBY.
How well you understand human nature. The play is really more important than the players - isn't it?
#SUD.
Of course, but actors are so superbly conceited.
#WOULDBY.
I know - poor things!
#SUD.
Mr. Ivory's entrance.
#WOULDBY.
The girl's father?
#IVORY.
I could not find the papers in the safe, Inkwell. Ah - how - do - you - do, Jack. Mr. Ivory Ruler
#RULER.
Good morning, Mr. Ivory.
#IVORY.
Daughter, dear - do you know anything about the papers in the safe?
#SUD.
Keep up the suspense - Inkwell.
#INKWELL.
I have no lines here. villain should sustain the suggestion of villainy whether he has lines or not. Look uneasy - tremble -
#IVORY.
But if I see him tremble, Mr. Sud, wouldn't I ask him if he had a chill?
#SUD.
It's not your business to be looking his way just then. Again, Inkwell.
#SUD.
Don't catch his eye!
#IVORY.
Will you tremble again please?
#SUD.
Count five for the tremble. Again please, "Daughter dear, do you know anything about the papers in the safe?"
#IVORY.
Daughter, dear, do you know anything about the papers in the safe?
#SUD.
Everybody look away. Tremble, Inkwell - Now, Inkwell, count five - now look at Inkwell - Again, please.
#IVORY.
Daughter, dear, do you know anything about the papers in the safe?
#SUD.
One - two - three - four - five -
#IVORY.
Those valuable papers!
#SUD.
That's it, go ahead!
#MISS IVORY.
I don't even know the combination, father. Could they have been stolen?
#WOULDBY.
Did Inkwell really take them?
#SUD.
He's the villain, isn't he? I couldn't let the hero do it.
#IVORY.
What shall I do? Where shall I look? Where, oh where?
#MISS IVORY.
Oh! Revolvers!
#RULER.
Let me, sir.
#MISS IVORY.
Where did they come from?
#WOULDBY.
Are they going to use them?
#SUD.
Of course. I had to show the audience the revolvers are there, so Ivory had to knock them down.
#IVORY.
I have to have these near by when a strike is on, one never knows what to expect.
#RULER.
Even I have one in my pocket.
#INKWELL.
And I in mine -
#MISS IVORY.
Oh! dear, how dreadful! Suppose one of them should go off! Oh! Do be careful!
#INKWELL.
Have you changed your mind, Mr. Ivory? Have you decided to accept my proposition?
#MISS IVORY.
What is your proposition, Mr. Inkwell?
#INKWELL.
I believe your father wishes to discuss it with you. Mr. Ruler, will you have a smoke with me in the orangerie?
#SUD.
Orangerie!!!
#MISS IVORY.
What does he want to know -
#IVORY.
Oh! My daughter - how can I tell you - how can I - I am ruined - ruined!
#MISS IVORY.
You - ruined - Oh! -
#IVORY.
Oh!
#MISS IVORY.
Oh!
#SUD.
When you are hard up for conversation use Oh's -
#IVORY.
We have lived beyond our means - Oh! - my child - I have only brought you misery -
#MISS IVORY.
Poor father - don't take it that way - I love you - we must live differently - anything you say -
#WOULDBY.
How sweet and sacrificial!
#SUD.
Ah! She's pure Ivory - a chip off the old block!
#IVORY.
That is not all. Inkwell represents the brick - layers; he will continue the strike unless I can buy him off.
#MISS IVORY.
And you can't raise the money?
#IVORY.
He doesn't want money. He wants to marry you! He will stop at nothing to get me into prison - any place to crush me - he has power. I have cause to fear him.
#MISS IVORY.
Oh! Oh! - How terrible - how terrible - what am I to say! Oh - father - and I can save you? And I hesitate? Yes - yes - I will - father!
#IVORY.
Oh! My daughter! My child! My child!
#MISS IVORY.
Yes, father, I will, cost me what it may. I will.
#SUD.
Miss Ivory! Show some feeling! Think how you feel when you read those lines!
#MISS IVORY.
I know how I feel Yes, father, I will. Cost me what it may, I will, Mr. Inkwell!
#SUD.
Abandonment, Miss Ivory - abandonment -
#MISS IVORY.
Mr. Inkwell! Mr. Ink - we - all - !
#IVORY.
Wait - think - consider -
#INKWELL.
Ah, My dear!
#IVORY.
Oh!
#RULER.
My dear - what is it?
#SUD.
Now, there's your line of "what is it?" I tucked it in there.
#MISS IVORY.
I can't keep my promise to you - Mr. Ruler - please don't ask for an explanation.
#RULER.
What is it, Mr. Ivory?
#IVORY.
Oh - I - am broken - hearted - she is going to marry Inkwell!
#RULER.
No! - no! - not while I live!
#IVORY.
It must be! Come with me - I'll tell you - alone!
#RULER.
Not while I live!
#SUD.
Mr. Ruler! Mr. Ruler! You go out too easily! Wait! I remember a precious line I cut out of one of my last year's plays. It is perfectly fresh! No novelty worn off and incontestably original! "I am coming back."
#RULER.
I am coming back - yes, sir. I am coming back.
#SUD.
There is no, "yes, sir," in it.
#RULER.
No, sir.
#SUD.
Do you wish to retire for a few minutes and commit to memory? Now that we are reaching the climax I want as few interruptions and references to the book as possible -
#RULER.
I think I have it. Cue please, Mr. Ivory.
#IVORY.
Come with me - I'll tell you! - alone!
#RULER.
Not while I live! I am coming back! I am coming back!!! - I am coming back!
#INKWELL.
Now that they have left us alone - my darling - let me tell you how I have waited for this moment -
#MISS IVORY.
No, let me pass - now, now. I have said yes, let it go at that - I cannot talk now - not now -
#MRS. PENCIL.
Coward! Villain! - I have been listening behind that door - all your false vows to me!
#INKWELL.
Don't yell so!
#MRS. PENCIL.
I will yell!
#SUD.
Of course, she will! Shriek good, Mrs. Pencil.
#MRS. PENCIL.
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
#INKWELL.
Stop - ! Stop!
#SUD.
Tussle! Tussle! The audience loves it!
#WOULDBY.
But what did Inkwell do?
#SUD.
Can't you tell. Haven't decided yet! Explanation in last act. No time now. Reaching climax of play. Keep it up! Keep it up!
#MRS. PENCIL.
Oh! The treachery - perjury - You are not fit to live! I'll have my revenge - Revenge! Bing! Bang! I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!
#MISS IVORY.
Oh - who's hurt?
#MRS. PENCIL.
Don't come near him or I'll shoot you!
#RULER.
What's the matter?
#MISS IVORY.
Don't move or she'll shoot you.
#RULER.
Harm her and I'll shoot you!
#INKWELL.
You thought you could be my rival - the girl said she would be mine! If you shoot the woman she'll kill the girl. I'm going to save the girl. Shoot and I'll kill YOU!
#MR. IVORY.
Stop! Save him or I'll shoot to kill! I'll shoot to kill! I'll shoot to kill!
#WOULDBY.
Who shoots?
#SUD.
My God! It's a deadlock!!! I don't know who shoots!
#OTHERS.
Oh! Shoot the AUTHOR!!
