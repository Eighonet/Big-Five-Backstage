#LLOYD.
It’s been s’ gray.
#BETTY.
It’s gettin’ lighter.
#LLOYD.
It’s been s’ gray. But now it’s gettin’ lighter and lighter—even to clear back here in the woods.
#BETTY.
I c’n feel the dawn.
#LLOYD.
I c’n feel the dawn. I c’n see the dawn! Look! Through the trees! Whur the lake’s at! The Big Lake’s a - shinin’ like a tub full o’ soap - suds! I’m glad we come. Ain’t you, Betty?
#BETTY.
I’m glad we come early.
#LLOYD.
I’m glad we come. Le’s set down. The horse is tied up. Grub’s safe in the buggy. Miss Meredith ’n’ the rest of ’em won’t be here fer a long time yit.
#BETTY.
They’ll be here, though.
#LLOYD.
Yeow, but it’ll be a long time. Won’t Miss Meredith be supprised to find us here ahead of everbody? It was my idee. She’ll think we’re purty smart.
#BETTY.
How many’s comin’?
#LLOYD.
The whole class, I guess—’cept the Davis boy. It’ll be a nice day to picnic, won’t it? I alwys liked the Big Lake. I’ve come here many’s the time with Paw, when we’d went out to git some cattle. Miles and miles through the bilin’ heat, tongue clawin’ at yer mouth—a - eatin’ dust, mebbe we’d go. Dust bilin’ up and blindin’ you—a - gettin’ in yer mouth and eyes till you thought you couldn’t stand it. An’ then the dark woods here—briars a - clawin’ at yer legs and hands, rattlers a - hidin’ under the leaves mebbe, logs t’ make yer horses jump, and branches ye’d have t’ dodge. Then the lake—flowin’ wide out—plum over almost out o’ sight—a - settin’ thar in the sun like sump’n you never hoped t’ see! I’d alwys want t’ git off my horse and go down to the edge of it—and tech it—and look at it—a long time. But Paw ud alwys say, “Set thar a - gawkin’, you kid. We got to git back to the sawmill ’fore 2 o’clock,” or he’d say, “’Tother end o’ the Lake is dried up purty good, son. We could cross over thar ’stid o’ goin’ round by the section line.” I ain’t never seen it like this, though. It’s purtier’n I ever seen it. And we c’n look at it ’s long’s we want to. And we c’n go out on it—in a boat—if they is a boat—
#BETTY.
Why don’t you come over here and set down by me?
#LLOYD.
Why don’t you come over here and look at the lake?
#BETTY.
I c’n see it good—from here.
#LLOYD.
Come on over the big log, and you c’n see it better.
#BETTY.
No. I like it here better.
#LLOYD.
You’re funny. Set over thar then. I like you thar jist as well. You look purty good no matter whur you’re a - settin’. You set purty good. I like you settin’ thar with the vine leaves and the tree leaves behind you. You’ve got purtier and purtier, Betty.
#BETTY.
Have I? You’re sweet to say it.
#LLOYD.
Why wouldn’t I say it?
#BETTY.
No reason not to. I like to hear it.
#LLOYD.
Words git in the way some. I cain’t think t’ say much.
#BETTY.
They’s no need t’ say much—
#LLOYD.
They is need to. Seems t’ me yore comin’ to Verdigree wuz like you’d come from some place besides down the river. It made me think of the Bible—sump’n about the angel that come down to roll away the stone—
#BETTY.
You wuzn’t dead.
#LLOYD.
I uz asleep, I wuz. I uz young - asleep. I uz boy - asleep. I’m awake now. I’m a man. I’ve come to life.
#BETTY.
You’d think I uz an angel—sproutin’ wings!
#LLOYD.
You’re better’n an angel—
#BETTY.
I ain’t!
#LLOYD.
You air, too, to me. Better’n an angel! I’ll put this flower in yer hair—
#BETTY.
No.
#LLOYD.
’S like a star.
#BETTY.
No, no. Whur’d you git it at?
#LLOYD.
Why, here.
#BETTY.
Under the leaves. It growed up through the dead leaves. I don’t like it—
#LLOYD.
Why, Betty!
#BETTY.
I cain’t stand them kind of flowers.
#LLOYD.
’S jist a flower. Growin’ in the woods.
#BETTY.
In the dark woods. Lloyd—
#LLOYD.
Whut is it?
#BETTY.
Lloyd, le’s go away frum here—
#LLOYD.
Whur’d you want to go to?
#BETTY.
Out of here, out of these woods! Oh, you think I ain’t right. I cain’t expect you to know how I feel. They’s sump’n—I don’t know what it is— Please! It’s like the woods wuz waitin’—
#LLOYD.
Like a animal.
#BETTY.
To git us. To git us! I’m afeard. They’s things growin’ here—an’ fightin’. They’s things crawlin’ on the ground, under the ground—in the trees—everwhur! I’m afeard!
#LLOYD.
I’m afeard!
#BETTY.
Lloyd!
#LLOYD.
I’m afeard, too! Le’s go—
#BETTY.
Whur’ll we go to?
#LLOYD.
Out on the lake.
#BETTY.
They’s no boat.
#LLOYD.
Futher down—they’s a cabin, I know, and a boat—mebbe. Come on—le’s go to it. Aw, listen. Whut’s the matter with us? Runnin’ like rabbits. They ain’t nuthin’ to be skeered of. We’re jist cold, that’s all. That’s it. Drivin’ so long ’fore it got light has jist got us chilled to the bone.
#BETTY.
I ain’t cold.
#LLOYD.
Y’air. Cold as ice. Ye’re tremblin’.
#BETTY.
I’m afeard!
#LLOYD.
We’ll go the cabin, then. It’s safe thar.
#BETTY.
And git the boat and go out on the lake?
#LLOYD.
We’ll git warm first.
#BETTY.
No! No! Le’s not go to the cabin. Le’s go on the lake.
#LLOYD.
Why, Betty! I never seen you like this!
#BETTY.
I never been like this. Come on, to the Lake—
#LLOYD.
Now, Betty, to the cabin first. Why, you’re cold! They’ll be a fa’r a - burnin’ thar. I doan know who’s a - livin’ thar, but we’ll go up and knock, and ask t’ git warm. They’ll be up. Country folks git up early. And they’ll have a fa’r—a nice roarin’ warm fa’r in the fa’rplace fer us to git warm at. Won’t you like that?
#BETTY.
Mebbe—
#LLOYD.
It’s the funniest kind o’ cabin you ever see. It’s a log cabin. I been in it a long time ago with Paw. It’s a nice log cabin. An’ they’ll have a fa’r.
#BETTY.
Well, I’ll go—if you think—
#LLOYD.
Frum the outside it looks jist like any log cabin. But when you open the door, and look in—whut do you see? Steps! Three steps a - goin’ down to the dirt floor. It’s part under the ground—
#BETTY.
Oh! Like it growed up out o’ the ground—?
#LLOYD.
Yes, jist like that! Like it growed out o’ the ground!
#BETTY.
It growed out o’ the ground. It growed out o’ the same ground the big woods growed out of!
#LLOYD.
Yeow.
#BETTY.
Le’s don’t go thar!
#LLOYD.
Jist long enough to git warm.
#BETTY.
No, not that long!
#LLOYD.
And to ask ’em fer the boat—if they got a boat.
#BETTY.
Couldn’t we jist take the boat—’thout asking?
#LLOYD.
Betty! Course we couldn’t!
#BETTY.
I don’t see why, I don’t see!
#LLOYD.
We ain’t thieves.
#BETTY.
I’d be one.
#LLOYD.
No, you wouldn’t. Come on.
#BETTY.
To the Lake?
#LLOYD.
To the cabin first.
#BETTY.
Lake!
#LLOYD.
No, Betty, cabin! and utensils for cooking at the fireplace—complete the furnishings. A fire burns in the fireplace; coffee bubbles on a little iron stand on the hearth. It is dark and gloomy; no direct sunlight has ever reached this secret place. ELLY, a tall, dark woman of thirty - five, stands tensely by the corner of the bunk. Her face, even in her excitement, is brooding and restrained. Her thick black hair, parted in the middle, is done up in a knob at the back of her head. She is wearing a faded, predominantly purple, plaid dress—full - sleeved, full - skirted, pulled in at the waist. After a moment she goes swiftly to the fireplace, pokes the fire, then goes across to the window nearest the bunk, and with extraordinary agility and grace steps upon a chair under the window and looks out. She gets down, goes slowly toward the fireplace. In the center of the room she halts, wheels about and faces the door. It opens. A man comes in quickly, and closes the door as if shutting something out. He turns, facing her from the top of the steps. He is of medium height, brutal, crafty. His clothes are nondescript and unclean. His hair slants into his eyes.)
#ELLY.
Butch! Thank God! I didn’t see ya—
#BUTCH.
Shet up!
#ELLY.
Butch, w’at is it?
#BUTCH.
Shet up, I tell you! Squawkin’ like a hen. You wanta git me killed? They follered me.
#ELLY.
Tell me—w’at is it—?
#BUTCH.
I’ll show ’em! They won’t git me. I’ve got away frum better men ’n they are. They won’t git me alive—the lousy bums! I’d like to see ’em! They follered me. I been at the Switch. An’ when I started back I seen three men a - follerin’. They’ll come here. They ain’t got nuthin’ on me. They cain’t prove nuthin’— They don’t know it’s me done it. They only got somebody’s word. They don’t know it, and they cain’t prove it. No one saw me—
#ELLY.
Butch, I knowed this ud come. I knowed it. You’ll git sent up. And it ain’t right. You ain’t done nuthin’ wrong. It’s jist a law. W’at the hell’s a law? W’at’s it good fer? Why’n’t it agin the law everwhur else to sell whiskey? Them men whur they have their corner saloons all polished up—a - makin’ it criminal to sell a man a drink—w’at’s right about it? Oh, yes! I know. Pertectin’ the Indians! They don’t want the Indians to git all lit up like they do all the time—ever day, ever night, regular. Hell! Indians! I ain’t saw two Indians since I come to Indian Territory. Now they’ll git you. I’ve knowed it. They’ll stick you fer sellin’ the stuff to the poor fools that’s too skeered, and too weak, and too damn big a cowards to go up to Kansas City or Joplin and bring in their own whiskey, like a man. They’ll send you to jail—the only man that’s got guts enough to do it. You’ll git ten year or more. W’at’ll I git? I’ll git off—that’s w’at I’ll git. I’ll git left here to rot!
#BUTCH.
Shet up! Let up on yer jail stuff. You’ll have me skeered. And I got to keep my senses. Listen t’ me. I been follered before. The last bunch o’ guys laid in wait close to the Holler whur the whiskey’s at. Did that stop me frum gettin’ the whiskey and gettin’ out with it? Did that stop me frum sellin’ it regler to Joe Hurd’s Curio Store at Claremont? I been follered lots o’ times and you know it. I been follered lots o’ times ’count o’ selling whiskey. It ain’t nuthin’ new to me. But this time I’m follered and it ain’t on the ’count o’ whiskey! They’s sump’n else....
#ELLY.
Butch! You got to tell me! W’at is it, w’at’ve you done?
#BUTCH.
Easy, easy!
#ELLY.
You wuz skeered! I never see you like that before. You’ve done sump’n. Tell me w’at it is. W’at’ve you done?
#BUTCH.
Lay off, take it easy....
#ELLY.
Butch....
#BUTCH.
Christ’s sake! You’re a mad womern! Keep yer shirt on! Mebbe I ain’t done nuthin’. Mebbe I jist been foolin’ myself. Mebbe—for all I know, they ain’t nuthin’ to git excited about.
#ELLY.
Butch! You got blood on yer coat! You’re hurt! Why’n’t you tell me? Quick, lemme fix it—I didn’t know.
#BUTCH.
I ain’t hurt.
#ELLY.
You’re bleedin’.
#BUTCH.
It ain’t my blood. I killed a man.
#ELLY.
Oh! You’ll hang fer it, Butch Adams! Why’d you go and do it? Who wuz it?
#BUTCH.
Jim Dory. He told on me fer sellin’ whiskey. He told the federal officers at Tulsy. I killed him. Stuck a knife in him and turned it around. That’s why I went out at midnight ... to lay fer him. I knowed he’d go to the play - party over t’ Binghams. I laid fer him in the big woods close to the sawmill here. He’d go that a - way home, I figgered. About three o’clock this mornin’ he come along in a buggy with one horse to it. I jumped out and grabbed the bridle. He lep’ out on me with a knife. I got a - hold of it. I stuck it through his ribs and turned it around. Then I got skeered. They might think I done it ... findin’ him so close t’ here. It wouldn’t do to find him so close. I picked him up and dumped him in the buggy and give the horse a crack with a stick. He started off in a run down the road. But not afore I’d saw Jim kinda raise up one of his hands to his face! He wuzn’t dead. I hadn’t made shore! He wuzn’t dead, and he’d tell on me! He’d tell some one ’fore he died, and I’d hang fer it! I thought mebbe I could ketch up and finish the job. But the horse run like mad, crashin’ through the bushes but keepin’ purty close to the road. I run and run after him—almost to the Switch. Then I seen some one come out of the store whur a light was burnin’, and grab the horse’s bridle. I seen him take Jim up and carry him in and shet the door. I run away then. I didn’t know if he wuz dead or not. If he wuzn’t, he’d tell on me! I wuz crazy—not knowin’ if he wuz dead or not. I come on to the woods. I couldn’t stand it not knowin’: I started back. When I got to the edge of the woods I seen three men comin’ up the road. I knowed one of ’em! It wuz the Shuruff. They musta wired to Claremont fer him. Jim ’d told on me! Elly! Whut’ll I do? They’ll git me! Elly! They’ll be here any minute! Fer God’s sake, say sump’n!
#ELLY.
Yer breakfast’s ready.
#BUTCH.
Elly!...
#ELLY.
Take off yer coat. Throw it under the bunk. Wash yer hands. Set down.
#BUTCH.
But, Elly....
#ELLY.
Set down! And eat yer breakfast,—Mister Murderer! Eat a plenty. Drink—here’s coffee. Salt pork, gravy, potaters—eat ’em! Enjoy yerself!
#BUTCH.
Whut’re you meanin’! I hadn’t oughta done it? Whut’d you want me to do ... let him git away with it, let that dirty little coward sneak off to Tulsy and sick the officers onto me like bloodhounds ’n do nuthin’ about it? That ain’t my way! If some one does me dirt he gets his, you c’n count on it! I ain’t no Christian: I’m a man!
#ELLY.
You—
#BUTCH.
I’m a man. Let up!
#ELLY.
You’re lower’n I thought you wuz. I never thought t’ be livin’ with a murderer. Oh, I ain’t so good. I know. You don’t have t’ tell me. But I never thought t’ come t’ this. I thought I knowed w’at I uz gettin’ into when I went away with you. I knowed you uz a bootlegger. I didn’t keer. It’s clean. It’s right. But killin’ ... I stop at killin’! Why’d you go and do it? Why did you? Now they’ll come and take you. They’ll take you away from me!
#BUTCH.
Christ’s sake, shet up! They’d a - took me away fer bootleggin’.
#ELLY.
No, they wouldn’ta! They couldn’t ’a’ proved it. But now they’ll take you. They’ll hang you fer murder. No, I won’t let ’em! They cain’t take you! I love you—I cain’t help it. ’N I won’t let ’em take you away frum me! I won’t let em! I’ll find a way! I will! They ain’t proved you done it ... you said no one seen you....
#BUTCH.
They got Jim’s word, I tell you....
#ELLY.
He’s dead. He cain’t talk now.
#BUTCH.
Sh—! I heerd sump’n! They won’t git me!...
#ELLY.
Gimme that gun!
#BUTCH.
.. Not’s long’s I’m alive!
#ELLY.
Butch! Give it t’ me! I’m all right now. I ain’t never advised you wrong. I’ll git you outa this! Listen t’ me: you ain’t been outa the house, y’hear—not since yistiddy. Eat yer breakfast! It’s only a man an’ womern....
#BUTCH.
It’s a blind!
#ELLY.
No, no! It’s jist a boy and girl—a couple o’ kids.
#BUTCH.
Keep ’em out!
#ELLY.
No! We’ll let ’em in! It’s Providence!
#BUTCH.
It’s a blind, I tell you....
#ELLY.
It’s luck! It’s our luck. Mebbe we c’n use ’em....
#BUTCH.
How?
#ELLY.
Some way. I doan know yit. Gimme the gun. Keep yer head. These two’ll come in. They’ll keep you frum hangin’, Butch Adams! Come in!
#LLOYD.
How’d do?
#ELLY.
Howdy.
#LLOYD.
You got a fa’r we could git warm at?
#ELLY.
Over thar.
#LLOYD.
If it ud bother you— If we’d be in yer way.
#ELLY.
It won’t bother me. Nuthin’ gits in my way. You’re welcome. Come in, an’ git warm if you want to. I’ll git you a cheer.
#ELLY.
Butch, bring a cheer up. Here’s another cheer. Set down. The fa’r’s goin’ strong. Mebbe you’d like a cup of hot coffee?
#LLOYD.
Would you, Betty? No, ma’am. Thank you.
#ELLY.
I guess you’ve had yer breakfast.
#LLOYD.
No’m, we ain’t yit. We’re gonna have it ’s soon’s Miss Meredith comes.
#ELLY.
Who’s Miss Meredith?
#LLOYD.
Our teacher.
#ELLY.
Oh! Over t’ the Switch.
#LLOYD.
Yes’m. It’s a picnic breakfast here in the woods—fer the whole class.
#ELLY.
Oh! You’ve come awful early.
#LLOYD.
Nobody’s come yit—but us. We come early.
#ELLY.
How’d you happen to do that?
#LLOYD.
Why, we—we jist thought we’d come early. We drove over from the Switch. Horse and buggy’s up here a ways—not fur.
#ELLY.
Oh! Air you gittin’ warm, Miss?
#BETTY.
Yes’m. I wuz cold.
#LLOYD.
She wuz tremblin’.
#ELLY.
You’d oughta wear more clothes when you go out s’ early.
#BETTY.
Yes’m.
#ELLY.
Yer Maw ud oughta told you.
#BETTY.
Maw’s dead.
#ELLY.
Yer Paw ud oughta told you, then.
#BETTY.
He’s asleep. This is the first time I been out s’ early. I didn’t know it wuz cold. Now I know. ’Fore it gits sun - up it’s li’ble to be. Even after sun - up it’s apt to be cold here in the woods, ain’t it?
#BUTCH.
Elly! Ain’t you got a coat you could let her borry?
#ELLY.
Why, yes, I got a coat. I’ll lend you one.
#BETTY.
No’m, you mustn’t. I’m obliged to you, but I doan need it.
#ELLY.
You shore?
#BETTY.
Yes’m.
#LLOYD.
Then BUTCH rises, crosses the room, takes the poker and stirs the fire. He goes back to the little table and sits down. rises, makes a step toward ELLY.) Mebbe we better go now—
#BUTCH.
Set down!
#ELLY.
He ain’t had his breakfast. Don’t mind him.
#LLOYD.
We better go.
#ELLY.
He don’t mean nuthin’.
#LLOYD.
Well, we’ll stay a minute or two.
#ELLY.
Must be fun to come a - picnickin’ in the woods.
#LLOYD.
I doan know. I ain’t never been.
#ELLY.
I ain’t been since I uz yore age. Why ain’t you been?
#LLOYD.
I’ve always worked, helped my Dad drive cattle—till now. I’m in school.
#ELLY.
And ain’t never been to school before?
#LLOYD.
No, ma’am.
#ELLY.
And ain’t never went on picnics?
#LLOYD.
Not till now.
#ELLY.
I used to go all the time when I uz yore age. In Kansas City. Woods wuzn’t fur away. Used to go—a whole crowd of us—ever Sunday. Set on the ground ... real ground, ’stid o’ pavement ... with grass a - growin’ out of it. First I’d ever saw. We thought it wuz fine. You’ve missed a lot.
#LLOYD.
Yes’m. I guess so. But I’ve had fun. I been out with Paw a lot—drivin’ cattle. He buys ’em up differnt places—Verdigree, Foyil, Sageeyah, even ’s fur away’s Pryor Crick. Nen we saddle up our horses’n go out ’n drive ’em in to ship to the market at St. Louis.
#ELLY.
W’at’s fun about drivin’ cattle? Sounds like work t’ me.
#LLOYD.
Well, it’s work. And it’s fun, too.
#ELLY.
In winter, looks like you’d freeze yer ears off....
#LLOYD.
We don’t drive ’em much in winter.
#ELLY.
Well, in the summer then, ’n the spring: I doan see w’at’s fun about the scorchin’ heat ’n the dust ’n the hot wind. I’d wanta be in out of it. I’d wanta be under a roof whur the sun didn’t hit me....
#LLOYD.
Sun’s bad. Dust’s bad, too. Wind ain’t so good. But they’s sump’n else....
#ELLY.
Yeow? W’at is it?
#LLOYD.
I doan know ... it’s kinda crazy....
#ELLY.
I had a crazy brother.
#LLOYD.
Well, it ain’t as bad as that.
#ELLY.
My brother wuzn’t bad. Jist wuzn’t right. He used to run out in the woods here like he uz wild. He lived here with us. He done queer things.
#LLOYD.
This is queer too. You’ll laugh. You see, when Paw and me goes out t’ drive cattle, some time or other we pass by the Big Lake.
#ELLY.
The Lake?
#LLOYD.
Yes’m. Sometimes it’s early ... when we first start out frum the Switch. Sometimes it’s the middle of the day—when we’ve got back frum Grand River. Sometimes it’s night. But we alwys pass by it—some time or other.
#ELLY.
I doan see w’at’s fun about it. I been livin’ here three year. I c’n see the Lake any time. They’s no fun to that.
#LLOYD.
I cain’t explain it very well. It’s nice—nice t’ see it. ’N no matter whur you’re at, whut time o’ day it is, it’s nice to know the Lake’s thar. ’N it’s nice to know ’at some time mebbe you’ll git a chance to go out on it. I ain’t never been. I alwys want to. Kinda crazy, ain’t it?
#ELLY.
Yes.
#LLOYD.
I told you it wuz.
#ELLY.
You’re not the only one.
#LLOYD.
The only one whut?
#ELLY.
Crazy. They’s others. I’ve saw ’em. Do you ever read the newspapers?
#LLOYD.
Why, no’m—I—
#ELLY.
Cain’t read?
#LLOYD.
Well, not much. But I’m gonna learn better.
#ELLY.
How long you lived at the Switch?
#LLOYD.
Alwys lived thar.
#ELLY.
Then you musta heerd of people gettin’ drownded in the Lake?
#LLOYD.
Yes’m.
#ELLY.
Crazy. Why’d they go on it?
#LLOYD.
’Tain’t the Lake’s fault. It’s their’n.
#ELLY.
Yeow. Fer goin’ out on it.
#LLOYD.
No. Fer keerlessness. Some of ’em fall in. Some of ’em turn the boat over. Sometimes the boat leaks....
#ELLY.
Yeow. But if they didn’t try to go out on the Lake, the boat wouldn’t leak, the boat wouldn’t turn over, ’n they wouldn’t fall in. It’s their fault fer goin’!
#LLOYD.
But people will go out on it. People want to. It ain’t wrong.
#ELLY.
No. ’Tain’t wrong. ’N people will do it. That’s the trouble: they will do it. ’N do you know who it is does it? D’you know who it is that’s alwys gettin’ drownded in the Lake? People like you—young people—like yerselves—picnickin’! My brother—he got drownded out thar—a month back. We never did find him.
#BUTCH.
Warm now?
#BETTY.
Yes, sir. We better go, Lloyd. I’m warm. I’m plenty warm.
#LLOYD.
Well, we’ll go then. Thank you, Mister— Thank you fer the fa’r. I wuz goin’ t’ ask you if we could borry yer boat. I doan know now if I want to....
#BETTY.
You got a boat, ain’t you?
#ELLY.
Yes.
#BETTY.
Let us borry it ... awhile? Please! Let us borry it!
#LLOYD.
You still wanta go on the lake?
#BETTY.
Yes. I do. Please. Cain’t we take it fer a while?
#ELLY.
I doan know—I ain’t so shore....
#BUTCH.
Borry it! Borry it all you want to! Here’s the key. Bring it back when you git ready. Oars is over thar by the door.
#LLOYD.
Thank you. Thanks fer the f’ar. The oars seem to be good. The boat—don’t leak, does it?
#ELLY.
No, it don’t leak.
#LLOYD.
Well. I’m keerful. Betty’s keerful. We’ll make out all right, I guess!
#ELLY.
Why’d you do it?
#BUTCH.
Do whut?
#ELLY.
Give ’em the key. Give ’em the oars.
#BUTCH.
Why, to git rid of ’em. I didn’t want ’em here. It uz you wanted ’em.
#ELLY.
You’re lyin’. Why’d you do it?
#BUTCH.
I told you.
#ELLY.
That wuzn’t it. You got some reason.
#BUTCH.
You had a reason fer lettin’ ’em come in, too. You said you did, anyway. Well, what wuz it?
#ELLY.
I thought we could use ’em....
#BUTCH.
Use ’em! How could we use ’em?
#ELLY.
I guess we cain’t....
#BUTCH.
No, ’course not! You never had no idee of it. You wuz jist talkin’....
#ELLY.
I did have an idee. I thought—when I seen ’em outside ... they might be a way of throwin’ the blame onto that boy, someway....
#BUTCH.
Elly! You thought of blamin’ him with....
#ELLY.
Yes. ’Fore I seen him, I did. After he come in, I knowed we couldn’t.
#BUTCH.
Why not?
#ELLY.
I wouldn’t have the nerve—to try to throw it onto him. Mebbe it ud work all right, mebbe it could be done. They’s ways of makin’ fools outa the law.... Oh, I know, I’ve done it many’s the time ... an’ we could git suspicion on this boy someway. And he’d hang too—innocent and all! But I cain’t do it, I wouldn’t think of doin’ it....
#BUTCH.
Well, why wouldn’t you?
#ELLY.
Butch! Fergit I said it, fergit I ever thought of sich a thing.
#BUTCH.
I’m glad you thought of it.
#ELLY.
W’at’d you mean?
#BUTCH.
I mean—it’s an idee.... I wouldn’t a - thought of it. I c’n see, I c’n see a way—you’re a smart womern, Elly.... Wait a minute, lemme think....
#ELLY.
No! You cain’t do it. W’at’re you thinkin’ of?
#BUTCH.
Why not? D’you want me to hang?
#ELLY.
No.
#BUTCH.
Shet up, then! The officers’ll come here. Whut’ll I tell ’em ... whut’ll I say—they’ll come in the door—this boy—he’ll be out on the lake by that time....
#ELLY.
Butch! Butch!
#BUTCH.
Shet up!
#ELLY.
You cain’t plan to do this! I won’t let you git that boy killed. He’s too young, he’s too sweet - lookin’....
#BUTCH.
Ha! Ain’t I young? Ain’t I sweet - lookin’? You’ve said so. ’D you mean it?
#ELLY.
I come here—and lived with you.
#BUTCH.
So’d Lilly. So’d Marge. ’N whut’d they do? Lilly on her death bed a - damnin’ me—I c’n hear her yit. Marge—she tried to give me up to the law. I fixed her. Hell! They both come here, ’n lived with me. That don’t prove nuthin’. You got to prove it some other way. You got to help me....
#ELLY.
I’ve helped you—bendin’ over yer f’ar, cookin’ yer victuals, washin’ yer clothes, makin’ the beds you’ve slep’ in. I’ve helped you ... livin’ in this damp cellar like a mole with no sunshine a - comin’ in and no moonlight ever. I’ve tended you when you uz sick, I’ve lied fer you, I’ve buried myself away frum all the decent folks I ever knowed—here in these dark woods fer three year. Why’d I do it? Why did I? It’s proof you want, is it? Then look at me, Butch Adams! I’m proof! Look at me! I uz young when I come here with you three year ago. I uz young—like that little girl that uz here jist now. I wuzn’t as purty as her, but I uz young like her. Look at me now!
#BUTCH.
You’re talkin’. You’re puttin’ words together. Whut good are they to me? They won’t save my neck frum hangin’. You got to help me. If you got to talk, tell me whut to do. The Shuruff’ll be comin’ here. Whut’ll I say to him? They ain’t nuthin’ to say to him, unless you help me. I got a plan—
#ELLY.
Not that boy!
#BUTCH.
You got to help me. They don’t keer who they hang in this country. One man’s as good as another fer hangin’. They don’t keer. But I do! I keer fer hangin’. It’s got to be some one else.
#ELLY.
Not that boy!
#BUTCH.
That boy! It’s got to be him! It’s got to be him killed Jim Dory—
#ELLY.
They’ll never b’lieve he done it.
#BUTCH.
They’ll believe it—
#ELLY.
Jim Dory must’a’ told ’em ’fore he died who done it—
#BUTCH.
That don’t prove it. My word’s as good as his. Jim might’a’ made a mistake; in the dark woods he couldn’t see so well ... not even if it ud been daylight. Mebbe—some one else done it—
#ELLY.
Not that boy!
#BUTCH.
That boy, I tell you!
#ELLY.
No, Butch, no!
#BUTCH.
Shet up!
#ELLY.
I cain’t let you. You doan know w’at you’re doin....
#BUTCH.
Doin’? I’m savin’ my neck, that’s whut I’m doin’!
#ELLY.
You’re losin’ it. If you git that boy hung, you’re hangin’ yerself!
#BUTCH.
You’d tell on me! Damn you, I’d oughta kill you!
#ELLY.
Kill me then! Coward! Don’t you know if I done w’at’s right, I’d tell on you now? I’d give you up to the law fer the brute you are, an’ let you hang as you’d oughta hang! Why don’t I? Yes, why don’t I? ’Cause I’m a fool, that’s why! I’m like all the women in the world that’s ever lived: I ain’t good, I ain’t decent, I ain’t even honest except to one man! I hate you!
#BUTCH.
Oh, you do, eh? Well, whut is it you mean, then? If I get that boy hung, how’ll that be hangin’ myself?
#ELLY.
Wuzn’t you ever young?
#BUTCH.
Whut’s that got to do with it?
#ELLY.
Wuzn’t you ever jist startin’ life? Wuzn’t you ever innocent and good, and wantin’ to go out into the world and expectin’ it to be kind to you?...
#BUTCH.
No!
#ELLY.
Then you won’t understand. This boy is that a - way. You cain’t kill a thing like that. If you killed him, you’d be killin’ w’at uz good in you once ... if they uz ever anything....
#BUTCH.
You’re preachin’. Let up! Whut’d you think this is? It’s got to be the way I say, Elly. If I wanna save my neck, I got to throw the blame on some one else....
#ELLY.
Not that boy! I’ll tell you another reason why! If you’d a - looked at him, you’d know the reason yerself! Anybody, even the Shuruff a - lookin’ at him would know that that boy couldn’t do nuthin’ wrong, he couldn’t kill a man....
#BUTCH.
Elly!
#ELLY.
He couldn’t even hurt any one’s feelin’s! And besides,—his story’s as good as yourn. They’d know w’at he said wuz the truth! You got to try some other plan, Butch. You got to try to get away. You got to sneak out in the woods an’ hide a day or two. I’ll take you grub t’ eat some way. Then when things blows over more we’ll light out fer Texas till they fergit all about us. You could hide close to the old sawmill some’er’s. They’d never think o’ lookin’ there fer you—so near—so near whur Jim—Hurry up, now! You ain’t got much time. Take yer gun. Don’t use it unless you have to—promise me! I want you to be safe.
#BUTCH.
No. Put the gun back....
#ELLY.
Butch!
#BUTCH.
You tuck it away frum me once....
#ELLY.
You’re not gonna give yerself up? Butch, no! You’ll be hung!
#BUTCH.
You said they’d never b’lieve that boy done it, eh?
#ELLY.
Yes. They won’t. They’ll know he couldn’t.
#BUTCH.
An’ they’ll b’lieve him, eh? His story’ll be better’n mine, eh?
#ELLY.
They’ll know it’s the truth.
#BUTCH.
I b’lieve you.
#ELLY.
Then why don’t you go—before the Shuruff comes?...
#BUTCH.
I ain’t goin’!
#ELLY.
You ain’t givin’ yerself up? Butch, you mustn’t! It’s wrong of me to say it. You’ve broke the laws, you’ve sold whiskey, you’ve killed a man—you’d oughta suffer fer it. But you mustn’t! You got to go—quick—they’s time! I’ll leave you grub ever’ day by the foot - log that’s been washed up by the Crick. I’ll keep a lookout. When it’s safe—
#BUTCH.
I ain’t goin’. I ain’t gonna give myself up, neither. I got a plan. An’ if you try to bungle it, if you try t’ put yer nose in, or even open yer mouth, I’ll kill you, d’ you hear! You know I will, too!
#ELLY.
W’at’re you gonna do?
#BUTCH.
Put that gun back. Put it back, I say!
#SHERIFF.
Two of ’em. Keep yer eye on the womern, Plank. Put ’em up! Search him, Joe. No gun, eh? Make shore, Joe. We doan wanna take no chances.
#OLD JOE.
They ain’t none, Shuruff.
#SHERIFF.
All right. Keep yer gun on him. Guess you know whut we want you fer, Adams. Yer name’s Adams, ain’t it?
#OLD JOE.
Butch Adams, Shuruff.
#SHERIFF.
You’ve killed a man.
#BUTCH.
I doan know whut you’re talkin’ about. Come bustin’ into my house this a - way. Whut right’ve you got?
#SHERIFF.
Dry up.
#BUTCH.
You got a warrant?
#SHERIFF.
Warrant, hell!
#BUTCH.
You got no right here. I oughta shoot you down.
#SHERIFF.
Shoot! Whut’ll you shoot with? Strikes me as funny you got no shootin’ iron on you an’ you jist murderin’ a man in cold blood—
#BUTCH.
I never! I doan know whut you’re talkin’ about—
#SHERIFF.
We won’t argy with you.
#BUTCH.
Show me yer warrant.
#SHERIFF.
They ain’t no warrant.
#BUTCH.
I’ll have the law on you.
#SHERIFF.
I’m the law! Le’s go. ’S funny about you havin’ no gun—I doan understand it—
#PLANK.
Stand whur you air. Git away from that bunk. Lemme see whut you’re a - doin’— So that’s whut you’re up to, eh?
#SHERIFF.
Whut is it, Plank?
#PLANK.
She uz reachin’ fer a gun. I thought they uz sump’n funny when we come in. She seemed t’ be a - bendin’ over like she uz huntin’ sump’n—
#SHERIFF.
So that’s it? Didn’t have time t’ git hold of it, did you? ’S lucky we kicked the door open—
#ELLY.
He didn’t do it.
#BUTCH.
I ain’t been outa the house—
#ELLY.
Don’t you take him! He ain’t done nuthin’!
#BUTCH.
I ain’t done nuthin’. If Jim Dory said my name—
#SHERIFF.
Jim Dory, eh? Who said anything about Jim Dory? I guess you’ve told on yerself!
#BUTCH.
I never!
#SHERIFF.
You’ve fixed yerself now! Look around, Joe. I’ll watch him. They oughta be evidence, too.
#OLD JOE.
Don’t see nuthin’.
#BUTCH.
You won’t find nuthin’—
#OLD JOE.
Here’s a pan! Bloody water, Shuruff!
#SHERIFF.
Le’s see it—
#OLD JOE.
He washed his hands.
#SHERIFF.
You got ’em bloody, did you—puttin’ Jim back in the buggy? Oh, he told. He had time to git out a word or two afore he died. Well, we got evidence. We got you now whur we want you—
#BUTCH.
Shuruff—I’ll tell you—
#SHERIFF.
It’s time you told me.
#BUTCH.
I’ll tell you who done it. My brother—he done it.
#ELLY.
Butch!
#BUTCH.
He’s crazy. He runs wild here in the woods. He ain’t right—
#SHERIFF.
Whut’s this?
#BUTCH.
He lives with us—my brother— You must’a’ heerd of him.
#PLANK.
I’ve heerd of a crazy boy here in the woods, Shuruff. But that don’t prove nuthin’. You hear funny stories about these woods here—
#BUTCH.
Ask Elly!
#SHERIFF.
’S this crazy boy live here with you?
#ELLY.
Yes.
#SHERIFF.
’N’ sleeps here?
#ELLY.
Yes. Sleeps thar.
#SHERIFF.
He’s yer brother, eh?
#BUTCH.
Yes. Name’s Adams—too, like mine. I’ll tell you. I cain’t pertect him. I tried. He went out las’ night. I didn’t know why. He goes out—roams in the woods—all the time. Lately, he’s got to mumblin’ sump’n—like this: “Woods is too full—woods is too full. People.” I’ve heerd him, ask Elly.
#ELLY.
Oh, he did—he said that—“People. Too many people. They’s room in the lake—they’s room thar—they’s room in the lake. It’s big. It’s deep.” Oh—
#BUTCH.
She liked him. He uz my brother. Las’ night he went out. He come in this mornin’ early. It uz him—it uz him killed Jim Dory. He told me. Met him in the woods—stuck a knife in him. He washed his hands—they uz blood on ’em. He throwed his coat under the bunk—they uz blood on it. He went out again.
#SHERIFF.
Whur is he? Whur’d he go to?
#BUTCH.
Don’t ask me—
#SHERIFF.
Tell me—quick, whur is he?
#ELLY.
In the lake—that’s whur he’s at.
#SHERIFF.
In the lake?
#ELLY.
Drownded.
#BUTCH.
No—no! No, he ain’t, Shuruff. He’s on the lake.
#ELLY.
Butch!
#BUTCH.
In a boat.
#SHERIFF.
We’ll git him. He won’t git away!
#BUTCH.
You won’t git him—not alive, you won’t. You’ll have t’ be keerful if you even go near him—he’s got a gun!
#SHERIFF.
We’ll git him!
#BUTCH.
He’s crazy. He’ll shoot.
#SHERIFF.
We’ll shoot first!
#ELLY.
Shuruff! No, no! Don’t do it. Don’t listen t’ him.
#BUTCH.
Be keerful, Shuruff—
#SHERIFF.
I ain’t skeered of him—
#BUTCH.
They’s a girl with him— girl—?
#BUTCH.
He run onto her som’er’s. Mebbe here in the woods. I doan know whur she come frum—a young, purty girl. He’s got her with him—out on the lake.
#SHERIFF.
The bastard!
#BUTCH.
Be keerful. Don’t shoot her, Shuruff.
#SHERIFF.
Whur’s they a boat?
#BUTCH.
They ain’t but one. He’s in it—him and the girl.
#SHERIFF.
We’ll get him frum the bank, then. Joe, you stay here. Watch the cabin—outside. Don’t let these two get outa yer sight. Plank, you come with me.
#ELLY.
Shuruff, you mustn’t do it—they’s a reason—you mustn’t. I’ll tell you—
#BUTCH.
He’s my brother, Shuruff. I don’t keer. He’s done wrong. Shoot him down.
#SHERIFF.
You’re damn right I will. Like a dog!
#ELLY.
W’at made you?
#BUTCH.
You told me yerself—
#ELLY.
No—
#BUTCH.
That about yer brother—that put me wise. No one knows he’s been drownded.
#ELLY.
Why’d you do it? You could’ve said he got drownded this mornin’. They’d a - b’lieved it. Why’d you say he wuz on the lake?
#BUTCH.
I got reasons.
#ELLY.
W’at air they?
#BUTCH.
You musta noticed, Elly—a girl wuz here with that boy. They’d come here together—
#ELLY.
W’at of it?
#BUTCH.
The horse and buggy’s up here a ways. She’s young, she’s purty— They drove here together. She’ll need some one to drive her home—through the woods—
#ELLY.
Ugh! You beast!
#BUTCH.
Mebbe I am one. Mebbe I am a beast. And this place we’re livin’ in—whut’s it? It’s the woods, Elly. It’s the dark woods.
#ELLY.
Butch!
#BOYS AND GIRLS.
I cain’t carry this no fu’ther. Whur’s the f’ar go? Fu’ther down, I reckon. Over thar’s a good place. She’s a - gettin’ her sewin’ done now, the crazy fool, an’ the Fair six months off! Aw, she cain’t sew a - tall. Guess she aims t’ git married. Married? Huh! Wouldn’t no one have her! Would too have me! Lem Sickles ud have me. He’d have you, all right, ’f you’d give him a chanst!
#BUD BICKEL.
Le’s play, le’s stop a minute!
#BOYS AND GIRLS.
Hey, Miss Meredith! Shet up yer yellin’! Miss Meredith’ll take yer head off. Whut if I call her Jessie? You better hadn’t! Arclo went ’n’ called her Jessie, ’n’ you orter seen her! She slapped him—!
#BOYS AND GIRLS.

#BUD BICKEL.
Le’s play “Little Brown Jug.”
#BOYS AND GIRLS.
I’m hungry! Well, who keers if you air? Be hungry! So’re we. Who’s gonna cook the meat? Who’s got the meat? Whur is the meat anyhow? It’s bacon, ain’t it? Shore, it’s bacon. “Sow belly bacon ’n’ bean soup!” Le’s play “Happy is the Miller Boy.” I’ll be it.
#BUD BICKEL.
Aw, le’s play “Ole Joe Clark.” C’m’on! Irey! Git her! Git Hildie fer a pardner. Well, you’re it, then. Irey’s it! Everbody got a pardner?
#BOYS AND GIRLS.
Wait a minute! Go ahead. You start it, Bud. “Ole Joe Clark”—
#BOYS AND GIRLS.
C’m’on, Miss Meredith, ’n’ play.
#MISS MEREDITH.
No, I won’t play.
#A BOY.
It’s fun.
#MISS MEREDITH.
It’s time to eat. Hurry and finish.
#BOYS AND GIRLS.
“Rock, rock, ole Joe Clark—”
#MISS MEREDITH.
Quit it! Quit it! That’s no way to act! Those verses are not very nice, Bud Bickel.
#BUD BICKEL.
Aw, whut’s the matter with ’em?
#MISS MEREDITH.
Never mind, you’re not to sing them. They’re bad taste.
#BUD BICKEL.
Ha! Bad taste? Verses don’t taste, Miss Meredith. They ain’t no taste to ’em, ma’am. ’N’ if they is, they all taste alike!
#MISS MEREDITH.
Not another word out of you, Bud Bickel! It’s time to be cooking the breakfast, anyway. You can play afterwards.
#BUD BICKEL.
Aw, let us play one more!
#BOYS AND GIRLS.
One more ’fore we go— He didn’t mean nuthin’. It’s still early. Betty and Lloyd ain’t here yit. Betty and Lloyd ain’t come. It’s time t’ eat, anytime. Gosh, she tole him— Please, Miss Meredith—?
#MISS MEREDITH.
Oh, very well. You may play “Drop the Handkerchief.”
#A BOY.
Aw, that ain’t a play - party game.
#MISS MEREDITH.
This is not a play - party.
#BUD BICKEL.
Le’s play “Straight Across the Hall.” That’s a game. It ain’t got no verses. C’m’on. Miss Meredith, you be my pardner. C’m’on!
#MISS MEREDITH.
I don’t play.
#BUD BICKEL.
I’ll teach you how. ’S easy’s fallin’ off a log.
#MISS MEREDITH.
No.
#BUD BICKEL.
Please, jist onct! Then we’ll go, ’n’ make a f’ar, and git breakfast!
#MISS MEREDITH.
Just once, then.
#BUD BICKEL.
Miss Meredith’s gonna play.
#BOYS AND GIRLS.
Gee! Hey, it’s a good game! You won’t mind it s’ much, ma’am. ’F anybody steps on you jist kick ’em, Miss Meredith! That’s the way a lady do.
#MISS MEREDITH.
Stop it!
#BUD BICKEL.
Whut’s the matter?
#MISS MEREDITH.
Stop it, Bud Bickel! We won’t play any more.
#BUD BICKEL.
Whut is it, whut’ve I done?
#MISS MEREDITH.
You’re swinging the Waist Swing, Bud Bickel!
#BUD BICKEL.
Well, o’ course!
#MISS MEREDITH.
It’s wrong. It’s wicked. I’m ashamed of you. I’m surprised at you.
#BUD BICKEL.
Why, ma’am, I do that all the time. I swing all the girls the Waist Swing.
#MISS MEREDITH.
The idea! Don’t you know it’s wrong?
#BUD BICKEL.
No’m.
#MISS MEREDITH.
It is. Don’t you ever do it again, you hear me? And don’t you girls ever let me catch you letting a boy swing you by the waist instead of by the arms. Come on, now! We won’t wait any longer.
#A BOY.
But Lloyd and Betty ain’t here yit—
#MISS MEREDITH.
We’ll not wait, I say! Hurry up now!
#BOYS AND GIRLS.
She’s on her high horse! Aw, it’s too early yit to eat. Sun’s jist riz— Hey, she tole it to you, Bud! Ain’t you a nice sight—a - swingin’ the girls—
#BUD BICKEL.
Shet up!
#A BOY.
You he - devil you, Bud Bickel! You waist - swingin’ son of a gun! Come on ’n’ swing some meat over the f’ar ’n’ see how you like that!
#LLOYD.
Betty— Betty, they jist went. I guess they’re ready t’ eat, now—
#BETTY.
I don’t keer—
#LLOYD.
Aw, you mustn’t be excited about nuthin’—
#BETTY.
I ain’t excited.
#LLOYD.
Yes, you air, too. I c’n tell the way you act. You see—they wuzn’t nuthin’—
#BETTY.
No—
#LLOYD.
Nuthin’ a - tall. They uz nice folks. Funny place t’ be a - livin’ in though—buried under the ground, like. Looks like it ud be damp s’ close to the lake. But they uz nice folks. Nice womern. The man uz all right. Kind of a lumberin’ kinda man—’thout no talk—but kindhearted. Didden he loan us the boat?
#BETTY.
Yes—
#LLOYD.
Didden he give us the oars? Shore he did! Well?—
#BETTY.
Le’s go on the lake now, Lloyd—
#LLOYD.
Shore! We’ll go, all right. I said we’d go. Betty, listen! They’re gettin’ breakfast ready, I guess.
#BETTY.
I don’t want none.
#LLOYD.
All right, I ain’t s’ hungry. But I’m jist wonderin’—wh’er we hadn’t oughter let ’em know we’ve come. I told Bud Bickel we uz comin’ early by ourselves. They might wonder about us—or wait fer us.
#BETTY.
They won’t wait. They’re startin’ a f’ar.
#LLOYD.
Smoke’s a - rizin’ good. It’s a - comin’ off the ground an’ rizin’ up like a cloud. We oughter be thar. Miss Meredith might worry about us.
#BETTY.
She wouldn’t worry about us. She wouldn’t worry about no one. Please, Lloyd, le’s go out on the lake—a little while, jist fer a little—
#LLOYD.
Whut is it?
#BETTY.
Nuthin’—
#LLOYD.
Tell me—
#BETTY.
Oh, them! That cabin! Them people! That man! I’m afeard of him, he’s a part of these woods here! He’s part of this. I don’t like it. It’s busy, busy a - doin’ sump’n I can’t understand! They ain’t nuthin’ clear t’ me. Why’d he look at me that a - way? Why’d he want me t’ borry a coat t’ keep warm? Why’d he stir up the f’ar—fer me? Why did he?
#LLOYD.
Why, Betty, he uz only bein’ nice t’ you. He liked you. People like you—you’re sweet, you’re purty—
#BETTY.
No. It ain’t that! It’s sump’n else. I don’t understand it. I’m afeard. I’m too young. It’s wrong t’ be young—
#LLOYD.
Betty! Why, here—
#BETTY.
His eyes a - burnin’— His teeth—like a animal’s—
#LLOYD.
Betty!
#BETTY.
He’s a part o’ these woods here! He b’longs here. I don’t. I don’t b’long here. You don’t. We’re too young. They’s sump’n goin’ on—sump’n mean—sump’n awful—It ain’t fer us t’ be part of. We got to git away—
#LLOYD.
We’ll go on the lake.
#BETTY.
Oh, yes, we’ll go on the lake! Nen whur’ll we go to?
#LLOYD.
Acrost the lake—or down to the other end. We c’n git a snack t’ eat at Binghams. We’ll do that ’n’ then row home. We won’t come back here t’ the woods if you don’t want to—
#BETTY.
We couldn’t jist stay—in the middle of the lake—awhile?
#LLOYD.
Course we could—fer a while. But you’d be hungry. You’d be cold out thar too after a while. The wind blows—
#BETTY.
All around the lake, everwhur, they’s woods. The lake goes out—’n’ it’s clear thar and bright—but it teches the woods everwhur at the edges. Oh! They ain’t no place t’ go to! The lake—it teches the woods—it’s a part of the woods!
#LLOYD.
No! No, it ain’t, Betty. You’re jist upset. It’ll be nice out thar. It’ll be clear an’ bright. Mebbe it’ll be warm. We’ll stay as long’s you want to. You mustn’t be this a - way, don’t you see, Betty? Oh, I know—you’re jist upset, you’ve saw things you don’t understand. You’ve been skeered. It’s all right now. You mustn’t think everything’s mixed up like this—like these woods. Out there—look at it—look at the lake! Sun techin’ it. Little waves startin’ in the wind, breakin’ here on the bank in ripples. Trees—willers leanin’ down like they uz prayin’ at the edges. I wish I could be a lake. I wish I could be that big, that deep! I wish I could be ketchin’ the sun like it—an’ sparklin’ an’ singin’—an’ never afeard o’ nuthin’—jist a - settin’ thar quiet in the sunshine—a - lookin’ up at the sky, a - lookin’ up at the sun—
#BETTY.
You make it nice—
#LLOYD.
No, ’tain’t me—
#BETTY.
You make it nicer’n it is—
#LLOYD.
No. It looks that a - way t’ me.
#BETTY.
It’s that a - way t’ me, too—
#LLOYD.
Betty—
#BETTY.
When you say it. You make things nicer’n they air—
#LLOYD.
No, I make ’em the way they air.
#BETTY.
An’ the lake?—
#LLOYD.
It’s a deep pool—
#BETTY.
It’s quiet.
#LLOYD.
It moves when the wind moves. It holds the sun. It’s a cup with gold in it—
#BETTY.
And dawn—
#LLOYD.
An’ sunset, and shadders, and starlight, an’ the moon burnin’ red. Come on, why’d we stay on the bank? We’ll go out—
#BETTY.
Yes.
#LLOYD.
On the lake!
#BETTY.
I hear sump’n—
#LLOYD.
’S footsteps. Somebody runnin’—
#BETTY.
They’re comin’ this way!
#LLOYD.
Through the woods—
#BETTY.

#LLOYD.
Sh!
#BETTY.

#DAVIS.

#LLOYD.
Down the lake. Thought you wuzn’t comin’. Thought you had t’ work.
#DAVIS.

#LLOYD.

#LLOYD.

You ain’t? Oh, wait’ll I tell her! Settin’ in a boat—hidin’ in a boat! I wouldn’t a - saw you if you’d a - kep’ yer head down. O gorry!

Oh, the sweet little babies—a - settin’ in the boat—jist a - settin’ an’ a - settin’ till the night do come. Oh, by Joe!
#BETTY.

#LLOYD.

#BETTY.
He makes me feel— Oh!—
#LLOYD.
Don’t mind him.
#BETTY.
I do mind him. We better go. Lloyd, whut is it? Whut’d he mean?
#LLOYD.
Oh, don’t mind him—
#BETTY.
Tell me—
#LLOYD.

#BETTY.
Oh!—
#LLOYD.
We’ll go whur the others are at. It’s all right. Don’t you mind. Miss Meredith’ll know it’s all right. She’ll know. Come on. We better go.
#MISS MEREDITH.
Oh—so you’re here?
#LLOYD.
Yes’m. pretty sight! A pretty couple, I must say!
#LLOYD.
Whut’d you mean?
#MISS MEREDITH.
The nerve—asking me what I mean! Where have you been all morning—you two?
#LLOYD.
No whur. We come here—that’s all.
#MISS MEREDITH.
Come here! What time did you leave the Switch?
#LLOYD.
I don’t know. It uz early.
#MISS MEREDITH.
What time?
#LLOYD.
I don’t know.
#MISS MEREDITH.
You don’t know? Before sun - up?
#LLOYD.
Yes, ma’am.
#MISS MEREDITH.
Before daylight, wasn’t it?
#LLOYD.
Yes.
#MISS MEREDITH.
You left in the dark?
#LLOYD.
Yes, it uz still dark.
#MISS MEREDITH.
I thought so!
#LLOYD.
Whut difference’d it make? I tole Bud Bickel to tell you—
#MISS MEREDITH.
Oh, he told me! He told me you were coming early—by yourselves—you and Betty. Why’d you do it?
#LLOYD.
Why, we wanted to.
#MISS MEREDITH.
Wanted to! That’s no reason. Why’d you want to?
#LLOYD.
Why, we wanted t’ be here ’fore it got light t’ see the lake. T’ see it git lighter ’n’ lighter till the gray mist uz all gone—an’ the sun had rose—
#MISS MEREDITH.
Oh, you did? So you had to get up early in the morning—before daylight—and drive here through the dark woods—by yourselves—alone—you two? You had to sneak off where there was no one to spy on you, and no light to make you ashamed of yourselves, didn’t you? Oh, don’t interrupt me! I know why you did it! I’m surprised at you, Betty. I wouldn’t have thought it of you! I shall report you both to the School Board. I’m ashamed! I’m ashamed for you! I can hardly look any one in the face. I don’t know how you can. Oh, it’s this that makes teaching so hard! After all my labor, and all my rules to keep you from going wrong like this—you sneak off to the woods—the first chance you get—like a couple of animals. I’m ashamed of you! Come on, now! The fire’s started. Come on and eat your breakfast!
#BETTY.
Oh! Her, too!
#LLOYD.
Her—an’ everbody! Damn her! Damn everbody! O Christ!
#BETTY.
It’s all mean—it’s all wicked, wicked! Whut’ll we do now?
#LLOYD.
Nuthin’—
#BETTY.
We got to do sump’n!
#LLOYD.
We’ll go on the lake, then.
#BETTY.
They’s no place else t’ go—
#LLOYD.
It’s the only place t’ go. We’d oughta went thar before. Come on, Betty, git in. We c’n go acrost ’n’ git grub—we c’n go home—
#BETTY.
Home! I don’t want t’ see home again! I hate it! I hate these woods! They’s no place fer us—nowhur—
#LLOYD.
They’s room on the lake—
#BETTY.
Oh, yes! They’s room thar! They’s room on the Lake!
#LLOYD.
It’s big! It’s deep!
#PLANK.
Thar he is, Shuruff!
#SHERIFF.
Come in, you! Put that boat in to shore!
#LLOYD.
I won’t— I won’t—
#SHERIFF.
I’m givin’ you one more chance!
#LLOYD.
I won’t never do it! You cain’t make me, you cain’t—
#SHERIFF.
I’ll give you till I count three!
#LLOYD.
Count ten! Count a hunderd! I won’t come!
#SHERIFF.
One! Two! Three! Comin’? Never!
#SHERIFF.
Take that, then!
#PLANK.
You got him, Shuruff! He’s sunk down in the boat like he’s dead! Hey! Look at it! Look! The girl! She’s standin’ up in the boat! Good God, she’s jumpin’ in the lake! She’ll drownd!
#ELLY.
Shuruff! Shuruff! You’ve killed him! You’ve killed him! Oh, the girl—she’s drownin’! Quick, save her—you got to—go an’ save her, she’s drownin’!
#BUTCH.
Christ!
#ELLY.
Oh, w’at’ve you done, w’at’ve you done! You don’t know! You think you’ve upheld the law, you think you’ve done yer duty! Well, you ain’t! You’ve killed an innocent boy that wouldn’t hurt a fly—that’s w’at you’ve done! Oh, hurry! hurry! She’s goin’ down! Hurry an’ git her!
#SHERIFF.
Go help him, Plank. Go help him. Joe, go drag in the boat. Hurry up!
#ELLY.
Mebbe she ain’t drownded. Mebbe she ain’t—the pore thing— Why’d you stand thar? Why don’t you do sump’n? Look at him. He’s the law. He’s done his duty. He’s got his man. He’ll git a reward.
#SHERIFF.
Shet up!
#ELLY.
You cain’t shet me up. I’m a fool not to a - told you before. I’m a fool too—like yerself—like Butch—like the whole damn world! I been a fool. But I won’t be now. I’ll tell you now—now it’s too late—I’ll tell you sump’n ’at’ll make yer ears burn, ’at’ll make you sick inside like sump’n eatin’ on yer heart! Listen t’ me—you! You’re bright, you’re smart, you’re a keen - smellin’ dog of the law, you’re the law! You pertect the weak, you hang the criminals. You shoot down, you murder innocent people—that’s w’at you do! It uz Butch, it uz Butch killed Jim Dory....
#SHERIFF.
Whut’s this!
#ELLY.
Butch, I tell you! This boy ain’t his brother. He never saw him before. He’s jist a boy, jist a young boy—picknickin’—in the woods—
#SHERIFF.
Good God! Is this the truth you’re tellin’ me?
#ELLY.
It’s the truth—
#SHERIFF.
Godamighty!
#BUTCH.
Drownded—
#PLANK.
You got him, Shuruff—
#OLD JOE.
He’s dead.
#ELLY.
Ask him!
#SHERIFF.
Oh—
#ELLY.
Ask him, Shuruff! Ask him who killed Jim Dory! ’N’ if he lies!—
#SHERIFF.
She says you done it.
#BUTCH.
She told on me?
#SHERIFF.
She says you done it.
#SHERIFF.
Speaks slowly.) I killed him.
#SHERIFF.
Christamighty! You killed Jim Dory? You killed this boy too, then! You done it! ’Twuzn’t me!
#BUTCH.
I killed her, too. She drownded herself. I tried t’ save her.
#SHERIFF.
How could you do it! Two men—an’ this pore innocent little girl! God! Why’d you do it? Whut made you?
#BUTCH.
I don’t know. You’re the law. You tell me! Tell me why I done it!
#MISS MEREDITH.
What’s the matter? I heard shots! Oh! What is it? Lloyd and Betty! Good heavens!
#SHERIFF.
Dead, Miss.
#MISS MEREDITH.
Oh, my poor little children! My poor little ones! Oh, you tried to save them! God will reward you! Poor little Betty— Lloyd was good to her. Oh, why’d they go on the lake! Why’d they do it? I told them not to.
#ELLY.
It’s alwys the way. People will go on the lake. Young people. Cain’t keep ’em off. ’N’ they’s alwys accidents. Sometimes it’s the lake, sometimes it’s the woods—boats leak, guns go off, people air keerless, they’s wild animals—sump’n happens, sump’n alwys happens. It cain’t be helped.—
