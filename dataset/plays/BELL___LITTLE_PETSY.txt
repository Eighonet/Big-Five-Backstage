#MRS. ROGERS.
I wish Mrs. Simonds would appear! It is so rude to keep people waiting in this way when they come to see you. Well, I wonder how much longer she's going to be. I would not have come if I had not wanted to explain to her about that bazaar we are getting up. Ah, how do you do, darling? How are you? Will you shake hands? You don't know my name, do you?
#POWERS.
I do, then.
#MRS. ROGERS.
You do? Who am I?
#POWERS.
You're Mrs. Roberts. I know it, because the maid came and told Mamma so, and then Mamma said, "Mrs. Roberts, bother!" and she told me to come and say she would be here in a minute.
#MRS. ROGERS.
Delightful child, this. Then as you know my name, won't you shake hands?
#POWERS.
Shan't.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Ah, my dear Mrs. Roberts, I am so glad to see you.
#MRS. ROGERS.
So I understand!
#MRS. SELWYN.
I am so sorry to have kept you waiting. I was just taking off my things.
#MRS. ROGERS.
Oh, not at all. I've not been here very long.
#MRS. SELWYN.
I sent down my little Petsy to amuse you.
#MRS. ROGERS.
Oh, thank you, yes, she came.
#MRS. SELWYN.
It is impossible to feel dull where she is. Such an original child, so full of life!
#MRS. ROGERS.
Oh, indeed! I came to see you, Mrs. Simonds, about the charity bazaar at Wandsworth.
#MRS. SELWYN.
The bazaar, yes.
#POWERS.
Ma! Ma! How long is she going to stay?
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, dear, dear, Petsy, Mrs. Roberts will be quite shocked at you! She will really, won't you, Mrs. Roberts?
#MRS. ROGERS.
Oh, dear no! Sweet child!
#MRS. ROGERS.
It seems - there has been some difficulty - about the hall.
#MRS. SELWYN.
About the hall - yes. She is such a merry child, it makes one quite happy to see her!
#MRS. ROGERS.
I am glad it has that effect upon some one!
#MRS. SELWYN.
You were saying about the hall -
#POWERS.
Ma! Mamma!
#MRS. SELWYN.
Yes, darling, yes. About the hall -
#POWERS.
Ma! Ma! Ma!
#MRS. SELWYN.
I don't know why there should be any difficulty -
#POWERS.
Ma! Ma!
#MRS. SELWYN.
What is it, my dear one? What do you want?
#POWERS.
May I play with the silver inkstand?
#MRS. SELWYN.
If you'll take great care of it, yes. Did you ever hear such ideas as the child has? Such an active mind, never quiet!
#MRS. ROGERS.
Well, perhaps now she's got the inkstand she'll be quiet.
#MRS. SELWYN.
You have no idea what quaint things she says sometimes. You must get me to tell you some of them next time we meet.
#MRS. ROGERS.
Oh, thank you! Then you think we shall be able to get the hall?
#POWERS.
Why do you wear this ugly cloak?
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, really, Petsy! I don't know what Mrs. Roberts will think! Such a pretty cloak, too.
#POWERS.
No, it isn't. It's hideous, and so is her bonnet. It's like Miss Jane's cloak in the poem.
#MRS. ROGERS.
In the poem?
#MRS. SELWYN.
Yes, that's a little poem she has learnt. You can't think what a memory she has for that kind of thing. I should like you to hear her recite it. You can't think how prettily she does it.
#MRS. ROGERS.
Does she, indeed.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Petsy, will you say your poetry to Mrs. Roberts?
#POWERS.
No, I shan't.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, now do! Mrs. Roberts would like it so much, wouldn't you?
#MRS. ROGERS.
Oh, of all things.
#MRS. SELWYN.
She stands on a chair and says it. You can't think how pretty it looks. Come now, Petsy, won't you?
#MRS. ROGERS.
Well, never mind - don't worry her about it now.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, but I should so like you to hear her. Come, Petsy, you needn't stand on a chair - stand there with your hands behind you. Now begin: "Pretty Miss Jane - "
#POWERS.
I won't, then! There!
#MRS. SELWYN.
She's so unexpected, isn't she? If you won't say the poem to Mrs. Roberts, you will play the violin to her, won't you?
#MRS. ROGERS.
The violin!
#MRS. SELWYN.
Yes, she does show such talent! You'll be quite surprised.
#MRS. ROGERS.
Yes, I shall be quite surprised if she does.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Of course, it's a little squeaky at times - but, after all, she's such a child, it's a wonder she plays at all.
#MRS. ROGERS.
It is indeed. Especially to visitors who don't want to hear her. I am sorry I can't stay to - day, I just came to see about that hall.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Ah, to be sure, the hall, yes - we've settled nothing. Do stay and have tea with us.
#MRS. ROGERS.
Tea.... I am afraid it is rather late.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, do stay, we shall be so snug, just we three - for Petsy always comes in. There she sits in her high chair, and keeps me alive with her prattle.
#MRS. ROGERS.
Ah, that quite decides me. I am afraid I can hardly do that to - day. I have an appointment at five.
#POWERS.
Ma! May I have butter as well as jam on my toast?
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, oh! my dear child! Really!
#MRS. ROGERS.
So it appears. I am afraid I can't stay longer to - day. Good - bye.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Good - bye. I'm so sorry you can't stay to tea.
#POWERS.
I'm so glad!
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh! Oh! really, dear Petsy. She likes being alone with her mother, that is the fact.
#MRS. ROGERS.
No doubt. Then you will let me know about the bazaar, won't you?
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, of course, I will, and then you must come here that we may have a good talk and settle everything - and we will persuade Petsy to sing her song, and dance her dance! she dances like a fairy, I assure you.
#MRS. ROGERS.
I have no doubt of it. Good - bye.
#MRS. SELWYN.
Good - bye.
#POWERS.
Good - bye, old Mother Roberts, good - bye!
#MRS. SELWYN.
Oh, Petsy, little Petsy!
