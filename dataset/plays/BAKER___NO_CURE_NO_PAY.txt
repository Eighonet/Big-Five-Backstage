#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Tak’ a sate, Miss Lucy, if ye plaze, while I spake to the young misthress. It’s glad she’ll be to see yer, for it’s a hape of throuble we have here ony how.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Trouble, Bridget! Why, what’s the matter?
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Shure, mam, it’s all along of the misthress; she’s too sick intirely, and is failin’, and failin’, and failin.’
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Mrs. Languish sick? I am sorry to hear that.
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Oh! indade, and indade she is. Ivery breath she draws is nearer and nearer her last.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
What seems to be the matter?
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
An’ shure, ma’m, I dont know, except that she’s failin’, and failin’, and failin’; an’ its sorry the day whin she fell ill; she’s the kindest and bist misthress in the world. Oh, musha, musha! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Well, well, Bridget, be calm, and hope for the best.
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Faith, and that’s what I’m doin’. Oh, here comes Miss Alice, the poor disconsilite orphan.
#ALICE CHASE.
Why, Lucy Aiken! You dear, good - for - nothing thing! Where have you been all this while?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
It is an age since we met. I must congratulate you, and I assure you I do, with all my heart, on your altered position. So, the rich and crusty old uncle, who forgot his relations while living, has remembered you in his will?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, Lucy; thanks to uncle Caleb, we are rich. And, I assure you, we were glad to be remembered.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
But, dear me, Alice, what a careless creature I am! How is your mother? Bridget tells me she is very sick.
#ALICE CHASE.
Poor mother! this sudden turn in the wheel of fortune has been too much for her; she is a confirmed invalid. I don’t know what to make of her. Dr. Tincture can find no symptoms of disease. He says she is in sound bodily health; her suddenly dropping her usual employments has occasioned her seeming illness.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Seeming! Why, Alice, you treat lightly what your Bridget seems to consider a very serious illness.
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, I do; for I am convinced nothing ails mother. Her head is turned with the idea that she is an invalid, because she thinks it fashionable for rich ladies to be ailing, and she has the queerest notions. I suppose you will laugh, but I am going to tell you her last freak. She is highly incensed at Dr. Tincture, refuses to see him, and declares her illness can only be cured by some mysterious agency. Yesterday she bade me prepare this note to be inserted in the evening papers. “NO CURE, NO PAY. - A lady who is suffering from a disease which baffles the skill of the medical profession, and who is desirous of testifying her appreciation of the efforts now being made to institute a school of female practitioners, offers the sum of five hundred dollars to any female who will cure her. Address, with real name, ‘BEDRIDDEN,’ Station A, Boston Post Office; and remember, No cure, no pay.” Did you ever hear of such a nonsensical whim?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
What an odd idea! And do you propose to send it?
#ALICE CHASE.
No, indeed; that is, if I can possibly prevent it. But she believes it has already gone. Dear me! I wish I could find a way to frighten her into health again.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
That’s just what you must do. If you will be guided by me, her cure can be effected. You remember our “Private Theatricals” last winter, and what fun we had. Let us turn our practice then to profit now. There’s Jenny Carter and Susie Dean all ready for any harmless sport, I know. You leave this to me, and I’ll send your mother a few samples of the new school she so much admires.
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, capital! capital! But are you quite sure you can carry out this scheme?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Sure. Remember what Richelieu says about “the bright lexicon of youth,” and leave all to me. Good - by; I must run and see the girls. Set your heart at rest; we’ll have your mother well before she knows it herself. Good - by.
#ALICE CHASE.
Good - by. I have great faith in Lucy. And I do hope this scheme of hers will be a success. Perhaps it is wrong to deceive poor mother; but that advertisement once inserted in the papers, we should have no peace day or night. Here she comes. Poor mother; she works very hard to keep up her sickness. I can hardly refrain from laughing to see her bright, rosy face, and the utter lassitude of her body.
#AUNT M.
Keerful, Angelina; keerful, my child. Remember you’re a drefful sick woman; drefful sick.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I know - I am. I know - I am weaker - and weaker - every - day. My camphor - bottle - aunt Midget - fan me - my child.
#ALICE CHASE.
Don’t you feel any better, mother?
#MRS. LEMMY.
No, child; your - poor - mother - is failing rapidly; a few short days - and then -
#AUNT M.
Massy sakes, child! who left that door open? Do you want your marm to catch her death?
#ALICE CHASE.
Have you had your breakfast, mother?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Yes, child - all I wanted - but I have no appetite.
#AUNT M.
Well, Angelina, how do you feel now?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Very feeble.
#AUNT M.
What does she say?
#ALICE CHASE.
Very feeble.
#AUNT M.
Hay?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Dear - dear! Aunt Midget, don’t speak so loud.
#AUNT M.
Loud? Why, Angelina! you know how feeble my voice is. I couldn’t speak loud.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Alice, do you - hear any thing from the advertisement?
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, yes, mother; I hear from it. Several people are anxious to see you.
#MRS. LEMMY.
I knew it - I knew it. My cure can only come from such a source. Look in the paper - child - there may be some new discovery advertised.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, there are a number. “Dr. Kresote’s Extract of Lignumvitæ for the cure of Lumbago” -
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, dear! I must try that. I know I’ve got the lunbago.
#AUNT M.
Who’s that? Tom Bago! Is that a new doctor?
#ALICE CHASE.
“Elias’s Great Cure - all” -
#AUNT M.
Who’s that’s got a new carry - all?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Aunt Midget - please, don’t.
#AUNT M.
Law, Angelina, what’s the use of living, if you don’t know what’s goin’ on?
#ALICE CHASE.
“The most Wonderful Discovery of the Age! A Speedy Cure for all Diseases of the Spine” -
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, dear! I know my spine is diseased -
#ALICE CHASE.
“Heart Disease” - know I’ve got that! I’ve got such a pain here and here - and here.
#ALICE CHASE.
“General Debility” -
#AUNT M.
General who? What new military man is that?
#ALICE CHASE.
“Consumption” -
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, dear! that’s my case! I feel it! I’m sure I’m a victim to that -
#AUNT M.
Yes, Angelina, I told you this morning at the breakfast - table, when you ate four hard - boiled eggs, six pertaters, a big piece of steak, and so many flap - jacks! sartin’ sure it was a forerunner of consumption.
#ALICE CHASE.
“And all diseases which flesh is heir to” -
#AUNT M.
Diseases of the hair! Do tell! have they got something new for that? I’m glad on it, for my hair is all a comin’ out.
#MRS. LEMMY.
We must try that. Dear me, child! you must have that bell muffled; and I think we had better have the street strewn with tan, it’s so soothing.
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Doctor, is it? Away wid yer. We want no doctors in petticoats here at all at all.
#ALICE CHASE.
Bridget, show the lady up here.
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Will I? Oh, come in, Mrs. Doctor, come in.
#ALICE CHASE.
This must be one of the ladies whom I expected.
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Here’s the she - doctor, mam.
#JENNY.
Ahem - ahem! Who’s sick? Who wants the doctor? I am Dr. Higgins, M.D., just graduated from the Female College. Would you like to see my diploma?
#ALICE CHASE.
It’s not necessary.
#JENNY.
Where is the patient? Stop! don’t speak! The eye of science is quick to distinguish suffering. I see her! - that form tottering on the verge of the grave.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, dear! what did I tell you!
#JENNY.
My poor woman, how are you?
#AUNT M.
Why, how do you do? My eyesight’s kinder failin’. It’s Jerusha Hoppin - ain’t it? What a handsome bunnet you’ve got!
#JENNY.
My dear woman, time is precious. Let me see your tongue.
#AUNT M.
Well, I flatter myself I do look young for one who’s seen so much triberlation.
#ALICE CHASE.
Miss - Mrs. Doctor, you’ve made a mistake. This is the patient.
#JENNY.
Dear me, dear me! what a blunder! What’s the trouble?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, dear! - doctor - I don’t know. I’m failing rapidly.
#JENNY.
Let me see your tongue Ahem! Bad, bad!
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, dear, doctor, do tell me the worst!
#JENNY.
Have you a cough?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Dreadful!
#AUNT M.
Why, that must be a female woman doctor.
#JENNY.
Sleep well nights?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Not a wink.
#JENNY.
Not a wink? Bad, bad! Any appetite?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Not a bit.
#JENNY.
Not a bit? Bad, bad! Madam, yours is a very bad case.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, do, doctor, tell me the worst!
#JENNY.
Madam, you are suffering from a terrible disease, - a disease of which the profession know but little. Hum - buga; a disease caused by a depression of the eliminating vesticubia of the scareophagus. Had you fallen into the hands of the masculine butchers of the medical profession, your fate would have been terrible; but we of the new school are destined to lay bare new fountains of health. I propose to treat your case by an entirely new method; one that is destined to make a great revolution in medicine. The Lionian Method, - I will briefly explain. You, madam, are suffering from prostration, - a superabundance of weakness. In your case, madam, it is necessary to throw off this superabundance of weakness; but how to supply the vacuum? What is needed? You see at once: strength. But where shall we find strength? - in the mineral world? No. In the vegetable world? No. Where shall we turn? To the animal world, and there we find strength; and where greater strength than in the lion, the king of beasts? There is our remedy. Madam, I prescribe for you a lion diet. Lion steaks for breakfast, roast lion for dinner, cold lion for supper; and lion broth, lion soup, and lion fricassees promiscuously. Obey me, and you are saved; hesitate, and you are lost.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Dear me! but where shall I get the lions?
#JENNY.
That’s none of my business. I prescribe the mode; you must find the means. You are rich; send and catch them. I would recommend your keeping a few live lions in your back garden, that you may have them fresh at all times.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Lions in our back garden? Mercy! we should be eaten alive!
#AUNT M.
Lions? What! turn our back garden into a howling wilderness?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Dear me, dear me! I can never find the means of cure.
#JENNY.
Then I cannot help you. So, if you will just hand me a check for five hundred dollars, I’ll go.
#MRS. LEMMY.
A check for what? check for five hundred dollars.
#MRS. LEMMY.
But you haven’t cured me. You forget, “No cure, no pay.”
#JENNY.
Ah, but I’ve prescribed a method that will be sure to cure. If you don’t choose to try it, that’s not my fault.
#MRS. LEMMY.
You just start yourself out of this house. Quick, or I’ll find a way to send you. Quick, I say.
#JENNY.
Very well, madam; very well. Remember the law. You’ll find you must pay. Good - morning.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Who ever heard of such impudence?
#AUNT M.
Why, Angelina, what are you doing? You’ll kill yourself standing so long.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear! My camphor, - quick! Fan me, child, fan me!
#ALICE CHASE.
Well, mother, your first attempt with the new school is a failure. You’d better give it up, and send for Dr. Tincture.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Child, don’t mention that horrid name again. Who can that be? Another one of those humbugs.
#ALICE CHASE.
We will not have any more come in here, if you say so.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Yes, let them come. Every means must be tried. BRIDGET, L.
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
If you plase, mam, there’s another old woman. Says she’s a doctor.
#ALICE CHASE.
Show her in, Bridget.
#AUNT M.
Seems to me, Angelina, you’re having lots of callers to - day.
#SUSAN.
How do you do, folks? Somebody sick here? I’m Dr. Hannah Stebbins, a regular graduated physician.
#ALICE CHASE.
So we understand.
#SUSAN.
Yes, my medical edication begun with docterin’ with roots and yarbs. But, dear me! which is the sick woman?
#ALICE CHASE.
My mother.
#SUSAN.
Oh, yes! the old lady in the specs. Well, she does look kinder feeble. Heow do you do, mam? Kinder croning, hay?
#AUNT M.
Hay?
#SUSAN.
They tell me you’re kinder complainin’.
#AUNT M.
Rainin’, is it? Why, do tell! What lots of rain we do have!
#ALICE CHASE.
You’ve made a mistake. This is my mother.
#SUSAN.
Why, yeou don’t say so. There’s nothing the matter with her - is there? What’s the matter? Got the rheumatics?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, dear! I don’t know what’s the matter.
#SUSAN.
Kinder stericky - ain’t yer? Let’s see your tongue. It’s awful red! Let me feel your pulse. Dear me! Why, what can be the matter?
#MRS. LEMMY.
I am very weak.
#SUSAN.
Got a crick in your back?
#MRS. LEMMY.
I don’t know, but I think I have.
#SUSAN.
Headache?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, terrible!
#SUSAN.
Purty bad way, yeou are. Let me see. There’s catnip, - that ain’t powerful enough; then there’s penny - rial and wormwood, thoroughwort and hy - sup; them won’t do yeou any good; we must try the new grassalogical treatment.
#MRS. LEMMY.
The grassalogical treatment! What is that?
#AUNT M.
Hay? new discovery of our larned sister, Dr. Sally Wiggins. The Scripters tell us, “All flesh is grass.” Therefore, when the flesh is weak, what more nat’ral than that we should fly to its great counterpart in nature, the grass?
#AUNT M.
Talking about counterpanes, - I’d like to show her my new patch - work quilt.
#SUSAN.
On this theory Dr. Sally has founded her new treatment; and I think it will be the best thing yeou can try. Take for breakfast every day grass tea; grass greens biled for dinner, with a leetle pork or bacon; grass tea for supper - nothing else, and sleep on the grass nights. If natur’ won’t work a cure in your case, then I’m much mistaken.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Sleep on the grass? Why, you’re crazy!
#AUNT M.
Why, I do believe that woman wants to turn our Angelina out to paster, jest like a cow.
#MRS. LEMMY.
I confess I do not see the logic of your new treatment.
#SUSAN.
Yeou don’t? Well, it does look kinder strange, but it’s the new school; and if woman is ever to find her speare, her speare must be in some new school.
#MRS. LEMMY.
I shall decline following any such nonsensical prescription.
#SUSAN.
Very well, mam. If you won’t, you wont; and that’s all there is about it. So, when you’re ready to settle, I’m ready to start.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Ready to settle! What do you mean?
#SUSAN.
Five hundred dollars. That was your offer.
#MRS. LEMMY.
No cure, no pay. What have you done?
#SUSAN.
Given you an original mode of treatment. If you do not choose to follow it, that’s not my fault.
#MRS. LEMMY.
You just take your roots and herbs and your new treatment, and start out of this house, or you’ll get worse treatment.
#SUSAN.
Well, well, if this isn’t an ungrateful world! You’re a pretty sick woman, you are.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Alice, call Bridget.
#SUSAN.
Yeou needn’t call any of your hired folks; I’m going; but if there is any law in the land, you shall hear from me. You’re a pretty sick woman, you are.
#AUNT M.
Why, Angelina, there you are standin’ ag’in! You’ll ruin your constitution jest as sure as can be.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, dear, what a trial!
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Did you ax for me, mam?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Bridget, don’t you let any more of these people into the house; they’ll be the death of me. Do you hear?
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Faith, I do, mam; and sorry a one will I let in at all at all.
#AUNT M.
Trial and triberlation, child! that’s the lot of us weak mortals. Enter ALICE, L., disguised as an old lady; shawl, large bonnet, spectacles, &c. Massy sakes! who’s that?
#ALICE CHASE.
Somebody’s sick here - hain’t there?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Where did you come from?
#ALICE CHASE.
Hay?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Where did you come from?
#ALICE CHASE.
I’m a leetle hard of hearing. You’ll have to speak louder.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Dear me! who sent you here?
#ALICE CHASE.
Thank you; I don’t care if I do take a cheer.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Dear, dear! where can Alice be! Who sent you here?
#ALICE CHASE.
Oh, yes, I hear now, when yer speak loud.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Aunt Midget -
#AUNT M.
Well, child.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Do try and talk to this woman; she’s deaf as a post, I’m sure.
#AUNT M.
Poor, is she? Wants cold victuals, I s’pose.
#MRS. LEMMY.
No, no; she’s a doctor.
#AUNT M.
What’s the matter?
#ALICE CHASE.
Hay?
#AUNT M.
What’s - the - matter?
#ALICE CHASE.
I’m deaf.
#AUNT M.
Dear me! she want’s some beef. Well, if poor folks ain’t gitting proud! I guess you’ll have to content yourself with good cold bread.
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes; it is caused by colds in the head.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Dear me! set the blind to lead the blind. Aunt Midget, this old lady is very deaf.
#AUNT M.
You don’t say so. What do you want?
#ALICE CHASE.
To treat the lady.
#AUNT M.
Hay?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Gracious! what a confusion! My good woman, aunt Midget, this lady, is also very deaf.
#ALICE CHASE.
I want to know. I want to treat this lady.
#AUNT M.
Want to treat her? What with?
#ALICE CHASE.
I’m a doctor.
#AUNT M.
Doctor, hey! Medical or dedical?
#ALICE CHASE.
I’m a female physician.
#AUNT M.
Musician too! What do you play on?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Stop, stop, stop! Do you want to craze me, you two? Bridget, Bridget! My good woman, I do not require your services. BRIDGET, L. Here, show this woman out of the house, quick!
#ALICE CHASE.
I’m a regular -
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Oh, no more of yer blarney! Start yourself quick!
#ALICE CHASE.
But, my dear lady, you advertised -
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Ah, away wid yer! Away wid yer!
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, dear! was ever a poor sick woman so abused! My camphor, aunt Midget; my camphor! Where can Alice be? ALICE, L.
#ALICE CHASE.
Here I am, mother; I was called down stairs to see a lady, a healing medium. She is very desirous of seeing you.
#MRS. LEMMY.
I will not see her. Those we have had have nearly killed me.
#ALICE CHASE.
But, mother, this is an entirely different sort of person. You must see her, for she is coming up stairs now.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, dear, dear! Am I never to have any peace? , an old - fashioned “front” of hair with side curls, a straw hat and parasol.)
#LUCY PILLENGER.
My dear child, which is your afflicted parent!
#ALICE CHASE.
This is her.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
She does, indeed, seem afflicted! That care - worn face, those weak and feeble limbs, are sure signs of the presence of disease.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Here is one who understands me at last.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
The power has been given me to heal the sick.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Mercy! what’s the matter?
#AUNT M.
That girl’s going into a fit.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
It’s nothing; be as quiet as you can.
#AUNT M.
Gracious goodness! I tell you, Angelina, that gal’s in a fit! See her glare at me! I tell you she’s crazy. Angelina, if you don’t have that woman taken away, I’ll holler right eout!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Sh - ! I behold a vision! I see a woman before a wash - tub - a stout, rosy, healthy woman. She looks like you; and she rubs and sings, rubs and sings.
#MRS. LEMMY.
That’s me - that’s just like me!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I see her again! She’s ironing now; and she irons and sings, irons and sings.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Just like me - just like me!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
And now she sweeps , and now scrubs , singing all the while. Hark! what is it she sings?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Yes, yes! That’s it! But now it changes. I see her again: she appears feeble and weak, and complains. Oh, how she complains! - “Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I’m so weak - I’m so weak! My camphor, aunt Midget! Fan me, my child!”
#MRS. LEMMY.
Oh, dear! that’s me.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
What is this that now urges me to seize this woman and shake her?
#AUNT M.
Angelina, that gal’s going to fight somebody. Don’t yer come a - near me.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
All this woman needs is exercise, and I must give her exercise.
#AUNT M.
Massy sakes! this is a raving lunatic.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Come, come, young woman, this is quite enough.
#ALICE CHASE.
You musn’t touch my mother.
#AUNT M.
That gal’s a Shaker; I know she is.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
To shake this woman - to shake this woman!
#MRS. LEMMY.
This woman declines being shaken. I’ll do all the shaking myself. What do you mean by such conduct? Who are you? Lucy Aiken! Why, what does this mean?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
That I have turned physician, owing to the extraordinary inducements held out in an advertisement entitled “No Cure, no Pay.”
#MRS. LEMMY.
What?
#ALICE CHASE.
Yes, mother, I thought it a pity to waste money in advertising when we had three such good female physicians in the neighborhood. DEAN, L., DISGUISED AS BEFORE. Here are the other two.
#MRS. LEMMY.
And pray, who are they? disciple of the lionian school!
#MRS. LEMMY.
Jenny Carter!
#SUSAN.
And a student of the grassalogical treatment.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Susan Dean! Well, I am amazed.
#AUNT M.
If that gal’s got through her tantrums, I’d like to get down!
#MRS. LEMMY.
But there was another - a deaf old lady.
#ALICE CHASE.
Hay?
#MRS. LEMMY.
Why, Alice! have you been concerned in this too? Do you know it was very wrong to deceive your mother in this way?
#ALICE CHASE.
Perhaps it was, mother; but I think you are better for the very singular treatment you have met with.
#AUNT M.
Law, child, what are you thinking of? You have been standing nearly five minutes.
#MRS. LEMMY.
And I propose to stand five minutes more, for the purpose of thanking these young ladies for the very excellent manner in which they have treated my complaint. Ah, Lucy, that little touch of the old life you gave me has awakened my slumbering energies. I think I shall be able to go about and do a portion of that duty which is given the rich to perform - succor the needy and relieve the distressed. In such employment I need fear no return of my complaint. But how can I reward you?
#ALICE CHASE.
Remember your promise; five hundred dollars -
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Which we gladly renounce, looking for reward in the approval of our friends here.
#MRS. LEMMY.
But will they grant it? If, like me, in your practice they have found a cure for idle complainings, they certainly will; if not, you must all remember the conditions - NO CURE, NO PAY.
