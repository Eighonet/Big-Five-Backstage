#MAID.
Yes, Sir?
#YOUNG MAN.
Oh, yes, Marie, oh, yes; I rang, yes … I only wanted … yes, of course… Oh, yes, of course, let the blinds down, Marie… It’s cooler with the blinds down … yes…
#YOUNG MAN.
What are you doing, Marie? Oh, yes. But, now, I can’t see to read.
#MAID.
You are always so studious, Sir.
#YOUNG MAN.
There, that’s better.
#YOUNG MAN.
I say, Marie … let’s see, what was it I wanted to say? … oh, yes… Is there any cognac in the house?
#MAID.
Yes, but it’s locked up.
#YOUNG MAN.
Well, who has the key?
#MAID.
Lini.
#YOUNG MAN.
Who is Lini?
#MAID.
The cook, Mr. Alfred.
#YOUNG MAN.
Well, then ask Lini for it.
#MAID.
Yes, but it’s Lini’s day out.
#YOUNG MAN.
So…
#MAID.
Can I get anything for you from the café, Sir?
#YOUNG MAN.
Thank you, no… It is hot enough as it is. I don’t need any cognac. Listen, Marie, bring me a glass of water. Wait, Marie,—let it run, till it gets quite cold. Exit MAID. The YOUNG MAN gazes after her. At the door the MAID looks back at him, and the YOUNG MAN glances into the air. The MAID turns on the water and lets it run. Meanwhile, she goes into her room, washes her hands, and arranges her curls before the mirror. Then she brings the glass of water to the YOUNG MAN. She approaches the couch. The raises himself upon his elbow. The MAID gives him the glass of water and their fingers touch.
#YOUNG MAN.
Thank you—Well, what is the matter?—Be careful. Put the glass back on the tray. How late is it?
#MAID.
Five o’clock, Sir.
#YOUNG MAN.
Ah, five o’clock.—That’s fine.—
#YOUNG MAN.
Listen, Marie, there was something I wanted to ask you. Didn’t Dr. Schueller call this morning?
#MAID.
No, Sir, nobody called this morning.
#YOUNG MAN.
That is strange. Then, Dr. Schueller didn’t call. Do you know Dr. Schueller by sight?
#MAID.
Of course, I do. He’s the big gentleman with the black beard.
#YOUNG MAN.
Yes. Then, perhaps, he called after all?
#MAID.
No, Sir. Nobody called.
#YOUNG MAN.
Come here, Marie.
#MAID.
Yes, Sir.
#YOUNG MAN.
Still nearer … so … ah … I only thought…
#MAID.
Do you want anything, Sir?
#YOUNG MAN.
I thought… Well, I thought—only about your blouse … what kind of a blouse is it … can’t you come closer. I won’t bite you.
#MAID.
What is the matter with my blouse? Don’t you like it, Sir?
#YOUNG MAN.
Blue? It is a nice blue. You are very prettily dressed, Marie.
#MAID.
But, Sir…
#YOUNG MAN.
Ah… What is the matter?… You have a beautiful white skin, Marie.
#MAID.
You are flattering me, Sir.
#YOUNG MAN.
That can’t hurt you.
#MAID.
Oh, no.
#YOUNG MAN.
But you sigh so. Why are you sighing?
#MAID.
Oh, Mr. Alfred…
#YOUNG MAN.
And what charming little slippers you have…
#MAID.
… But … Sir … if the doorbell should ring.—
#YOUNG MAN.
Who will ring now?
#MAID.
But, Sir … look … it is so light…
#YOUNG MAN.
You needn’t feel at all shy with me. You needn’t feel shy with anybody … any one as pretty as you. Yes, really, you are, Marie… Do you know your hair actually smells sweet.
#MAID.
Mr. Alfred…
#YOUNG MAN.
Don’t make such a fuss, Marie… Anyway, I’ve already seen you otherwise. When I came home the other night and went to get some water, the door to your room was open … well…
#MAID.
Oh, my, I didn’t know that Mr. Alfred could be so wicked.
#YOUNG MAN.
I saw lots then … that … and that … that … and—
#MAID.
Oh, Mr. Alfred!
#YOUNG MAN.
Come, come … here … so—that’s it…
#MAID.
But if the doorbell should ring now—
#YOUNG MAN.
Now forget that … we simply wouldn’t open the door.
#YOUNG MAN.
Confound it… What a noise that fellow makes—Perhaps he rang before, and we didn’t notice it.
#MAID.
Oh, no. I was listening all the while.
#YOUNG MAN.
Well, see what’s the matter. Peek through the curtains.
#MAID.
Mr. Alfred … you are … no … such a bad man.
#YOUNG MAN.
Please go and see…
#MAID.
He must have gone away again. Anyway, no one is there now. Perhaps, it was Dr. Schueller.
#YOUNG MAN.
Thank you.
#YOUNG MAN.
Listen, Marie,—I’m going to the café now.
#MAID.
So soon … Mr. Alfred.
#YOUNG MAN.
I am going to the café now… If Dr. Schueller should call—
#MAID.
He won’t come any more to - day.
#YOUNG MAN.
If Dr. Schueller should come, I—I am in the café.
