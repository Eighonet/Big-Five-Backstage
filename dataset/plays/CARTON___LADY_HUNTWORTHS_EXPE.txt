#GANDY.
Good morning, Mr. Thorsby!
#THORSBY.
Eh! Oh, good morning! I was - I - wanted to see Mr. Pillenger.
#GANDY.
Mr. Pillenger ain't much in the 'abit of climbin' trees before breakfast.
#THORSBY.
No, of course not. I thought I saw a bird's nest, I was mistaken; but feeling rather warm after my walk, I fancied it would be cooler under the branches. My object, in fact, was -
#GANDY.
Shady!
#THORSBY.
What?
#GANDY.
I was sayin' it's shady under the h'oak.
#THORSBY.
Exactly.
#BOY.
Papiers!
#GANDY.
Late again!
#BOY.
No, I ain't.
#GANDY.
Yes, you h'are. Four minutes and a half late. Your prospects of a Christmas - box are darkenin' week by week.
#BOY.
Well, but I say, Gandy!
#GANDY.
Mr. Gandy! A leetle more respect might assist your grandmother's next h'application to the coal and blanket fund. Now, is this to - day's "Standard?"
#BOY.
Yus!
#GANDY.
Very good. And the other papers?
#BOY.
"Sportin' Life!"
#THORSBY.
"Sporting Life!" That's rather an innovation, isn't it?
#GANDY.
It's for Captain Dorvaston. We deplore it, but we're 'elpless. Go along with you, and, mind me, if there's any more tip - cat down our road, I call at the police station.
#BOY.
All right. Keep your 'air on.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Good morning, Mr. Thorsby!
#THORSBY.
Good morning!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
You're an early visitor.
#THORSBY.
Yes, I - I was -
#GANDY.
Bird's nestin'!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
What does he mean?
#THORSBY.
He caught me standing up on that seat. I had just found your letter, and I had to give some explanation.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
And couldn't you rise to anything better than that? My dear Harry, what an idiot you are.
#THORSBY.
You see, I greatly dislike any deviation from the truth.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Truth is a luxury very few of us can afford. When you and I are married -
#THORSBY.
Darling!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Stay where you are! All the back windows have eyes to them. Muslin curtains don't count. When we are married -
#THORSBY.
In fact, after to - morrow -
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh, Harry, do shut up a minute. You object to shams, how is a properly organised household to be carried on without 'em? Suppose I'm up to my neck in something important - putting finishing touches to a new ball - dress, we'll say - and some female horror calls - mustn't I be out because I happen to be at home? Deviation from the truth! My dear boy, I should deviate for all I was worth. So you got my letter?
#THORSBY.
Yes.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
And your answer?
#THORSBY.
I posted it in our usual letter box.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
All right, I'll get it directly. Does it give full directions?
#THORSBY.
I think so.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Got the special license?
#THORSBY.
Yes.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
You've arranged with old Bristowe?
#THORSBY.
Yes.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
And we bike over to Ingledene Church - what time? Early of course?
#THORSBY.
I said nine.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Very well. Now you'd better go. They'll be coming out to breakfast.
#THORSBY.
Darling!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Back windows!
#THORSBY.
I was going to say that I can't help regretting the way we are treating Captain Dorvaston.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
You mind your own business. Captain Dorvaston is in my department.
#THORSBY.
I never fully understood how you came to be engaged.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Simple enough. My father was a colonel who did some rather big things on the Indian frontier, and in a dust up with one of the native Princes got himself into rather a tight corner. Jack Dorvaston - he was only a subaltern then - pulled him out of it, and in fact saved his life; so when the governor died a year or two later, he left a strong wish behind that the Captain should marry me.
#THORSBY.
I understand.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
It was a queer way of showing his gratitude, seeing that I was then a particularly unattractive child, all elbows and knees.
#THORSBY.
Lucy!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
It's all right, don't be nervous; time has softened them down. I have a notion that Jack has always funked the thing, but his colonel had given his orders, don't you see? And that was enough for him. I don't regard discipline - military or parental - with the same amount of respect. British freedom means the right to make a fool of one's self in one's own way. You're my way, and that's enough for you. Back windows!
#THORSBY.
I suppose no one guesses that we - ?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Mean business! No, with the exception possibly of Cook.
#THORSBY.
Cook!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Somehow I've a notion she's tumbled to it.
#THORSBY.
Would it matter? Would she - ?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Prattle about it? No, I think she rather likes me - tolerates would be a better word.
#THORSBY.
Tolerates? A woman of that class?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Cook is a very great personage; she rules the vicarage. Auntie made a show of resistance at first, but Uncle and Jack have been abject slaves from the start.
#THORSBY.
Really?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh yes; when a woman is striking in appearance, evidently has a past history, and can make an omelette, I don't see what's going to stop her.
#THORSBY.
What's her history?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
How should I know? She was recommended to us by the Duchess of Sturton at the time she opened the bazaar - you remember. Local philanthropic?
#THORSBY.
Then you've nothing tangible to go on?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Not from a masculine standpoint. Cook doesn't give herself away, but, like Achilles, she has one vulnerable point, and in the same locality.
#THORSBY.
How is that?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
She wears the neatest, quietest shoes imaginable, only I happened to notice they have Louis heels. That tells you nothing - the inference is too subtle; but it's quite enough for me. Make a dignified clerical exit - here comes Gandy.
#THORSBY.
I think I won't wait, Miss Lucy. So will you kindly give my message to Mr. Pillenger?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Certainly!
#THORSBY.
Thank you. Good morning!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Good morning. Gandy! what is there for breakfast?
#GANDY.
H'eggs!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Poached?
#GANDY.
Biled.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Auntie said poached.
#GANDY.
Cook said biled.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh! There's some fish, isn't there?
#GANDY.
Kidneys.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
But Auntie particularly mentioned fish.
#GANDY.
Cook thought kidneys would be preferable.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Ah, Lucy! breakfast not ready?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Breakfast is late - as usual.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
As usual? What do you mean by as usual?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I mean - as usual.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Cook is most punctual. If some trivial hitch has occurred this morning, I daresay a perfectly reasonable explanation will be forthcoming.
#GANDY.
Kidneys was late!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Kidneys was late! - er - were late. I knew it! That man Skeggs' meat - which I more than suspect of being colonial - is never delivered in time. Explain to Cook that the delay is of no consequence, and beg her not to hurry.
#GANDY.
She won't hurry!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
If I shall not be depriving you of the "Standard" - ?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Not at all! I'll have a look at Jack's "Sporting Life."
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
By the way, during the - I trust - brief interval of time that must elapse before your marriage with Captain Dorvaston, you might hint to him that the newspaper he favours is at variance with the general tone of a pious household.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I'll mention it.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I am obliged to you.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Good morning, Audley!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Good morning.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Well, Lucy!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Good morning, Auntie.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Is breakfast not ready?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
No, it isn't ready - not quite ready. I have no doubt it's nearly ready.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I shall really have to speak sharply to Cook.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I see no necessity for any - er - drastic step of that description. The delay is due to that man Skeggs.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Skeggs?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Skeggs. It is also traceable, in a minor degree to yourself - your injudicious selection of kidneys.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Kidneys?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Yes; you are aware of my preference for fish, and therefore I consider the substitution of kidneys -
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I ordered fish - and I did not order kidneys. Cook is entirely responsible for the change, and I shall certainly -
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Hannah! Hannah! If Cook understood your order, which is by no means obvious , she was doubtless influenced by - er - by Lucy's partiality for kidneys.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I never touch them.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Well, she couldn't know that. Really I think this discussion has been sufficiently prolonged.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Here is the breakfast. Let us endeavor to approach it in a seemly spirit. Where is Captain Dorvaston? Upon my word, Lucy, considering the ties that will unite you, I hope very shortly, to Captain Dorvaston, I think he might conform to my rules.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Jack was late last night.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
He was. Creaking boots after midnight are a serious infliction.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I'll call up to him if you like.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I should be indebted.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Jack! Jack!
#DOROTHY.
Hulloa!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Breakfast!
#DOROTHY.
What say, little woman?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Breakfast! Kidneys! Devilled!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut! tut! Broiled - broiled!
#DOROTHY.
Right - O! down in a minute!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
What are your plans for to - day, Audley?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I expect to be rather busy.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
It's sermon day, isn't it?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
It is. So I trust your piano practice will be reduced to a minimum.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I'm going down to the village. I suppose you'll have broken the back of it by lunch time.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Possibly - probably!
#DOROTHY.
'Fraid I'm a bit late. How are you, sir?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
In my ordinary health, I am obliged to you.
#DOROTHY.
You look astonishing fit. Now d'you know, I feel as jumpy as a flea.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Captain Dorvaston!
#DOROTHY.
Fact, ma'am! How are you this morning?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Without being actually indisposed, I feel -
#DOROTHY.
Chippy - I know; same here. Where are those kidneys you were shouting about, Lucy? Thanks!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
You kept it up again last night, Jack?
#DOROTHY.
I had a gentle flutter at the Plough and Rainbow. There was a little pool, so of course I went in.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I hope you changed your things, Captain Dorvaston. Damp clothing is so very dangerous.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Pool is a kind of billiards, Auntie.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Oh, I misunderstood! Your tea, Captain Dorvaston.
#DOROTHY.
Thank you, ma'am.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
How did you do over it?
#DOROTHY.
So so. I took a few lives at the finish.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Dear me! It sounds rather a bloodthirsty pastime.
#DOROTHY.
There was a man there named Crayll - nailing good player! Potted 'em just as he liked. He seemed to be a thirsty little beggar. I should say he took a bit of knowing.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Who's that, Jack?
#DOROTHY.
This fellah Crayll. He's stopping at the Plough and Thingummy - we're going to try a horse together.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
To - day?
#DOROTHY.
Yes. Said he'd call round some time this morning.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Hannah, we must dine earlier this evening, in view of the Penny Reading.
#DOROTHY.
Another of those festive gatherings! Hope you don't expect me to tip 'em anything this time?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
No, Captain Dorvaston; your contribution on the last occasion may have been well intentioned - I judge no man, and will hope so -
#DOROTHY.
Thought it was just the thing to wake 'em up after that Shakespearian bit of yours - The Ball of Worsted.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
The Fall of Wolsey!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I was not present last time. What did Captain Dorvaston read?
#DOROTHY.
It was an account of the last American glove fight, don't you know?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Oh!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Described with a wealth of technical detail. The whole occurrence was most regrettable. I was observing, Hannah, we shall have to dine earlier -
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I had some idea of making it a cold meal.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Cold meal! A most unpleasant suggestion. Cold food, especially in the evening, has a tendency to lie heavy on the stom - er - that is, I see nothing feasible in the notion.
#DOROTHY.
Oh no, hang it all, ma'am! Cold stuff ain't the kind of thing to do a Penny Reading on.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I thought under the circumstances it might be easier for Cook.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Eh?
#DOROTHY.
What?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
But as you both object -
#DOROTHY.
Hold on, ma'am!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
One moment, Hannah!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I will explain to Cook.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Hannah! Hannah! You're so hasty.
#DOROTHY.
Hannah - ma'am - pity to be hasty.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
If you will permit me to explain myself, Captain Dorvaston? I have no wish, Hannah, to add weight to Cook's very arduous duties.
#DOROTHY.
Hear, hear!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
And therefore it seems to me - er - unmanly to lay stress upon possible digestive difficulties which fortitude and a little pepsin should enable us to face with calmness. Let the meal be a cold one.
#DOROTHY.
Point of fact, it makes a pleasant change.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
But, Audley!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
The question is decided. We will not pursue the subject.
#DOROTHY.
Anything in the paper?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
There's something about the Huntworth Divorce case.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
We have no wish to hear any news relating to such a matter.
#DOROTHY.
But it's an old business, ain't it? When I was at Malta last year, the chaps used to chat about it at mess.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Lord Huntworth brought the divorce, didn't he?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Yes, Lord Huntworth was the petitioner. It was a sad case.
#DOROTHY.
I know Bob Carruthers.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Who's he?
#DOROTHY.
The co -
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut! tut!
#DOROTHY.
Bob was an extraordinary good chap!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
How can any individual be described as good who has occupied the position of - er - a co - respondent?
#DOROTHY.
Bob managed it.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
You seem to ignore poor Lord Huntworth.
#DOROTHY.
Didn't know Huntworth - did know Bob. He once lent me a monkey when I wanted it badly - lent it when he wanted it badly. Devilish good chap!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut! tut!
#DOROTHY.
Beg pardon, sir - slipped out.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Did you know Lady Huntworth, Jack?
#DOROTHY.
No. Heard she was a nice woman.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Nice?
#DOROTHY.
So fellahs who met her used to say.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
But I always understood the suit was undefended.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Entirely undefended.
#DOROTHY.
Matrimonial thimblerig is a confusing game to watch.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Thimblerig?
#DOROTHY.
Three thimbles, don't you know? Husband - wife - and the other chap. Well, what I meant to say was, it ain't easy for the looker - on to say which thimble the fault is under. By - the - bye, I saw something in the paper about Lady Huntworth the other day.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Surely the whole affair is uninteresting and unsavory?
#DOROTHY.
Noosance to forget a thing! What was the bit you were reading, Lucy?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
That yesterday the rule was made absolute. What does that mean?
#DOROTHY.
Only that the time was up. They keep 'em in blinkers for six months after the verdict. But that wasn't what I read? What the devil was it now?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut! Really! Really! I think we've all finished, haven't we? Hannah, you will probably wish to interview Cook.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I will see her in your presence. Gandy, will you ask Cook to come to me? I wish to give her my orders.
#GANDY.
H'orders?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Orders.
#GANDY.
I'll name it to her.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Hannah, I would suggest that whatever you have to say to Cook may be said calmly and without undue severity.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
That should be left to my discretion; a stand must be made somewhere.
#CAROLINE.
You wished to speak to me?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Yes, Cook. I want to give you the orders for to - day's dinner.
#CAROLINE.
Certainly! What do you fancy? What would you all like?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Before we speak of that I have a word to say with regard to the breakfast.
#CAROLINE.
To - morrow's breakfast?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
No, to - day's. I am very much astonished and annoyed.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut, tut!
#CAROLINE.
What was wrong with the breakfast? When I sent it out it looked all right.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Why were my directions disregarded? I ordered the eggs to be poached - you boiled them; I mentioned fried bacon - none came to table; I requested you to procure fish - you gave us kidneys. Now what have you to say?
#CAROLINE.
I'm afraid I forgot about the eggs? I haven't any other excuse to offer. most reasonable explanation!
#DOROTHY.
Things do slip one's memory.
#CAROLINE.
I didn't cook any bacon; it had got rather low, and I didn't think the result would please you.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Impossible to cut rashers from bacon that is - er - practically non - existent.
#DOROTHY.
Thing no fellah could do!
#CAROLINE.
I remember you did mention fish, but you've had a good deal of fish lately, so I thought I'd try you with kidneys. But if there has been any inconvenience, I'm sorry.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
There has been no inconvenience.
#DOROTHY.
None at all.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Hannah, I think we may pass to the orders of the day.
#DOROTHY.
Hear, hear!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Well, Cook, since you express your regret I will say no more. Now as to this evening, you will be in sole charge of the house, as I have given Keziah permission to go to the Penny Reading - so I think we will make it a cold meal, as that will entail less washing up.
#CAROLINE.
Just as you like.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
We will begin with salmon.
#CAROLINE.
Salmon? Yes, you might have salmon.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Pickled salmon.
#CAROLINE.
Oh, no, not pickled! That would be a pity! I'll make you a mayonnaise.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Delightful!
#DOROTHY.
Rippin'!
#CAROLINE.
I shall want some lettuces. I'll tell Gandy.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
After that we will have two cold ducklings.
#CAROLINE.
Ducklings? It's late for ducklings.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Maturity in poultry is to be deprecated.
#DOROTHY.
Leathery beasts at this time of the year.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Then why not a gosling?
#CAROLINE.
It's early for geese.
#DOROTHY.
Deuced early!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Entirely premature.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
When I mentioned a goose I was thinking of Mr. Pillenger.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut, tut! Hannah!
#DOROTHY.
Hope, ma'am, when you mentioned a duck, you were thinking of me.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I fail to understand you. My brother is exceedingly partial to goose.
#CAROLINE.
There's a ham in cut, so I think we'd better fall back on fowls. It isn't easy to do anything very novel with cold fowls, but if I stuff and glaze them, I've no doubt they'll pass muster.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
But, Cook, I -
#CAROLINE.
You like sweets, of course?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Certainly, you had better make us -
#CAROLINE.
Will you leave the sweets to me? I want to try a new kind of fruit salad; it's my first attempt, but you'll find it will be all right - and perhaps I might throw in a shape of jelly - we'll see.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
But -
#CAROLINE.
What time will you dine? - at least it isn't dinner - what time will you sup?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
At seven to - night, instead of half - past.
#CAROLINE.
Seven! I shall be ready. Is there anything else you wish to say to me?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
No, Cook; I don't suppose anything will be gained by my saying any more.
#CAROLINE.
Very good!
#DOROTHY.
Ah! here's that bit about Lady Huntworth. It's in the Agony column. "Will Lady Huntworth communicate with Messrs. Brampton and Stokes, Capel Court, on a matter of considerable importance?"
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Why should we resume the discussion of that disgraceful woman?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Why, indeed?
#DOROTHY.
When we were talking just now, couldn't remember where I'd read that. Hate to forget a thing.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Cook! Cook!
#CAROLINE.
I - beg your pardon!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
We needn't keep you, if you quite understand about the supper.
#CAROLINE.
Oh, quite, thanks!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Don't you think that woman has a very singular manner?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Singular! No, she is certainly superior - very superior.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
She is so superior that she seems above taking my orders.
#DOROTHY.
I wouldn't say that, , ma'am; she met you half way over the salmon.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Thorsby is late. I expected him to call.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
He came early this morning, but he wouldn't wait.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut, tut! He knows I wished to see him. I have two christenings at one - thirty, and an interment at three. However, Lucy and - er - Captain Dorvaston as you are together for once - I will avail myself of the opportunity to say a few serious words to you both.
#DOROTHY.
Peg away, sir!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I have no wish to appear unduly inquisitive on a subject with which I have merely an indirect concern but may I enquire if you have fixed the time that will make you both - that will make us all happy? Has a date been arrived at?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Not precisely.
#DOROTHY.
Not to a day or so.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Have you settled on the week or the month?
#DOROTHY.
No, we haven't got as far as that. But something was said about the autumn.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
The late autumn.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
The late autumn! But last autumn something was said about the early spring; the question was then relegated to the late summer. This is July, and where are we?
#DOROTHY.
Allow me, sir!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Thank you. I was unaware that Gandy had removed the table. But, to resume what I was saying - can you give me any definite information?
#DOROTHY.
You see, sir, I haven't worried Lucy, because I know girls are apt to be a bit - a bit -
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Well?
#DOROTHY.
Noosance! I've lost a word. Girls are apt to be a bit -
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Coy.
#DOROTHY.
That's it! Thanks, little woman - a bit coy.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Coy! Well, the expression hardly seems to me to convey Lucy's habitual demeanour; but in any case she is of age. You were twenty - one last week I think?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Yes, I was.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Your small fortune is carefully tied up.
#DOROTHY.
Quite right, sir, so it ought to be.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Captain Dorvaston is in a firm financial position.
#DOROTHY.
Pretty fair as things go.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Then why any further delay? Why not August? Nice seaside month. My own thoughts are turning towards Eastbourne.
#DOROTHY.
I had an offer from a fellah I know to go halves in a shoot this August, but I wouldn't let that stand in the way, not for a moment.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Thanks, Jack,
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Take my advice, let no trivial obstacle intervene between you. Let there be no postponement or interruption.
#DOROTHY.
There shan't be, sir.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
That's well! That's well!
#CAROLINE.
Gandy!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Do you want anything, Cook?
#DOROTHY.
Anything I could do?
#CAROLINE.
I wanted Gandy for a second.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Certainly. He was here just now.
#DOROTHY.
Saw him a minute ago.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I'll call him. Gandy!
#DOROTHY.
Fancy he went this way. Gandy!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Sorry to detain you! Gandy!
#DOROTHY.
Noosance having to wait! Gandy!
#CAROLINE.
Pray don't bother about it; I only wanted him to pick me some parsley.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
No trouble at all. Where is Gandy?
#DOROTHY.
What's happened to the beggar? Could I - er - take on the job?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut, tut! absurd! How should you know the proper way to - er - pick parsley?
#DOROTHY.
Never too old to learn, sir. Where should I be likely to drop across it?
#CAROLINE.
There's a small parsley bed over there
#DOROTHY.
Right - O!
#CAROLINE.
But it's really too bad to trouble you.
#DOROTHY.
Not a bit! To oblige you I'd pick oakum!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I - er - regret - that - er - the absence of Gandy - as to which I shall require some explanation, should have caused you all this inconvenience.
#CAROLINE.
It doesn't signify. Captain Dorvaston is doing the work very nicely.
#DOROTHY.
Fact is I've broken out in a new place. Where shall I put the pieces?
#CAROLINE.
In this dish.
#DOROTHY.
It's very easy when you get into the swing of it. Will that be enough?
#CAROLINE.
Plenty, thanks.
#DOROTHY.
There!
#CAROLINE.
I'm much obliged.
#DOROTHY.
Don't you think I should make a good gardener?
#CAROLINE.
Capital, I should say.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut! tut!
#DOROTHY.
Cook! Cook! If I try for the situation will you give me a character?
#CAROLINE.
I'm afraid I haven't one to spare!
#DOROTHY.
By George she's a devilish - er -
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut! tut!
#DOROTHY.
Just so, sir; but I mean she is - don't you know - isn't she?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
She is undoubtedly possessed of great refinement for anyone in her present sphere.
#DOROTHY.
Refinement!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
We gathered from the Duchess of Sturton that Cook had seen better days. Her Grace is somewhat vague conversationally; but we understood as much as that.
#DOROTHY.
Funny thing a woman like that should be running loose. Odd she hasn't married some fellah.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
It is singular - in fact remarkable. For a certain type of man she would make - I should say - an admirable wife.
#DOROTHY.
Just the wife for a soldier man!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Pardon me, I disagree with you. No - she has a quietude, a dignified reserve - that would fit her to preside over the household of a staid medical man - or a barrister in fair practice - who was no longer young - or even - a - a - But we're wasting the morning.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Don't say that, uncle.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Lucy!
#DOROTHY.
Hulloa, little woman! Still there?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Yes, I'm still here.
#DOROTHY.
By George, sir, weren't we all chatting over something?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I - er - think I was urging you both - to - er -
#LUCY PILLENGER.
You were urging us to name the day - and to avoid any kind of trivial interruption.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I - believe that is so.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
And Jack agreed.
#DOROTHY.
Yes.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
And I chimed in with the general sentiment. But of course - at the time - it was impossible to foresee the parsley, I'm going down to the village. I punctured a tire yesterday, and I've got to fetch my bike.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I must get to work. I'm late as it is.
#DOROTHY.
Make it a ten minutes' sermon, sir, weather's extr'ordinary hot.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I beg, Captain Dorvaston, you will spare me any such irreverent suggestions; and I trust that if you must sleep in a sacred edifice, you will render your slumber less aggressive.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
You do snore, Jack - you nearly drowned the second lesson last Sunday.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
You are not blameless. As his future wife, it is your duty - and - er - privilege - to nudge him. For what purpose has Heaven given you elbows?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Jack!
#DOROTHY.
Yes, little woman?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Do you care for me?
#DOROTHY.
'Course I do!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
How much?
#DOROTHY.
How much? Well, I'm a bad hand at explaining things.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
For instance, would you give up a big thing for my sake?
#DOROTHY.
What sort of big thing?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
An Empire?
#DOROTHY.
Oh, yes. peerage?
#DOROTHY.
Oh, Lord, yes!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Would you give up - a dish of parsley?
#DOROTHY.
What do you mean? I - don't understand.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
You're a humbug!
#DOROTHY.
Sorry you think that.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Well, do something to please me.
#DOROTHY.
Anything I can.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Fetch me an orchid, to wear this evening - there are lots in the orchid house - will you?
#DOROTHY.
'Course I will.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Thanks.
#DOROTHY.
Little woman! Ever since the time when your dear old dad first gave us the word of command, I've always had a pretty clear notion where the word duty came in; so when once you've pulled yourself together, and named the day, I mean to pull myself together and do my level damnedest to make you happy. D'you see?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Yes, I see. I'm quite sure you mean all you say, and it's nice of you to say it, and to mean it. The only thing is, you seem to be entering upon a matrimonial campaign without any transports.
#DOROTHY.
I don't follow.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
When I said you were a humbug, I meant there is one person you are always trying to deceive.
#DOROTHY.
Who's that?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Jack Dorvaston! Don't you mind what I say; go and fetch my orchid.
#CAROLINE.
Shall I do that?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh, Cook, is that you? You startled me.
#CAROLINE.
Did I? I'm sorry.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
What was it you said?
#CAROLINE.
I offered to get your letter for you. I have a longer reach.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
What letter?
#CAROLINE.
The latest one from Mr. Thorsby.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Cook! How dare you?
#CAROLINE.
I'm not naturally timid.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
You are excessively impertinent.
#CAROLINE.
Am I? Very likely. But as that is your opinion, I'll chance a rather rude question - When are you going to bolt with Mr. Thorsby?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
What do you mean? I'm foolish to listen to you at all. I shall go to my uncle and aunt and tell them what you've just said.
#CAROLINE.
If I am mistaken about you and Mr. Thorsby, you would be quite right to tell them. Am I mistaken? Quite so! Then I think I would get the compromising letter out of the tree and say no more about it - unless you'll let me do it.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh, no! There! I don't care if you do know. Anybody may know after to - morrow.
#CAROLINE.
So it's to be to - morrow?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Yes, it is. I am bound to trust you - I can't help myself; so if you choose to give the whole thing away, you can.
#CAROLINE.
I shan't do that. On the contrary, I should like to do any little thing I could to help you.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Thank you. How did you find out - about - us?
#CAROLINE.
Two or three Sundays ago - I was coming home about ten in the evening - it was my Sunday out - and as I came round the corner, you and Mr. Thorsby were outside the gate.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh!
#CAROLINE.
You were supposed to be spending the evening with your friend Mrs. Bronson, if you remember?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Yes.
#CAROLINE.
You didn't hear me coming and Mr. Thorsby said good - night to you.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh!
#CAROLINE.
He said it - very thoroughly.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Yes - I believe he did.
#CAROLINE.
That was how I found out.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
How funny it seems to be talking to you about it all. What did you think - when you saw - what you saw?
#CAROLINE.
I was rather amused.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
What did you think of me?
#CAROLINE.
Need we go into that?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I should like you to say.
#CAROLINE.
Well, to tell you the truth, I thought you weren't going quite straight.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Because of Captain Dorvaston?
#CAROLINE.
Yes.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I don't care for Captain Dorvaston - and I do care for Mr. Thorsby. Surely it's better to marry the man you love?
#CAROLINE.
I daresay it would be. I have nothing to say against Mr. Thorsby - he seems a very pleasant young fellow. I shouldn't think he would take to drink or turn out badly to any special extent. Of course, one can't tell beforehand.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Cook!
#CAROLINE.
It would be all right if you weren't engaged to another man.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
But Jack isn't in love with me!
#CAROLINE.
You think not?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
He likes me, and he wouldn't admit to anybody - certainly not to himself - that I wasn't all the world to him, and a bit over; but in the way of real love he doesn't care a rap for me. He doesn't care - a sprig of parsley!
#CAROLINE.
Ah! that makes a difference. Well, I must see to the mayonnaise.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Do you know, I think you've been trying to be very kind to me?
#CAROLINE.
Not at all.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I was wondering - if you would tell me a little - about yourself.
#CAROLINE.
Tell you what?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Tell me - about - your life.
#CAROLINE.
My life! No. It's waste of time to discuss failures.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
You are a riddle - because you are - pardon me - a lady.
#CAROLINE.
Well?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
And yet - yet - Who are you? What are you?
#CAROLINE.
The Vicar's cook. You will do me a favor, Miss Pillenger, if you will leave it at that.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh, certainly! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be inquisitive.
#CAROLINE.
I'm sure you didn't.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I ought to go down to the village.
#CAROLINE.
Don't let me make you late for any appointment.
#DOROTHY.
Here you are, little woman,.
#CAROLINE.
She has gone down to the village.
#DOROTHY.
Hulloa! Are you there, Cook?
#CAROLINE.
Yes.
#DOROTHY.
Doing a bit of al fresco cooking?
#CAROLINE.
I'm mixing the mayonnaise.
#DOROTHY.
Are you, by George! That's devilish interesting. I suppose, now, the kitchen's a bit hot for things that go off color.
#CAROLINE.
Yes.
#DOROTHY.
Eggs, for instance. I suppose you start with eggs as a ground plan - and then - and then you beat 'em. I often thought I should like to beat eggs.
#CAROLINE.
You can beat these; at least, you can stir them, if you've a fancy that way. I want to baste my two fowls.
#DOROTHY.
Oh!
#CAROLINE.
Don't leave off stirring till I come back.
#DOROTHY.
Not for worlds. But basting now, basting must be an unusual engrossing branch of the science. Couldn't I come and watch you baste?
#CAROLINE.
No; go on with the eggs please. That orchid seems rather in your way.
#DOROTHY.
Got it for Lucy to wear to - night.
#CAROLINE.
Give it me.
#DOROTHY.
Thanks!
#CAROLINE.
Tell her I'm taking care of it.
#DOROTHY.
I say, Cook!
#CAROLINE.
Yes.
#DOROTHY.
I want awfully to have a chat with you.
#CAROLINE.
You're chatting now.
#DOROTHY.
Can't talk here - people about - and there's the basting.
#CAROLINE.
That's true.
#DOROTHY.
You'll be all alone this evening. Don't fancy I shall want much of the Penny Reading - a ha'porth will be plenty. Thought I'd stroll back - and then, don't you understand?
#CAROLINE.
I think I understand you, but I'm doubtful if you quite understand me. I've an idea that what you want to say wouldn't interest me at all.
#DOROTHY.
You're wrong. I don't mean an atom of harm - swear I don't. What I want to say I would say before anybody - only I'd rather talk it over quietly. May I come?
#CAROLINE.
If you like.
#DOROTHY.
Then you believe in me?
#CAROLINE.
Yes, I think I do. What time are you likely to be back?
#DOROTHY.
Round about nine thirty.
#CAROLINE.
Nine thirty! All right! Don't forget to stir the eggs Very gently.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Captain Dorvaston! Captain Dorvaston! Captain Dorvaston! If you are at leisure I should be glad if - What is that?
#DOROTHY.
Fancy they call it a pudden basin.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
What are you - ? why should you - ?
#DOROTHY.
I'm stirring the eggs for the mayonnaise. Cook asked me to.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut, tut! I have received a letter from the lawyers, respecting the draught copy of your marriage settlement. I gave it to you. May I ask you to fetch it!
#DOROTHY.
Just now, sir?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Naturally. Why not?
#DOROTHY.
Promised I wouldn't leave off stirring. Look here, sir, if I fetch the paper, will you go on with the eggs?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Well, rather than cause - er - domestic inconvenience but have the goodness to make haste. The position is not without embarrassment.
#DOROTHY.
I'll look sharp, sir. Don't forget to stir very gently.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
The caution is quite superfluous.
#DOROTHY.
Hulloa, ma'am! Going for a prowl?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Fowl?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut, tut!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
You here, Audley? I am accompanying Lucy to the village. I imagined you were writing your sermon.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I have been delayed by - er - unforeseen interruptions You are yourself wasting the freshness of the morning.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I thought the moment was opportune for the purchase of your new socks.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut, tut!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
But you have given me no instructions as to pattern or texture.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Both are indifferent to me. I rely on your taste and judgment.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I will go then.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
What is amusing you, Lucy?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I was laughing because -
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I have no wish to hear. I object to frivolity.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Do you, uncle? Wait for me, Auntie. Jack, where's my orchid?
#DOROTHY.
Cook is taking care of it.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
What a treasure Cook is. I wonder what any of us would do without her?
#DOROTHY.
Sorry I let you in, sir, but Lucy won't say anything. I'll be back directly - and, I say, you won't forget to stir very gently?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
No, I won't! No, I won't! No, I won't!
#CAROLINE.
Captain Dorvaston! Is Captain Dorvaston - Oh, you've got it!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
The basin? Yes. I was compelled to interrupt Captain Dorvaston, so I was endeavoring to supply his place; I fear with poor results.
#CAROLINE.
Let me look? Thanks. Oh, no - it's all right.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I am relieved to hear it. Still, it probably needs the - er - hum - the final touch of the artist. You don't care for - er - compliments?
#CAROLINE.
No!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Rather an unkind restriction. bird of some experience is apt to change its first opinion of bird - lime.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Yes, very true. But compliments that are the expression of honest and - er - respectful appreciation - what of them?
#CAROLINE.
I don't know. I've never met that kind of compliment. If you'll excuse me, I'll go back to the fowls.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I have no right to detain you from more congenial society. But I have something I particularly wish to say to you. Something I wish to explain.
#CAROLINE.
Certainly! What is it?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
My explanation might - in fact, would occupy some time. The present moment is obviously ill - chosen for the purpose. You will be the sole occupant of the house this evening.
#CAROLINE.
Shall I?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Everybody - Keziah included - is going to the Penny Reading - even Gandy has asked permission to visit his aged mother.
#CAROLINE.
Has he an aged mother? I didn't know.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
He doesn't lay much stress on her - she suffers from spasms, and is a Nonconformist.
#CAROLINE.
Well?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I thought if I came back early from the Parish room, I could explain what I - er - wish to explain.
#CAROLINE.
You would discuss this all - important matter in the kitchen?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
If you - er - see no objection.
#CAROLINE.
It's your kitchen, and your responsibility; but if I were you I wouldn't explain.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Do you prohibit me from doing so?
#CAROLINE.
No, come if you like. What time am I to expect you?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
About nine o'clock. It's a quiet hour, and usually free from callers.
#CAROLINE.
We'll hope it will prove so. Very well - till nine o'clock then.
#CRAYLL.
Mornin'! Mornin'.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Eh! Oh, good morning!
#CRAYLL.
What time's the funeral?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Funeral?
#CRAYLL.
Ain't anybody dead? I rang your beastly front door bell till my arm ached; so I turned it up and came round to the back.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
My butler - er - my male servant - is rather remiss. But to the best of my knowledge, he is still alive.
#CRAYLL.
Damn sorry for it.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut, tut!
#CRAYLL.
What's the matter?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I cannot countenance such language. My sacred calling -
#CRAYLL.
Oh, I see! Didn't know you were a magpie. Come to think of it, s'pose I passed your place of business a little way up the road,
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Er - hum - yes.
#CRAYLL.
Oh, well then, I take back the damn. After all, it don't do to open one's front door too quick. S'pose you thought I was the Water Rate.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
No, sir.
#CRAYLL.
Gas?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Certainly not.
#CRAYLL.
Then what the devil did you think?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I had no theory on the subject; and as to your language - I really must beg -
#CRAYLL.
Beg? Yes, that's your trade. Same time I'll take back the devil. We don't often part company. Talking of the devil, did you ever have If you refer to the "Daily Telegraph," I usually read the "Standard."
#CRAYLL.
No, no! D.T. Jim - jams!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Jim - jams?
#CRAYLL.
Delirium tremens - ever had 'em?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Eh? What? Never, sir, never!
#CRAYLL.
Lucky beast! Well, when you do have 'em, you'll know 'em again. I've had 'em twice.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Really!
#CRAYLL.
The last bout was a blazer. A man generally sees snakes, or rats, or spiders. It was spiders with me.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Was it indeed?
#CRAYLL.
Yes - fat brutes with as many legs to 'em as an Empire ballet - all over the walls by day - all over the bed at night. If you lit a candle you saw 'em - if you didn't you felt 'em. Pah! filthy devils! Could I have a whiskey and soda?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
You haven't mentioned the object of your visit.
#CRAYLL.
Man named Dorvaston hangs out here, don't he?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Captain Dorvaston is my guest at present.
#CRAYLL.
Thought so. Promised to look him up. We're goin' to price a horse - a nailer - risin' thirteen - and well up to Dorvaston's weight - which is sayin' somethin'.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Captain Dorvaston's physique is substantial.
#CRAYLL.
If he stood on your foot, I expect you'd ask him to move.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Probably!
#CRAYLL.
He's goin' to be somethin' to you by marriage, ain't he?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
He is affianced to my niece.
#CRAYLL.
Hope he'll like it.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Why should he not, sir?
#CRAYLL.
I daresay you stick up for marriage - double blessedness and all that kind of muck.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I regard the married state as best calculated to confer the greatest happiness that - er - the -
#CRAYLL.
Have you ever bin married?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
No.
#CRAYLL.
I thought not. You beggars are always jawin' about what you don't understand. You've never had D.T., but that wouldn't stop you preaching about drink. You've never bin married, and yet you get up in the pulpit and talk about Hell as if you knew the country.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
May I ask, Mr. - er -
#CRAYLL.
Crayll.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
May I enquire, Mr. Crayll, if you are married?
#CRAYLL.
Not at present.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Ah! Here is Captain Dorvaston.
#DOROTHY.
There's the paper you wanted, sir. It took a bit of finding. Keziah cleaned my room out yesterday. Hulloa, Crayll!
#CRAYLL.
Hulloa!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Now you have come, I will ask Mr. Crayll to excuse me.
#CRAYLL.
Don't name it. Dorvaston will see to me. I daresay he knows where the whiskey's kept.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Surely a most offensive person.
#DOROTHY.
He's all right, sir. He takes a bit of knowing.
#CRAYLL.
Now, for the Lord's sake get me a drop of whiskey to wash the parson out of my mouth.
#DOROTHY.
Whiskey it is! Take potash with it? little potash.
#DOROTHY.
Right - O! Have a look at "Sporting Life"?
#CRAYLL.
What d'ye fancy for the Leger?
#DOROTHY.
Centipede! It's a dead snip. You should have a bit on it.
#CRAYLL.
No, thank ye. Don't like the name - it's too spidery.
#DOROTHY.
Cook! Cook!
#CAROLINE.
Yes?
#DOROTHY.
Fact is, friend of mine has just turned up, and he's unusual thirsty. Would you bring him out a whiskey and potash?
#CAROLINE.
Certainly.
#DOROTHY.
Very kind of you - extr'ordinary kind.
#CAROLINE.
Not at all.
#DOROTHY.
Look here, I'll run up and put another coat on, and then we'll start.
#CRAYLL.
How about the whiskey?
#DOROTHY.
It'll be here directly.
#CRAYLL.
Thank ye.
#CAROLINE.
Whiskey and potash!
#CRAYLL.
All right!
#CRAYLL.
Goodness a'mighty! Is that you? Is that you?
#CAROLINE.
Yes - what then?
#CRAYLL.
Phew! When I saw you standin' there, dressed like that, I thought I'd got 'em again. Damned if I didn't.
#CAROLINE.
Why?
#CRAYLL.
Why, who'd expect to see Lady Huntworth masqueradin' as a cook.
#CAROLINE.
I'm not Lady Huntworth any longer. Surely Lord Huntworth is the last person who should need the reminder.
#CRAYLL.
I'm not Lord Huntworth down here. My name's Crayll for the present.
#CAROLINE.
Really?
#CRAYLL.
I'm keepin' out of the way - for - reasons.
#CAROLINE.
The local police don't strike me as being very shrewd.
#CRAYLL.
Police! What d'you mean? It's duns I'm hidin' from.
#CAROLINE.
Duns!
#CRAYLL.
It's debt - it ain't crime.
#CAROLINE.
Ah! not yet. Well, good - day, Mr. Crayll. I must go back to my cooking.
#CRAYLL.
Here, hold on. Damn it, don't be in such a hurry. I want to talk to you.
#CAROLINE.
I have to baste the fowls.
#CRAYLL.
Curse the beastly fowls. I must see you alone for half - an - hour, d'you hear?
#CAROLINE.
I hear.
#CRAYLL.
It's infernal important. Will you meet me to - night?
#CAROLINE.
No.
#CRAYLL.
Why not? What are you afraid of?
#CAROLINE.
I'm not afraid of you. I think you know that.
#CRAYLL.
That long fool will be back in a minute. You'll see me somehow to - night, because - you've damned well got to - d'you understand?
#CAROLINE.
I haven't the smallest notion why you want to see me, but since fate has played me a final dirty trick by throwing us together again, perhaps we had better understand each other. So you can come here this evening for half - an - hour. I shall be alone. You had better tap at the window.
#CRAYLL.
That'll do - I'll come.
#CAROLINE.
What time shall I have the honor?
#CRAYLL.
I'll get here about nine.
#CAROLINE.
Nine! You must make it earlier than that. I expect I shall be rather busy about nine.
#CRAYLL.
Eight - thirty then.
#CAROLINE.
Yes, that would suit me.
#CRAYLL.
Is there anything else?
#CAROLINE.
As you seem to want to talk about something important you might break through a rule for once - and turn up in a possible condition.
#CRAYLL.
Not come drunk - is that what you mean?
#CAROLINE.
No, I don't want to be unreasonable. At that time in the evening you are certain to be drunk, - but try not to be too drunk to be coherent. I'll expect you at eight - thirty.
#DOROTHY.
Ready, old chap?
#CRAYLL.
In half - a - minute.
#DOROTHY.
Ah! Cook! friend and I are going for a stroll.
#CAROLINE.
It's a pleasant day for walking.
#DOROTHY.
How is our mayonnaise coming on?
#CAROLINE.
Very well, I think.
#DOROTHY.
That's all right! Shall we get along?
#CRAYLL.
Yes. Goodness A'mighty.
#CAROLINE.
"Will Lady Huntworth communicate with Brampton and Stokes, Capel - Court, on a matter of considerable importance?"
#GANDY.
Sweets, Cook!
#CAROLINE.
Quite ready! They seem to have taken very kindly to the stuffed fowls.
#GANDY.
Oh, horful! There's 'ardly a gizzard left for hus to make a supper of. Dorvaston's the worst.
#KEZIAH
Oh, and master too. I thought he'd 'ave bust 'imself - I did reelly.
#GANDY.
They told me to look sharp. It's wonderful they don't want a rest. So that's it, Cook? It looks lovely.
#CAROLINE.
Glad you like it.
#GANDY.
It ain't no good me likin' it, I shan't get none - they'll see to that. Keziah, don't you come. You'll never wait at table - your mind can't rise above 'anding bread when nobody wants it. It do look lovely. Let's pray to 'eaven they don't eat it all.
#KEZIAH
Gandy's a bit narked to - night. When there's a bit of anythink extra for supper, 'e does grodge it to 'em, don't 'e? Now with me it's, as you may say, different. If any trifle takes me fancy - such as a breast of chicken - or what not - while it's bein' carved I simply turn me 'ead away.
#CAROLINE.
Take these plates into the scullery.
#KEZIAH
Yus, Cook. Not as it always answers. I wes 'anding that sauce stuff - I forgot what you call it, Cook -
#CAROLINE.
Mayonnaise.
#KEZIAH
Yus, Cook, that was it - in a butter boat. Well, I was 'anding it to old Madam as the Captain cut himself off - oh, such a slice of 'am - I dote on 'am, I do, reelly. Well, I had to shet me eyes, and just then Gandy hustled me with 'is elbow, and me wrist turned, as you may say, sudden like, and I upset the myanneasy on to milady's gown. She did talk to me a treat.
#GANDY.
Now then, Keziah, one claret glass short. That's your silly fault.
#CAROLINE.
Do they seem to fancy the fruit salad?
#GANDY.
Fancy it! Dorvaston and the governor are both in their second 'elpings. It's 'ideous to see 'em - 'ideaous!
#KEZIAH
I shall be awful late with me washin' up. I shall miss a good 'alf of it.
#CAROLINE.
I'll wash the glass and silver for you.
#KEZIAH
That's wonderful good of you, Cook; it is reelly. D'you know I'm in two minds which 'at to wear.
#CAROLINE.
Are you?
#KEZIAH
The straw's tasty; but the large 'at with the flowers is more dressy like.
#CAROLINE.
I wouldn't wear the large one with the flowers.
#KEZIAH
Wouldn't you now?
#CAROLINE.
It might have been made in the Old Kent Road.
#KEZIAH
Might it, now? Is that in London?
#CAROLINE.
Yes.
#KEZIAH
At the shop where I bought it, they told me as it was copied from a London pattern, so I dessay you're right, Cook. Well, I could wear the straw, but -
#GANDY.
Now then, cheese - cheese.
#CAROLINE.
I see they've finished the fruit salad.
#GANDY.
Finished it! Of course they've finished it. It's 'eartbreakin'. Put the dish away, and let me try to forget it.
#KEZIAH
'As the Governor still bin goin' it?
#GANDY.
I should think 'e 'ad. Ah! and it will pay 'im out. This night's work'll lie 'eavy on 'im. I know 'is constitooshon. Ready, Cook! A bit of that cheddar all round ought to just settle 'em.
#KEZIAH
As I was sayin', Cook, as I was sayin' I could wear the straw, only I'm wishful to look me best, cos the young gentleman as I'm walkin' out with at present'll be there.
#CAROLINE.
Oh!
#KEZIAH
We shan't be able to sit together, cos of old Madam - "I don't allow no followers," she said when I come after the place - "I don't allow no followers" - You know 'er sniffy way?
#CAROLINE.
What does your young gentleman do when he isn't following?
#KEZIAH
Didn't I tell you? 'E's at Bilkins, the pork butchers. You remember that pound of sausages that came from me aunt at Cambridge? That was 'im - 'e began with sausages - next comes along a photograph frame, last week pig's feet and a shell pin - cushion. 'E's free 'anded, as you may say.
#CAROLINE.
He must be.
#KEZIAH
Won't you be feelin' lonesome this evenin'? All of us out - and Gandy goin' to see 'is mother. She lives two stations down the line and used to take in washin'.
#CAROLINE.
No, I don't fancy I shall feel lonesome.
#KEZIAH
I'll lend you my girl's "Special Monthly Journal." There's a most interestin' tale in this number. It's in 'ere. There's an 'url and 'e goes ridin' through a wood and 'e's all dressed up in armour, you know - just like the dish covers. I say, Cook, when you lived in London did you ever see any 'urls?
#CAROLINE.
One or two.
#KEZIAH
And do they dress themselves up like that?
#CAROLINE.
Not as a rule.
#KEZIAH
My word, I wish I'd bin born a toff! They must find life come easy.
#CAROLINE.
Not always. Trouble is like a postman - sooner or later he knocks at every door.
#KEZIAH
Why, they can eat and drink just what they like.
#CAROLINE.
No. After a time their doctors have a word to say.
#KEZIAH
And they can wear just what suits 'em.
#CAROLINE.
They wear whatever their dressmakers and tailors tell them to wear - whether it suits them or not. It generally doesn't.
#KEZIAH
Any'ow they don't 'ave to pay for their breakages.
#CAROLINE.
In the long run they pay just as heavily for their breakages as you do for yours.
#KEZIAH
My word! Think of that now!
#GANDY.
That's over. I'm fair sick of it. The governor is rushin' on to 'is fate. Took radishes with 'is cheese. Keziah, I have brought out the Captain's whiskey and syphon - I shan't be 'ere to - night, so you must take 'em up to 'is room the last thing, d'ye 'ear?
#KEZIAH
I 'ear.
#GANDY.
I've done most of the clearin' away.
#CAROLINE.
Bring me the bowl, Keziah, and then you can put your things on. Will you have your supper now?
#GANDY.
No, thank'ee. They've put me off it. I shall try to pick a bit by and bye when I get to mother's.
#CAROLINE.
Is your mother a good cook?
#GANDY.
No, she ain't; far from it! 'Er jints are flabby, and 'er pie crust is h'ashfelt.
#KEZIAH
Is there anything more, Cook, as I can do?
#CAROLINE.
No, thanks.
#KEZIAH
Good night, Gandy.
#GANDY.
Not so much Gandy! Mr. Gandy would do you more credit, and might lead to a cap ribbon at Christmas. It's 'ard on a respectable man to mix with such riff - raff.
#KEZIAH
Riff - raff your own self. Why, for two pins - I'd -
#CAROLINE.
Keziah!
#KEZIAH
Yus, Cook!
#CAROLINE.
Go and dress.
#KEZIAH
Yus, Cook; I'm sorry as I spoke hasty before you.
#CAROLINE.
Very well, go along; you'll be late.
#KEZIAH
Yus, Cook. Good - night, Mr. Gandy.
#GANDY.
That's the worst of domestic service - one 'as to put up with the cheek of h'underlings. It ain't a fit life for such as h'us - we're a good many cuts above it. Well, Cook, I shall 'ave to change my coat, so if you will excuse me -
#CAROLINE.
Certainly!
#GANDY.
But before I go to - night, I should like 'alf a word with you about a little matter which 'as bin floatin' on the top of my mind for this month past.
#CAROLINE.
Won't it keep?
#GANDY.
No, it won't - not if you was to put it in the refrigerator.
#CAROLINE.
People change their minds sometimes.
#GANDY.
I shan't change my mind.
#CAROLINE.
Well, change your coat, or you'll miss your train.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Cook! I've come for my orchid.
#CAROLINE.
I'll fetch it.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Gandy, I thought you were going to see your mother to - night.
#GANDY.
So I h'am, miss - I am just h'off.
#CAROLINE.
Here it is.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Thanks!
#CAROLINE.
Shall I pin it in?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Thanks!
#CAROLINE.
What time to - morrow do you take the plunge?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh, quite early in the morning, before anybody is up. Mr. Thorsby will fetch me.
#CAROLINE.
I see.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Why did you want to know?
#CAROLINE.
So that I should think of you and wish you luck.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I don't see what reason you have to wish me luck.
#CAROLINE.
You're a nice child - and I was always fond of children.
#DOROTHY.
I say, Cook, I - ah! I - hulloa, Lucy!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Well, Jack, what do you want?
#DOROTHY.
I - ah - I - wanted - to - er - Of course, I came to fetch your orchid.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
You needn't have troubled. I fetched it myself.
#DOROTHY.
Didn't know, don't you know!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Have you got my music?
#DOROTHY.
Got it here.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
That's right. Is Auntie ready?
#DOROTHY.
Fancy she's waiting in the hall.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh! then I must go. Good - night, Cook. Thanks for taking care of the flower.
#CAROLINE.
Not at all! Good - night!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Are you coming, Jack?
#DOROTHY.
In a second. Thought perhaps Cook would give me a light.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Very well, we'll go on. You can catch us up. You needn't hurry.
#DOROTHY.
May I?
#CAROLINE.
There's a box of matches on the dresser.
#DOROTHY.
This is a devilish snug kitchen. D'you know, I'd much rather stop here - and watch you doing - whatever you are doing - what are you doing?
#CAROLINE.
Washing up.
#DOROTHY.
Are you, by George? Washing up, now. How is that generally done?
#CAROLINE.
With water and a tea - cloth.
#DOROTHY.
It must be an awful fag. When it comes to work, seems to me you women beat us hollow.
#CAROLINE.
You have your drill - and parade - and fighting, too, in these days.
#DOROTHY.
Fighting ain't work - it's fun.
#CAROLINE.
Each to his trade! I prefer cooking and washing up. Oughtn't you to go?
#DOROTHY.
Yes, I'll get along. I say, you haven't forgotten - nine - thirty?
#CAROLINE.
No, but I was hoping you had.
#DOROTHY.
Upon my soul, what I want to say won't take ten minutes. Hulloa! cigar's out. I'll just light up again, you don't mind?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Cook!
#CAROLINE.
Yes!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I just wished to say one word. I wish Tut! - dear me!
#DOROTHY.
Hulloa, sir!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I imagined you had accompanied my sister and Lucy. They have started.
#DOROTHY.
Came in here to fetch the orchid!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
What orchid?
#DOROTHY.
The orchid - and I hadn't a match - and Lucy had got it already, don't you see - so Cook gave me one - and - that's how it was, don't you know.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Cook gave you an orchid?
#DOROTHY.
No, a light.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Then why allude to an orchid? However, it is quite immaterial.
#CAROLINE.
You said you wished to speak to me, Mr. Pillenger!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I desired to express my approval - my warm approval - of the excellent meal you gave us this evening; but I fear I have not sufficient time to do justice to the theme.
#DOROTHY.
By George, sir, you did justice to the fruit salad?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Very possibly, Captain Dorvaston, but I may remind you that your own appreciation assumed a very practical form.
#CAROLINE.
Won't you both be rather late?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I fear we shall. I may have to return early - I am conscious of the approach of a headache.
#DOROTHY.
Deuced odd thing! I feel a bit off colour - doubt if I shall manage to see it through.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut, tut! you look singularly well! Merely fancy, I'm sure. Good - night, Cook!
#CAROLINE.
Good - night!
#DOROTHY.
Good - night, Cook!
#CAROLINE.
Good - night!
#DOROTHY.
Nine - thirty!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Cook! you remember our appointment? Nine o'clock.
#DOROTHY.
Are you coming, sir?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Yes - in one moment! Nine! you quite understand?
#CAROLINE.
Quite!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Thank you. I thought I would just recall it to your memory. I'm coming, Captain Dorvaston!
#GANDY.
Cook, I'm a leetle pressed for time - but I find I've just got three minutes and a 'alf to waste.
#CAROLINE.
Well, what is it?
#GANDY.
I'll come straight to the pint. I've saved money - I'm sick of service, and I want to settle down. I know of a eatin' 'ouse to be 'ad - good situation - terms moderate - part cash down - remainder in monthly instalments. Will you marry me and take over the kitchen department?
#CAROLINE.
No.
#GANDY.
Don't be 'asty now. We should crush all local competition. Think it over careful. I can give you a minute and a 'alf. I'm a staid respectable man, and I want a staid respectable wife.
#CAROLINE.
And do I strike you in that light?
#GANDY.
You do.
#CAROLINE.
That is a very unexpected compliment.
#GANDY.
Yes, Cook; since I met you I've come to see there's things in life as I didn't suspect. You've showed me the superiority of braized beef over biled beef - you've rewealed the difference between 'aricot and 'ash - before you came apple fritters was to me a mere flash in the frying pan. Now I wouldn't 'urry you, but time's on the move. 'Ow's it to be?
#CAROLINE.
It's to be no!
#GANDY.
Oh!
#CAROLINE.
I wish the eating - house every success, but I don't intend to marry.
#GANDY.
But couldn't you - ?
#CAROLINE.
No, I couldn't. Don't miss your train.
#GANDY.
Well, it's a disappointment, but if you say it's to be like that -
#CAROLINE.
It's to be like that. Good - night.
#GANDY.
Good - night.
#KEZIAH
Ready at last, Cook! I'm always a cow's tail, ain't I? Thought I should never get into this dress. Miss Fletcher sent it 'ome so tight, I can't 'ardly bear myself, and no 'ook and eye at the neck, if you please. Lend us a pin, there's a dear! Thanks! I'll talk to me lady when I pay 'er. You're looking at the 'at? Yus, I 'ad to wear the big one, the straw didn't go with this dress, It made me look almost common like. Well, I must step it.
#CAROLINE.
You've forgotten your gloves.
#KEZIAH
Got 'em in my pocket - can't put 'em on yet - me hands is too 'ot. Am I all right at the back? This skirt seems to kick up.
#CAROLINE.
Not more than it does in front.
#KEZIAH
That's a blessing. 'Arry war! comes down L., puts spoons in basket, crosses to R. and exit. There is a slight pause, then CRAYLL looks in at window, he taps twice, then whistles softly - there is another slight pause, then COOK comes back and crosses C.)
#CRAYLL.
Oh! there you are! Anybody about?
#CAROLINE.
No. Come in, the door is open.
#CRAYLL.
Well, I've got here.
#CAROLINE.
So I see.
#CRAYLL.
There's a beast of a dog somewhere on the premises, ain't there?
#CAROLINE.
Yes, but he's chained up, and he's rather particular about his food; you needn't be nervous.
#CRAYLL.
And these are your quarters, are they? You've brought your pigs to a nice market. Well?
#CAROLINE.
Well?
#CRAYLL.
Why don't you speak?
#CAROLINE.
I was waiting for you to begin.
#CRAYLL.
Don't you feel the damned degradation of your position?
#CAROLINE.
No. You seem to forget I was your wife for nearly ten years.
#CRAYLL.
Ah! Have you any whiskey?
#CAROLINE.
No!
#CRAYLL.
Why, what's this?
#CAROLINE.
That belongs to Captain Dorvaston.
#CRAYLL.
That's all right. He knows me. He won't mind. A cook! That's what beats me. Why a cook?
#CAROLINE.
It was an experiment.
#CRAYLL.
If you were broke why didn't you try the stage? The divorce would have given you a leg up.
#CAROLINE.
How did you find me out?
#CRAYLL.
Accident! I came down here because I thought your pal the Duchess might give me the straight tip as to your whereabouts. My spottin' you was a bit of luck.
#CAROLINE.
You must be very hard up?
#CRAYLL.
Oh! it's bin a rotten season! Nothin's paid me. Had some big stable information for Doncaster week - that didn't pay me, couldn't even win place money. Tried the Stock Exchange; damned if that paid me - jumped in at the top of the market, crawled out at the bottom. Then there was the trial -
#CAROLINE.
Ah! I suppose the law expenses were heavy?
#CRAYLL.
Oh, devilish!
#CAROLINE.
Bribing the servants must have been rather a serious item!
#CRAYLL.
What d'ye mean?
#CAROLINE.
That was a most elaborate story my maid Thompson told the jury - Thompson was not very intelligent. It must have involved a great deal of careful rehearsal.
#CRAYLL.
We needn't go into all that.
#CAROLINE.
You are astonished to find me here. What did you think I should do?
#CRAYLL.
Thought you were with Carruthers.
#CAROLINE.
No, you didn't. You had been dangling your title before the eyes of a certain rich widow, but I see by the papers she has slipped through those shaking fingers of yours and is going to marry another man.
#CRAYLL.
Yes; women are damned shifty.
#CAROLINE.
Your notion didn't come off, but that was why you trumped up your case against me, knowing it was all a lie.
#CRAYLL.
You didn't deny it?
#CAROLINE.
No.
#CRAYLL.
Neither did he?
#CAROLINE.
No. Bob is a good fellow - and a good friend. He helped me.
#CRAYLL.
Helped you to cheat the law!
#CAROLINE.
Helped me to cheat the law that ties a woman to such a man as you.
#CRAYLL.
That was the game, was it?
#CAROLINE.
Why did you want to find me out? By the way, , has that anything to do with it?
#CRAYLL.
How do you mean?
#CAROLINE.
To - day's "Standard." There's a little advertisement in the agony column.
#CRAYLL.
I - can't see - light's bad. Read it out!
#CAROLINE.
"Will Lady Huntworth communicate with Messrs. Brampton and Stokes, Capel - Court, on a matter of considerable importance?" Did you know of that?
#CRAYLL.
No. Who are Brampton and Stokes? Never heard of 'em.
#CAROLINE.
Then why have you been hunting me up? I hadn't a shilling - you saw to that.
#CRAYLL.
I wanted you to - come - back.
#CAROLINE.
What?
#CRAYLL.
I'm willin' - to bury the past. Well, I tell you, I want to bury the past.
#CAROLINE.
Before we talk of burying the past, I should like you to look down into the still open grave -
#CRAYLL.
Filthy way of talkin'!
#CAROLINE.
When I married you I was thirty - quite old enough to know better! but I'd spent my youth in nursing my father. When he died I inherited a fortune - and my freedom - without much notion what to do with either. That was a bad year for me. I lost my father and I found you. I don't know what crime I had committed that fate should sentence me to ten years' penal servitude. But my father had wished it and so did your mother. You had been a little wild, they said, but all you needed was gentle guidance. I believed them, but my gentle guidance that was to work miracles generally took the shape of helping you up to bed in the small hours, when the difficulty of adjusting the latchkey had been overcome.
#CRAYLL.
Look here, it 'pears to me you're trying to be 'fensive.
#CAROLINE.
That was my life for ten years. The dregs of your fortune and the whole of mine gradually melted away - in cards - racing, drink - and a few extra establishments.
#CRAYLL.
You never grumbled about th' extra 'stablishments.
#CAROLINE.
Oh, no! I only mention them now - to fill up the picture of our home life. With regard to your gambling and drunkenness I was sorry for myself, but in the matter of your infidelities I was sorry for the other women.
#CRAYLL.
Your language's 'fensive - damned 'fensive!
#CAROLINE.
At the finish we had a pleasant little chat; you hadn't a sixpence left - or a friend either - except Bob Carruthers. He had lent you more than he could afford and he was sick of it. You tried to get me to ask him again. I wouldn't. It was on that occasion you reached up and tried to strike me. Do you remember?
#CRAYLL.
Momentary irritation - regretted it d'rectly!
#CAROLINE.
We parted that night. The place was sold up, and I didn't hear of you again till you commenced proceedings for our divorce. Then I went to Bob. He offered to see me through - engage counsel and all that. It would have been easy to smash your case, but that would have left me tied to you; so I asked him if he would join me in making no defence. He pointed out what society would think of me. I said I knew enough of society to care nothing for its bad opinion. He did as I wished, so you got your decree nisi and the sympathy of the public.
#CRAYLL.
All this is beastly 'fensive.
#CAROLINE.
My only problem was how to live. I couldn't teach or make dresses or typewrite. There was only one thing I could do properly - I could cook. It was always a fad of mine. I used often to prepare little dishes for my father - in the old days - and while I was trying to see my way, I met Millicent Sturton. I told her everything, and asked her to help me. She had influence with these good people - so I resumed my own name and became the vicar's cook. Now you understand everything! I'll say good - bye. I'm likely to be rather busy this evening.
#CRAYLL.
Don't say goo'bye. I wan' you to come back. My 'ntentions are disin'ersted. Won't you come back?
#CAROLINE.
Not while there's a crossing to be swept - or a box of matches to be sold.
#CRAYLL.
S'pose I was to - give th' show away - d'you think they'd keep a woman like you - a woman who was n'torious?
#CAROLINE.
No!
#CRAYLL.
Very well, then I can squash you. Word from me'd sweep you into the gutter - an' if you don' come back - I'll do it. I'll show you what comes of r'fusin' disin'ested offer. Don' laugh at me, you fool! I'll do it! I'll drag you off your damned high horse, I'll - I'll -
#CAROLINE.
No, you won't! you're too anxious to keep your own identity secret just now to say anything about mine. Isn't that so - Mr. Crayll?
#CRAYLL.
Tha's true, tha's true! Le's be frien's - shall we? Don' le's be touchy. If you'll come back, I'll do the right thing - marry you again - marry you anywhere you like - St. Paul's Cathedral, if you like. Come back and be a comfort to ailin' man. Le's have 'nother honeymoon. Shall we? Le's kiss an' be friends; but first le's have a little more whiskey. Shall we?
#CAROLINE.
No, we won't have any more whiskey - in fact, I think we had better go now.
#CRAYLL.
Not friendly! No r'sumption of former 'fectionate footin', same time - no desire to remain - where not wanted. Where's cigar case? Want cigar - smoke going home. Oh, here 'tish!
#CAROLINE.
Wake up! You mustn't sleep here.
#CRAYLL.
Want cigar!
#CAROLINE.
Want a cigar? But this is your letter case. And you've dropped something. Looks like a writ. Messrs. Brampton and Stokes Ah! my first idea was right "Messrs. Brampton and Stokes present their compliments to Lord Huntworth, and would be greatly obliged if he could place them in communication with the lady who was till very recently his wife. The reason for the application is urgent, as information has been received from an Australian firm of solicitors that Lady Huntworth has succeeded to a considerable fortune through the death of an uncle. Messrs. Brampton and Stokes would greatly appreciate an early reply. Capel Court. May 9th." More than two months ago! Ah! Lord Huntworth, you will do me the favour to wake up. I thought I had said everything I had to say, but I find I was wrong. What's that? Did I hear the gate go? Wake up - you mustn't be found here.
#CRAYLL.
Wha's matter?
#CAROLINE.
I must put you somewhere; you wouldn't be easy to explain away. Quite like old times!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Hum! Cook!
#CAROLINE.
Yes?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
May I come in?
#CAROLINE.
Certainly!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I - er - explained to Miss Pillenger that I thought it advisable to return home early - as I was feeling somewhat indisposed.
#CAROLINE.
Then you would like to go to bed? I'll let Miss Pillenger in.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
That is not necessary, I gave her my latchkey. I fear I must admit my illness has no - er - tangible existence.
#CAROLINE.
Oh!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I trust I am not interrupting any - er - domestic occupation?
#CAROLINE.
I have to hem some pudding cloths, but I can listen while I work. What do you want to say to me?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I - er - find some difficulty in approaching the subject. It is one with which I have been hitherto - quite unfamiliar.
#CAROLINE.
Perhaps if you sat down it might be easier.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Er - thank you. The suggestion is very considerate. During the few months you have been with us - you must have noticed that you had roused - in me - a strong feeling - of - er - of interest?
#CAROLINE.
I saw it - I didn't notice it.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Exactly! You would not - care - perhaps, to give me a somewhat larger measure of your - er - confidence - touching the - er - the past.
#CAROLINE.
No; I think we'll leave the past alone.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I may possibly persuade you to be less reticent - when I have submitted my - er - my proposal to you.
#CAROLINE.
Proposal?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Yes. After such reasonable hesitation as should precede the taking of any important step, I have decided to offer you an alternative to your present life, the nature of which you may have already guessed.
#CAROLINE.
I suppose you are the alternative?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Precisely. I ask you to be - er - to be my wife.
#CAROLINE.
Thanks!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I am no longer young, but my health is good, with the exception of a little periodic gout. My temper, if not invariably equable, is what a long succession of curates has made it; and as to worldly considerations, without being a rich man, my position is an independent one.
#CAROLINE.
It ought to be.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I beg your pardon?
#CAROLINE.
You say you don't speak without consideration. Have you considered what your sister would say?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
It is a point to which I have devoted very exhaustive attention. At first she might not welcome the idea with - er - absolute enthusiasm.
#CAROLINE.
No, she might not. Have you also considered what the world would say?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
The world?
#CAROLINE.
It's rather a tolerant world where a man is concerned, but it holds special views about clergymen, and it wouldn't stand the notion of a vicar marrying his cook.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
The social disparity between us is far more apparent than real. Your present vocation must be the outcome of caprice - or temporary necessity.
#CAROLINE.
Take it at that. What do you know of me? I may be an adventuress - in fact, most of the evidence points that way. At any rate I have no intention of marrying. I have said the same thing once before this evening in reply to a similar proposition from Gandy.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Gandy? Did he dare?
#CAROLINE.
He did. This seems to be rather a susceptible household.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
You haven't given me a conclusive answer?
#CAROLINE.
Haven't I? I thought I had.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
You may require a little time for final reflection.
#CAROLINE.
I think not.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Nevertheless, if you will spare me your attention.
#CAROLINE.
One moment! I thought I heard a step on the path. Yes, it's Captain Dorvaston.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
You don't say so? That is highly inconvenient. What had I better do?
#CAROLINE.
I think you had better go to bed.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
An opportunity like the present is so difficult to obtain. He will merely pass through to his room. I'll wait in the scullery.
#CAROLINE.
The scullery is rather in confusion.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Then the larder is probably available.
#CAROLINE.
I really wouldn't wait if I were you.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I do so on my own initiative. There are several arguments I wish to -
#CAROLINE.
He's coming.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Oh!
#DOROTHY.
Well, Cook, I've got back. May I come in?
#CAROLINE.
If you like. You needn't have locked the door.
#DOROTHY.
Don't you keep it locked?
#CAROLINE.
I do generally - it doesn't matter.
#DOROTHY.
The governor was seedy and left early.
#CAROLINE.
Yes, he came back.
#DOROTHY.
Gone to bed, I s'pose? I tried to think of something a bit more novel, but I couldn't, so I had to tell the old lady I wasn't feeling fit myself.
#CAROLINE.
Why did you trouble?
#DOROTHY.
Oh, well, don't you know, I wanted to say something to you.
#CAROLINE.
Yes.
#DOROTHY.
I'm a bad hand at getting my notions into words. P'raps if you go on doing - whatever you're doing - I may manage to make a start. That ought to look exceptional pretty when it's finished.
#CAROLINE.
Do you think so?
#DOROTHY.
Yes! What - is it? pudding cloth.
#DOROTHY.
Jove! You don't say so? I say, you mustn't think me an awful ass!
#CAROLINE.
It doesn't matter what I think.
#DOROTHY.
It matters to me.
#CAROLINE.
It oughtn't to matter.
#DOROTHY.
Been doing a bit of reading?
#CAROLINE.
No. That belongs to Keziah.
#DOROTHY.
This sounds promising. "The belted Earl entered the lists with lance in rest. His shield bore for device a bar sinister with Fleur de Lys rampant." That ain't heraldry!
#CAROLINE.
Yes, it is, "Family Heraldry." I don't want to hurry you, but it's getting late.
#DOROTHY.
Well, I - I hope you haven't misunderstood my - object in - bothering you?
#CAROLINE.
I should like to think I had.
#DOROTHY.
I don't follow.
#CAROLINE.
Members of your profession don't generally make an appointment with cook in order to assure her of their respect.
#DOROTHY.
Some of us may be a bit rackety, but we know a lady when we see one, and we shouldn't treat her any different because she chose to pretend to be a cook.
#CAROLINE.
Pretend?
#DOROTHY.
Why, any duffer could see - I can see you were never meant to be what you are. These things generally come about through loss of coin - for instance, a woman's father speculates, and the home goes biff. He shuts up in his stride, and she takes up the running. Now what that woman wants is a friend to give her the lead over the fences - a friend who don't want anything from her - will you keep your eye on that? - who don't want anything from her, but who would like awfully to do her a turn, if she'd let him. I think that goes into the four corners of what I wanted to say.
#CAROLINE.
Do you know you're a wonderfully good fellow?
#DOROTHY.
Oh, rot! Well, may I be - a little use to somebody for once?
#CAROLINE.
I won't borrow money of you, if you meant that.
#DOROTHY.
False pride!
#CAROLINE.
No, that isn't it.
#DOROTHY.
It's a devilish odd thing that every good woman is a bit of a coward, and she's always afraid of what people will say, especially if it isn't true.
#CAROLINE.
That description fits me less than any woman in the world.
#DOROTHY.
You won't let me be of use to you, because I happen to be a man, and you happen to be a woman - ain't that so? I see how it is. I've made an ass of myself. You won't have my help or my friendship.
#CAROLINE.
I don't need the help, but I'll take the friendship.
#DOROTHY.
Thanks!
#CAROLINE.
What I thought about you was wrong. I beg your pardon.
#DOROTHY.
Oh, that's all right!
#CAROLINE.
Now, will you do me a little favour?
#DOROTHY.
Anything!
#CAROLINE.
Will you go to bed? They mustn't come back and find you here.
#DOROTHY.
Of course not, I'll go at once; and if at any time you should want a pal, you'll let me -
#CAROLINE.
Hush! I fancy I heard the key in the front door. Yes, it is them. Miss Pillenger is saying she wants to speak to me.
#DOROTHY.
By George! I'd better nip into the scullery.
#CAROLINE.
No!
#DOROTHY.
The larder?
#CAROLINE.
No. Go into the garden.
#DOROTHY.
Of course! Stupid of me!
#CAROLINE.
Make haste.
#DOROTHY.
Can't get the beastly door open. Something's wrong with the key.
#CAROLINE.
You'll be too late!
#DOROTHY.
Here! What's this? Ah, the broom cupboard, any port in a storm!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Cook, I remembered I hadn't ordered to - morrow's breakfast.
#CAROLINE.
No. What would you like?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Has Keziah returned?
#CAROLINE.
Not yet.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Both my brother and Captain Dorvaston were too unwell to remain with us. They have doubtless gone to bed, so I will ask you to go upstairs very quietly.
#CAROLINE.
Certainly! I think I hear Keziah.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
She is very late. Why don't you open the door?
#CAROLINE.
The key sticks a little.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
It should be oiled.
#KEZIAH
Oh, Cook, I did enjoy myself a treat! 'E was there - and when I come out - Oh lor!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Keziah!
#KEZIAH
Yes, mum.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Why are you so late?
#KEZIAH
I dunno, mum.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Who is the person you spoke of when you came in?
#KEZIAH
What person, mum?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
You said distinctly he was there.
#KEZIAH
Oh, that was me sister's 'usband's brother, mum. 'E's a plumber, and Church of England.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
You are aware I don't allow followers?
#KEZIAH
'E don't follow me, mum. I did give 'im good evenin', bein', as you may say, relations, and 'e told me as my sister 'as just 'ad 'er seventh, and both doin' well, and -
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
That will do. I hope you are telling the truth.
#KEZIAH
Oh yes, mum, it's gorspel, it is reely!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Mind you go upstairs quietly; your master is unwell.
#KEZIAH
Yes, mum. Good night, mum.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Good night! I'm afraid, Cook, you must have had a rather dull evening.
#CAROLINE.
No, I haven't been dull. You were going to speak about the breakfast.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Yes. Let me see, we shall have fish. What was that? I heard a noise in that cupboard.
#CAROLINE.
It may have been a mouse.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I didn't know we had any mice. You had better set a trap to - morrow.
#CAROLINE.
You mentioned fish? Will you have it grilled?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
No, fried with egg and breadcrumbs. That can't be a mouse. The cat must have got shut up in there.
#CAROLINE.
The cat is in the scullery.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Then it must be a strange cat.
#CAROLINE.
Strange cats sometimes fly at you. If you'll go, I'll see to it. I'm not nervous.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Neither am I. I prefer to see for myself. How this door sticks. Captain Dorvaston! May I ask you to explain this?
#DOROTHY.
Well, ma'am, it ain't exactly easy to make the thing clear.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I see. The explanation is only too obvious. My niece has gone to her room, so I shall not disturb her to - night, but to - morrow it will be my painful duty to tell her everything.
#DOROTHY.
I say, ma'am, just a moment.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
As to you, Cook, I will - or, rather, Mr. Pillenger - will speak to you in the morning.
#CAROLINE.
Very well!
#DOROTHY.
Look here, ma'am - upon my soul you must listen. I wanted to say something to Cook. It was nothing - anybody might have heard it.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Then why conceal yourself in the broom cupboard?
#DOROTHY.
I know the broom cupboard ain't easy to get out of. I could explain better, only I feel in such an awful hat -
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
You are not wearing your hat!
#DOROTHY.
No, but - really, you know, I simply wanted -
#CAROLINE.
Captain Dorvaston, don't trouble; whatever you may say Miss Pillenger won't believe you.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
That is true. There are things that cannot be explained away. The broom cupboard is one of them.
#DOROTHY.
But I say, ma'am!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Good - night, Captain Dorvaston.
#DOROTHY.
I've made a nice mess of it.
#CAROLINE.
You have rather.
#DOROTHY.
If nature allowed a fella to kick himself, I'd do it with the greatest pleasure. To drag you into such a beastly muddle! And I did so want to do you a turn.
#CAROLINE.
I know you did. You meant kindly, and I'm very grateful. Go to bed and forget all about it.
#DOROTHY.
There'll be an awful row to - morrow. I'm not thinking of myself, I'm thinking about you.
#CAROLINE.
You needn't worry about me. Oddly enough, I've had news to - night that makes this affair very unimportant. Now I must really ask you to go.
#DOROTHY.
All right, I'll be off. But, I say - you do forgive me?
#CAROLINE.
Of course I forgive you.
#DOROTHY.
Thanks. Good - night!
#CAROLINE.
Good - night!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Hum! Tut, tut!
#DOROTHY.
Hulloa, sir! Were you in there?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Yes - I - er - was.
#DOROTHY.
What, all the time?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I had an important reason for desiring a few minutes' conversation with - er - Cook.
#CAROLINE.
Mr. Pillenger shared your wish that I should better myself.
#DOROTHY.
That's devilish lucky, because, as you were a witness, you can clean the slate for us, and back up what I say.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
You fail to perceive that my perfectly innocent sojourn in the larder would be as difficult of plausible explanation as your own regrettable occupancy of the broom cupboard.
#DOROTHY.
Jove, yes, that's true! What had we better do?
#CAROLINE.
The first step - especially as you are both invalids is for you to go to bed.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
The suggestion is most judicious. I think, Captain Dorvaston, I will precede you by a few minutes. The stairs have a tendency to creak, and would certainly do so under our combined weight. Good - night.
#DOROTHY.
Good - night, sir.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
With your permission I will remove my boots. It would not be fair to disturb the household. Good - night!
#DOROTHY.
By George! then the governor was there all the time.
#CAROLINE.
Yes, I was well provided with chaperonage.
#DOROTHY.
It don't get you out of the mess, that's the worst of it.
#CAROLINE.
You needn't mind me.
#DOROTHY.
I'm bound to mind you. Are you sure there's nothing I could do to help you - in any sort of way?
#CAROLINE.
No. Well, there is one thing you could do for me - if you really mean what you say.
#DOROTHY.
I swear I do!
#CAROLINE.
What I should want you to do would be rather a nuisance. Are you sure you wouldn't mind?
#DOROTHY.
Try me.
#CAROLINE.
Well, there's a man in the scullery.
#DOROTHY.
Another man!
#CAROLINE.
Yes. I fancy you'll find he is asleep against the sink.
#DOROTHY.
Is he, by George?
#CAROLINE.
Might I trouble you to fetch him out?
#DOROTHY.
Eh? What? Oh, certainly! There you are! Why, it's Crayll!
#CAROLINE.
Yes.
#DOROTHY.
He's as drunk as a fiddler.
#CAROLINE.
Yes. He called on me this evening, rather to my inconvenience.
#DOROTHY.
Did he?
#CAROLINE.
Might I ask you - to put him somewhere for me? There's a dry ditch - at the end of the garden - that would do.
#DOROTHY.
Anything you wish, of course.
#CAROLINE.
Thanks!
#DOROTHY.
Then you know Crayll?
#CAROLINE.
Yes. He was my husband at one time.
#DOROTHY.
What!
#CAROLINE.
Good - night! The stage is now dark except the moonlight which streams in at
#THORSBY.
Darling!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Hush!
#THORSBY.
Mustn't I? - on our wedding day?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
No!
#THORSBY.
Oh!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
At least - whatever you wish to convey to me must be done in dumb show.
#THORSBY.
I see.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Mind my hat. When we have been married a few years you'll realize that my hats must be treated very respectfully.
#THORSBY.
I suppose the household is still in bed?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Yes. I crept downstairs feeling like a burglar. I had one awful moment - I stumbled over Auntie's shoes - they were outside her door.
#THORSBY.
My dearest - that was rather careless.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Careless! Auntie's shoes aren't easy to avoid in a narrow passage. It was all right. Uncle and Aunty were still asleep - I could hear them -
#THORSBY.
And Captain Dorvaston?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh! I expect Jack was asleep, too, not dreaming the hour of his emancipation was at hand. Poor old Jack! I wish he was coming with us.
#THORSBY.
Hum! Do you?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I wish he could have given me away.
#THORSBY.
I - hardly share that feeling.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
You don't know him; he'd have done it in a minute if I'd asked him. I'd have told him all about it, only he's such a clumsy old duffer; he might have given me away in a different sense.
#THORSBY.
You seem to place great reliance on his affection for you.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
He has tons of affection for me - tons - but not love - at least, not the business article you and I deal in. By the way, Harry, there are one or two points we have never properly settled.
#THORSBY.
What are they?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I mean to be a clinking parson's wife.
#THORSBY.
Darling!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Hold on! I mean to be a clinking parson's wife, but I have my limitations. Church on Sunday - how many times?
#THORSBY.
Three?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh, no! Mornings generally, evenings sometimes, afternoons never.
#THORSBY.
Never?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Never! Now you're shocked - your face has grown a couple of inches longer. Well, if I'm not orthodox enough for you it's off, and I'll go back to bed again.
#THORSBY.
Lucy dear, in answer to what you said, I shall merely exact one promise.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Which is?
#THORSBY.
That in all things - and in all seasons - you will do - or not do - whatever you please. Do you promise?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Harry, I do promise; it shall be exactly as you say. Indeed, indeed, I'll keep my word. Now then, fasten my glove, and we'll go and get it over.
#CAROLINE.
I beg your pardon.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Cook!
#THORSBY.
Dear me!
#CAROLINE.
I hope I didn't startle you?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh, no!
#THORSBY.
Not at all!
#CAROLINE.
I thought you might like a cup of coffee to help you face the ordeal.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Was that why you wanted to know last night what time I meant to start?
#CAROLINE.
No. I told you I wanted to think of you, and wish you luck. The coffee was an afterthought.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I see.
#CAROLINE.
Won't you both sit down and have it comfortably?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Is it safe to wait?
#CAROLINE.
Quite.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Keziah?
#CAROLINE.
Keziah is not awake - I wrapped the alarum in a blanket.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
It has probably dawned on you, Harry, that Cook is a good friend of ours?
#THORSBY.
It has, indeed!
#CAROLINE.
Cook was once young herself - it was some years ago - but she hasn't forgotten the circumstances. Milk and sugar?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Thanks.
#CAROLINE.
Mr. Thorsby?
#THORSBY.
If you please - two lumps.
#CAROLINE.
Bread and butter? It isn't up to much - yesterday's loaf - but it was the best I could do. And how do you both feel? Nervous?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Beastly nervous!
#THORSBY.
The moment is naturally a solemn one. I feel anxious, but not nervous.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh, it's all right for you; you've tied up such a lot of poor misguided people, that you know the words backwards. It's different with me - I know I shall bungle it.
#CAROLINE.
There are only three words that really signify.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Which three?
#CAROLINE.
Love, honor, and obey.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I think I can manage the first two, but I mean to slur the third, cough, or sneeze or something.
#THORSBY.
That sounds rather an alarming prospect. Don't you pity me?
#CAROLINE.
No, I don't think I do. How do you go to Church?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
We are going to bike there. By - the - bye, would you tell somebody - Auntie or Jack - anybody will do - that I've run over to see my friend, Jenny Thornton, and they're not to wait breakfast?
#THORSBY.
My dear Lucy, ought we to involve a third person in our deception?
#CAROLINE.
The third person hasn't a very tender conscience in such matters. I'll tell your little fib for you with pleasure.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
There, Harry, I knew she would. Thank you, Cook. What's this?
#CAROLINE.
I wanted to throw a shoe after you, and that was the only one I could find. It's one of your Aunt's - she put it outside her door to be cleaned.
#THORSBY.
Dear me! It looks rather formidable.
#CAROLINE.
It is large! We'll hope that the luck it brings will be proportionate. Now, I should say it was time for you to go.
#THORSBY.
Yes, I don't think we ought to delay.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
All right, come along. Stop a second though. I say, Harry, have you got everything?
#THORSBY.
Got everything?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Everybody's fee. I should like to do the thing well.
#THORSBY.
Yes.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
How about the ring?
#THORSBY.
Eh? Oh, yes, I - I bought it yesterday.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Very likely, but have you got it with you to - day?
#THORSBY.
I certainly think so. I have a distinct recollection of putting it in my waistcoat pocket.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
You've lost it. There's a pretty mess!
#THORSBY.
Ah! here it is. There is a hole in the pocket, and it had slipped down into the lining.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Thank goodness! That would have been a nice thing, wouldn't it?
#CAROLINE.
Will you wear this? It's only syringa, but it looks like orange blossom. I picked it for you this morning.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
You have been kind to me, and I've no means of thanking you. Will you stoop down and let me kiss you? I'm afraid that's all I can do.
#CAROLINE.
I'm quite repaid. I fancy Mr. Thorsby agrees with me.
#THORSBY.
Good - bye! May I add my thanks also?
#CAROLINE.
Not at all. Good - bye.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
It isn't good - bye - we're coming back as soon as it's over; and we mean to tell everything to everybody. So we shall see you again.
#CAROLINE.
One never knows what may happen. I think we'll make it good - bye. Now, go along and get married, and live happy ever after, as they do in the fairy tales.
#DOROTHY.
Hulloa! Good - morning!
#CAROLINE.
Good morning. Rather a close shave.
#DOROTHY.
I beg your pardon?
#CAROLINE.
Nothing!
#DOROTHY.
Look here, don't go. I want to have half a word with you.
#CAROLINE.
Well?
#DOROTHY.
I - saw to that little job.
#CAROLINE.
Yes?
#DOROTHY.
I - put him in the ditch.
#CAROLINE.
Thanks. Did he say anything?
#DOROTHY.
He muttered something about another whiskey, and that he would like to be called about nine. Now would you mind telling me a little about it all? Give you my word it ain't mere curiosity, it's interest in you and everything that concerns you.
#CAROLINE.
I told you the chief thing last night. Mr. Crayll was my husband at one time.
#DOROTHY.
You say he was your husband.
#CAROLINE.
Yes. We are divorced.
#DOROTHY.
Oh, that was it! I haven't known your - er - I haven't known Crayll more than a day or two, but I can see he's an awful little swine. I suppose he treated you anyhow?
#CAROLINE.
Yes. Is there anything else you would like me to tell you?
#DOROTHY.
It's extraordinary good of you to give me your confidence.
#CAROLINE.
You've earned it.
#DOROTHY.
Well then, I say, what are you going to do now?
#CAROLINE.
See to the breakfast.
#DOROTHY.
No, no! I mean about - Miss Pillenger - and - the broom cupboard. There'll be an infernal row, and I'm afraid you'll get beans.
#CAROLINE.
I'm used to handling all kinds of vegetables. As I told you last night, it doesn't matter.
#DOROTHY.
But, by George, it does matter! When I asked you then to let me be of use to you, I put it to you as a favor, now I ask it as a right. I got you into this mess, simply through my beastly clumsiness, and you've got to let me see you through it somehow.
#CAROLINE.
News has reached me, in rather a roundabout way, that I have come into some money; so you see I'm independent - of Miss Pillenger - and the broom cupboard.
#DOROTHY.
Really?
#CAROLINE.
Really!
#DOROTHY.
You're not - pulling my leg?
#CAROLINE.
No!
#DOROTHY.
Then I'm devilish glad for your sake, and devilish sorry for my own. I thought at last I saw my way - to doing you a turn.
#CAROLINE.
My life hasn't been a very pleasant one, but in one respect I've been lucky, I have known two men who honestly tried to befriend a woman.
#DOROTHY.
Who was the other chap?
#CAROLINE.
His name is Carruthers.
#DOROTHY.
Not old Bob?
#CAROLINE.
Old Bob.
#DOROTHY.
Why, he's a dear pal of mine!
#CAROLINE.
Is he?
#DOROTHY.
And did he try to be a pal to you?
#CAROLINE.
I was thinking of his kindness to Lady Huntworth.
#DOROTHY.
Ah, how about Lady Huntworth? Did you know her?
#CAROLINE.
Yes! We are rather intimate - like myself she was unfortunate in her choice of a husband.
#DOROTHY.
Huntworth brought the divorce, didn't he?
#CAROLINE.
Yes. Thinking he saw his way to marrying another woman, with another fortune, he brought his suit against his wife and your friend.
#DOROTHY.
Damn him! Pardon! couldn't help it.
#CAROLINE.
The whole thing was utterly untrue and I know she asked Bob to join her in making no defence rather than remain Lady Huntworth.
#DOROTHY.
The only thing that rather fogs me is, when the verdict was once given, why didn't Bob marry her?
#CAROLINE.
He did suggest it.
#DOROTHY.
Well?
#CAROLINE.
She said no.
#DOROTHY.
Why did she do that?
#CAROLINE.
She knew he didn't care for her, nor she for him - at least not in that way.
#DOROTHY.
Still, it was game of her to refuse! There ain't many women placed as she was who'd have done it.
#CAROLINE.
Perhaps not. I must go now.
#DOROTHY.
No, wait one minute. I'm going on duty directly. My duty is to make Lucy a happy little woman and I mean to do it. But you seem to be going down rather a lonely road and I want you to remember that somewhere or other there is an old duffer lumbering about the world who will never forget you - will you remember?
#CAROLINE.
I shall remember. Now I really can't stay any longer.
#DOROTHY.
I say! Will you?
#CAROLINE.
Of course! Why not?
#DOROTHY.
Supposing I'd been a free man, do you think you - could -
#CAROLINE.
Oh! That opens out a very large question. I haven't time to answer that.
#DOROTHY.
I wonder if we shall ever come across each other in the future?
#CAROLINE.
More unlikely things have happened. Good - bye!
#DOROTHY.
Good morning!
#GANDY.
Mornin'.
#DOROTHY.
Got a match about you?
#GANDY.
No. There should be a box 'ere. There is!
#DOROTHY.
Thanks! I suppose the papers haven't come yet?
#GANDY.
They 'aven't.
#DOROTHY.
You seem a trifle down. Not quite your own bright self, are you?
#GANDY.
I ain't!
#DOROTHY.
You went to see your mother, didn't you?
#GANDY.
Yes.
#DOROTHY.
Hope you found her feeling fit?
#GANDY.
She's fit enough! It's me.
#DOROTHY.
What's the matter?
#GANDY.
Weal cutlet for supper - that's wot's the matter! I've always done my dooty by mother, so I picked a bit, and then I went to bed and dreamt I was superintendin' my own funeral. Weal cutlet! Mother gets above herself.
#DOROTHY.
Have you tried a drop of brandy?
#GANDY.
I 'ave.
#DOROTHY.
I should try another.
#GANDY.
I mean to.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Gandy, can you tell me what has happened to my shoes?
#GANDY.
No.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I put them outside my door last night, but this morning I find one of them still uncleaned and the other has disappeared. You haven't seen it, I suppose?
#GANDY.
I 'aven't.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Very singular! Have you seen Miss Lucy? She is not in her room!
#GANDY.
No.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Good morning!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Good morning, Audley.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Has the post come?
#GANDY.
No, it ain't.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
You appear to have had an accident.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Accident!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
In completing your toilette.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Eh? Hum - yes. The razor slipped. My nervous system is slightly disorganized.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
The result of last night.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Last night? I - er - fail to understand you.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I was referring to your indisposition.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Oh! - Ah! - exactly.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Are you going out?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I thought the fresh morning air might be beneficial.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I must ask you to remain. I have a most painful subject to talk over with you.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Need we deal with it now? Painful subjects should never be discussed on an empty - before breakfast.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
It does not admit of delay. We may have to face a serious scandal.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Scandal! I trust, Hannah, you are weighing your words very carefully.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I am not in the habit of speaking heedlessly. What I have to tell you refers to Cook - and to Captain Dorvaston.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Ah! here - is - er - Captain Dorvaston.
#DOROTHY.
Good morning, sir. Good morning, ma'am!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Hannah was just - er - mentioning, as you entered, that - you -
#DOROTHY.
Yes, I fancied I caught my name. What were you saying, ma'am?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I was saying, Captain Dorvaston - What are you doing with that shoe?
#DOROTHY.
Just picked it up.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Why did you touch it? Your doing so seems to me to be strangely wanting in delicacy.
#DOROTHY.
Don't see anything indelicate in picking up an old shoe. I found it on the garden path.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
My shoe on the garden path!
#DOROTHY.
Yours! I thought it was Gandy's.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
If you thought to keep me a prisoner in my room by the removal of my shoe, the expedient was abortive. I have several other pairs.
#DOROTHY.
Don't know what the deuce you're driving at, ma'am. Sorry I disturbed the thing. Shall I put it back?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I will thank you to restore it to me. Thank you! Now, with your permission, I will resume what I was saying to Mr. Pillenger when you came in. I warned you last night I should consider it my duty to acquaint Lucy with the details of - my - very painful discovery but I find she has gone out for a walk - at least so I imagine. Well - Audley - Audley Well, Audley, the painful discovery I allude to was this. After returning home last night I had occasion to visit the kitchen in order to speak to Cook for a moment. While doing so, I heard a mysterious noise. I investigated its origin, and found Captain Dorvaston concealed in the broom cupboard. He was unable to give me any lucid explanation. I now leave the matter in your hands.
#DOROTHY.
I don't know whether it's much good me saying anything - is it, sir?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I think otherwise. I shall be very happy to hear anything you care to tell me. Appearances are often misleading.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
But, Audley, surely -
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Hannah, the matter has now been submitted to my judgment. I shall not approach it in a spirit of carping doubt. If our dear friend can give us his personal assurance that the whole thing was - a - little joke for instance - little joke!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
If he could tell us that in concealing himself in the - er - broom cupboard, he had an idea of jumping out suddenly and startling somebody by saying "Boo" - not you particularly - but Cook, or Keziah, or myself -
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
You? What should you be doing in the kitchen?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
No - that is so; but still, though I deprecate practical joking as a rule, I should consider the explanation as not being without a certain measure of antecedent plausibility.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
You appear to be putting words into Captain Dorvaston's mouth.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
No, pardon me, I merely say that such a line of defence would carry conviction to an unbiased mind. The army is proverbially a light - hearted profession.
#DOROTHY.
Well, sir, I'm afraid I can't exactly say that.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
There!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
In any case, Hannah, our friend Dorvaston is Lucy's responsibility.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
At all events, Cook is yours!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Eh? Hum - yes -
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
You will of course ring the bell and discharge her.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I - really think we should endeavour to avoid any -
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Her continued presence in the house would be an insult to me.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
To avoid any appearance of temper - do you hear me, Hannah? - of temper.
#DOROTHY.
Upon my soul, ma'am, Cook hadn't anything to do with it. I was there against her wish.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Surely that is a most convincing testimony.
#DOROTHY.
I know last night things didn't look quite square, but whatever fault there was, was my fault.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Precisely! No doubt!
#DOROTHY.
I was chatting to Cook - it was a stoopid thing to do - but there was no harm in it.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
None whatever, I feel sure.
#DOROTHY.
In fact, the governor knows there wasn't!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
How should my brother know?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Hum! - tut - tut!
#DOROTHY.
How! Why, because he was in the lar -
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I was sure to take a broad - minded view. Doubtless that is our friend's meaning.
#DOROTHY.
Yes, that is what I meant. It got late, and I heard you coming, ma'am, and I knew you're a bit strict, don't you know!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Quite so!
#DOROTHY.
And as I was supposed to be seedy, I thought you'd take my being there the wrong way, don't you see? So I - nipped into the broom cupboard, don't you understand?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
To a moderately impartial intelligence the whole thing is as clear as day, and really reflects discredit on no one.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Is it your intention to say nothing to Cook on the subject?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I think we should give her to understand that careful investigation has tended to modify our original misconception of the true facts of the case.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Then, Audley, I have this to say -
#GANDY.
I've just found a gent in the dry ditch at the end of the garden.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
A gent in the ditch! What gent? - er - gentleman?
#GANDY.
'E was asleep and I shook 'im - 'e grunted, and I shook 'im again. 'E says his name's Crayll, and 'e'd like to see you.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Crayll! That is the person who called on you yesterday?
#DOROTHY.
Yes, I know him.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
He wished to see me?
#GANDY.
'E said so.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Show him in. Surely a most singular circumstance! Why did he go to sleep in my ditch?
#DOROTHY.
I suppose, as he's an acquaintance of mine, he thought you wouldn't object.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
He must be very eccentric.
#DOROTHY.
Yes, he's a rum sort of chap!
#GANDY.
Mr. Crayll!
#CRAYLL.
Good mornin'!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Good morning!
#CRAYLL.
How are you?
#DOROTHY.
How are you?
#CRAYLL.
Think I'll sit down. Feel rather shaky.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
By all means. My sister!
#CRAYLL.
Oh!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
But, my dear sir, I understand you passed the night - or some portion of it - in er - the ditch?
#CRAYLL.
'Pears I did.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
But - how did you get there?
#CRAYLL.
How the devil should I know?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut, tut!
#CRAYLL.
I must have bin sprung last night, that's about the size of it. I seem to recollect somebody pickin' me up, and then chuckin' me down again, like a sack of coals. It wasn't you, was it?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Certainly not! But you seem to be shivering. May I offer you anything?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
A hot cup of tea?
#CRAYLL.
Tea be damned!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut!
#CRAYLL.
No, I should like a hair of the dog that bit me.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Bitten by a dog! Good Heavens! My dear sir, the place should be cauterised at once - no time should be lost!
#CRAYLL.
Oh, don't be such an ass! I mean whiskey. What's that on your face? What is it? What's that filthy black thing crawling over your face?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I - er - you probably -
#CRAYLL.
What is it? Why the devil don't you tell me what it is? slight accident in shaving. My razor is somewhat out of condition - merely sticking plaster.
#CRAYLL.
Oh! Thought it was a spider. I want to talk to you.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Yes.
#CRAYLL.
Want to say a word or two about your Cook.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Indeed!
#CRAYLL.
I s'pose you didn't know much about her when you took her. Did you?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
No.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Hannah, permit me! In answer to your inquiry, I may say we obtained the highest testimonials from the Duchess of Sturton.
#CRAYLL.
Oh yes, that's all right - they're pals. Did she tell you your Cook was married.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Married?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Hannah! Hannah! No, sir, she did not.
#CRAYLL.
Well she is. Did she say she was a well - known society woman, who wasn't living with her husband?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Good gracious!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Her Grace did not mention the fact - if it is a fact.
#CRAYLL.
It is - you may lay your shirt on it. That ain't quite the sort of party you want in your kitchen, is it? Now I happen to know the husband'd be willin' to overlook the past - and take her back again -
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Er - really?
#CRAYLL.
He's a good - natured beggar, and he don't bear malice. He put it to her, but she's an obstinate devil - she didn't listen to reason. Now it struck me that as you're a magpie -
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Tut! magpie?
#CRAYLL.
Beg pardon - I mean as you're a parson, with your eye on the marriage service - "Those who Heaven joined" and all that kind of thing - you might see your way to chuckin' her out, neck and crop, without a character - D'you see? - and so bring her to a sense of dooty.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Really, Audley, there is something to be said for this gentleman's suggestion.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Whatever course it may ultimately be desirable for me to adopt, I shall require more definite information than I at present possess as to the intentions and - er - general identity - of the alleged husband.
#CRAYLL.
You can have it. I'm her husband.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
You!
#CRAYLL.
Yes, you ask her; she'll admit she's been married all right.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I'll ring for her at once.
#CRAYLL.
Hold hard! Stop that, old woman! I don't want to see her - there wouldn't be any good in that - the meeting would be painful all round. No! you do what I say - tell her to pack up her traps and go - and then my arms will be open to her. Good mornin'!
#DOROTHY.
You're not leaving us?
#CRAYLL.
Yes, I am!
#DOROTHY.
I think not!
#CRAYLL.
What d'you mean? I suppose I can go when I like?
#DOROTHY.
You will go when I like; and before you do, you've got to face the lady you've just been trying to injure. Sit down there and don't move, or I shall hurt you! Sit down! Now I'm going to ring the bell, and Mr. Pillenger will send for Mrs. Crayll; but if you try to get away, I shall probably hurt you rather badly. Do you follow me?
#CRAYLL.
Yes.
#DOROTHY.
That's all right. Sorry to take the business out of your hands, sir, but we've got to see it through, don't you know?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I think it would undoubtedly be desirable. Will you ask Mrs. - er - I mean - er - kindly inform Cook we should like to speak to her. Er - wonderful how the - eh - fine weather lasts!
#CAROLINE.
You have something to say to me?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Yes, we have.
#CAROLINE.
That is fortunate, because I have something to say to you.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Hannah, you will greatly oblige me by remaining silent. We wished, Cook -
#CAROLINE.
Pardon me, Mr. Pillenger, I have no longer any claim to that title - I beg to hand in my resignation.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
You contemplate leaving us?
#CAROLINE.
Yes. I've sent for a fly.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Audley, since this lady objects to be referred to as Cook, I think you should address her by her name - her real name.
#CAROLINE.
I doubt if you know it.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
We are better informed than you imagine, Mrs. Crayll!
#CAROLINE.
Oh, that's it!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
My dear madam, pray believe the - er - somewhat startling information came to us unsought. Our informant was that gentleman.
#CAROLINE.
What gentleman?
#DOROTHY.
You can stand up now.
#CAROLINE.
I see! Well, what has he told you?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
This gentleman came here this morning to beg us -
#CAROLINE.
To turn me out?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Be that as it may, he is anxious to make an appeal to his, I fear, misguided wife.
#CAROLINE.
Is he indeed?
#CRAYLL.
I've been tellin' 'em I want you to come back - man can't say more, can he?
#CAROLINE.
What else did he tell you?
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
He mentioned you were a well - known woman in society - and that you had been living apart from your husband.
#CAROLINE.
Quite so! Was that all he said?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
I think that embraced the whole of Mr. Crayll's statement.
#CAROLINE.
Up to a certain point he told the truth. I did marry him some years ago.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
You concealed the fact when you entered our service.
#CAROLINE.
It wasn't a thing I felt inclined to boast of. As he was so confidential, it seems odd he forgot to tell you we were recently divorced.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Divorced!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Divorced!
#CAROLINE.
There is one other thing - I think it is only fair you should know what a distinguished individual you have been entertaining in the person of Mr. Crayll.
#CRAYLL.
Keep your infernal tongue between your teeth!
#CAROLINE.
This gentleman -
#CRAYLL.
I shan't stay here to be baited - and badgered.
#DOROTHY.
You'll stay where you are!
#CAROLINE.
This gentleman is Lord Huntworth, I am - I was Lady Huntworth. Last night Lord Huntworth dropped in the kitchen a letter. It was from a firm of solicitors.
#CRAYLL.
Damn!
#CAROLINE.
Telling him I had inherited a large sum of money. Lord Huntworth is rather hard up just now. There is nothing unusual in the circumstance, but I mention it because it explains the reason of his generous offer to condone the past. Here is your letter; you needn't trouble to answer it - I shall call on Messrs. Brampton and Stokes in the course of the day. I don't think we need detain you any longer, need we?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Is it actually the case that you are the Lady Huntworth?
#CAROLINE.
Yes, I am the Lady Huntworth who is so widely and so very unfavourably known. Would you oblige me by ringing the bell, Captain Dorvaston?
#DOROTHY.
Certainly?
#CAROLINE.
If I thought there was even a chance that you could understand my doing what I have done I would try to make it clear to you, but you couldn't - I should only waste your time and my own. Gandy, has the fly come?
#GANDY.
It 'as.
#CAROLINE.
Thanks! Good - bye! We've been good friends, haven't we?
#GANDY.
We 'ave; servin' with you 'as bin a honour.
#CAROLINE.
Mr. Pillenger - You have done everything in your power to render my little experiment a pleasant one. I am grateful; and if your thoughts should ever turn in my direction I hope you will let your mind dwell on the excellence of my curried chicken, rather than on the supposed hopelessness of my moral character. Good - bye.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Good - bye!
#CAROLINE.
We have already taken leave of each other, but it has occurred to me that perhaps you might care to let me hear from you. I am leaving England for some time, but that address will find me. Poste Restante, Brussels.
#DOROTHY.
Poste Restante, Brussels.
#CAROLINE.
Yes. Good - bye!
#DOROTHY.
Good - bye!
#GANDY.
"Standard!" "Church Times!" "Sportin' Life!" 'Ow about dinner?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Eh?
#DOROTHY.
What?
#GANDY.
'Ow about dinner?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Don't dare allude to it.
#DOROTHY.
Get out of the room!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Good - morning, everybody!
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Good morning!
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Good morning!
#DOROTHY.
Good morning!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
I've brought Mr. Thorsby with me.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
Good day, Mr. Thorsby!
#DOROTHY.
Ah, Thorsby!
#DOROTHY.
How are you, Thorsby?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
We've just been married.

} mantel and sits on settle looking out trains)
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Uncle, it wasn't Harry's doing, so if you feel riled you must pitch into me. I'm responsible. Harry hated the deception all through - didn't you?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
All right, don't interrupt. We started early, biked over to Ingledene Church - did the trick - rode back, and we want everybody's blessing, and a good breakfast.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
As you are practically independent of my control I fear I have no power to withhold the blessing. The good breakfast may be less easily obtained.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Why?
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Cook has left us?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Oh! I'm sorry! She got up early, and made us some coffee,
#DOROTHY.
Then she knew?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Of course she did! I told her.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
She would naturally take a prominent part in any duplicity.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
That's all rot. She was a real good sort - a long way better than most of us Jack, old boy!
#DOROTHY.
Yes, little woman?
#LUCY PILLENGER.
You're the only one that matters. I cared for Harry - and you didn't care for me - did you? Tell me you didn't, or I shall hate myself. You'd have married me and tried to look pleasant, but it would have taken you all your time. Now, Jack, I want to hear you take your oath you don't mind.
#DOROTHY.
Mind! My dear child, you don't know what a turn you've done me by throwing me over for a better man. Mind? My dear Thorsby, I wish you all the luck you could wish yourself - and you'll get it! A chap who could carry out a thing of this kind in such an exceptional way has all the makings of a future bishop. Pack my things at once; I must catch the 11:15 to town.
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Going to leave us?
#DOROTHY.
I must, little woman - but I won't forget to send you a wedding present - silver mug - no, that's later! Good - bye, sir. Keep your head up and your liver active.
#AUDLY PILLENGER.
Good - bye!
#DOROTHY.
Good - bye, ma'am. I mean to be quite respectable by the time we meet again.
#HANNAH PILLENGER.
I hope so.
#DOROTHY.
Good - bye, young fellah! Give that little filly her head, and she won't want the whip. Good - bye, little woman! God bless you!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Good - bye, dear old boy! You'll let us hear from you?
#DOROTHY.
Yes!
#LUCY PILLENGER.
Where will a letter find you?
#DOROTHY.
Poste Restante, Brussels!
