#MR. CAMPBELL.
Well, I must say it seems pleasant to be home again, once more. After travelling two years through foreign countries, it is really refreshing to reach one’s native land. But I wonder where Maria and her husband are? They will be somewhat surprised to see me here a month earlier than they expected. Fortunately, through all my travels I have kept my latch - key, and was able to gain an entrance without the aid of a servant. However, now that I am here, I feel impatient to see Maria and Arthur. I think I will ring.
#MR. CROWELL.
Are Mr. and Mrs. Lewis at home?
#THE MAID-SERVANT.
No, sir, the family are all away at a party. You are Mrs. Lewis’s brother, I suppose?
#MR. CROWELL.
Yes. Did she expect me to - night?
#SERVANT.
Yes, and she bade me say they were sorry to be obliged to be away. But they wished you to make yourself comfortable. Here is the evening paper, sir. As they will not be home till late, I will conduct you to your room when you wish to retire.
#MR. CROWELL.
There’s no occasion for that. I remember my old room very well. I will read a while before I go to bed. I may possibly sit up till they come home. At all events, I shall not need any further service from you. Well, I must say I’m mystified. In the first place, I don’t see how Maria heard I should arrive to - day. In the second place, when I asked if Mr. and Mrs. Lewis were at home, the servant said all the family were away. Now people don’t use such an expression as that when the family consists of only two members. I wonder whether they have company? I wish I might meet my sister Eliza here. But I won’t trouble myself with needless conjectures. I shall learn all about the matter in the morning. I believe I’ll put on my slippers. I wonder what the news is. In fact, it will be all news to me. Ah! here’s the announcement of the arrival of the Rosamond. But if Maria had seen it she wouldn’t have supposed that I was a passenger. How could she have heard of my arrival? That is a mystery to me. Why, bless me, I nearly lost myself! I feel very sleepy. No wonder—it is nearly half - past eleven o’clock. I think I will go to bed.
#MR. CROWELL.
It seems Maria has entirely refurnished this chamber. I can hardly recognize the room I have occupied so many times. But I am too sleepy to take much account of surroundings. If the bed is only comfortable, I shall not take much notice of anything else.
#AUNT RACHEL.
What senseless people one meets at a party, to be sure!
#MR. CROWELL.
Who the deuce is this?
#AUNT REBECCA.
There was that Fitznoodle, the puppy, trying to make himself agreeable to our little Agnes. To be sure, she’s old enough to have a beau, but I hope to goodness she won’t marry him. I wouldn’t if he was worth his weight in gold.
#MR. CROWELL.
What a fate it would be for a man to marry such a woman as that! Though, for that matter, there won’t be much left of her, if she keeps on. She’s got her head most taken to pieces, already.
#AUNT REBECCA.
Where did that other lamp come from? I know it wasn’t here when I dressed for the party. Oh, there’s a man in the room, I know there is! I shall faint. If I only dared to go and look! Oh! oh! oh!
#MR. CROWELL.
Don’t be so foolish, madam. I assure you it is all a mistake.
#AUNT REBECCA.
That’s what they always say. Emmeline! James! Help! Murder! Thieves!
#MR. CROWELL.
Well, I must say, that’s rather curious. The mystery thickens. Pray who could that female be? I’m sure it’s no one that I ever saw before. Perhaps she’s left a handkerchief with her name written on it. I guess I’ll reconnoitre a little, as she has left me a light. Here is part of her make - up. But there’s no name on it. In fact, there is nothing to give any clue to the mystery. But there’s one thing I can do. I’ll fasten the door so that I shall not be interrupted again. Now I believe I will retire once more, and see if I cannot get a little rest. And for fear I may be routed again, I will leave the light burning.
#MRS. LEWIS.
How glad I am to get home again! I feel very tired.
#PHILIP.
I don’t feel tired a bit. I wanted to stop longer. Didn’t you, Agnes?
#AGNES.
I had a nice time, and enjoyed myself very much. I don’t suppose I should seriously have objected to stopping longer. Do you know, Phil, I made a good many new acquaintances this evening?
#PHILIP.
Yes, you seemed to be having a splendid time, talking with Fitznoodle. I can’t say I admire your taste.
#MRS. FADD.
Oh, as for that, I don’t fancy him much, myself, but you know one must be civil, even if they don’t like those they are talking with.
#AUNT REBECCA.
Oh, murder! Help! Thieves!
#MRS. LEMMY.
What is it, Rachel?
#AUNT REBECCA.
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
#MRS. LEMMY.
Why, Rachel, what is the matter?
#MRS. FADD.
Do tell us, Aunt Rachel.
#PHILIP.
I’ll protect you, Aunt Rachel. Where’s the robber?
#AUNT REBECCA.
Oh, there’s a man in my room—and he spoke to me. What shall I do? Oh! oh! man in your room! It can’t be. How could he get in with the doors all locked?
#AUNT REBECCA.
I tell you there is a man there. Don’t you believe me? He spoke to me too.
#PHILIP.
What did he say, Aunt Rachel?
#AUNT REBECCA.
I’m sure I don’t know. I didn’t wait to hear.
#MR. LEWIS.
Pray what is the matter? You all look frightened.
#MRS. LEMMY.
And well we may. There’s a man in Rachel’s room.
#MR. LEWIS.
That’s all imagination. It is simply impossible that any one could get in, under the circumstances.
#AUNT REBECCA.
What! Do you mean to insinuate that I don’t know what I’m talking about? I guess I haven’t lost the use of any of my faculties yet. And I saw him with my own eyes.
#MR. LEWIS.
Don’t get disturbed, Rachel. We can easily learn whether there is any one there or not. I will go myself and see.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Don’t go, Alfred. If there is a man there, of course he is armed. What could you do to protect yourself against the assault of a desperate man, and one well armed too? Take my advice and call a policeman.
#MR. LEWIS.
Well, perhaps that would be a better way.
#MRS. LEMMY.
But what shall we do? We can’t be left alone. He might murder us all and escape before you got back.
#MR. LEWIS.
That is true.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Why can’t we arm ourselves, and all go, in a body? There wouldn’t be much chance for him to escape, and we could, all together, overpower him.
#MR. LEWIS.
Very well. I’ll take the carving - knife.
#MRS. LEMMY.
I’ll take the poker.
#PHILIP.
I’ll take the tongs.
#AUNT REBECCA.
I’ll take the broom, and use it well, too.
#MRS. FADD.
I’ll get the clothes - line to tie him with.
#MR. CROWELL.
What’s to pay now, I wonder? I believe I shall have more adventures in this one night than I met with all the time I was abroad. Halloo there! Don’t break the door down. What’s wanted?
#MR. LEWIS.
Open this door at once, in the name of the law.
#MR. CROWELL.
Well, well, wait a minute.
#MR. LEWIS.
Well, sir, what do you mean by entering my house at night, and frightening this lady in such a manner?
#MR. CROWELL.
I think I can explain it satisfactorily, sir; but I must first ask a few questions. Is your name Lewis?
#MR. LEWIS.
It is.
#MR. CROWELL.
How long have you occupied this house?
#MR. LEWIS.
About a month.
#MR. CROWELL.
What was the name of the former occupant?
#MR. LEWIS.
His name was Lewis, also. I bought the house of him.
#MR. CROWELL.
My name is Campbell. I am a brother of the other Mrs. Lewis. I have been travelling abroad for the last two years, and arrived here late last evening. Having a latch - key, and being ignorant of the change of owners, I entered, but was disappointed at not finding any one at home. The servant said the family were away at a party, and offered to conduct me to my room when I was ready to retire. She said Mrs. Lewis was expecting her brother.
#MRS. LEMMY.
I was expecting him, but he didn’t come.
#MR. CROWELL.
Under these circumstances, and misled by the name, I had no suspicion that I was trespassing. I therefore told the servant I could easily find the way to my room, as I had slept there many times before. I must apologize to this lady for giving her such a fright, which I assure her was entirely unintentional on my part.
#MR. LEWIS.
Your explanation is perfectly satisfactory, sir. Mr. Arthur Lewis lives three blocks farther down - town. But it is late, and you must be our guest for the remainder of the night. We will furnish you with another bed, and——
#AUNT REBECCA.
Do you suppose I would sleep in that bed after a man had slept there? Never! Let him stay here the rest of the night, if he wants to. I shall sleep in the other chamber myself.
#PHILIP.
That’s it, Aunt Rachel. Stand up for your rights.
#MRS. LEMMY.
Very well, let it be arranged so. And we’d better all retire, for it is already an hour past midnight.
#MR. CROWELL.
I thank you all for your hospitality, and hope in the morning to be able to vindicate my character more fully.
#MR. LEWIS.
That is quite unnecessary. Your statement is entirely satisfactory.
#PHILIP.
Hadn’t you better take your braids and curls and things, Aunt Rachel? Mr. Campbell won’t have any use for them, and you look better with them on than you do without.
#AUNT REBECCA.
I didn’t expect, when I put this cap on, to receive callers.
#MR. CROWELL.
You are very excusable, under the circumstances.
#AUNT REBECCA.
Then I will bid you good - night.
#PHILIP.
Good morning.
