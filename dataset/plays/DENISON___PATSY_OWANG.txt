#MRS. FACILE.
Well, Dr. Fluke, I shant take the responsibility of having a Chinaman in the house.
#DR. FLUKE.
My dear, don’t be absurd! There’s no responsibility in the case. Out in California, you know, people are charmed with Chinese cooks. Why, your sister couldn’t be induced to part with Weak Lung.
#MRS. FACILE.
Maria always was eccentric.
#DR. FLUKE.
But you know, darling, we have tried everything but the Chinese—Irish, Swede, German, French, African, Yankee—that’s so as we haven’t had any Hindoos yet nor Cannibal Islanders.
#MRS. FACILE.
Dear me! It makes me weary to think of it. Why can’t we get along with Norah?
#DR. FLUKE.
Or transform Mike into a cook.
#MRS. FACILE.
Now you are absurd, Henry. I’ll wash my hands of the whole affair.
#DR. FLUKE.
My dear, that is just what I wanted you to say.
#MRS. FACILE.
Indeed, then you needn’t have asked my opinion at all.
#DR. FLUKE.
I am sure this Patsy O’Wang is a treasure.
#MRS. FACILE.
Patsy O’Wang! Patsy doesn’t sound very Chinese.
#DR. FLUKE.
But he has a history.
#MRS. FACILE.
Oh indeed! That’s rather a doubtful accomplishment for a cook.
#DR. FLUKE.
Quite the contrary! Harriet, I tell you that I’ve found a treasure. Let me read you what Major Barker says in his letter recommending Chin Sum.
#MRS. FACILE.
Chin Sum! I thought you said his name was—what barbarous name did you say?
#DR. FLUKE.
Patsy O’Wang! but that’s only a nick - name. The Chinese of it is Chin Sum. Now Chin is the son of a wild Irish officer in the tenth Artillery stationed formerly at Hong Kong. His mother was a pretty Chinese girl.
#MRS. FACILE.
Well, did you ever!
#DR. FLUKE.
My dear, I admit that there is a slight flaw in his pedigree. But let me skip all that. Major Barker speaks of him in the most extravagant terms—: “The best cook I ever saw,” “the most obedient servant,” “the most affectionate creature”; isn’t that enough?
#MRS. FACILE.
I suppose so since apparently it is all settled.
#DR. FLUKE.
There’s more.
#MRS. FACILE.
Never mind, skip it.
#DR. FLUKE.
Eh, what’s this? “Never under any circumstances let him taste a drop of whiskey.”
#MRS. FACILE.
Humph, then you’ll have to keep him and Mike apart.
#DR. FLUKE.
Really that is surprising.
#MRS. FACILE.
What’s surprising?
#DR. FLUKE.
Nothing, my dear “The remedy is”—
#NORAH.
If you plaze, sor, the Chinee cook has come.
#DR. FLUKE.
All right, Norah, show him his room and then take him to the kitchen. My dear will you install him?
#MRS. FACILE.
No indeed! You may do that, Henry, till he gets a start. Decidedly I feel nervous with a Chinaman in the kitchen. Who knows but he may poison us all.
#NORAH.
If you plaze, Mrs. Fluke, Miss Simper’s at the dure.
#MRS. FACILE.
Show her in, Norah, at once. Now she will be trying to convert him.
#MRS. FACILE.
I’m delighted to see you, Miss Simper.
#MISS STOKES.
Thank you! I just run in for a minute. Good morning, Dr. Fluke.
#DR. FLUKE.
Good morning, Miss Simper. How charming you look. That tonic benefited you greatly. Shall I change the prescription?
#MISS STOKES.
No, thank you, I have come to - day in the interest of the missionary cause.
#MRS. FACILE.
Wont you step back into the parlor where we can talk at leisure?
#MISS STOKES.
Oh no, I’m in a dreadful hurry. The African Argonauts meet at eleven and I preside. We start our first worker to Ashantee to - morrow. At 4 p. m. the Mongolian Mediators have a meeting and at 8 p. m. is the debate in which we shall answer the Cannibal Calumniators.
#DR. FLUKE.
You are a very busy bee, Miss Simper.
#MISS STOKES.
No, I’ve resigned from the Busy Bees; concentrating you see. They say you have a new Chinese cook, Mrs. Fluke.
#MRS. FACILE.
Not I. He’s the doctor’s importation. Talk to him.
#MISS STOKES.
Oh doctor, tell me all about him. My heart bleeds for the millions of Asia who sit in outer darkness.
#DR. FLUKE.
My dear Miss Simper, he is a gold nugget; he will be a capital acquisition in your mission school, so intelligent, so docile, so affectionate, so—so—
#MISS STOKES.
Just so. Oh, I’m perfectly delighted. Doctor, does he—ah—has he doffed the Chinese garb yet and donned the raiment of civilization?
#DR. FLUKE.
Blessed if I know. I’ll call him in and introduce him at once.
#MISS STOKES.
Do so. I was just going to ask that very favor. I’m sure he will agreeably surprise us all.
#DR. FLUKE.
He will. Bring Chin Sum here.
#MRS. FACILE.
I hope the wretch doesn’t smoke opium.
#DR. FLUKE.
Harriet, don’t expose your ignorance. That is done in joints.
#MRS. FACILE.
What kind of joints?
#DR. FLUKE.
Blessed if I know, bamboo joints possibly. I hear the Chinese do most everything with bamboo except to fight Japan. They did that in their minds.
#DR. FLUKE.
Chin Sum, I want to introduce you to my wife; by the way, I think I will call you Patsy. Wife, our new servant Patsy O’Wang.
#PATSY.
Velly much glad see Missee Fluke.
#DR. FLUKE.
And this is Miss Simper, a mission young lady.
#PATSY.
Vellee nice mission gull
#MISS STOKES.
Mr. O’Wang, you’re so gallant. Promise me to come to Bible class next Sunday.
#PATSY.
Sooh thing!
#MISS STOKES.
How intelligent!
#PATSY.
Leadee all same Biblee in Flisco?
#MISS STOKES.
I don’t understand him.
#DR. FLUKE.
Yes, Patsy, they read the same Bible as they do in Frisco.
#PATSY.
Sing velly nice hymn - song all same day?
#DR. FLUKE.
Yes!
#PATSY.
Chin Sum make be school boy next Sunday all same day.
#DR. FLUKE.
Patients will be coming soon. Patsy, I’ll show you the kitchen and tell you what to prepare for dinner to - day, after that Mrs. Fluke—
#MRS. FACILE.
Oh dear!
#MISS STOKES.
How charming! So childlike!
#PATSY.
All samee lika big man - shile? No catchee what say.
#DR. FLUKE.
Patsy, go to the kitchen, I’ll be there in a minute.
#MRS. FACILE.
Here are the attendants getting the baths ready. Come into the house. It may be all right but I’m afraid.
#MISS STOKES.
What, afraid of Chin! I shall call him Chin, poor boy. I think those Chinese names perfectly lovely. So brief, so simple, so childlike. Chin! just think! so expressive.
#MRS. FACILE.
And those horrid stories of rats and opium.
#MISS STOKES.
I don’t believe a word of it.
#NORAH.
What do you think, Mike, of havin’ a Chinee cook in the house?
#MIKE.
Ah Norah, it’s an outrage, that’s the whole blissid truth. To think of a blackgyard haythen cookin’ for dacint people.
#NORAH.
It’s a disgrace, I’ll give notice, I will—
#MIKE.
I’ll not ate a bit o’ his dirthy cookin’, faith I’ll not.
#NORAH.
But what’ll ye do. Them that works must eat.
#MIKE.
O’im all right as long as free lunches hold out.
#NORAH.
Free lunches ye’d better let alone, Mike.
#MIKE.
Norah, it’s not the lunches that afficts me. It’s what goes with thim.
#NORAH.
Last time you know, Dr. Fluke said you’d have to leave if you got drunk again.
#MIKE.
It’s a bit o’ charity the doctor needs. Ivery mon has some wakeness.
#NORAH.
And woman is weak too, so just carry out that box of bottles for me, I’ll have to wash them here. The doctor has some of his truck in the laboratory.
#MIKE.
He’ll be blowin’ the whole place up yit with his dinnymite an’ farmacopy.
#NORAH.
Mike, ye’d better get ready for Mr. Boyler. He’ll be here pretty soon for his electricity and that Englishman will want his bawth.
#MIKE.
Faith it’s enough to try the patience of ould Job himself. Begob, Job never was docthor’s assistant. I regret I iver intered the midical profession. Ivery toime I look at ould Boyler he sez, Mike, ye’ve hurt me rheumatiz again.
#NORAH.
Mike, you are too strong, you must be careful.
#MIKE.
Faith I handle him just like a new born baby, or like the egg with the chick unborn. But the ould badger’s that tender I’m mortally afraid he’ll go all to pieces in the bath tub.
#NORAH.
Mr. Boyler complains to Doctor Fluke that you are too rough.
#MIKE.
Too rough, is it! Faith he’ll have to be packed in cotton nixt. The Docthor was after tellin’ me to stretch Boyler’s limbs gintly loike an’ I tuk hold av his arm with one hand and his shoulther with the other like this and pulled like this, sort o’ bracin’ mysilf loike with one fut forinst the tub. I’m a thafe if some jint or other didn’t snap like a pistol. I was so scared that I dropped the ould bundle in the wather hid over ears. I thought he was goin’ to exshplode right there in me hands.
#NORAH.
What did he say?
#MIKE.
I don’t know what he intinded to say. He sthrangled.
#NORAH.
Why, was he under the water so long as that?
#MIKE.
No, indade it wasn’t the wather. It was the strong language. He is that way sometimes when his emotions overcome him. When the ould sinner gets to swearin’, he can’t stop till he sthrangles. After that he’s very paceable for a shpell.
#NORAH.
But he’s awful good in spite of his rough ways. He gives you many a quarter.
#MIKE.
That he does and I couldn’t think more of an only child if I had wan nor an only father ayther for that matter. I’m prayin’ for him night an’ day. If he survives these baths and the alectricity an’ the drugs and the plasthers, it’ll be a great triumph of the midical profession. There he comes now, I hear his cane on the walk.
#BOYLER.
Good morning, Mike, good morning, Norah.
#MIKE.
Mornin’, sir. Begob, ye’re spry as a kitten this marnin’. I thought it was the milkman whin I heerd yez.
#BOYLER.
Mike, try to be careful to - day. You rubbed my right side yesterday till I think you started all my ribs.
#NORAH.
Do be gentle, Mike.
#MIKE.
I’ll be as tender—as tender as a shpring chicken. It’s alictricity, sor, to - day?
#BOYLER.
So it is, I forgot.
#MIKE.
The docthor said yez couldn’t stand another bath to - day. I mane ye’re improvin’ till yez don’t nade it.
#NORAH.
Such dirty bottles. The labels ain’t half soaked off and the half of them look greasy. Boyler groans: “Oh! Mike, that’s too strong.”
#NORAH.
Poor man, I wonder if it does him any good?
#PATSY.
Ilish gal! Monnin’, Nolee.
#NORAH.
What’s that?
#PATSY.
All samee nice day.
#NORAH.
Go back with yez to the kitchen.
#PATSY.
Chin Sum want see.
#MIKE.
Yez want to see? All right ye shall see. That is the Docthor’s private consultification room. Nobody but himself and patients and mimbers of the profession like mesilf go in there. Back there is the operating room. Whin yez git hurted that’s where they saw yer leg off.
#PATSY.
What time saw leg?
#MIKE.
Ony toime.
#PATSY.
Who leg?
#MIKE.
Begob, onbody’s if they can pay for the job.
#MIKE.
Comin’, sor.
#PATSY.
What machine? All samee lope loun wheel.
#MIKE.
I’m thinkin’ it would take a Frinchman or a Dago to talk to the haythen.
#PATSY.
Lope loun wheel.
#MIKE.
He wants to turn a bit. Begob, yez may turn awhile.
#NORAH.
Be careful, Mike. The doctor wouldn’t like it.
#MIKE.
Turn aisy loike. It’s great shport.
#NORAH.
Doctor wouldn’t like your letting that Chinee boy meddle here.
#MIKE.
I’ve a bit of an arrant. He may turn till I get back.
#NORAH.
Worry now! These be a bad lot of bottles. There, I’ve broken one. screams in pain, “stop, you scoundrel!”)
#NORAH.
Oh dear, there they go. I knew there would be trouble. “Mike, Mike, come quick. Where is the doctor? He ought to be here.”
#BOYLER.
You Mongolian idiot. Where is that rascally Irishman? John, you are a fool.
#PATSY.
My name not John. Name in Chinee Chin Sum. Melican name Patsy O’Wang.
#BOYLER.
Stop your chatter, you mummy, you saffron colored rat catcher! Where is that rascal of a Mike? When I get well it’ll be a bad day for him. I’ll murder that man yet. How my nerves thrill, oh! oh! The liniment! No attendance here. I’ll sue Fluke for damages. Here, you moon - faced Mongolian monkey! What are you grinning at? Do you see that bottle of liniment?
#PATSY.
Heap bottle, one time, whichee?
#BOYLER.
That one! bring it in and rub me. I’m on fire.
#PATSY.
Melican man hot like old boy; all bun up.
#BOYLER.
I’ll die in this infernal torture chamber. Bring the bottle!
#PATSY.
Um! Hong Kong blandy! make toddy likee time in Hong Kong. Dlink heap toddy. Um! velly good.
#BOYLER.
Hurry up, you! What on earth are you doing?
#PATSY.
bottle.
#MIKE.
Put that down, ye haythen!
#PATSY.
Ilishman dlunk!
#NORAH.
Do ye hear that, Mike? That Chinaman’s goin’ to ruin the place! Oh, do stop him.
#MIKE.
Let the haythen airn his wages.
#NORAH.
Oh Mike, do stop him. He’ll kill Mr. Boyler.
#MIKE.
Faith, that’s nothin’. That’s the way the ould badger goes on ivery day if I only touch a bit av a sore spot. A good shakin’ up’ll benefit him greatly. I think he’ll be ready nixt for the bat’s liver oil.
#NORAH.
Merciful powers! Did ye say bat’s liver oil?
#MIKE.
Bat’s liver oil, I said. Hould on there, Patsy! The docthor and meself have institooted a regular coorse “Mike, where are you?” Here, sor. First comes the hot bath at noinety noine degrays Farenhot, followed by pullin’ the limbs, on the injy rubber plan. Nixt is the alictricity an’ liniment; thin comes the bat’s liver oil.
#NORAH.
An’ what will be next?
#MIKE.
That’s a saycret like the Kaly cure.
#NORAH.
Tell me wont you Mike?
#MIKE.
Yis, if yez wont tell onybody. Sand paper!
#NORAH.
Go ’long with yez.
#BOYLER.
Murder! Oh! oh! You infernal scoundrel.
#BOYLER.
getting out of chair. PATSY comes out flying with B. after him. They come down C. B. strikes PATSY with cane. PATSY grabs at cane and pulls wig off. Runs with it into office, R., and closes door as B. throws cane after him.)
#MIKE.
Thank God he’s cured! He’s throwed away the cane. Aisy sor, aisy, ye’re all right now.
#BOYLER.
You villain! My leg is on fire.
#MIKE.
I belave it, sor. It’s a very lively leg, Mr. Boyler.
#BOYLER.
Oh, you—you—
#MIKE.
Aisy sor, careful sor. Wont ye step into the office and write a bit of a tistimonial for the inshtitootion?
#NORAH.
Oh dear, we’re all ruined. He’ll tell the Doctor.
#MIKE.
Whist, he’s stranglin’ now. It is the profanity. He’s often took that way.
#NORAH.
Where is the Doctor. Everything’s going to ruin.
#MIKE.
That haythen is gettin’ gay. I’ll tache him a lesson he won’t forget soon. I’ll tache him to stay in the kitchen.
#BOYLER.
I’ll have you arrested, you villain, for malpractice.
#MIKE.
Malpractice! What sort o’ practice is that?
#BOYLER.
You are a pair of knaves.
#MIKE.
What a wonderful cure. Beautiful! I’ll just kape this stick as a tistimonial.
#BOYLER.
None of your insolence. I’ll sue Doctor Fluke for damages, and as for you and that Chinaman, I’ll have you put in jail. beautiful cure, sor. Ye walk as straight as—as straight—as the moral law. Ye’d make an illegant drum - major.
#BOYLER.
Drum - major!
#MIKE.
Wont yez take yer hat, sor? Now I’ll just settle with John Chinaman, bad cess to him.
#PATSY.
Whoopee! Feel good! Allee same day feel bully!
#MIKE.
Faith I think he’s possissed!
#MIKE.
The divil’s in him. I’d betther call the docthor.
#PATSY.
It’s a bad head I have! Where am I? What am I? Now I have it. I’m an Irishman again. Is this Hong Kong? No, this is America. A doctor’s shop! I was this way once before in Hong Kong when I got drunk in the barracks. Whiskey brings out the Irish in me. But they put me back. What did they give me? I can’t remember. My head’s all confused. Well, I wont be a Chinaman. I wont take a blessed drop of anything but poteen. I’ll get rid of this Chinese dress. I hate it. Just the thing! Not so bad! Old coat, I’m done with you, too. Not so bad a fit, though a bit too long in the tails. Well now, aint I good enough Irish for New York or Chicago or Cork ayther? Look at the bloody shoes. Off with ye. Cow leather’s good enough for me. Now me toilet is more to me likin’. Let that ould bear come back an’ the doctor and his man. I’ll thrash the whole crowd if they lay hands on me. patient? The doctor will soon be here. Have a seat, sir. Oh! Who are you?
#PATSY.
Don’t be alarmed, madam. I’m Patsy O’Wang. I’m the new—No, indeed, I’m not that.
#MRS. FACILE.
The new cook, and crazy! Oh dear, I knew there’d be trouble. Oh,
#PATSY.
I beg, madam, that you do not give yourself any uneasiness about the doctor. He’ll soon be here, I assure you.
#MRS. FACILE.
He seems harmless. I declare if he hasn’t a wig! And as I live the doctor’s coat on. A robber in disguise.
#PATSY.
Madam, you are not well. I beg you to be seated.
#MRS. FACILE.
He’s very polite, at any rate.
#PATSY.
There’s goes another! It’s not much confidence the new mistress has in me. They’re puttin’ a job up on me. What is it they gave me before? I’d give a thousand dollars if I could only think of it. runs into office R. and locks himself in.
#MRS. FACILE.
Doctor Fluke, I told you something would happen.
#DR. FLUKE.
Pshaw, nothing has happened. Mike let him have whiskey.
#MRS. FACILE.
I told you so. The very thing he shouldn’t have had.
#DR. FLUKE.
I’ll cure him quick enough, and Mike you are very careless.
#MIKE.
I’m very sorry, sor, but I didn’t let him have the whiskey. Do yez think I’d be wastin’ good liquor on a Chinaman?
#MRS. FACILE.
But he’s got it now and what will you do, I’d like to know?
#DR. FLUKE.
I’ll just give him the remedy spoken of by Major Barker.
#MRS. FACILE.
What is the remedy?
#DR. FLUKE.
Where is that letter? Here’s a go!
#MRS. FLUKE.
Have you lost the letter?
#DR. FLUKE.
It seems so. Oh, I have it!
#MRS. FACILE.
Read it then!
#DR. FLUKE.
I mean, I know where it is. I changed coats.
#MRS. FACILE.
And Patsy has the coat on!
#DR. FLUKE.
Well that is a situation!
#MRS. FACILE.
Now he’ll murder us all.
#DR. FLUKE.
Nonsense! Major Barker says he’s the most affectionate creature.
#MRS. FACILE.
Major Barker, fiddlesticks!
#MISS STOKES.
I am sure the major must be right. I do think the Chinese have such lovely dispositions.
#MRS. FACILE.
Miss Simper, you and the doctor fatigue me with such twaddle.
#DR. FLUKE.
Mike, suppose you go into the office and ask him for my coat.
#MIKE.
If you plaze, sor, I think my appearance excoites him a bit.
#MISS STOKES.
Oh, let me go.
#MRS. FACILE.
Miss Simper, are you out of your senses?
#DR. FLUKE.
I will go in.
#MRS. FACILE.
Henry, do you want to be murdered?
#DR. FLUKE.
Let me alone. “Patsy! Patsy!”
#MRS. FACILE.
Oh rash man! Henry, I know we’ll all be killed in our tracks.
#MISS STOKES.
Let me reason with him!
#MRS. FACILE.
Oh you silly goose. Do be quiet, wont you. What can he be doing? It’s as quiet as the grave. I’ll bet he’s taking poison in his desperation. Or hanging himself, may be.
#MIKE.
There’s a noice bit o’ rope on the pulley machine.
#MRS. FACILE.
We’ll all be killed yet, I know. Miss Simper, save yourself.
#DR. FLUKE.
Harriet, there isn’t the slightest danger.
#MRS. FACILE.
Dr. Fluke, why do you stand there like a post? Why don’t you send for the police before that Chinaman does anything desperate? He is crazy and so are you.
#DR. FLUKE.
Humph! He’s drunk!
#MRS. FACILE.
He’s crazy. Mike, run for the police.
#DR. FLUKE.
Mike, stay where you are, to assist me.
#MRS. FACILE.
What are you going to do, Henry?
#DR. FLUKE.
Going into that room. Let me alone. “Patsy!” “Say! Chin Sum!” “Sir.” Will you let me in? “No.” I don’t want to arrest you. I give you my word of honor. What? Yes, I’ll send them all out.
#MRS. FACILE.
Indeed, I wont go out and see you killed.
#DR. FLUKE.
Harriet, how could you see me killed if you went out. Yes, I’ll send them all. Mike go at once. Harriet, please go. He wont open the door till you all go. He is afraid we’ll take him to jail.
#MIKE.
Sarve him good and roight, I say.
#MRS. FACILE.
Yes he ought to be jailed for acting that way.
#DR. FLUKE.
Just hand my coat through the door, please.
#DR. FLUKE.
Now for the remedy! “Affectionate creature.”
#MRS. FACILE.
Stuff!
#DR. FLUKE.
Hum, “most confiding”—yes, it seems so. Oh, here it is.
#MRS. FACILE.
What is it?
#DR. FLUKE.
Harriet, why do you interrupt? Oh, here it is! “If he ever gets under the influence of liquor he labors under the strange delusion that he is an Irishman.”
#MRS. FACILE.
How absurd! He’s crazy, I’d call the police.
#DR. FLUKE.
My dear, will you allow me? This is a very curious case. “The remedy is tea, plenty of strong tea.” How very simple. I’ll give him enough tea to settle him in short order.
#NORAH.
What is it, sor? Is he still voilent?
#DR. FLUKE.
Peaceful as a lamb! He wants tea.
#NORAH.
Tay is it! Did yez iver—
#MRS. FACILE.
As well try a pinch of salt.
#DR. FLUKE.
Don’t stand there talking, Norah. Bring the tea at once. Plenty of it! Strong! Just throw about half a pound into the tin pot and fill it with hot water.
#NORAH.
The tin pot houlds a gallon, sor.
#DR. FLUKE.
Will you obey orders? Go! Run!
#MRS. FACILE.
Tea! The idea!
#DR. FLUKE.
This is a great case. I’ll write it up for the medical journals. A wonderful case—
#BOYLER.
All humbug, sir!
#DR. FLUKE.
What’s that? Oh, it’s you, Mr. Boyler.
#BOYLER.
At last I’ve found you out, Dr. Fluke!
#DR. FLUKE.
So it seems. Why bless me, if you aint cured. Walking without a cane!
#BOYLER.
Humbug! I said.
#DR. FLUKE.
But it’s a fact!
#BOYLER.
You can’t hoodwink me, sir. You’re a charlatan!
#DR. FLUKE.
Don’t be unreasonable!
#BOYLER.
Unreasonable! Oh, I can’t stand that. Gad, sir, you are actually laughing at my misfortunes. Do you call yourself a gentleman?
#DR. FLUKE.
Cut all that! What do you complain of? You are cured.
#BOYLER.
Confound your cure. You first maltreat me, outrage my feelings and then laugh at me.
#DR. FLUKE.
When has all this happened?
#BOYLER.
Every day for a month, Dr. Fluke. First you put a Hercules in the shape of a wild Irishman to rub me in the bath. He breaks every bone in my body by installments. Then he pummels me by degrees into a jelly.
#DR. FLUKE.
Well, what did you expect, Mr. Boyler? This isn’t a kindergarten, and your rheumatism was a very obstinate case.
#BOYLER.
Obstinate case! Let me say, sir, you are a butcher and that Irishman is an executioner. To crown the indignity you set a crazy Chinaman to give me the electrical treatment. He runs a stream of liquid fire through my leg.
#DR. FLUKE.
Which cured you completely!
#BOYLER.
Will you let me speak, sir? When I protest, the heathen doubles the quantity. Why gad, sir, it was something terrific. I saw the constellation of Orion in broad daylight.
#DR. FLUKE.
Ah, it is a fine machine! A beauty!
#BOYLER.
There you are wrong, for I smashed it to bits.
#DR. FLUKE.
What’s that you say? My fine machine ruined? I’ll have damages, Mr. Boyler.
#BOYLER.
Damages! I shall sue you for $10,000 damages.
#DR. FLUKE.
Do it, sir, do it! It’ll make my fortune. It will advertise the greatest cure of the age. Nothing like a law suit for advertising purposes. Wont you oblige me by breaking something else? Just upset those shelves, wont you? Throw my instrument case out of the window.
#BOYLER.
I’ll not do it. I wont gratify you. A gentleman can find other ways of avenging an insult. And then there’s my wig, too.
#DR. FLUKE.
Where?
#BOYLER.
Where? Do you doubt my word? Do you see that?
#DR. FLUKE.
I see the head - piece but I don’t see any wig.
#BOYLER.
No, sir, you don’t see any wig. Your crazy Chinaman snatched it off my head and exposed me to the indignity of going home barehead in the public street.
#DR. FLUKE.
You shouldn’t go out barehead, you may catch cold; I’ll not be responsible if you disobey orders.
#BOYLER.
And whose fault would it be?
#DR. FLUKE.
Yours, of course.
#BOYLER.
Why, hang your assurance, Dr. Fluke.
#DR. FLUKE.
I disapprove of your indiscretion.
#BOYLER.
Fluke, I don’t think I ever saw quite such monumental effrontery as yours. That wig cost me one hundred and fifty dollars, one of the very best make by the celebrated Toupee.
#DR. FLUKE.
Oh, we’ll not haggle about trifles. I’ll credit it on the bill for the electric machine. That cost five hundred dollars.
#BOYLER.
Credit it on the bill! That’s cool, why confound your insolence! I’ve a mind to cane you on the spot.
#DR. FLUKE.
But you can’t, you see. You have no cane. You are cured.
#BOYLER.
Oh, this man will put me crazy if I stay here much longer. You’ll hear from me again, Dr. Fluke. You are a quack. crackers. B. runs against her and sends things flying as he exits.
#NORAH.
Well, did yez iver see such a cyclone!
#MIKE.
Begorrah, it was lucky I was carryin’ the tay pot or there’d been a Noah’s flood o’ tay.
#NORAH.
Must I get more crame, Docthor?
#MIKE.
It’s aisy to pick that up with a spoon.
#DR. FLUKE.
Bother the cream. It’s the tea I want. Put the things on the table. Now I’ll get him to come out.
#MRS. FACILE.
Henry, do you think he’ll hurt you?
#MISS STOKES.
The idea! Poor abused thing!
#DR. FLUKE.
Clear out, you women. Do you want to frighten him?
#MRS. FACILE.
and MISS S.) Mike, go in the operating room to be ready for emergencies. Norah, you be ready to serve the tea. I’ll drink some to make believe. Be cool, don’t lose your head.
#NORAH.
Yis, sor, but I can’t guarantee to kape me head if that ould cyclone blows in again.
#DR. FLUKE.
Patsy, come out please. It’s nearly dinner time. What’s that? Yes, I’m all alone, that is, Norah is here, too.
#DR. FLUKE.
Why Patsy, are you cold? I feel decidedly too warm.
#PATSY.
I think I took a bit o’ cold in the cars, I’m subject to sore throat.
#NORAH.
Crazy as a June bug.
#DR. FLUKE.
Chin Sum, do you like tea?
#PATSY.
My name isn’t Chin Sum; just Patrick O’Wang, if you please.
#DR. FLUKE.
What is the O for, Patrick?
#PATSY.
The O shows that I’m a son of me father.
#DR. FLUKE.
We have tea served. Sometimes we take a light refreshment an hour or so before dinner. Patsy, do you like tea?
#PATSY.
Tea! I’m onto their scheme. I’ll take a drop, weak if you please, one lump of sugar.
#DR. FLUKE.
Norah, place a chair. Be seated, Patsy. You must be tired.
#PATSY.
Your honor I couldn’t sit in your presence.
#DR. FLUKE.
Very well, as you please. Norah, pour the tea. Give me a small cup. For a cold it should be drunk copiously. You had better take several cups, Patsy.
#PATSY.
Very well, sir, I like tea myself.
#DR. FLUKE.
How do you like the tea, Patsy?
#PATSY.
It’s capital tea, doctor.
#DR. FLUKE.
Norah, fill his cup. He wants several cups to break his cold. Then I’ll put you to bed, Patsy, and give you a good sweat.
#PATSY.
All right, sir.
#DR. FLUKE.
It’s working! Obedient already.
#NORAH.
Will yez have some more tay, docthor?
#DR. FLUKE.
No, fill Patsy’s cup. Don’t you see it’s empty. How do you feel now?
#PATSY.
Better already, doctor.
#DR. FLUKE.
Have another! There’s nothing like tea. Why, it will cure every ill that flesh is heir to. Norah, fill his cup.
#NORAH.
I’m pourin’ as fast as I can, sir. What a dale o’ tea he do hold.
#PATSY.
Very nice tea, Norah.
#NORAH.
I could do a dale betther with plenty o’ tay and more time.
#DR. FLUKE.
Norah, why don’t you fill his cup instead of talking. How do you feel now, Patsy?
#PATSY.
Much better, sir.
#DR. FLUKE.
Head clearer?
#PATSY.
Well, it’s not as thick as putty an’ it’s not as clear as a June mornin’.
#DR. FLUKE.
Try a few more cups, keep it up. Norah, don’t you see his cup is empty. Pour him another.
#NORAH.
The mon’ll explode purty soon a drinkin’. He’s swellin’ already.
#DR. FLUKE.
Hold your tongue. The charm’s working finely.
#NORAH.
Faith it’s time, the tay pot’s impty.
#DR. FLUKE.
Empty! Why girl it holds a gallon!
#NORAH.
An’ he’s drunk it all. The poor bye must have the stomach of an osterich or a dodo.
#DR. FLUKE.
Patsy, do you mean to say that you have drank a gallon of tea?
#PATSY.
Faith, I think it’s nearer a barrel.
#DR. FLUKE.
And how do you feel?
#PATSY.
Like an irrigation canal!
#MISS STOKES.
and MIKE gather round back of table, L.)
#MRS. FACILE.
Doctor Fluke, you’ll kill that man with your experiments.
#MISS STOKES.
Poor dear man!
#DR. FLUKE.
Silence, ladies. This is a most extraordinary case! A remarkable case. Why, I’ve hypnotized him.
#MIKE.
Begob, I think he’s paralyzed!
#MRS. FACILE.
What makes the horrid creature act so? He’s got a wild look.
#NORAH.
I think he’s drownin’, I do.
#DR. FLUKE.
Patsy, why don’t you speak, what ails you? bit o’ queerness here.
#DR. FLUKE.
How’s your head?
#PATSY.
Me head’s all right. It’s me stomach.
#DR. FLUKE.
Do you still imagine you are an Irishman?
#PATSY.
I am, sir, Irish to the bone.
#MRS. FACILE.
Says he’s Irish. He’s crazy, Henry. I told you so. He’ll murder us all.
#NORAH.
I give notice, Mrs. Fluke. I’ll not live in the house with a crazy mon.
#MIKE.
Nayther will I. I give up me job. It will be hurtin’ the profession to mix with loonytics an’ Chinese.
#DR. FLUKE.
Hold your tongue, Mike. This is a most extraordinary case!
#MIKE.
Indade it is! First he’s a haythen Chinee. Then he takes a drop too much an’ goes wild an’ pulls the clothes aff other people and says he’s an Irishman, bad luck to him. Another dram’ll turn him into a Dago, I belave. I quits to - day, doctor.
#DR. FLUKE.
Where is your pain, Patsy?
#PATSY.
Me stomach feels all queer like.
#DR. FLUKE.
And no wonder. Why, it’s hot as fire! And distended like a balloon!
#MIKE.
He’s dishtended!
#DR. FLUKE.
Mike, get the stomach pump in the office. Norah, a basin, quick!
#PATSY.
Faith, I’m on fire!
#DR. FLUKE.
We’ll fix you in a minute.
#PATSY.
Aye, doctor, you’ve fixed me already.
#DR. FLUKE.
Quick, Mike!
#PATSY.
You’ll never put that thing down my throat.
#MIKE.
By the powers, you’ve pulled the sthomick clane out av’ ’im. Is that what it looks like? I niver seed one before.
#MRS. FACILE.
Oh horrors!
#MIKE.
Hadn’t yez better put it back, docthor? He may nade it.
#DR. FLUKE.
What does this mean, you rascal?
#PATSY.
It means you can’t fill me up with tea and turn me back into a Chinaman. They did that trick in Hong Kong!
#DR. FLUKE.
What are you now? Irish or Chinese?
#PATSY.
Irish forever.
#MISS STOKES.
Dear me! I’m so disappointed. I did hope we had got a real Chinaman.
#DR. FLUKE.
But confound you man, I hired you for a Chinaman. A bargain’s a bargain.
#PATSY.
That bargain is off.
#MIKE.
Then I’m aff, too. Two Irishman in wan house is wan too many.
#PATSY.
Keep your place, Mike, I can do better. I’m in America now, the land of opportunities. I’m goin’ into politics. Me ambition is to be an alderman and die beloved and respected by all.
#MIKE.
Begorrah, the ambition of it!
#DR. FLUKE.
Very well, Patsy. Since you are going to have influence let us part friends.
#MIKE.
Inflooence! Faith, I’ll niver vote a shplit ticket, half Irish half Chinay.
#DR. FLUKE.
Patsy, you have had a strange history.
#PATSY.
I’ll recount it if you please, doctor. “Patsy O’Wang,” Song. Air “Pat Malloy.”
