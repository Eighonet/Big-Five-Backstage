#LITTLE GIRL.
What is your name?
#EVERYCHILD.
I do not understand.
#LITTLE GIRL.
Oh, of course, I forgot. I will lead you to some one who will give you a name.
#EVERYCHILD.
Who are you?
#MOTHER.
I am your mother.
#EVERYCHILD.
Who are you?
#FATHER.
I am your father.
#EVERYCHILD.
What place is this? They told me somewhere - but I have forgotten - that I should die there which is being born here and come to the earth.
#MOTHER.
Yes, this is our world, and I shall give you a name. I shall name you Everychild.
#EVERYCHILD.
Is it always and everywhere so beautiful?
#MOTHER.
No, but it should be so, and some day it will be so.
#FATHER.
It is a dream we have.
#MOTHER.
It will be even more beautiful than this, for we shall go higher, and climb those Morning Mountains. The flowers of the Spirit grow there.
#EVERYCHILD.
And we shall gather them?
#FATHER.
Yes, Everychild. Come now, and bring all the others with you. We will take that path yonder to the hills.
#MOTHER.
No, wait! They are not all here. There are some missing. They must all come.
#FATHER.
It will be so long to wait. Let us go with these.
#MOTHER.
Have we not named her Everychild?
#FATHER.
Yes. She must go down and find all who have lost their way. Perhaps some have awakened in the wrong place and are wandering about in the dark jungle of the world. We will wait here till they come.
#MOTHER.
Go, Everychild. Find them and bring them all back with you. Take this lamp.
#FATHER.
Our lamp?
#MOTHER.
Our love!
#FATHER.
Take it, Everychild. With this lamp you can find the lost children and bring them all back with you.
#MOTHER.
We will wait for them no matter how long. rises revealing
#THE YOUNGER CHILD.
Ma, can I go to bed? I am so tired and hungry.
#MOTHER.
It ain't ten yet. It will be only a few minutes more. The boss is coming early in the morning and we must have the work ready. Now you be still and keep working. You don't know what a good home you got. Ain't she got a good home, John?
#FATHER.
You bet she got a good home, and if you all work now we get the good coffee and bread in the morning and perhaps in a couple a weeks we all go to the movies.
#OLDEST CHILD.
Gee, I like to see that fairy play what we see once.
#MOTHER.
Now, go right to bed, children. It is ten o'clock.
#EVERYCHILD.
You are some of the lost children. How did you get in here? Come with me. I will give you some better clothes and you can dance and sing with all of them.
#MARY.
Here we are, Jim. Guess you're ready for something. It takes a man to sprout a patch o' locusts, and you had breakfast by lamplight.
#JIM.
Some o' them roots seemed as long as from here to the barn.
#MARY.
But you'll have the best pasture in the county next year.
#JIM.
What's the good? We rationed our beef steers the way that government chap taught us, and our pigs, and our sheep, and who got the profit? lot more documents came from the government to - day - all about pigs. And we haven't got a decent house to live in! If we could only build on that pretty bit of high ground I've had picked out for three years, Rosie would quit havin' these sick spells.
#JIM.
How is she, mother?
#MARY.
I b'lieve she's a little better. Jim, have you got any money left from sellin' the car?
#JIM.
You know we had to pay the interest at the bank first of all, and the rest went for fertilizer.
#MARY.
I miss the car more on Rosie's account than mine. She's been cryin' for a ride this morning. I didn't know what to say. And I had to promise her she could go to the picnic if she got well. That'll mean a pretty dress, and hat and shoes.
#JIM.
I don't know where you'll get 'em then.
#MARY.
Looks like we ought to be able to give our children a little pleasure. There's poor Billie and Tom don't more'n get home from school an' lay their books down till they have to go to hoein' and pullin' weeds. I don't blame Billie a bit for runnin' away and goin' fishin' last Saturday.
#JIM.
I don't either, though I had to whip him for it. I can't do without his work and get through.
#MARY.
Get through? When did we ever get through anyhow? Look at this, Jim. Beef steers sold to - day in Chicago at nine cents a pound. It cost us fourteen cents to raise ours, and we're countin' on makin' things easier by raisin' more next year. And see here, it says beef went up in the Eastern market four cents.
#JIM.
Steers down, beef up! Robbin' both ways.
#BILLIE.
The big boys are goin' to play ball. Dad, can't we go watch 'em? We ain't seen a ball game this year, and we want to learn to play. They're makin' a little boys' team at school.
#MARY.
Daddy's workin' awfully hard to - day. He needs you bad to pile brush for him.
#JIM.
You can't go to - day, boys. Next time -
#BILLIE.
Oh, next time! It's always next time.
#MARY.
Wash up now, and you can have a hot dinner.
#JIM.
Mary, I think you'd better telephone for the doctor to come and have a look at Rosie.
#MARY.
I did - this morning. He said he didn't have time to come out to - day.
#JIM.
Dr. Lowden?
#MARY.
Guess he's tired o' comin' for nothing. You can't blame him. Cho - Cho You sent for a doctor?
#JIM.
Yes - but - you - ain't - no doctor. Cho - Cho No, I - ain't - no - doctor , but my daughter is a doctor and here she is now.
#JIM.
You say that little old man is your daughter and a doctor? Cho - Cho That's right - but a new kind of doctor. This is a Health doctor, not a Disease doctor. Present treatment for Health - absent treatment for absence of Health. I'll leave the doctor here.
#EVERYCHILD.
Well, well, where is the patient?
#JIM.
I must be crazy, but I never seen a doctor like you. You ain't no doctor.
#EVERYCHILD.
Oh, yes I am. I'm a children's specialist. Is she in that room? Whew! No air. Lift up that curtain and open the window! You must show me where you keep your pigs. Don't they get light and air on a day like this? So this is the little patient. Well! Well! Take these and throw them out. My! My! Pork and potatoes and candy! Of all things! I'll have to make out a diet list later. I think the trouble with you is bad food, bad air, and no light. The trouble is not enough agricultural pamphlets on human live stock, not enough government millions spent on the real thing. Now get up, Rose! Let me see you stand. There, that's good. Now a comb and brush - we'll help this hair a little.
#MARY.
My hands are so full of work -
#EVERYCHILD.
Yes, that's better. Now, father, a glass of milk! And mother, open that bag, please.
#MARY.
Oh, my!
#ROSIE.
Oh, mother! You did get them!
#ROSIE.
Are you going to take me to the picnic?
#EVERYCHILD.
Indeed I am! A picnic that will never be over!
#ROSIE.
Are we going to ride? Have we got our car back?
#EVERYCHILD.
Better than that.
#ROSIE.
What is it?
#EVERYCHILD.
You'll see. Maybe you'll dance out of the window.
#MARY.
Are you going to take her away?
#EVERYCHILD.
Yes, I shall keep her with me until she is well. Then she will return to you.
#ROSIE.
Oh, please take Billie and Tom!
#EVERYCHILD.
Yes, I want them, too. Come along, boys!
#MARY.
Oh, Jim, is this a dream? Or am I awake at last?
#JIM.
Perhaps this is what it ought to be for all the children of the world.
#ONE MAN.
Lunch - time. It feels good to rest half an hour in this bloomin' hole. Have a swig, Jack?
#JACK.
Don't care if I do. I'll bring some next time, Joe.
#OLD JOE.
Here, Bert, it helps. Take some and give a swallow to the boys.
#BERT.
I'll take some and thank you, but I guess the boys are better off without it.
#JACK.
How long you worked here, Bert?
#BERT.
Nigh on fifteen years, and a devil's job it is. I wanted to be a sailor, but I got into this, and it paid pretty good, and then I got tangled up with a family and just stayed on the job. But it's no place to spend a life.
#OLD JOE.
I been here 'bout as long as you, Bert. I ran away from the big woods where my father was a lumberman. Thought I'd see the world, and just got stuck here and never could make up my mind to get away. See the world, eh! All I ever seed was de inside of it. If I had my way to do over again, I think I'd take to the tall timber up dere on top.
#FIRST BOY.
Dey's havin' parade up dere.
#SECOND BOY.
Dat ain't band music, you mutt.
#SECOND BOY.
Wot's the matter?
#FIRST BOY.
Nuthin'. Did yer ever dance, Buck?
#SECOND BOY.
Naw. But I bet I could!
#FIRST BOY.
I had a dream onct. I dremp I's in an orchard, an' they's blooms floatin' round. I could smell 'em!
#SECOND BOY.
You's nutty. You can't smell in a dream.
#JACK.
I've been here fourteen years, since I was a boy. It ain't a place for a man. It's too black. You get black outside and inside. Why, they say your lungs get black from breathing this dust. And your soul gets black. The place for an honest man to work is out in the white light, on your ocean or in your woods, or on the roads and railways, and in the big buildings. This kind of work is work with punishment added to it. A little of it would be all right for men who go wrong, or for some as needs discipline. Then some day they'll get machines to do the rest. Ah - there's the whistle. Come on, boys, to work again!
#EVERYCHILD.
Oh, mother, I went everywhere, and we've brought all who could come! But there were some in holes in the ground that I couldn't reach, though we danced and danced, and called and called. They were too far down. And there were some ill and crippled, in hospitals, that couldn't walk, and some hidden away in great buildings called factories - and some in tenements, where there was no sun, and no green grass to walk on. Mother, what shall we do? It was so hard to leave them. Won't you go back with me, and help me?
#MOTHER.
Yes, Everychild. We must all go. Not one must be left down there.
#FATHER.
Yes, we cannot go on up the Morning Mountains until they come.
#MOTHER.
We will start at once, all of us, down through the highways and valleys and cities of the world, and bring them here. Come, children, let us go.
