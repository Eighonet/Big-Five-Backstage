#TOWNSLEY.
Is everybody in?
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Oh John, I’m afraid they’re not all in. Jack are you there, an’ Tootsie?
#JACK.
I’m O.K. maw, Tootsie, too.
#SOLDIER.
Boot me down O.K. too. I set my ziglone alarm, greatest invention of the age. Wendt off an hour ago. Macher, I’ll sell you some stock; 50 per zent down, balance—
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Where’s Pattie Baggs?
#MRS. BANKS.
I’m here, Mrs. Townsley. And I’m dyin’ o’ fright. Oh, I wish John was here!
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Do you want him here to be blown to fiddle - strings in the cyclone?
#MRS. BANKS.
But he’s on the cyars and it may blow the train off the track.
#SOLDIER.
Tear laty, regomment him to my ziglone ogsident bolicy!
#MRS. BANKS.
Oh, I shall faint if you go on that way.
#ADOLPHUS.
Deah me, is the stom so vewy violent as that?
#JIM FUNK.
Well, I should say, Puterbaugh! Last cyclone there was an old goose on a nest under the barn. It blew those goose eggs, would you believe it, right through the brick chimney. Holes in the brickwork looked as if there had been a cannonade.
#ADOLPHUS.
Dweadful! I’m sowwy I evah left New Yawk!
#SOLDIER.
Mine frent, Nye Yorick vas a great blace, but it ish not in it gombared to Dexas.
#JIM FUNK.
That’s what, Isaacstein. A cyclone’s not bad. It’s a little exciting, but rather enjoyable when you get used to it.
#ADOLPHUS.
Weally, you don’t say! It must be vewy twyin’ on the nerves.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Townsley, is the door barred securely?
#TOWNSLEY.
Yes, my dear.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
John, put something more against it. You men lean against it.
#TOWNSLEY.
Let the door alone, can’t you!
#MRS. BANKS.
Oh my nerves, they’re twitchin’ forty ways for Sunday.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Pattie Baggs, can’t you keep still? This is a serious time.
#SOLDIER.
Mine frent, vat becomes of dot goose?
#JIM FUNK.
Oh the goose, that was the strangest thing ever heard of. The cyclone blew that barn all to fliggets and scattered it over half the county and it actooally left that old goose settin’ on the same spot with not a feather on her, an’ nary an egg under her.
#ADOLPHUS.
Did you evah heah the like?
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Jim Funk couldn’t stop tellin’ stories if old Nick was at the back door; he had ought to be ashamed of himself.
#SOLDIER.
Dot was a stranche phenomenon. I will write dem insurance gombanies to stop wridin’ bolicies on parns oont wride dem on gooses. Der gombany safes monies oont I get a gommission. capital idea! Why, it blew so hard last time—
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Major Townsley, can’t you men stop talkin’. It’s a solemn occasion.
#TOWNSLEY.
Madam, I haven’t said a word.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
But Dizzie Jim an’ that Jew—
#TOWNSLEY.
My dear, they are guests of the hotel. I can’t tell ’em what to say. Jim Funk, this is a serious matter.
#JIM FUNK.
You bet it is, major.
#MRS. BANKS.
Oh my nerves—is it comin’?
#TOWNSLEY.
Dark as Egypt and roarin’ like Tophet.
#MRS. BANKS.
Oh! oh! I shall smother.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Pattie Baggs, keep quiet. Hollerin’ aint goin’ to stop it. My land, where’s Bridget an’ Susan. They aint in; Townsley, do go an’ fetch them.
#TOWNSLEY.
It’s too late now. I guess they have run out the back way and got in Smith’s cellar.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
But maybe they haven’t an’ they’ll be killed sure.
#MRS. BANKS.
Oh goodness! If you talk of killing, you’ll kill me dead, and John—
#TOWNSLEY.
Mrs. Townsley, who is talking now?
#MRS. TWIGGS.
But you don’t do anything. You just stand there as unconcerned.
#TOWNSLEY.
What can I do?
#MRS. TWIGGS.
I wish I was a man.
#ADOLPHUS.
This is puffickly dwedful!
#SOLDIER.
If you blease, macher, a little petter light. I wrides dem ogsident gombanies to put a goupon on der bolicy, “Not good unless der barty vas in der zellar.” Dem gombanies safes monies oont I get a gommission.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Where’s Tootsie?
#TOOTSIE.
I’m here all right, maw.
#JACK.
Yes, I fetched her, you bet.
#JIM FUNK.
Hello there, Puterbaugh. Lightning strike you?
#ADOLPHUS.
Weally I cawn’t say. I feel so shook up.
#JIM FUNK.
You’re all right. That ain’t a marker to what we’ll get. Why, last cyclone the lightning fell in great balls, as big as your head, that danced round the ground among the hailstones and melted away slowly—them that didn’t explode. I saw a chunk of it in the chimley corner next day.
#ADOLPHUS.
Weally, I cawn’t stand that, don’t you know. I wish I’d nevah left New Yawk.
#SOLDIER.
Mine frent, you was nerfous. Haf you an ogsident bolicy? I’ll write you up. You vas a goot risk, seein’ you was in der zellar.
#ADOLPHUS.
Weally, my fwend, you aw impawtunate. I have me insurance, don’t you know, always cawy it same as me cane.
#SOLDIER.
Dot Nye Yorick insurance vas no goot in Dexas. It hasn’t got der ziglone goupon.
#JACK.
Oh Tootsie, come an’ look. It’s just splendid. Black as ink, an’ way off yellow as can be.
#TOOTSIE.
Aint that just tip top?
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Major Townsley, do you see those children?
#TOWNSLEY.
My dear, I see them.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Do you want them killed?
#TOWNSLEY.
Fiddlesticks! Keep still, can’t you.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Send them away from that door—if anything happens!
#TOWNSLEY.
Go, my dears, back to the far corner! Something will happen! It’s a grand sight! It’s coming like a race - horse!
#MRS. BANKS.
Oh, Major Townsley, do you want to frighten us all to death!
#MRS. TWIGGS.
It’s no use trying to keep men still.
#JIM FUNK.
I hope it wont blow this cyclone cellar out of root.
#ADOLPHUS.
Gwacious! do you think it’ll do that?
#JIM FUNK.
No tellin’! Last cyclone—
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Jim Funk, can’t you keep still?
#JIM FUNK.
Why yes, if it is the wish of the company.
#ADOLPHUS.
I cawn’t keep still, I say now!
#SOLDIER.
Dot gomes from hafin no insurance! Bedder dake a ziglone bolicy. Dot helps der nerfs bedder.
#ADOLPHUS.
Go away, fellah, weally you annoy me. I’m used to pwivacy.
#SOLDIER.
Zome beoples always stands in der vay of der own lidght. Say, lantlort! Macher Downsley, dis zellar vas boorly lidghted, vy ton’t you but in elegdrick lidghts? He toesn’t hear. Macher Downsley!
#TOWNSLEY.
What are you yelling about?
#SOLDIER.
I’ll dake a gondract to lidght dis zellar from basement to addig mit elegdrick lidghts. I can get a small gommission from der gompany. He gan’t hear. It vas a drifle noisy for peesness.
#TOWNSLEY.
Isaacstein, you had better sit down.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Townsley, how does it look outside?
#TOWNSLEY.
Roaring like all the fiends. The roof of the hotel will go in a minute. There goes the chimneys now!
#JACK.
Oh paw, let me see!
#TOOTSIE.
An’ me, too!
#JACK.
Go back, Tootsie! It aint fur girls.
#TOOTSIE.
Paw, Jack’s pushin’ me.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Come here, both of you. Major Townsley, do you see those children? And at such a time! Humph, you aint fit to be the father of a family! No more government than a cat— Oh! oh!
#MRS. BANKS.
Save me! save me!
#MRS. TWIGGS.
I guess ye aint gone yet.
#TOWNSLEY.
Run back dears, to the far corner.
#TOOTSIE.
Jack, I’m afraid.
#JACK.
Don’t be skart, Tootsie. Paw an’ me’s here.
#ADOLPHUS.
Oh, I say, majah, say, don’t you know! He cawn’t heah. Majah!
#TOWNSLEY.
Speak louder!
#ADOLPHUS.
Me twunk!
#TOWNSLEY.
What’s the matter now?
#ADOLPHUS.
I fohgot me twunk, don’t you know.
#TOWNSLEY.
Trunk! What on earth do you want with your trunk?
#ADOLPHUS.
It contains all me linen and things. Let me out! I must have it! It’s the houah to change me tie.
#TOWNSLEY.
Mr. Puterbaugh, you can’t go out in that storm. Hear the roaring.
#ADOLPHUS.
But I change me linen twice a day, don’t you know.
#JIM FUNK.
I’ll loan you a shirt!
#ADOLPHUS.
Thanks awfully, but I nevah weah flannel, besides what would you do, I say now?
#JIM FUNK.
Do you think I have only one shirt!
#SOLDIER.
Mine frent, my vardrobe vas limited, but it is at your disbosal.
#ADOLPHUS.
Thanks, awfully, but I cawn’t weah percale, it’s two dweadful! Don’t you think I could dwag me twunk into this cave?
#TOWNSLEY.
Why, you lunatic! you wouldn’t risk your life for a trunk would you?
#ADOLPHUS.
I’m dwedfully nervous! I haven’t been so excited since the day I thweatened to cane Gawge Bowkah in the Manhattan Club. Insulted me, the cad! They had to westwain me, and all that. Adolphus Putehbaugh was the hero of the houah. Got hauled up befoah the diwectahs and all that. Made me a weputation as a dangewous man, don’t you know— Gwacious! that’s comin’ it stwong!
#SOLDIER.
Mine frent, vil you dake dot bolicy now? No dime like der bresent. Telay is tangerous. I tell you vot I’ll do. Half der gommission! Gristian name Adolphus—Age?
#TOWNSLEY.
There goes the roof!
#MRS. BANKS.
Land sakes, I’m goin’, too!
#MRS. TWIGGS.
No you aint! Patty Baggs, don’t be a fool.
#MRS. BANKS.
Oh, if John were only here!
#SOLDIER.
My tear laty, in dis case distance vas der pest bolicy—exzepting always der ziglone bolicy.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
If the roof is gone how will we manage for dinner, I’d like to know?
#TOWNSLEY.
Dinner! That’s like a woman.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Yes, and it’s like a man to say nothing till he’s hungry as a wolf, and then he expects it in two minutes.
#JIM FUNK.
Never mind, Mrs. Townsley, we’ll get along somehow.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Humph! There aint a man in the county that has a better appetite than you have.
#JACK.
Maw al’ays said ’at Dizzy Jim was a dandy to eat!
#TOWNSLEY.
Boy, keep still there.
#SOLDIER.
Macher Downsley, dot roof was gone sure enough. Say, I’ll dake a gondragt to repuild dot hotel on a scale of magnifizence suitable to dis greadt state of Dexas.
#TOWNSLEY.
You a contractor, too? I thought your line was insurance.
#SOLDIER.
Haf you not my gardt alretty? Read dot gardt. “Solomon Isaacstein, Bromoter.” I bromotes eferyding from ziglone bolicies to hodels oont shtock gombanies. Wherefer dere was gommissions dere was Isaacstein retty for peesness.
#TOWNSLEY.
Wait till we find out the damages.
#SOLDIER.
Mine frent, der bresent is der only dime. Der bast was brotested oont der future disgounted. I’ll figger on dot gondragt now oont have an esdimate ven der ziglone subsites. Dem gandles vasn’t equal to such an occasion as der bresent. Macher, haf you consiteret dot broposition for elegdrick lights in dis ziglone zellar?
#ADOLPHUS.
I say now this is gettin’ to be a beastly boah.
#SOLDIER.
Frent Puterbaugh, allow me. You vas standin’ in your own lighdt, my tear sir.
#ADOLPHUS.
I should say that I’m standing in me own dark. Aw, wathaw good joke that, best I’ve made since I left New Yawk. You cawn’t make a good joke in this blawsted country. Climate so vewy depwessing. We’re an awfully witty lot of chaps in the Manhattan Club.
#JIM FUNK.
How is it outside, major?
#SOLDIER.
Der glimate vas hart on matches in Dexas. Mine frent, a goot shoke is ter best donic for te nerfs excebt a ziglone bolicy—
#ADOLPHUS.
I say now Mistah—ah, I cawn’t quite wecall youah name.
#SOLDIER.
Solomon Isaacstein, Bromoter, Nye Yorick oont San Franzisco. Let me make a broposition, der macher vas a little slow.
#ADOLPHUS.
He keeps a beastly place heah, don’t you know.
#SOLDIER.
Ogzactly, ogzactly, but petter oxpressed dan I could oxpress it. Dis blace vas not up mit der dimes even for Dexas. It needs elegdrick lights oont, py chorge, vat you say to pilliarts in dis zellar?
#ADOLPHUS.
By Jove! Good idea, don’t you know.
#SOLDIER.
Sugchest it to Macher Downsley. My prudder Abe Isaacstein makes pilliart dables. He gives a tiscount of dwenty per zent to der drade, put I makes Abe gif me sefenty - fife per zent. I’ll tifide dot gommission. Himmel, vat a noise.
#MRS. BANKS.
I know we’ll all be killed.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Pattie Baggs, are you hankering to be killed?
#MRS. BANKS.
Oh Mrs. Townsley, how can you talk so?
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Keep still, then. That poor dude’s nearly scared to death already.
#JIM FUNK.
There she goes.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
The hotel?
#JIM FUNK.
No, the stable. Look at that!
#CHORUS.
What is it?
#JACK.
Lemme see.
#TOWNSLEY.
Sit down, will you, boy.
#JIM FUNK.
Aint that great! Aint it?
#MRS. BANKS.
Do tell us, Jim.
#JIM FUNK.
Why, that old brindle mule. When the stable went it riled him so he’s got his grit up an’, dumme, if he aint just kickin’ the cyclone to strings right an’ left; he’s splittin’ it wide open.
#ADOLPHUS.
Gwacious me!
#JIM FUNK.
But it’ll git the better of ’im, I ’low. He’s gittin old an’ short - winded an’ that cyclone holds a full hand. There goes a cabin. Look at it, major. Why, I’ll be shot if there aint three coon skins nailed on the door an’ a nigger smokin’ a pipe, as cool as patent ice.
#ADOLPHUS.
Gwacious, my twunk!
#SOLDIER.
Oont no inzurance? No? I’ll write an emerchency bolicy for fifty per zent extra.
#TOWNSLEY.
Jim, you’ve a good eye to see coon skins in that light.
#JIM FUNK.
Hanged, if I wasn’t mistaken. It’s fox skins. Might a knowed that by the rings on the tails. Old Brindle’s knocked out! No, he isn’t. He’s taken a hitch round an apple tree with his tail. There goes the tree, roots an’ all, an’ the mule holdin’ on by his tail. The cabin’s out o’ sight now.
#MRS. BANKS.
Mercy me, Jim, d’ye see any cyars? John’s in the cyars.
#JIM FUNK.
No, Mrs. Baggs, I don’t see no cyars, but if there doesn’t go half a mile o’ track sailin’ along over the tree tops.
#MRS. BANKS.
Mercy on us! I’ll bet the cyars is wrecked an’ John’s hurt. Oh Jim—
#JIM.
Don’t be skeared, mom! The cyars didn’t get into the cyclone, only the locomotive. It’s still runnin’ nateral as life. The fireman’s heavin’ in coal.
#ADOLPHUS.
I weally cawn’t get back to New Yawk without me twunk.
#SOLDIER.
Ton’t co pack py Nye Yorick yet, mine frent. You haf not seen half ter peauties of dis great gountry alretty.
#JIM.
There it’s about over now. Major Townsley, I’ll bet three to one that old mule doesn’t get back inside three days. It took him two days last time an’ he’s gittin’ old an’ stiff.
#SOLDIER.
Mine frent, dot was a coot pet. We’ll make up a little zindigate oont dry it. Jim, I dakes ten tollars vort of dot pet, hants town.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Townsley, is the hotel gone?
#TOWNSLEY.
No, only the roof and the chimneys. Jim has been exaggerating slightly.
#SOLDIER.
I suspected oxacheration. I’ve pin dere pefore. Py cracious, I’ll ket up an oxacheration bolicy for dis gountry. It would be a vortune broperly hantled.
#MRS. TWIGGS.
Roof gone and dinner ruined.
#ADOLPHUS.
And my twunk gone to the bow wows, an’ it’s half an howah pawst the time to change me linen.
#SOLDIER.
Mr. Bewterpaugh! Mr. Bewterpaugh! I’ll find dot drunk for a slighdt atvance, cash town.
