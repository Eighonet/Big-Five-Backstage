#ANNE.
And so you can't stay any longer, James?
#JAMES.
No, Anne. I told my father I'd be back while there was light, and I'm going back. Come over to our house to - night, Anne. I'll be watching the girls coming in, and thinking on yourself; there's none of them your match for grace and favour. My father wanted me to see a girl in Arvach. She has three hundred pounds, besides what the priest, her uncle, will leave her. "Father," says I, "listen to me now. Haven't I always worked for you like a steady, useful boy?" "You have," says he. "Did I ever ask you for anything unreasonable?" says I. "No," says he. "Well then," says I, "don't ask me to do unreasonable things. I'm fond of Anne Hourican, and not another girl will I marry. What's money, after all?" says I, "there's gold on the whin - bushes if you only knew it." And he had to leave it at that.
#ANNE.
You always bring people around.
#JAMES.
The quiet, reasonable way is the way that people like.
#ANNE.
Still, with all, I'm shy of going into your house.
#JAMES.
Don't doubt but there'll be a welcome before you; come round with Maire. Anne rises, and comes to him. She has graceful, bird - like movements.
#ANNE.
Maybe we won't have a chance of seeing each other after all. James Moynihan kisses her reverently
#JAMES.
Sit down now, Anne, because there's something I want to show you. Do you ever see "The Shamrock"?
#ANNE.
Very seldom. James and Anne go to the settle; they sit down.
#JAMES.
There be good pieces in it sometimes. There's a poem of mine in it this week.
#ANNE.
Of yours, James? Printed, do you mean?
#JAMES.
Ay, printed. It's a poem to yourself, though your name doesn't come into it. Let no one see it, Anne, at least not for the present. And now, good - bye. Goes to the door. Anne continues reading the verse eagerly. At the door James turns and recites: - That's the first stanza. Good - bye. James goes out. Anne continues reading, then she leaves the paper down with a sigh.
#ANNE.
O, it's lovely! No, Brian, Maire's not back yet. Ay, I'll engage she'll give you a call when she does come back. I hope Maire won't forget to call at the mill.
#ANNE.
Had Maire any talk of going to the mill, father?
#CONN.
I heard nothing of it.
#ANNE.
I hope she'll mind of it. We must get the meal there, and not be going to the shop so often.
#CONN.
I suppose we must. He moves about restlessly.
#ANNE.
And I was just thinking that one of us ought to go to Arvach on Tuesday, and get the things there.
#CONN.
The mean, odious creatures! Anne is startled. She turns from dresser.
#ANNE.
What are you thinking of, father?
#CONN.
That den of robbers. Well, well, I'm finished with them now; but I'm a proud man, and a passionate man, and I'll be even with them yet.
#ANNE.
There's no comfort in going into rough places.
#CONN.
You know nothing at all about it. Were the men in yet?
#ANNE.
James Moynihan was here, because he had to go away early; but Brian MacConnell is outside still. Father, you were home late two nights this week.
#CONN.
And is a man to have no life to himself? But sure you know nothing at all about it. I'm going out now to give Brian MacConnell a hand.
#ANNE.
It's hardly worth while going out now.
#CONN.
There's still light enough to do a bit of mowing, and you ought to know that it isn't right to neglect the boy that's come to do a day's work with you. Many's the day I put in with the scythe in Ireland, and in England too; I did more than stroll with the fiddle, and I saw more places than where fiddling brought me. I was just going out to you, Brian. I was telling the girl here that it's not right to neglect the boy that's giving you a day's work out of his own goodness.
#BRIAN.
I'm only coming in for a light.
#CONN.
As you're here now, rest yourself. Brian MacConnell comes in, and goes over to the hearth. He is dark and good - looking, and has something reckless in his look. He wears corduroy trousers, and a shirt loose at the neck. Anne comes to Brian. Conn stands at entrance, his back turned.
#BRIAN.
When do you expect Maire back?
#ANNE.
She'll be here soon. Shell give you a call if you're outside,
#BRIAN.
How is it you couldn't keep James Moynihan?
#ANNE.
It's because you didn't say the good word for me, I must think. Be sure you praise me the next time you're working together.
#BRIAN.
Will you do as much for me?
#ANNE.
Indeed, I will, Brian. Myself and another are making a devotion to Saint Anthony.
#BRIAN.
And what would that be for?
#ANNE.
That the Saint might send us good comrades.
#BRIAN.
I thought it was Saint Joseph did that for the girls.
#ANNE.
Sure we couldn't be asking the like from him. We couldn't talk to Saint Joseph that way. We want a nice young saint to be looking at. Conn turns from the door.
#CONN.
It'll be a poor season, Brian MacConnell.
#BRIAN.
The season's not so bad, after all.
#CONN.
God help them that are depending on the land and the weather for the bit they put into their heads. It's no wonder that the people here are the sort they are, harassed, anxious people.
#ANNE.
The people here mind their own business, and they're a friendly people besides.
#CONN.
People that would leave the best fiddler at the fair to go and look at a bullock.
#ANNE.
He's not satisfied to have this shelter, Brian.
#CONN.
I'm saying, Brian, that her mother had this shelter, and she left it to go the roads with myself.
#ANNE.
That God may rest my mother. It's a pity she never lived to come back to the place. But we ought to be praising grandmother night and day, for leaving this place to Maire.
#CONN.
Your grandmother did that as she did everything else.
#ANNE.
Now, Brian, what would you do with a man that would say the like? Anne goes outside.
#CONN.
It's small blame to the girl here for thinking something of the place; but I saw the time, Brian MacConnell, when I could make more playing at one fair than working a whole season in this bit of a place.
#BRIAN.
Girls like the shelter, Conn.
#CONN.
Ay, but the road for the fiddler. I'm five years settled here, and I come to be as well known as the begging ass, and there is as much thought about me. Fiddling, let me tell you, isn't like a boy's whistling. It can't be kept up on nothing.
#BRIAN.
I understand that, Conn.
#CONN.
I'm getting that I can't stand the talk you hear in houses, wars and Parliaments, and the devil knows what ramais.
#BRIAN.
There's still a welcome for the man of art, somewhere.
#CONN.
That somewhere's getting further and further away, Brian.
#BRIAN.
You were not in the town last night?
#CONN.
I was not, Brian. God help me, I spent the night my lone.
#BRIAN.
There's Sligomen in the town.
#CONN.
Is there, now? It would be like our times to play for them. Anne, would you bring me down my spectacles? They're in the room, daughter. I suppose the Sligomen will be in Flynn's.
#BRIAN.
They were there last night.
#CONN.
Listen, Brian, I've a reason for not going to Flynn's. Would you believe it, Brian, Flynn spoke to me about the few shillings I owe him?
#BRIAN.
That was shabby of him. He got a lot out of you in the way of playing.
#CONN.
It's just like them. Besides, Maire keeps us tight enough, and I often have to take treats from the men. They're drovers and rambling labourers and the like, though, as you say, they've the song and music, and the proper talk. Listen, Brian, could you leave a few shillings on the dresser for me?
#BRIAN.
To be sure I will, Conn. Brian goes to the dresser, and puts money on a shelf.
#CONN.
Thank you, Brian. There's few I'd let put me under a compliment; but I take it from you. Maire, as I said, is a careful girl, but some of us must have our freedom. Besides, Brian, the bird that sings lone sings slow. The man of art must have his listeners. Anne, daughter, what's keeping you there? Sure the spectacles were in my pocket the whole time, child. When I spoke against the people about here, I was leaving you out of it, Brian.
#BRIAN.
I'm fond of tune, though it wasn't here I got fond of it. Brian goes to the door.
#ANNE.
You won't be rambling again, Brian?
#BRIAN.
I'm settled here, Anne; I made it up with my brothers.
#ANNE.
They used to say that a MacConnell quarrel was a lasting quarrel.
#BRIAN.
Maybe we're working the bad blood out of us.
#ANNE.
Don't be staying out long, Brian.
#BRIAN.
Till Maire gives me the call. Brian MacConnell goes out.
#ANNE.
We oughtn't to take another clay from Brian MacConnell. There's only the patch at the back to be mown, and you could do that yourself.
#CONN.
You can depend on me for the mowing. I'm going up now, to go over an oul' tune I have.
#ANNE.
James Moynihan would come over and stack for us.
#CONN.
James Moynihan is a decent boy, too.
#ANNE.
You won't be going out to - night, father?
#CONN.
Now, how's a man to know what he'll be doing?
#ANNE.
It leaves me very anxious.
#CONN.
I'll give you this advice, and it's proper advice to give to a girl thinking of marrying. Never ask of your menkind where they're going.
#ANNE.
The like of that brings bad luck on a house.
#CONN.
You have too much dead knowledge, and the shut fist never caught a bird.
#ANNE.
I only wish you were settled down.
#CONN.
Sure I am settled down.
#ANNE.
I can't speak to you, after all.
#CONN.
You're a good girl, Anne, and he'll be lucky that gets you. And don't be grieving that you're not bringing James Moynihan a fortune. You're bringing him the decency of birth and rearing. You're like the lone pigeon I often think - the pet that doesn't fly, and keeps near the house.
#ANNE.
That's the way you always treat me, and I never can talk to you.
#CONN.
Hush now, here's the other, your sister Maire. She's like the wild pigeon of the woods. We were discoursing on affairs, Maire. We won't be bringing Brian MacConnell here tomorrow; there's only the bit at the back to be mown, and I'll do that myself. Conn Hourican goes into the room right; soon after the fiddle is heard. Anne goes to the settle, and takes up her knitting. Maire takes her shawl off, and hangs it on the rack. Maire Hourican is over twenty. She is tall, and has easy, graceful movements; her features are fine and clear - cut; the nose is rather blunted, the mouth firm. Her gaze is direct and clear. She has heavy auburn hair, loose now, and falling. Maire comes down to the table, opens basket, and takes some flowers from top. She turns to dresser and arranges some of the flowers in a jar.
#MARIE BRUIN.
We'd have no right to take another day from Brian. And when there's no one here to - morrow, you and me could draw some of the turf.
#ANNE.
Your hair is loose, Maire. Maire goes to the mirror and fixes her hair.
#MARIE BRUIN.
The wind blew it about me, and then I let it down. I came home by the long way, just to feel young again with my hair about me.
#ANNE.
And did you meet any one?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Indeed I did. I met James Moynihan.
#ANNE.
James had to go early. They're building at his place.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Indeed they ought to let James build a house for himself. ANNE Some day they will, Maire. But we must not let some day be a far day.
#ANNE.
I think I'll show you something. What is it, daughter? Anne rises and goes to the dresser. She opens drawer. Maire watches her.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I made a good girl out of you, anyway.
#ANNE.
You wouldn't let me use stroller words when we were on the road. Do you mind of that?
#MARIE BRUIN.
I kept you to the mannerly ways. I have that to my credit.
#ANNE.
Read that, Maire. It was James that made it.
#MARIE BRUIN.
It's a song, I declare.
#ANNE.
No, Maire, it's a poem. poem? O, that's grand! She begins to read it eagerly.
#ANNE.
And, Maire -
#MARIE BRUIN.
Well?
#ANNE.
James says it's about me.
#MARIE BRUIN.
About you? O, I wish some one would put me into a song, or into a poem; I suppose a poem would be best. You might ask James. No, I'll coax him myself. Ah, no I won't, Anne.
#ANNE.
You may keep it for a while, but don't let any one know.
#MARIE BRUIN.
He must be very fond of you, and I thinking him so quiet.
#ANNE.
He has grand thoughts about me.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Well, you'll be seeing him to - night.
#ANNE.
I don't know that I'll go out to - night.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Sure Grace Moynihan asked us to go over.
#ANNE.
I'm shy of going into James'.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Anne, you're the only one of us that has any manners. Maybe you're right not to go.
#ANNE.
I'll stay in to - night.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Then Brian and myself will go to Moynihan's.
#ANNE.
You'd get an indulgence, Maire, if you missed a dance.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Would it be so hard to get an indulgence? The house looks nice this evening. We'll keep Brian here for a while, and then we'll go to Moynihan's.
#ANNE.
Father will be going out to - night.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Will he?
#ANNE.
He will. I think I ought to stay in. Maire, father was in only a while before you the night before last and another night.
#MARIE BRUIN.
O, and I thinking things were going so well with us. He's drinking again.
#ANNE.
He's going to Flynn's again.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Disgracing us again.
#ANNE.
I'll stay in to - night.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I'm tired of this.
#ANNE.
Don't say it that way, Maire.
#MARIE BRUIN.
What will people say of us two now?
#ANNE.
I'll talk to him to - night.
#MARIE BRUIN.
No, you're going out - you're going to Moynihan's - you're going to see your sweetheart.
#ANNE.
I think you're becoming a stranger to us, Maire.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You're going to Moynihan's to - night, and I'm going, too. But I'm going to settle this first. Once and for all I'm going to settle this. The fiddle has ceased. As Maire goes towards the room, Conn Hourican comes down, the fiddle in his hand.
#CONN.
Were you listening to the tune I was playing? Ah, that was a real oul tune, if there was anyone that knew it. Maire, my jewel, were you listening?
#MARIE BRUIN.
I heard you.
#CONN.
It was a real oul' tune, and while I was playing it a great scheme came into my head. Now, listen to me, Maire; and you listen, too, Anne. Both of you would like to see your father having what's his due after all, honour and respect.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Both of us would like to see our father earn the same.
#CONN.
I could earn the same, ay, and gold and silver cups besides, if I had the mind to earn them. He puts fiddle on table and prepares to speak impressively.
#CONN.
Let ye listen to me now; I've a scheme to put before ye. When I was going over the oul tune, I remembered that I'd heard of a Feis that's coming on soon, the Feis of Ardagh. I'm thinking of going there. There will be great prizes for some one; I don't doubt but I'd do at Ardagh better than I did at the Feis of Granard, where people as high as bishops were proud and glad to know Conn Hourican the Fiddler.
#ANNE.
Father, you've a place to mind.
#CONN.
I'm tired of that kind of talk; sure I'm always thinking of the place. Maire hasn't little notions. What do you say to it, Maire, my girl?
#MARIE BRUIN.
What do I say? I say you're not a rambler now, though indeed you behave like one.
#CONN.
You have something against me, Maire.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I have.
#CONN.
What has she against me, Anne?
#MARIE BRUIN.
All the promises you broke.
#CONN.
You were listening to what the town is saying.
#MARIE BRUIN.
What does the town know? Does it know that you stripped us of stock and crop the year after we came here? Does it know that Anne and myself, two girls of the roads, had to struggle ever since to keep a shelter?
#CONN.
It knows that. It couldn't help but know it, maybe. But does it know all the promises you made and broke?
#CONN.
Hush now; I'll hear no more. I went my own way always, and I'll go my own way always. He goes to the entrance, and remains with his back turned. Maire goes to Anne.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Ay, he'll go his own way always. What was the good of working and saving here?
#ANNE.
Be quiet with him.
#MARIE BRUIN.
He'll go his own way always, and it's foolish of us to be fretting for him night and day. Maire sits on stool and puts her hands across her face.
#CONN.
Fretting for me. It was too easy that I reared you.
#ANNE.
God help Maire! She kept the house together at the worst, and she is always fretting for us.
#CONN.
I'm oul' enough to mind myself. Let her remember that.
#ANNE.
It's you that ought to remember that.
#CONN.
Did I ever give the harsh word to you, child? No answer.
#CONN.
There, there; I never could see tears in a woman's eyes; there, there, colleen. I'm an oul' man; I won't be a trouble to you long.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Why need you play in Flynn's? You're as good as any that goes there.
#CONN.
I know that. I'm disgusted with Flynn. May hell loosen his knees for him! I'll go in and throw his money on the counter.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Some one else can do that. Promise me you won't go near the place.
#CONN.
You'll have me promise. I promise.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Take this in your hand and promise. It's a medal that belonged to mother. She takes a medal from her neck
#CONN.
I'm disgusted with Flynn. I promise you, Maire.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Now you've honour and respect.
#CONN.
And what about Ardagh, Maire?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Sure, you're not the rambling fiddler any more.
#CONN.
That would be the good rambling. I see the trees making shadows across the roads.
#MARIE BRUIN.
We'll talk about it again.
#ANNE.
Brian MacConnell will be coming in now. CONN I'm going out to Brian MacConnell. He goes to the door.
#ANNE.
Tell Brian to come in now. Conn Hourican goes out. There is a pause. Maire hums a tune as she goes to the mirror.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Am I looking well to - day?
#ANNE.
You're looking your best, I think. Maire, I didn't like the way you talked to father.
#MARIE BRUIN.
What have you against it?
#ANNE.
You're becoming a stranger to us, Maire.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I'm out often, I know, but I think as much as ever of the house, and about you and father. You know we couldn't let him go to the Feis at Ardagh. We couldn't let him go off like a rambling fiddler.
#ANNE.
We couldn't let him go off by himself.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You're going to Moynihan's.
#ANNE.
Maybe I'll go.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Anne, honey, do something for me.
#ANNE.
What will I do?
#MARIE BRUIN.
You'll meet father coming up with Brian, and take him away.
#ANNE.
And will you tell me everything to - night?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Who else would I talk to but yourself, Nancy? I wish Anne hadn't spoken to me like that. I feel the like of that. Well, I'll pray for nothing now but to look my best. You're welcome, Brian.
#BRIAN.
We didn't finish to - day. I'll come in to - morrow and finish.
#MARIE BRUIN.
O no, Brian, we won't take another day from you.
#BRIAN.
Well, what's a day after all? Many's the day and night I put in thinking on you.
#MARIE BRUIN.
But did you do what I asked you to do?
#BRIAN.
I did. I made it up with my brothers. It was never my way before. What I wanted I took with the strong hand; or if I mightn't put the strong hand on it, I left it alone.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Tell me what your brother said to you.
#BRIAN.
When I came up to the door, Hugh came out to meet me. "What destruction are you bringing me?" he said. "There's my hand," says I, "and I take your offer." MAIRE Ah, that's settled. You could settle anything, Brian. I wonder could you settle something for us?
#BRIAN.
What is it, Maire?
#MARIE BRUIN.
It's my father. He wants to be rambling again. He wants to be going to some Feis.
#BRIAN.
Sure, let him go. He takes her hand.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I couldn't, Brian. Couldn't you help us? Couldn't you keep father's mind on the right things?
#BRIAN.
Sure, let the fiddler go on the roads.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You might stay here this evening with ourselves. Father would be glad to talk with you.
#BRIAN.
But I want the two of us to be seen in Moynihan's to - night.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Stay here with us, and let all that go by.
#BRIAN.
Hugh will be there with that woman that brought him the big fortune; and I want you to take the shine out of her.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I was out often lately. You know that, Brian. She goes to chair at table, and sits away from him.
#BRIAN.
But this night above all you must be with me.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Stay here and I'll be as nice to you as if we were in another house. If you knew me at all, Brian MacConnell, that's not the way you'd treat me.
#BRIAN.
Are you not coming out with me?
#MARIE BRUIN.
You must leave me to myself now. Is Anne with you, father?
#CONN.
She's gathering posies or something like that. Brian, did you hear about the Feis at Ardagh?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Oh, what's the good of talking about that? You can't go.
#CONN.
Can't go, did you say, girl?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Oh, how could you go?
#CONN.
Is that the way? Well, God help us. Give me that fiddle till I leave it up. He takes the fiddle off dresser, and turns to go.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Father, let me be with you to - night; oh, I'm sorry if I vexed you. Well, stay with Brian MacConnell; I'm going out to Anne. Maire goes out. Brian goes to rack, and puts on his coat.
#BRIAN.
Are you coming, Conn? I'm off.
#CONN.
Where to, man?
#BRIAN.
To Flynn's.
#CONN.
I can't be going, I'm sorry to say.
#BRIAN.
I'm going anyway. It's a great thing to be in the company of men.
#CONN.
Ay, in troth. Women, Brian, leave the heart of one very lonesome.
#BRIAN.
Why can't you come out? I thought you were going to - night.
#CONN.
I can't, Brian, and that reminds me. Give these few shillings to Flynn for me. I'll owe them to you still.
#BRIAN.
I'm not going to be bothered by the like. Why can't you come?
#CONN.
I promised Maire. Brian strides away. He turns, comes back deliberately, and sits on table beside Conn.
#BRIAN.
They'll be all looking out for you at Flynn's.
#CONN.
Well, the next time they see me they may respect me.
#BRIAN.
Some of the boys will take it very unkindly. CONN They're decent enough fellows, some of them.
#BRIAN.
And above all nights they'll be watching out for you this night, on account of the Sligomen.
#CONN.
They're decent enough fellows, as I said, and I'll be sorry to disappoint them.
#BRIAN.
The Sligomen will have great stories about Shawn Heffernan.
#CONN.
Shawn Heffernan! Is that impostor still alive?
#BRIAN.
He is, and for fiddling these Sligomen think there's not the like of him in the whole of Ireland.
#CONN.
God help them if that's all they know. We played against each other at the Granard Feis. He got the prize, but everybody knew that it was me played the best.
#BRIAN.
There's few of them alive now that mind of the Granard Feis. He got the prize, and there's no talk of you at all.
#CONN.
No talk of me at all?
#BRIAN.
It's said that since you settled down you lost your art.
#CONN.
And what had the men at Flynn's to say about that? BRIAN They bragged about you for a while, but the Sligomen put them down.
#CONN.
I wonder would we have time to go up, play a few tunes, and come back, while Maire would be doing something? It would be a pity not to give them fellows a lesson and close their ignorant mouths for them. I wonder would we have time? I thought you went somewhere and left Brian and myself here.
#ANNE.
We're going somewhere and Brian might come with us.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Every one is going to Moynihan's.
#CONN.
It's a pleasant house, a pleasant house. Brian will make his ceilidh with me. We might go over a few tunes.
#ANNE.
Let Brian come where there are girls that might miss him.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Anne, you're a great one for keeping up the story that girls are always thinking about men.
#ANNE.
And so they are. Just as men are always thinking about girls.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You'd make a good ribbonman. You'd put a face on anything you said.
#ANNE.
Ribbonism and secret societies were denounced off the altar.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Goodness! The men will begin to think they've secrets worth telling.
#ANNE.
Have you secrets worth telling, Brian?
#MARIE BRUIN.
I daresay he has. There are foolish women in the world.
#ANNE.
Are you coming to Moynihan's, Brian?
#BRIAN.
No. I'm going where there's men.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Come, Anne, till I deck you out. Come here, daughter, don't wear flowers. I think they're unlucky. Here I am talking like this, and I going to a dance. I suppose I'll dance with seven or eight and forget what's on my mind.... Everyone is going to Moynihan's except the men here. Are you going out, father?
#CONN.
I'm making a ceilidh with Brian.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Well, God be with you both. Come on, Anne. Maire takes down her shawl, and puts it over her head. She stands at the door, watching Anne, who goes to Brian.
#ANNE.
Brian, what have you against Moynihan's?
#BRIAN.
Nothing at all. I may go in. MAIRE Come on, Anne. God be with you both. Maire and Anne go out. They are heard talking for a while. Conn goes to the door.
#CONN.
Maire and Anne are turning the bohereen. Come on now. He takes his fiddle and begins to wrap it up eagerly.
#BRIAN.
Ay, let's go.
#CONN.
I never forget, I never forget. The Granard Feis is as fresh in my mind as the day I played at it. Shawn Heffernan, indeed! I never forget. I never forget. Conn Hourican and Brian MacConnell go out.
#MARIE BRUIN.
We shouldn't have stayed at Moynihan's so late.
#ANNE.
Indeed it would have been better to go home, but I was sure that Brian MacConnell would come in.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Well, it was his own loss if he didn't come. Maybe there was one there that I liked better.
#ANNE.
You couldn't have liked Connor Gilpatrick better than Brian MacConnell.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Connor's the best - looking boy in the country. Was it noticed that we were together often?
#ANNE.
Peggy Carroll noticed it.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Well, the boy was glad to talk to me. Connor's a good dancer, and he has fine talk besides. If Brian MacConnell had come to the door, I wouldn't have turned my head towards him.
#ANNE.
Sure, you wouldn't compare a young boy like Connor Gilpatrick with Brian MacConnell?
#MARIE BRUIN.
I wouldn't have turned my head towards Brian. O! never expect kindness from men. Why did you let me stay on? I'm afraid to look at myself in the glass to - day. You were hard on me, Anne, yesterday.
#ANNE.
I didn't like the way you talked to father.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I think I'm getting different to what I used to be. Well, I've reason to be sorry for what I did yesterday. Was Peggy Carroll vexed at the way I went on?
#ANNE.
She never took her eyes off the pair of you. You know she's very fond of Connor.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Anne, never remind me of my foolishness, I'm heartsick of myself to - day.
#ANNE.
I'll comb out your hair for you, and you'll look well enough.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Then you're expecting Brian MacConnell?
#ANNE.
It's likely he'll come in to see if there's anything to be done.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I suppose he'll come in. Gracious, how did father get out? He's coming up the path.
#ANNE.
Father's not up, surely? Maire, be easy with Brian MacConnell when he comes in.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Father's coming up the path. Anne!
#ANNE.
What is it, Maire?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Father wasn't in at all, last night.
#ANNE.
Then he went to Flynn's, after all.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Ay, he went to Flynn's. She goes to Anne.
#ANNE.
O Maire, what will become of us all?
#MARIE BRUIN.
I don't know. Maire goes to the settle, and sits down.
#ANNE.
What will we do with him at all? Conn Hourican comes in.
#CONN.
God save you! Well, I came back to ye.
#ANNE.
You did, God help us! And we depending on you. It's the bad way you always treated us.
#CONN.
Did you hear what happened to me, before you attack me?
#ANNE.
What happened to you? What always happens to you?
#CONN.
I wonder that a man comes in at all! The complaints against him are like the Queen's Speech, prepared beforehand.
#ANNE.
Ever since I can remember, you treated us like that. Bringing us into drinking - places and we little. It's well we got to know anything, or got into the way of being mannerly at all.
#CONN.
You know too much. I always said that. Is James Moynihan coming here to - day?
#ANNE.
No, he isn't coming here to - day.
#CONN.
Well, we can do without him. There's something to be done to - day. I said I'd do the bit of mowing, and I was thinking of that all along. Did you hear what happened to me, Maire?
#MARIE BRUIN.
It's no matter at all.
#CONN.
I went over to Flynn's, I may tell you.
#ANNE.
In troth we might have known that.
#CONN.
But did you hear what happened to me?
#ANNE.
How could we hear? It was Maire went to the door, and there you were coming up the path; and we thinking you were in bed, resting yourself.
#CONN.
I went over to Flynn's, but I had good reason for going there. Didn't you hear there were Sligomen in the town, Maire? Well, one of them was in the way of rewarding the prizes. I told you about the Feis; well, it's no matter now, I'll say no more about that. At all events the man I mentioned wanted to know what music was in the country, so he sent a message to myself.
#ANNE.
That was kind of him.
#CONN.
It was. I could do no less than go. I'll rest myself now, and then get ready for the mowing. Maire, I'm sorry you weren't on the spot. You might have advised me. I couldn't think of where you went or I'd have followed you. I had to make haste.
#MARIE BRUIN.
It's no matter at all now.
#CONN.
I'll stretch myself on the bed before I begin work. Anne, did you say you were leaving something in the room for me?
#ANNE.
I suppose I'll have to leave the tea in the room for you. She gets the tea ready. Maire remains motionless.
#CONN.
Well, I have the pattern of daughters, anyway. I wouldn't give this house for the praise of Ireland, no, not if they carried me on their backs. It's a pity you weren't there, Maire, though of course I wouldn't bring you into such a place. But they were decent fellows, decent, warm - hearted fellows. If you were to see their faces when I played An Chaitin Donn. I'll warrant they'll be whistling it, though they never heard the tune before. And the manners they have! I offered the fiddle to one of them. "No," says he, "not a string will I touch while the master of us is here." That's something like the spirit. But there, I won't fill myself up with false music telling you about it all. He turns to the room.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Bring up your fiddle.
#CONN.
It will be as good as sound sleeping for me. I'll never forget it. Flynn will never forget it. It will be the making of Flynn. Maire rises.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You've only your fiddle; we shouldn't forget that. Conn goes up to the room. Maire turns to the fire. Anne comes down.
#ANNE.
O Maire, what will become of us at all?
#MARIE BRUIN.
He is very pleased with himself. He has only his fiddle, we shouldn't forget that.
#ANNE.
It will be a long time till he does the like again.
#MARIE BRUIN.
It will be a long time, I suppose. Both of us might be in a different house and have different cares.
#ANNE.
That would be terrible. I'll never leave him, Maire. MAIRE You can't say the like now.
#ANNE.
Why?
#MARIE BRUIN.
How could you take such things upon you and life stretching out before you? You're not young enough, Anne. Besides, it's not what we say; it's what we feel. No, it's not what we feel either; it's what grows up in us.
#ANNE.
He might never do the like again.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Many's the time mother said that, and she and me lying together.
#ANNE.
Will we ever get out of it, Maire? James enters.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You have only a while to stay with us.
#ANNE.
O James, what will your father say if he hears of you giving us another day?
#JAMES.
My father took a stick in his hand this morning, and went off with himself.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You're welcome, James. It was a pleasant time we had in your house last evening.
#JAMES.
I hope you liked the company, Maire. I'm afraid there was very little to be called refined or scholarly, and the conversation at times was homely enough. But we did our best, and we were proud to see you.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Sit down, James. James sits on chair, near table. Maire is seated at fire, left of James. Anne leans against table, right of him.
#JAMES.
Your father is outside, maybe?
#MARIE BRUIN.
No. He's above in the room.
#JAMES.
Yes. Practising, I suppose. Them that have the gift have to mind the gift. In this country there isn't much thought for poetry, or music, or scholarship. Still, a few of us know that a while must be spared from the world if we are to lay up riches in the mind.
#ANNE.
I hope there's nothing wrong at home?
#JAMES.
To tell you the truth, Anne, and to keep nothing back, there is.
#MARIE BRUIN.
And what is it, James?
#JAMES.
Anne was talking to my father last night.
#ANNE.
Indeed I was, and I thought him very friendly to me.
#JAMES.
Ay, he liked you well enough, I can tell you that, Anne. This morning when he took a stick in his hand, I knew he was making ready for a journey, for the horse is laid up. "Walk down a bit with me," said he, "and we'll go over a few things that are in my mind." Well, I walked down with him, and indeed we had a serious conversation.
#ANNE.
Well?
#JAMES.
"Anne Hourican is too young," said my father; "she's a nice girl, and a good girl, but she's too young."
#MARIE BRUIN.
Sure in a while Anne will be twenty.
#JAMES.
Ten years from this father would still think Anne too young. And late marriages, as everybody knows, is the real weakness of the country.
#ANNE.
I thought your father liked me.
#JAMES.
He likes you well enough, but, as he says, "what would she be doing here and your sisters years older than herself?" There's truth in that, mind you. I always give in to the truth.
#MARIE BRUIN.
James?
#JAMES.
Well, Maire?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Is Anne a girl to be waiting twenty years for a man, like Sally Cassidy?
#JAMES.
God forbid, Maire Hourican, that I'd ask your sister to wait that length. MAIRE She hasn't got a fortune. We were brought up different to farmers, and maybe we never gave thought to the like.
#JAMES.
She has what's better than a fortune.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Why aren't your sisters married off?
#JAMES.
Big fortunes are expected with them.
#MARIE BRUIN.
And they look to your wife to bring a big fortune into the house?
#JAMES.
Ay, they do that.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You, James, ought to have some control in the house. You're the only son. Your father is well off. Get him to fortune off your sisters, and then bring Anne to the house.
#JAMES.
But how could I get father to fortune off the girls?
#MARIE BRUIN.
How? By wakening up. You have the right. When we have the right, we ought to be able to do anything we like with the people around us.
#JAMES.
I give in to the truth of that, Maire.
#MARIE BRUIN.
What will come of you giving in to the truth of it? But sure you ought to remember, Anne.
#ANNE.
James has the good way with people.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Well, I suppose it will come out right for you in the end. You are both very deserving. But some time or another we have to take things into our own hands.
#JAMES.
Indeed that's true, Maire. Maire goes to back.
#ANNE.
Did you make any more songs, James?
#JAMES.
I have a song in my head since last night.
#ANNE.
The one in the paper is lovely. I know it by heart.
#JAMES.
The next I make will be ten times better. Conn Hourican comes down.
#CONN.
I heard your voice, James, and I thought I'd come down. It's very good of you to come here again. I'll be out with you to - day.
#JAMES.
It'll be a good day from this on. Were you practising above, Mister Hourican?
#CONN.
Well, no, James, I wasn't practising. I was at a big gathering last night, and my hands are unstrung like. We'll talk for a while, and then I'll go out with you.
#ANNE.
Come out with me for a minute, James.
#JAMES.
I'll see you again, Mister Hourican. James and Anne go out,
#CONN.
Well, God help us. Are you going out, Maire?
#MARIE BRUIN.
No, I'm staying here.
#CONN.
Do you mind them two, how they went out together. I think I'll go out and see what's to be done about the place. Conn goes towards the entrance. Maire goes towards the fire.
#CONN.
I broke my word to you, Maire.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I don't know what to say to you now.
#CONN.
It was the music and the strange faces that drew me.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I know that now.
#CONN.
It will be a long time till I break my word to you again.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I'll never ask for your word again.
#CONN.
I can tell you this, Maire. There's many's the place in Ireland where Conn Hourican's word would be respected.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I'll never ask for your word again. You have only your fiddle, and you must go among people that will praise you. When I heard you talking of your listeners, I knew that. I was frightened before that. When I saw you coming, I went and sat there, and I thought the walls of the house were crowding in on me.
#CONN.
You were partly to blame, Maire. You left me there very lonesome.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I was to blame, I suppose. I should have treated you differently. Well, I know you better now. Let you sit down and we'll talk together. What's to become of myself I don't know. Anne and James Moynihan will marry, I hope. Neither of us have fortunes, and for that reason our house should be well spoken of.
#CONN.
Sure I know that. I wouldn't bring the shadow of a disgrace near ye.
#MARIE BRUIN.
If the father isn't well spoken of, how could the house be well spoken of? They're big drinkers that go to Flynn's, and it's easy for the fiddler to get into the way of drinking.
#CONN.
I won't go to Flynn's when you put it that way.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I'll ask for no word. I'll let you know the real way of the house, and then trust you.
#CONN.
You're a good girl, Maire. I should have been said by you.
#MARIE BRUIN.
From this out there will be dances at the schoolhouse and the like of that. You could be playing at them. CONN None of the oul' people go to the like, and the young don't understand me nor my ways. God knows will I ever play again. That thought is often with me of late, and it makes me very lonesome.
#MARIE BRUIN.
That's foolishness.
#CONN.
I was very lonesome when you left me. You don't know how I was tempted, Maire. There was Brian MacConnell putting on his coat to go to Flynn's, and talking of the Sligomen.
#MARIE BRUIN.
And was it to Flynn's that Brian MacConnell went?
#CONN.
It was Brian that brought me to Flynn's.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Was it Brian MacConnell that brought you to Flynn's?
#CONN.
It was.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You must never go to Flynn's.
#CONN.
I'm ashamed of myself. Didn't I say that, Maire?
#MARIE BRUIN.
You must never go again.
#CONN.
And is a man to have no life to himself?
#MARIE BRUIN.
That's talk just. It's time you thought of your own place and your own children. It's time you gave up caring for the praise of foolish people,
#CONN.
Foolish people, did you say?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Ay, foolish people. You had all your life to yourself, and you went here and there, straying from place to place, and caring only for the praise of foolish people.
#CONN.
God help you, if that's your way of thinking! Sure the world knows that a man is born with the gift, and isn't the gift then the sign of the grace of God? Foolish people, indeed! Them that know the gift have some of the grace of God, no matter how poor they may be.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You're always thinking of them. You never think of your own. Many's the time your own cried tears over your playing.
#CONN.
I'll go out of the house.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Let you stay here.
#CONN.
I'll go out of the house, I tell you.
#MARIE BRUIN.
No. Conn goes over to the fire.
#CONN.
God help me that ever came into this country at all. I had friends once, and was well thought of; I can tell you that, my daughter. I know that. CONN Well, you can have your own way with me now.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Why can't you stay here? There's lots to be done here. Our fields are a laughing - stock to the neighbours, they're that poor and wasted. Let us put all our minds into working, and have a good place of our own.
#CONN.
Ay, and the grabbers and informers of this place would think well of you then.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Who do you call grabbers and informers?
#CONN.
The people of this place. The people you want to shine before.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I don't want to shine before the people.
#CONN.
I'm not saying against you, Maire.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You're wrong in thinking I want to shine at all.
#CONN.
Sure you go to every dance and ceilidh; and to every house where you can show off your face, and dancing, and conversation.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Do I? Maybe I do. Every girl does the like.
#CONN.
I'm not saying against it. Pause.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You think I'm like yourself, wanting the praise of the people.
#CONN.
And what's the harm if you do?
#MARIE BRUIN.
No harm at all. But I don't go to houses to show myself off.
#CONN.
Troth and you do, Maire. He rises and goes towards the entrance, and remains looking out.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I won't believe it. She goes to the settle. Anne comes in. Anne goes to the glass to fix her hair.
#CONN.
Had you a good night at Moynihan's, Anne? sort of a good night.
#CONN.
I was going to tell you about a man I met last night. He had a song about your grandmother.
#ANNE.
Was grandmother a great beauty, father?
#CONN.
Honor Gilroy had good looks, and indeed she made the most of them.
#MARIE BRUIN.
It's likely there was some to tell her that she was showing off.
#CONN.
No one was to her liking unless they praised her.
#ANNE.
Ah well, a fiddler ought to forgive that to a woman. MAIRE Fiddlers and women are all alike, but don't say that to him. Anne goes to Maire and sits beside her.
#CONN.
Well, Honor Gilroy wasn't the worst, maybe.
#MARIE BRUIN.
And fiddlers and women oughtn't be hard on each other.
#CONN.
Do you say that, Maire?
#MARIE BRUIN.
I say it, father.
#CONN.
God forgive me if I vexed you, Maire.
#ANNE.
It's clearing up now, father, and you ought to go out to James. What did you say to him?
#MARIE BRUIN.
He doesn't feel it at all. Father will always be the fiddler, no matter what we say.
#ANNE.
Maire. Come and talk to me. I was talking to James. He'll never be happy until we're under the one roof. Maire clasps Anne's hands passionately.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Anne, daughter, I'll be very lonesome for you.
#ANNE.
But sure I won't be far off, Maire.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Ay, but it's terrible to face things alone. James has come to the door. Conn and James have been talking. They turn in.
#CONN.
But I'll be glad enough to have the scythe in my hands after it all, James.
#JAMES.
Anne was telling me how you took the victory from Connaught.
#CONN.
Still I'm sorry for him! That poor Heffernan! He'll never hold up his head again.
#JAMES.
Sure I'd have it in a ballad that would be sung in his own town. It would be well worth putting into a ballad.
#CONN.
Well indeed, it would make a right good ballad, James.
#JAMES.
I'd like to make a ballad about it, that would be sung all over Connaught.
#CONN.
And why wouldn't you do it, James Moynihan? Sure it would be the making of you. It would be sung all over Ireland, and your name to it. Do you hear that, Maire? Do you hear that, Anne?
#JAMES.
I'm saying that I'd like to do a ballad about your father's victory.
#CONN.
Maybe you could have it this night week, James? ANNE Will it be a poem or a ballad, James? Anne goes to him.
#CONN.
If you had it this night week, we could bring the boys to the place. What do you say to that, Maire? We'll bring the boys here this night week to hear James Moynihan's ballad.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I was thinking of the Feis at Ardagh.
#CONN.
The Feis at Ardagh?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Maybe you'll be going to it this night week.
#CONN.
Sure you're not joking with me, Maire?
#MARIE BRUIN.
No. She rises.
#CONN.
God forgive me, Maire, if I vexed you. Maire goes up to Conn's room.
#CONN.
Anne, jewel, had Maire anything to say about Ardagh?
#ANNE.
We weren't talking about that at all.
#JAMES.
Play me a rouse on the fiddle and maybe the ballad will come into my head. Maire comes down, a fiddle in her hands.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Here's the fiddle that was your favourite, the Granard fiddle.
#CONN.
And this is the fiddle I'll bring with me to Ardagh.
#ANNE.
And is he going to Ardagh?
#JAMES.
And what about the ballad, Mister Hourican?
#CONN.
I leave it all to Maire now. How well she bethought of the Granard fiddle.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Father, we were always together. She hands him the fiddle. Conn, Maire, James, Anne, are at table.
#CONN.
However it is, I could never play my best in this place. The houses are too scattered, I often think. And it doesn't do for the fiddler to remain too long in the one place. The people get too used to him. Virgil made better songs than any man, but if Virgil was sung in the fairs constant, divil much heed would be given to his songs.
#JAMES.
Now, I often thought of that.
#CONN.
Another thing, James Moynihan, Ribbonism and the Land League ruined the country. Maire goes out.
#JAMES.
But sure we must be doing something for the Cause.
#CONN.
They were all Fenians here when I came into this country first, over twenty years ago. He rises and goes into room.
#JAMES.
Well, he's a great man, Conn Hourican. How do you think you'll do at Ardagh?
#CONN.
I think I'll do very well at Ardagh, James. He leaves coat on settle.
#JAMES.
Everything's ready for the start.
#CONN.
Ay, and it's near time for going. I'm playing very well lately, James. It's the thought of being before people who'll know music. If I was staying in this place any longer, James, I'd put my fiddle in the thatch, and leave it there for the birds to pick holes in.
#JAMES.
But won't you be back here after the Feis at Ardagh?
#CONN.
Well, I will, for a while anyway. And would you be going off again after a while?
#CONN.
I'm thinking that when my daughters are settled I'll have the years before me. I was reared in a place south of this, and I'd like to go back there for a while.
#JAMES.
But wouldn't you come back to us?
#CONN.
There's many's the place in Ireland that I never saw, town and countryside. Tell me, James Moynihan, is your father satisfied with the settlement that Maire's making for yourself and Anne?
#JAMES.
My father is very well satisfied.
#CONN.
And so he ought to be, James Moynihan. Goes into his room.
#JAMES.
My father had always a great liking for Anne. May you never think, Anne, that you made the bad choice when you took James Moynihan. They sit on settle.
#ANNE.
Sure I was never fond of any one but yourself.
#JAMES.
And I never cared for any one after I saw you.
#ANNE.
I used to hear that you were fond of another girl.
#JAMES.
I was fond of the girl that used to be in the newspaper shop in the town.
#ANNE.
And used you to talk with her?
#JAMES.
The elbows were worn out of my coat with leaning on the counter to talk with her. But she married a policeman after that. He was a friend of mine, too. It was me that got him the words and music for "I'll hang my harp on a willow tree" - a song that he was always looking for.
#ANNE.
Did you make any songs about the girl?
#JAMES.
I did not.
#ANNE.
Oh, James, I'm glad of that. I'm glad you made no songs about her.
#JAMES.
Are you content to marry me in the town of Ardagh, after the Feis, as Maire wishes?
#ANNE.
It will be strange to be married in Ardagh, away from the people I know.
#JAMES.
It will be lucky getting married after the Feis.
#ANNE.
James, it's a great trial for a girl to face marriage; but, James, I'm very fond of you. James kisses her.
#JAMES.
I don't know what to think of them writers who say that the Irish girls haven't the heart for love.
#ANNE.
Is Maire outside?
#JAMES.
She went out.
#ANNE.
It's a wonder that Brian MacConnell isn't here before this. Anne rises. Maire comes in.
#ANNE.
Is there no one coming here?
#MARIE BRUIN.
There is no one on the road.
#ANNE.
Brian MacConnell is late in coming. Maire comes up to the fire. Anne stands with her. James goes to entrance, and remains looking out.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I saw Brian yesterday.
#ANNE.
And did you tell him that you were going at the sunset?
#MARIE BRUIN.
I told him we were going in the evening.
#ANNE.
Maybe you were distant with Brian?
#MARIE BRUIN.
He looked like a man that something had happened to. Connor Gilpatrick came up, and then I went away. Conn Hourican comes out of room. He has left the greatcoat in room. He brings the fiddle with him. Maire and Anne go to the settle. They talk.
#JAMES.
What would you think of a row of trees planted before the door? Conn leaves fiddle on dresser, and comes to him.
#CONN.
They might be very becoming, James.
#JAMES.
My father was saying that the front looked very bare. row of trees, when they'd grow, would make a great difference.
#JAMES.
That's what my father was saying. They talk, Conn leaning on the half - door.
#ANNE.
I'm glad to be here. It would be very strange for me to be married, and in another house.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I was thinking, Anne, that father and myself ought to stay a while on the road, till you and James get settled here.
#ANNE.
Listen, Maire. James says that he'll be giving this place back to you after a while. With this start he'll be able to get a house and land near his father's place. He has fine schemes for making this place prosperous. James, come here. Come here, James, and talk with Maire. James comes to girls, leaving Conn looking out. Maire rises.
#JAMES.
I'll make a path down to the road, and, with a row of trees before the door, the place will be well worth looking at.
#MARIE BRUIN.
We won't know the place after a while.
#JAMES.
We can never forget, Maire, that it is to you that we owe the place and the start in life.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I never looked on the place as my own.
#JAMES.
And now that the land is in Anne's name, my father will be glad to stock the place.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You have all our will of the place. Father, speak to James and tell him that he has your will of the place.
#CONN.
Indeed you have, James, and we're overglad to have Anne settled with a steady boy.
#JAMES.
Well, long life to you, Conn; and may the man of art never want fame nor a friend.
#CONN.
Drink to that, James. He takes up a bottle and fills two glasses.
#JAMES.
I never touch anything, Conn; but if Anne won't think bad of me, I'll drink to your prosperity.
#ANNE.
I won't be watching you at all. I'm going down the road, and if there's any one coming here, I'll let you know. Anne goes out. James takes the glass from Conn.
#JAMES.
Here's to the fiddler, first of all. May it be again like in the days of Ireland's glory, when the men of art had their rights and their dues. He drinks.
#CONN.
Long life to yourself, James Moynihan. I know you a long time now, and I know nothing to your discredit. You're one of the few people here that are to my liking. Well, if I'm nothing to them, they're nothing to me. I lived my own life, and I had the gift.
#JAMES.
If Anne was here, I'd drink to her. I must go after Anne. May she never repent of her choice. But sure I'm forgetting the jewel of them all, yourself, Maire Hourican. Long may you reign in splendour and success, and in the wish of your heart. James Moynihan goes out. Conn Hourican goes back to the door, and remains looking out. Maire stands at fire.
#CONN.
It's strange to be looking across that door, and the sun setting for our journey. And now we're letting the place go out of our hands. Well, Honor Gilroy's bit of land has been brought to a great many people. He comes down to dresser. Maire goes up to window, and remains looking out.
#CONN.
Is there any one coming here, Maire?
#MARIE BRUIN.
There is no one coming. It's no wonder James's father thought the place was bare - looking.
#CONN.
Well, the bit of land is going to James, and I was saying that it has been brought to a great many people. Maire takes paper out, and looks at it.
#CONN.
What paper is that, Maire?
#MARIE BRUIN.
It's a paper that I have to put my name to. There's a pen and ink near your hand on the dresser, and you might give them to me. It's about giving this place to Anne, and James's father wants my name on the paper.
#CONN.
Well, isn't James's father the councillor, with his paper and his signing? And does that give the place to Anne for ever?
#MARIE BRUIN.
It gives it to herself. It will be a great change for us when we come back to this place.
#CONN.
It will be a great change for you and me, no matter what we say.
#MARIE BRUIN.
And now that James's father is putting stock on the land, the Moynihans will have great call to the place.
#CONN.
Maire, your father is thinking of taking to the road.
#MARIE BRUIN.
And how long would you be staying on the roads?
#CONN.
Ah, what is there to bring me back to this country, Maire?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Sure you're not thinking of going on the roads altogether?
#CONN.
The road for the fiddler.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Would you leave the shelter and the settled life? Would you go on the road by yourself?
#CONN.
Anne and yourself will be settled, and I'll have the years before me.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Then you'd go on the roads by yourself?
#CONN.
Sure I did it before, Maire.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Ah, but do you not remember the prayers that mother used to say for us to get some shelter? Do you not remember how proud and glad we were when we come by a place of our own?
#CONN.
The shelter was for Anne and yourself. What had I to do with it?
#MARIE BRUIN.
The Moynihans are not the sort to make us feel strangers in the place.
#CONN.
The place was your own, Maire, and you gave it to your sister rather than see her waiting years and years.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I came to give it to her after I saw how hard I was on yourself.
#CONN.
Listen, my jewel, even if the Moynihans had nothing to do with the place, what would Conn Hourican the fiddler be doing in this country?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Ah, there are many you might play to; there are lots that know about music. There's Michael Gilpatrick and John Molloy -
#CONN.
And that's all, Maire. MAIRE You might go to Flynn's an odd time.
#CONN.
And what do they know about music in Flynn's? Young Corney Myles was up there a while ago, and you'd think, from what the men said, that there was never the like of Corney for playing, and the boy isn't three years at the fiddle,
#MARIE BRUIN.
Father, stay here where the shelter is.
#CONN.
Sure, I'd be getting ould, and staying in the chimney - corner, with no one to talk to me, for you'd be going to a place of your own, and Anne? after a while, would have too much to mind.
#MARIE BRUIN.
The people here are kinder than you think.
#CONN.
But what has Conn Hourican to do with them anyhow? The very greatest were glad of my playing, and were proud to know me.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I know that, father.
#CONN.
Well, one is always meeting new life upon the roads, and I want to spend the years I have before me going from place to place.
#MARIE BRUIN.
If you took to the roads, I'd think I ought to go with you, for we were always together.
#CONN.
Ah, Maire, there are some that would keep you here.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Do you know who would keep me here?
#CONN.
Brian MacConnell is very fond of you.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Do you know that, father?
#CONN.
And I know that you are fond of Brian. That my jewel may have luck and prosperity. I'll be taking this fiddle, Maire.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Oh, are we going on the roads?
#CONN.
To Ardagh, Maire.
#MARIE BRUIN.
To Ardagh.
#CONN.
I'll go up now, and make ready. He takes candle off table, and goes back towards room door.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Oh, what do I know about Brian MacConnell, after all?
#CONN.
Brian is wild, but he is free - handed.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Wild and free - handed! Are all men like that? Wild and free - handed! But that's not the sort of man I want to look to now.
#CONN.
That's nothing to Brian's discredit. MAIRE Ah, what do I know about Brian MacConnell, except that he's a man of quarrels and broken words? Conn holds up his hand warningly. Brian MacConnell comes to door.
#CONN.
You're welcome, Brian.
#BRIAN.
Thank you for the good word, Conn. He comes in.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You're welcome, Brian MacConnell.
#CONN.
I was going up to the room to make ready, but Maire will be glad to speak to you. I knew you wouldn't let us go without wishing us the luck of the road. Goes up to room. Maire goes and sits on settle.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Brian MacConnell has come to us again.
#BRIAN.
I'm before you again. Let me tell you what I was doing since I was here last.
#MARIE BRUIN.
What were you doing, Brian? Making quarrels, may be?
#BRIAN.
Why do you say that?
#MARIE BRUIN.
I'm thinking that you were doing what would become you, Brian MacConnell, with the free hand and the wild heart.
#BRIAN.
They were telling you about me?
#MARIE BRUIN.
I know you, Brian MacConnell.
#BRIAN.
You don't know how I care for you, or you couldn't talk to me like that. Many's the time I left the spade in the ground, and went across the bogs and the rushes, to think of you. You come between me and the work I'd be doing. Ay, and if Heaven opened out before me, you would come between me and Heaven itself.
#MARIE BRUIN.
It's easy taking a girl's heart.
#BRIAN.
And I long to have more than walls and a roof to offer you. I'd have jewels and gold for you. I'd have ships on the sea for you.
#MARIE BRUIN.
It's easy to take a girl's heart with the words of a song.
#BRIAN.
I'm building a house for you, Maire. I'm raising it day by day.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You left me long by myself.
#BRIAN.
It's often I came to see the light in the window.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Brian, my father wants to go back to the roads. Brian goes and sits by her.
#BRIAN.
I know that Conn would like to go back.
#MARIE BRUIN.
He wants to go on the roads, to go by himself from place to place.
#BRIAN.
Maybe he has the right to go.
#MARIE BRUIN.
He has the right to go. It's the life of a fiddler to be on the roads.
#BRIAN.
But you won't go on the roads.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Oh, what am I to do, Brian?
#BRIAN.
Do you think of me at all, Maire?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Indeed I think of you. Until to - day I'd neither laugh nor cry but on account of you.
#BRIAN.
I'm building a house, and it will be white and fine, and it's for you that I'm building the house.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You're going to ask for my promise.
#BRIAN.
Give me your promise before you go to Ardagh. Maire rises.
#MARIE BRUIN.
If I gave you my promise now, I'd have great delight in coming back to this place again.
#BRIAN.
You won't deny me, my jewel of love?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Oh, I'm very fond of Aughnalee. I feel that I was reared in the place. I'd like to live all my life in the place.
#BRIAN.
And why would you go from it? MAIRE You might come with us to Ardagh, Brian.
#BRIAN.
Your father might stay with us when he'd be in this country.
#MARIE BRUIN.
That's true; I'm glad to think on that.
#BRIAN.
Give me your promise, Maire.
#MARIE BRUIN.
We'll talk on the road. There's the blackbird. I'll hear him every evening on the road, and I'll think I'm a day nearer home.
#BRIAN.
Sure you'd leave them all to come with me.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Ay, I think I would. Do you know where I saw you first, Brian?
#BRIAN.
Where was it, Maire?
#MARIE BRUIN.
In a field by the road. You were breaking a horse.
#BRIAN.
I was always a good hand with a horse.
#MARIE BRUIN.
The poor beast was covered with foam and sweat, and at last you made it still. I thought it was grand then. She sings. I know where I'm going, I know who's going with me, I know who I love, But the dear knows who I'll marry. Are your brothers with you, Brian?
#BRIAN.
Is it building with me?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Building with you? She sings. Some say he's dark, I say he's bonny. He's the flower of the flock, My charming, coaxing Johnny.
#BRIAN.
No. My brothers are not with me. I quarrelled with them all and I am nearly heart broken for what I did.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Ah, Brian MacConnell, I don't know what to say to you at all.
#BRIAN.
You'll give me your promise, Maire?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Promise. I've no promise to give to any man.
#BRIAN.
Remember that these days past I had only yourself to think on.
#MARIE BRUIN.
There was never a man but failed me some time. They all leave me to face the world alone.
#BRIAN.
You said that I might go with you as far as Ardagh.
#MARIE BRUIN.
No. You're not to come. Myself and my father go to Ardagh by ourselves.
#BRIAN.
How was I to know that you would take that quarrel to heart?
#MARIE BRUIN.
I thought you were strong, but I see now that you are only a man who forces himself to harsh behaviour. I have my own way to go; my father wants to go back to the roads, and it's right that I should be with him, to watch over him.
#BRIAN.
What shelter will you have on the road?
#MARIE BRUIN.
I'll have the quiet of evening, and my own thoughts, and I'll follow the music; I'll laugh and hold up my head again.
#BRIAN.
Maire Hourican, would you leave me?
#MARIE BRUIN.
What can I do for you, Brian MacConnell? Brian goes to settle, and puts his hands before his eyes. She goes to him.
#BRIAN.
You have thought for your father, and you have no thought for me.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Indeed I have thought for you.
#BRIAN.
O Maire, my jewel, do you care for me at all? She kisses him.
#BRIAN.
Maire! She rises.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I'm going to call my father.
#BRIAN.
You go to him, and you go from me.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You are both my care: my father and yourself.
#BRIAN.
What will become of me when you go?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Isn't it right, Brian, that I should be with my father on the roads? Even if I was in your house, I would be thinking that I should watch over him.
#BRIAN.
Then it's good - bye you'd be saying?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Good - bye, Brian MacConnell.
#BRIAN.
Good - bye, Maire Hourican; gold and jewels, ships on the sea, may you have them all. He goes out. With a cry Maire follows him to the door. She stands before door for a minute, then she goes back to table, and throwing herself down, remains with her head buried in her hands. James Moynihan comes in. Maire raises her head, and remains looking before her. James comes to table, and puts flowers beside Maire.
#JAMES.
We gathered them for you, Maire. They're the woodbine. We were saying that you would be glad of the flower of the road. Anne remembers a good deal about the road. She minds of the grassy ditches, where the two of you used to catch the young birds.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I mind of them too.
#JAMES.
And the women that used to be with your mother, that used to tell you the stories.
#MARIE BRUIN.
And the things we used to talk about after a story! There's the turn of the road, and who's waiting for you? If it's your sweetheart, what will you say to him?
#JAMES.
I'm often taken with the thought of the road! Going to the fair on a bright morning, I'd often wish to leave everything aside and follow the road. A fiddle is heard outside. Conn Hourican comes down, dressed for the road. He has on the greatcoat. He carries fiddle. He puts fiddle on dresser.
#CONN.
What music is that, James?
#JAMES.
Some of the boys are coming to meet you, and they have a fiddle with them.
#CONN.
Well, now, that's friendly of the boys.
#JAMES.
I'll go out now, and let them know that you're coming. Brian MacConnell turned the other way, and Anne went after him. He goes out.
#CONN.
Why did Brian MacConnell go away?
#MARIE BRUIN.
We didn't agree; no, not after all you said.
#CONN.
Maybe we'll see Brian at Ardagh.
#MARIE BRUIN.
How would he ever come back when I bid him go from me?
#CONN.
You bid Brian go from you! And there was myself that had the mind to go on the road that I see stretched out before me.
#MARIE BRUIN.
You need never come back here.
#CONN.
I'll come back with yourself.
#MARIE BRUIN.
I remember the time when we were on the roads. I remember sights we used to see! Little towns here, and big towns far away, and always the road.
#CONN.
And the lasting kindness of the road!
#MARIE BRUIN.
There is no need for you to come back here, father.
#CONN.
And would you follow the road?
#MARIE BRUIN.
Go back to the fiddler's life, and I'll go back with you. Well see Anne and James at Ardagh, and we'll be at their marriage. It's right that this place should go to Anne. The house wasn't for you, and it wasn't for me either, I begin to think. Anne comes in.
#ANNE.
Maire, you are going on the roads!
#MARIE BRUIN.
How do you know that?
#ANNE.
You bid Brian MacConnell go from you, and where else would you go but on the roads? She goes to the settle and throws herself down, her hands before her face. Maire puts cloak on. Conn goes to Anne. He takes her hands from her face and holds them.
#CONN.
Don't be grieving that we're going from you, Anne. When you come back here again, your own care will begin. I know that you grieve for Maire going from you, and my own heart is unquiet for her. Well, here's Conn Hourican the fiddler going on his travels again. No man knows how his own life will end; but them who have the gift have to follow the gift. I'm leaving this house behind me; and maybe the time will come when I'll be climbing the hills and seeing this little house with the tears in my eyes. I'm leaving the land behind me, too; but what's land after all against the music that comes from the far, strange places, when the night is on the ground, and the bird in the grass is quiet? The fiddle is heard again. Conn Hourican goes to door. Maire embraces Anne again, rises and goes to door. Anne follows slowly. Conn goes out. Maire turns to Anne.
#MARIE BRUIN.
Tell Brian MacConnell that when we meet again maybe we can be kinder to each other. Maire Hourican goes out with Conn. Anne is left standing at the door in the dusk.
