#LORETTA.
No, I won't go fishing. It's too warm. Besides, the fish won't bite so early in the afternoon.
#NED.
Oh, come on. It's not warm at all. And anyway, we won't really fish. I want to tell you something.
#LORETTA.
You are always wanting to tell me something.
#NED.
Yes, but only in fun. This is different. This is serious. Our . my happiness depends upon it.
#LORETTA.
Then don't wait. Tell me right here.
#NED.
Shall I?
#LORETTA.
Yes.
#NED.
Loretta . I, . ever since I met you I have -
#NED.
Confound it
#LORETTA.
Ned! Why will you swear so?
#NED.
That isn't swearing.
#LORETTA.
What is it, pray?
#NED.
Displeasuring.
#JACK HEMINGWAY.
Squabbling again?
#LORETTA.
No, we're not.
#NED.
What do you want now?
#JACK HEMINGWAY.
Come on fishing.
#NED.
No. It's too warm.
#JACK HEMINGWAY.
You needn't take a fellow's head off.
#LORETTA.
I thought you wanted to go fishing.
#NED.
Not with Jack.
#LORETTA.
And you told me it wasn't warm at all.
#NED.
That isn't what I wanted to tell you, Loretta. Dear Loretta -
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Goodness! I thought you'd both gone fishing!
#LORETTA.
Is there anything you want, Alice?
#NED.
Anything I can do?
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
No, no. I only came to see if the mail had arrived. No, it hasn't arrived.
#LORETTA.
I am going to see.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
What have you been saying to her?
#NED.
Nothing.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Now listen to me, Ned.
#NED.
On my word, Alice, I've been saying nothing to her.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Then you ought to have been saying something to her.
#NED.
Look here, Alice, I know your game. You invited me down here to make a fool of me.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Nothing of the sort, sir. I asked you down to meet a sweet and unsullied girl - the sweetest, most innocent and ingenuous girl in the world.
#NED.
That's what you said in your letter.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
And that's why you came. Jack had been trying for a year to get you to come. He did not know what kind of a letter to write.
#NED.
If you think I came because of a line in a letter about a girl I'd never seen -
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
The poor, jaded, world - worn man, who is no longer interested in women . and girls! The poor, tired pessimist who has lost all faith in the goodness of women -
#NED.
For which you are responsible.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
I?
#NED.
You are responsible. Why did you throw me over and marry Jack?
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Do you want to know?
#NED.
Yes.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
First, because I did not love you. Second, because you did not love me. And third, because there were just about twenty - seven other women at that time that you loved, or thought you loved. That is why I married Jack. And that is why you lost faith in the goodness of women. You have only yourself to blame.
#NED.
You talk so convincingly. I almost believe you as I listen to you. And yet I know all the time that you are like all the rest of your sex - faithless, unveracious, and .
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Go on. I'm not afraid.
#NED.
And immoral.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Oh! You wretch!
#NED.
That's right. Get angry. You may break the furniture if you wish. I don't mind.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
And how about Loretta?
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
The depths of duplicity that must lurk under that sweet and innocent exterior . according to your philosophy!
#NED.
Loretta is an exception, I confess. She is all that you said in your letter. She is a little fairy, an angel. I never dreamed of anything like her. It is remarkable to find such a woman in this age.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
She is so naive.
#NED.
Yes, isn't she? Her face and her tongue betray all her secrets.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Yes, I have noticed it.
#NED.
Have you?
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
She cannot conceal anything. Do you know that she loves you?
#NED.
Do you think so?
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
And to think I once permitted you to make love to me for three weeks!
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
None for you, Ned. Tradesmen. Put them on the table, Josie.
#NED.
Loretta seems to have quite a correspondence.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Yes, as I used to when I was a girl.
#NED.
But hers are family letters.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Yes, I did not notice any from Billy.
#NED.
Billy?
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Of course she has told you about him?
#NED.
She has had lovers . already?
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
And why not? She is nineteen.
#NED.
This . er . this Billy . ?
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Now don't be alarmed, poor, tired philosopher. She doesn't love Billy at all.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Three letters for you.
#LORETTA.
Oh! Thank you.
#NED.
But Billy?
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
I am afraid he loves her very hard. That is why she is here. They had to send her away. Billy was making life miserable for her. They were little children together - playmates. And Billy has been, well, importunate. And Loretta, poor child, does not know anything about marriage. That is all.
#NED.
Oh, I see.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Are you going fishing, Loretta?
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Then you're not, I suppose?
#NED.
No, it's too warm.
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Then I know the place for you.
#NED.
Where?
#ALICE HEMINGWAY.
Right here.
#LORETTA.
Oh! I thought you were gone.
#NED.
I thought I'd stay and finish our conversation.
#LORETTA.
Yes, you were going to .
#NED.
I little dreamed when I came down here visiting that I was to meet my destiny in - gentleman to see you. He hasn't any card. He said for me to tell you that it was Billy.
#LORETTA.
Oh! . Ned! If you'll excuse me now, I'll wait till afterward to tell you what I wanted.
#LORETTA.
What shall I do?
#NED.
Don't you want to see him? Then don't.
#LORETTA.
I can't do that. We are old friends. We . were children together. Send him in. Don't go, Ned.
#NED.
I'll come back.
#BILLY.
Loretta!
#LORETTA.
You never said you were coming.
#BILLY.
I walked from the station.
#LORETTA.
If you had let me know, the carriage would have been sent for you.
#BILLY.
If I had let you know, you wouldn't have let me come.
#LORETTA.
Won't you sit down?
#BILLY.
Go on, just one. Why not? We're engaged.
#LORETTA.
We're not. You know we're not. You know I broke it off the day before I came away. And . and . you'd better sit down.
#BILLY.
That's what I came to see you for - to get engaged over again.
#BILLY.
Now look here, Loretta, I haven't any time to lose. I've got to leave for that train in ten minutes. And I want you to set the day.
#LORETTA.
But we're not engaged, Billy. So there can't be any setting of the day.
#BILLY.
But we're going to be. Oh, Loretta, if you only knew how I've suffered. That first night I didn't sleep a wink. I haven't slept much ever since. I walk the floor all night. Loretta, I don't eat enough to keep a canary bird alive. Loretta .
#LORETTA.
Billy, what you need is a tonic. Have you seen Doctor Haskins?
#BILLY.
Loretta, when a girl kisses a man, it means she is going to marry him.
#LORETTA.
I know it, Billy. But . Captain Kitt doesn't want me to marry you. He says .
#BILLY.
Never mind what Captain Kitt says. He wants you to stay and be company for your sister. He doesn't want you to marry me because he knows she wants to keep you.
#LORETTA.
Daisy doesn't want to keep me. She wants nothing but my own happiness. She says -
#BILLY.
Never mind what Daisy says -
#LORETTA.
And Martha says -
#BILLY.
Darn Martha and the whole boiling of them!
#LORETTA.
Oh, Billy!
#BILLY.
Darn isn't swearing, and you know it isn't.
#BILLY.
Never mind Captain Kitt, and Daisy, and Martha, and what they want. The question is, what do you want?
#LORETTA.
Oh, Billy, I'm so unhappy.
#BILLY.
The thing is, do you want to marry me? Just answer that.
#LORETTA.
Aren't you afraid you'll miss that train?
#BILLY.
Darn the train!
#LORETTA.
Oh, Billy!
#BILLY.
Darn isn't swearing. That's the way you always put me off. I didn't come all the way here for a train. I came for you. Now just answer me one thing. Do you want to marry me?
#LORETTA.
No, I don't want to marry you.
#BILLY.
But you've got to, just the same.
#LORETTA.
Got to?
#BILLY.
That's what I said - got to. And I'll see that you do.
#LORETTA.
I am no longer a child. You can't bully me, Billy Marsh!
#BILLY.
I'm not trying to bully you. I'm trying to save your reputation.
#LORETTA.
Reputation?
#BILLY.
Yes, reputation. Loretta, when a woman kisses a man, she's got to marry him.
#LORETTA.
Got to?
#BILLY.
It is the custom.
#LORETTA.
And when . a . a woman kisses a man and doesn't . marry him . ?
#BILLY.
Then there is a scandal. That's where all the scandals you see in the papers come from.
#LORETTA.
You are a good man, Billy. And I am a very wicked woman.
#BILLY.
No, you're not, Loretta. You just didn't know.
#LORETTA.
But you kissed me first.
#BILLY.
It doesn't matter. You let me kiss you.
#LORETTA.
But not at first.
#BILLY.
But you did afterward and that's what counts. You let me you in the grape - arbour. You let me -
#LORETTA.
Don't! Don't!
#BILLY.
- kiss you when you were playing the piano. You let me kiss you that day of the picnic. And I can't remember all the times you let me kiss you good night.
#LORETTA.
Not more than five.
#BILLY.
Eight at least.
#LORETTA.
You told me it was all right.
#BILLY.
So it was all right - until you said you wouldn't marry me after all. Then it was a scandal - only no one knows it yet. If you marry me no one ever will know it. I've got to go. Where's my hat?
#LORETTA.
This is awful.
#BILLY.
You bet it's awful. And there's only one way out. What do you say?
#LORETTA.
I must think. I'll write to you. The train? Your hat's in the hall.
#BILLY.
All right. You write to me. Write to - morrow. Remember, Loretta, there must be no scandal.
#NED.
There, there, little one, don't cry.
#LORETTA.
Oh, Ned, if you only knew how wicked I am.
#NED.
What is the matter, little one? Has your dearly beloved sister failed to write to you? Has Hemingway been bullying you? Then it must have been that caller of yours? Tell me what's the matter, and we'll see what I can do.
#LORETTA.
I can't. You will despise me. Oh, Ned, I am so ashamed.
#NED.
Let us forget all about it. I want to tell you something that may make me very happy. My fondest hope is that it will make you happy, too. Loretta, I love you -
#LORETTA.
Too late!
#NED.
Too late?
#LORETTA.
Oh, why did I? I was so young. I did not know the world then.
#NED.
What is it all about anyway?
#LORETTA.
Oh, I . he . Billy . I am a wicked woman, Ned. I know you will never speak to me again.
#NED.
This . er . this Billy - what has he been doing?
#LORETTA.
I . he . I didn't know. I was so young. I could not help it. Oh, I shall go mad, I shall go mad!
#NED.
I . I do not understand.
#LORETTA.
I am so unhappy!
#NED.
Why unhappy?
#LORETTA.
Because . he . he wants to marry me.
#NED.
That should not make any girl unhappy. Because you don't love him is no reason - Of course you don't love him? What?
#LORETTA.
No, I don't love Billy! I don't want to love Billy!
#NED.
Because you don't love him is no reason that you should be unhappy just because he has proposed to you.
#LORETTA.
That's the trouble. I wish I did love him. Oh, I wish I were dead.
#NED.
Now my dear child, you are worrying yourself over trifles. Women do it every day. Because you have changed your mind, or did not know you mind, because you have - to use an unnecessarily harsh word - jilted a man -
#LORETTA.
Jilted? Oh Ned, if that were a all!
#NED.
All!
#LORETTA.
But I don't want to marry him!
#NED.
Then I shouldn't.
#LORETTA.
But I ought to marry him.
#NED.
Ought to marry him? That is a strong word.
#LORETTA.
I know it is. I am a wicked woman. A terrible wicked woman. No one knows how wicked I am . except Billy.
#NED.
He . Billy knows? Tell me about it. You must tell me all of it.
#LORETTA.
All of it?
#NED.
Yes, all of it.
#LORETTA.
And . will . you . ever . forgive . me?
#NED.
Yes, I'll forgive you. Go ahead.
#LORETTA.
There was no one to tell me. We were with each other so much. I did not know anything of the world . then.
#NED.
Go on.
#LORETTA.
If I had only known.
#NED.
Yes, yes. Go on.
#LORETTA.
We were together almost every evening.
#NED.
Billy?
#LORETTA.
Yes, of course, Billy. We were with each other so much . If I had only known . There was no one to tell me . I was so young .
#NED.
The scoundrel!
#LORETTA.
Billy is not a scoundrel . He . he . is a good man.
#NED.
I suppose you'll be telling me next that it was all your fault. What!
#LORETTA.
It was all my fault. I should never have let him. I was to blame.
#NED.
All right. I don't blame you in the least, Loretta. And you have been very honest. It is . er . commendable. But Billy is right, and you are wrong. You must get married.
#LORETTA.
To Billy?
#NED.
Yes, to Billy. I'll see to it. Where does he live? I'll make him. If he won't I'll . I'll shoot him!
#LORETTA.
Oh, Ned, you won't do that?
#NED.
I shall.
#LORETTA.
But I don't want to marry Billy.
#NED.
You must. And Billy must. Do you understand? It is the only thing.
#LORETTA.
That's what Billy said.
#NED.
You see, I am right.
#LORETTA.
And if . if I don't marry him . there will be . scandal?
#NED.
Yes, there will be scandal.
#LORETTA.
That's what Billy said. Oh, I am so unhappy!
#LORETTA.
I don't want to leave Daisy! I don't want to leave Daisy! What shall I do? What shall I do? How was I to know? He didn't tell me. Nobody else ever kissed me. I never dreamed a kiss could be so terrible . until . until he told me. He only told me this morning.
#NED.
Is that what you are crying about?
#LORETTA.
N - no.
#NED.
Then what are you crying about?
#LORETTA.
Because you said I had to marry Billy. I don't want to marry Billy. I don't want to leave Daisy. I don't know what I want. I wish I were dead.
#NED.
Now look here, Loretta, be sensible. What is this about kisses? You haven't told me everything after all.
#LORETTA.
I . I don't want to tell you everything.
#NED.
You must.
#LORETTA.
Well, then . must I?
#NED.
You must.
#LORETTA.
He . I . we . I let him, and he kissed me.
#NED.
Go on.
#LORETTA.
He says eight, but I can't think of more than five times.
#NED.
Yes, go on.
#LORETTA.
That's all.
#NED.
All?
#LORETTA.
All?
#NED.
I mean . er . nothing worse?
#LORETTA.
Worse? As though there could be. Billy said -
#NED.
When?
#LORETTA.
This afternoon. Just now. Billy said that my . our . our . our kisses were terrible if we didn't get married.
#NED.
What else did he say?
#LORETTA.
He said that when a woman permitted a man to kiss her she always married him. That it was awful if she didn't. It was the custom, he said; and I say it is a bad, wicked custom, and it has broken my heart. I shall never be happy again. I know I am terrible, but I can't help it. I must have been born wicked.
#NED.
Do you mind if I smoke? I beg your pardon. I don't want to smoke. I didn't mean that at all. What I mean is .
#LORETTA.
No! No!
#NED.
What's the matter?
#LORETTA.
Would you make me a wickeder woman than I am? kiss?
#LORETTA.
There will be another scandal. That would make two scandals.
#NED.
To kiss the woman I love . a scandal?
#LORETTA.
Billy loves me, and he said so.
#NED.
Billy is a joker . or else he is as innocent as you.
#LORETTA.
But you said so yourself.
#NED.
I?
#LORETTA.
Yes, you said it yourself, with your own lips, not ten minutes ago. I shall never believe you again.
#NED.
And I am a joker, too, and a very wicked man. Nevertheless, you must trust me. There will be nothing wrong.
#LORETTA.
And no . scandal?
#NED.
Scandal fiddlesticks. Loretta, I want you to be my wife.
#NED.
You might say something.
#LORETTA.
I will . if .
#NED.
Yes, go on.
#LORETTA.
If I don't have to marry Billy.
#NED.
You can't marry both of us!
#LORETTA.
Then, Ned, I cannot marry you.
#NED.
W - what?
#LORETTA.
Because I can't marry both of you.
#NED.
Bosh and nonsense!
#LORETTA.
I'd like to marry you, but .
#NED.
There is nothing to prevent you.
#LORETTA.
Oh, yes, there is. You said yourself that I had to marry Billy. You said you would s - s - shoot him if he didn't.
#NED.
Nevertheless .
#LORETTA.
And it isn't the custom . what . Billy said?
#NED.
No, it isn't the custom. Now, Loretta, will you marry me?
#LORETTA.
Don't be angry with me, Ned. I wish it were the custom, because now I'd have to marry you, Ned, wouldn't I?
#LORETTA.
I don't care. written for Robert and Julia Fitzsimmons
#MAUD.
Not a soul saw me. I wonder where everybody is. And that big brother of mine said I could not get in. "Here is my card, Maudie. If you can use it, go ahead. But you will never get inside the door. I consider my bet as good as won." You do, do you? Oh, if you could see your little sister now. Here she is, inside. So this is the West Bay Athletic Club. No women allowed. Well, here I am, if I don't look like one. "Robert Fitzsimmons, the greatest warrior of them all." Oh, you dear! Well, I'll go out like a girl, if I did come in like a man. Mercy! Here comes somebody now!
#FITZSIMMONS.
"Maudie. John H. Sylvester." That must be Jack Sylvester's sister Maud. Hello! Hello! Hello!
#MAUD.
H - h - hello!
#FITZSIMMONS.
You are a queer one, reading a paper upside down.
#MAUD.
It's quite a trick, isn't it? I often practise it. I'm real clever at it, you know.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Seems to me I have seen you before.
#MAUD.
Yes, and I know you - You are Robert Fitzsimmons.
#FITZSIMMONS.
I thought I knew you.
#MAUD.
Yes, it was out in San Francisco. My people still live there. I'm just - ahem - doing New York.
#FITZSIMMONS.
But I don't quite remember the name.
#MAUD.
Jones - Harry Jones.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Sure.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Glad to see you, Harry. Glad to see you again, Harry.
#MAUD.
Ye - es, er . Bob . er . glad to see you again.
#FITZSIMMONS.
You were a wild young rascal in those San Francisco days. Lord, Lord, how it all comes back to me.
#MAUD.
I was wild - some.
#FITZSIMMONS.
I should say! Remember that night I put you to bed?
#MAUD.
Sir!
#FITZSIMMONS.
You were . er . drunk.
#MAUD.
I never was!
#FITZSIMMONS.
Surely you haven't forgotten that night! You began with dropping champagne bottles out of the club windows on the heads of the people on the sidewalk, and you wound up by assaulting a cabman. And let me tell you I saved you from a good licking right there, and squared it with the police. Don't you remember?
#MAUD.
Yes, it is beginning to come back to me. I was a bit tight that night.
#FITZSIMMONS.
A bit tight! Why, before I could get you to bed you insisted on telling me the story of your life.
#MAUD.
Did I? I don't remember that.
#FITZSIMMONS.
I should say not. You were past remembering anything by that time. You had your arms around my neck -
#MAUD.
Oh!
#FITZSIMMONS.
And you kept repeating over and over, "Bob, dear Bob."
#MAUD.
Oh! I never did! Perhaps I must have. I was a trifle wild in those days, I admit. But I'm wise now. I've sowed my wild oats and steadied down.
#FITZSIMMONS.
I'm glad to hear that, Harry. You were tearing off a pretty fast pace in those days. Still punch the bag?
#MAUD.
No, I've got out of the hang of it.
#FITZSIMMONS.
You haven't forgotten that right - and - left, arm, elbow and shoulder movement I taught you?
#MAUD.
N - o - o.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Then, come on.
#MAUD.
I'd rather see you punch the bag. I'd just love to.
#FITZSIMMONS.
I will, afterward. You go to it first.
#MAUD.
No; you. I'm out of practice.
#FITZSIMMONS.
How many drinks have you had to - night?
#MAUD.
Not a one. I don't drink - that is - er - only occasionally.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Then go to it.
#MAUD.
No; I tell you I am out of practice. I've forgotten it all. You see, I made a discovery.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Yes?
#MAUD.
I - I - you remember what a light voice I always had - almost soprano?
#MAUD.
Well, I discovered it was a perfect falsetto.
#MAUD.
I've been practising it ever since. Experts, in another room, would swear it was a woman's voice. So would you, if you turned your back and I sang.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Look here, kid, I think you are an impostor. You are not Harry Jones at all.
#MAUD.
I am, too.
#FITZSIMMONS.
I don't believe it. He was heavier than you.
#MAUD.
I had the fever last summer and lost a lot of weight.
#FITZSIMMONS.
You are the Harry Jones that got sousesd and had to be put to bed?
#MAUD.
Y - e - s.
#FITZSIMMONS.
There is one thing I remember very distinctly. Harry Jones had a birth mark on his knee.
#MAUD.
Yes, right here.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Wrong. It was the other knee.
#MAUD.
I ought to know.
#FITZSIMMONS.
You haven't any birth mark at all.
#MAUD.
I have, too.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Then we'll prove it. Let me see.
#MAUD.
Fancy his wanting to see my birth mark.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Then take a go at the bag. You're not Harry Jones.
#MAUD.
I am, too.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Then hit it.
#MAUD.
Oh! I told you I was out of practice. You punch the bag, Bob.
#FITZSIMMONS.
I will, if you will show me what you can do with that wonderful soprano voice of yours.
#MAUD.
I don't dare. Everybody would think there was a woman in the club.
#FITZSIMMONS.
No, they won't. They've all gone to the fight. There's not a soul in the building.
#MAUD.
Not - a - soul - in - the building?
#FITZSIMMONS.
Not a soul. Only you and I.
#MAUD.
Then I must go.
#FITZSIMMONS.
What's your hurry? Sing.
#MAUD.
Let me see you punch the bag, - er - Bob.
#FITZSIMMONS.
You sing first.
#MAUD.
No; you punch first.
#FITZSIMMONS.
I don't believe you are Harry -
#MAUD.
All right, I'll sing. You sit down over there and turn your back.
#MAUD.
"Robert Fitzsimmons." That will prove to my brother that I have been here.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Hurry up.
#MAUD.
How did you like it?
#FITZSIMMONS.
Rotten. Anybody could tell it was a boy's voice -
#MAUD.
Oh!
#FITZSIMMONS.
It is rough and coarse and it cracked on every high note.
#MAUD.
Oh! Oh! Oh, very well. Now let's see if you can do any better with the bag.
#MAUD.
Beautiful! Beautiful! Nothing like the bag to limber one up. I feel like a fighting cock. Harry, let's go out on a toot, you and I.
#MAUD.
Wh - a - a - t? toot. You know - one of those rip - snorting nights you used to make.
#MAUD.
I'll do nothing of the sort. I've - I've reformed.
#FITZSIMMONS.
You used to joy - ride like the very devil.
#MAUD.
I know it.
#FITZSIMMONS.
And you always had a pretty girl or two along.
#MAUD.
Oh, I still have my fling. Do you know any - well, - er, - nice girls?
#FITZSIMMONS.
Sure.
#MAUD.
Put me wise.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Sure. You know Jack Sylvester?
#MAUD.
He's my brother -
#FITZSIMMONS.
What! MAUD. - In - law's first cousin.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Oh!
#MAUD.
So you see I don't know him very well. I only met him once - at the club. We had a drink together.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Then you don't know his sister?
#MAUD.
His sister? I - I didn't know he had a sister.
#FITZSIMMONS.
She's a peach. A queen. A little bit of all right. A - a loo - loo.
#MAUD.
She is, is she?
#FITZSIMMONS.
She's a scream. You ought to get acquainted with her.
#MAUD.
You know her, then?
#FITZSIMMONS.
You bet.
#MAUD.
Oh, ho! Know her very well?
#FITZSIMMONS.
I've taken her out more times than I can remember. You'll like her, I'm sure.
#MAUD.
Thanks. Tell me some more about her.
#FITZSIMMONS.
She dresses a bit loud. But you won't mind that. And whatever you do, don't take her to eat.
#MAUD.
Why not?
#FITZSIMMONS.
I never saw such an appetite -
#MAUD.
Oh!
#FITZSIMMONS.
It's fair sickening. She must have a tapeworm. And she thinks she can sing.
#MAUD.
Yes?
#FITZSIMMONS.
Rotten. You can do better yourself, and that's not saying much. She's a nice girl, really she is, but she is the black sheep of the family. Funny, isn't it?
#MAUD.
Yes, funny.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Her brother Jack is all right. But he can't do anything with her. She's a - a -
#MAUD.
Yes. Go on. holy terror. She ought to be in a reform school.
#MAUD.
Oh! Oh! Oh! You liar! She isn't anything of the sort!
#FITZSIMMONS.
Now I'm going to put a head on you. You young hoodlum.
#MAUD.
Don't! Please don't! I'm sorry! I apologise. I - I beg your pardon, Bob. Only I don't like to hear girls talked about that way, even - even if it is true. And you ought to know.
#FITZSIMMONS.
You've changed a lot, I must say.
#MAUD.
I told you I'd reformed. Let us talk about something else. Why is it girls like prize - fighters? I should think - ahem - I mean it seems to me that girls would think prize - fighters horrid.
#FITZSIMMONS.
They are men.
#MAUD.
But there is so much crookedness in the game. One hears about it all the time.
#FITZSIMMONS.
There are crooked men in every business and profession. The best fighters are not crooked.
#MAUD.
I - er - I thought they all faked fights when there was enough in it.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Not the best ones.
#MAUD.
Did you - er - ever fake a fight?
#FITZSIMMONS.
Yes. Once.
#MAUD.
And I always heard of you and thought of you as the one clean champion who never faked.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Let me tell you about it. It was down in Australia. I had just begun to fight my way up. It was with old Bill Hobart out at Rushcutters Bay. I threw the fight to him.
#MAUD.
Oh! I could not have believed it of you.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Let me tell you about it. Bill was an old fighter. Not an old man, you know, but he'd been in the fighting game a long time. He was about thirty - eight and a gamer man never entered the ring. But he was in hard luck. Younger fighters were coming up, and he was being crowded out. At that time it wasn't often he got a fight and the purses were small. Besides it was a drought year in Australia. You don't know what that means. It means that the rangers are starved. It means that the sheep are starved and die by the millions. It means that there is no money and no work, and that the men and women and kiddies starve. Bill Hobart had a missus and three kids and at the time of his fight with me they were all starving. They did not have enough to eat. Do you understand? They did not have enough to eat. And Bill did not have enough to eat. He trained on an empty stomach, which is no way to train you'll admit. During that drought year there was little enough money in the ring, but he had failed to get any fights. He had worked at long - shoring, ditch - digging, coal - shovelling - anything, to keep the life in the missus and the kiddies. The trouble was the jobs didn't hold out. And there he was, matched to fight with me, behind in his rent, a tough old chopping - block, but weak from lack of food. If he did not win the fight, the landlord was going to put them into the street.
#MAUD.
But why would you want to fight with him in such weak condition?
#FITZSIMMONS.
I did not know. I did not learn till at the ringside just before the fight. It was in the dressing rooms, waiting our turn to go on. Bill came out of his room, ready for the ring. "Bill," I said - in fun, you know. "Bill, I've got to do you to - night." He said nothing, but he looked at me with the saddest and most pitiful face I have ever seen. He went back into his dressing room and sat down. "Poor Bill!" one of my seconds said. "He's been fair starving these last weeks. And I've got it straight, the landlord chucks him out if he loses to - night." Then the call came and we went into the ring. Bill was desperate. He fought like a tiger, a madman. He was fair crazy. He was fighting for more than I was fighting for. I was a rising fighter, and I was fighting for the money and the recognition. But Bill was fighting for life - for the life of his loved ones. Well, condition told. The strength went out of him, and I was fresh as a daisy. "What's the matter, Bill?" I said to him in a clinch. "You're weak." "I ain't had a bit to eat this day," he answered. That was all. By the seventh round he was about all in, hanging on and panting and sobbing for breath in the clinches, and I knew I could put him out any time. I drew back my right for the short - arm jab that would do the business. He knew it was coming, and he was powerless to prevent it. "For the love of God, Bob," he said; and -
#MAUD.
Yes? Yes?
#FITZSIMMONS.
I held back the blow. We were in a clinch. "For the love of God, Bob," he said again, "the misses and the kiddies!" And right there I saw and knew it all. I saw the hungry children asleep, and the missus sitting up and waiting for Bill to come home, waiting to know whether they were to have food to eat or be thrown out in the street. "Bill," I said, in the next clinch, so low only he could hear. "Bill, remember the La Blanche swing. Give it to me, hard." We broke away, and he was tottering and groggy. He staggered away and started to whirl the swing. I saw it coming. I made believe I didn't and started after him in a rush. Biff! It caught me on the jaw, and I went down. I was young and strong. I could eat punishment. I could have got up the first second. But I lay there and let them count me out. And making believe I was still dazed, I let them carry me to my corner and work to bring me to. Well, I faked that fight.
#MAUD.
Thank God! Oh! You are a man! A - a - a hero!
#FITZSIMMONS.
Let's have a smoke.
#MAUD.
I can't tell you how glad I am you told me that.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Forget it.
#MAUD.
What are you going to do?
#FITZSIMMONS.
Call the police.
#MAUD.
What for?
#FITZSIMMONS.
For you.
#MAUD.
For me?
#FITZSIMMONS.
You are not Harry Jones. And not only are you an impostor, but you are a thief.
#MAUD.
How dare you?
#FITZSIMMONS.
You have stolen my cigarette case.
#MAUD.
Here it is.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Too late. It won't save you. This club must be kept respectable. Thieves cannot be tolerated.
#MAUD.
But you won't have me arrested?
#FITZSIMMONS.
I certainly will.
#MAUD.
Please! Please!
#FITZSIMMONS.
I see no reason why I should not.
#MAUD.
I'll give you a reason - a - a good one. I - I - am not Harry Jones.
#FITZSIMMONS.
A good reason in itself to call in the police.
#MAUD.
That isn't the reason. I'm - a - Oh! I'm so ashamed.
#FITZSIMMONS.
I should say you ought to be.
#MAUD.
Stop! I'm a - I'm a - a girl. There!
#MAUD.
I only wanted your cigarette case to prove to my brother that I had been here. I - I'm Maud Sylvester, and you never took me out once. And I'm not a black sheep. And I don't dress loudly, and I haven't a - a tapeworm.
#FITZSIMMONS.
I knew you were Miss Sylvester all the time.
#MAUD.
Oh! You brute! I'll never speak to you again.
#FITZSIMMONS.
You'll let me see you safely out of here.
#MAUD.
Ye - e - s. Thank you.
#FITZSIMMONS.
Here's the cigarette case. You may k - k - keep it.
#MAUD.
I thank you - er - Bob. I shall treasure it all my life. Why, I do believe you're bashful. What is the matter?
#FITZSIMMONS.
Why - I - you - You are a girl - and - a - a - deuced pretty one.
#MAUD.
But you knew it all along.
#FITZSIMMONS.
But it's somehow different now when you've got your girl's clothes on.
#MAUD.
But you weren't a bit bashful - or nice, when - you - you - Were so anxious about birth marks.
