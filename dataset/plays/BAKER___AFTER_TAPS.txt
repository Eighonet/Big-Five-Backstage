#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Another thousand of Maine's boys marching down into Dixie. Bless their dear hearts! If this keeps on much longer, there will be none left for the hopeful Down - East girls and full - blown spinsters, whose natural expectations are warm corners in the hearts of these brave heroes. What a queer lot of men. Some have left their sweethearts behind them, I suppose. Heigho! There's no one to leave me behind. When I think of the good times Down East, it just makes my mouth water. I'd give a week's wages to catch a glimpse of some familiar face. I wish I were a man. Nothing I'd like better than to join those ranks and march with them; but here I must stay and dust chairs and tables. I know the military tic - tacs—no, that isn't right. I mean tactics. Present—arms—no—feathers. Order—feathers. Indeed, I'd like to, for my next winter's bonnet, if there were only some one to pay the bill. Right shoulder, feathers. Ha, ha, if any one could see me now, they would take me for a condensed, awkward squad. I can feel the military thrill down to the tips of my toes. Think of the excitement when the bugle calls, and you hear the cry, “Charge feathers—charge!”
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Phew! pooh—ah, choh! What are you trying to do, smother a fellow? Giving us the great Othello act, with me as Desdemona! Why, no!—yes, it is, Polly—Polly Primrose.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Bijah Bright! Well, I declare!
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Why, the sight of you is good for a pair of diseased optics.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
But why are you here in this house?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
It must have been the magnetism of your bright eyes, Polly. When I was marching along, I felt so drawn towards this house, sez I to myself, sez I, here, Bijah, is the place to find rest for your weary bones, and rations for an aching void. And, behold, I find you, my long - lost treasure. Ah, Polly Primrose, the way you've played tag with that vital organ of my being, the heart that beats for you alone, would frighten any other man, but I've jest made up my mind,—
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Don't be so sure of that, Mr. Bright. Don't flatter yourself that you are the only man that calls me, “My Polly.”
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Let me but find him. He'll wish he hadn't been born.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Same Bijah Bright. Don't be worried , for I think you will find me the same Polly.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Wal, now, that's something like. When the temperature of your society is at zero, it makes my very blood congeal.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Where did you come from?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Right from Oldtown, Polly, chuck full of patriotism and peace.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Seems to me those two words don't jine well, Bijah. Patriotism and fight make the best partnership.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
The fighting is all wrong, Polly. Do you see that flag? You bet, I'm proud of it. I've made a big wager that I can carry that flag from Oldtown to New Orleans.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
How do you get along?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Thus far, swimmingly; from Oldtown to Baltimore has been a triumphant march, but just here I've struck something.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
From the looks of that eye, and the mud on that coat, I should say something had struck you. Bijah, you're a crank. Your peace and flag won't stir anything down this way. If you are not both suspended from a tree before you reach New Orleans, you may think yourself lucky. If your wits were as sharp and dazzling as your name, you would shoulder your gun and join that regiment.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Oh, Polly, you're way off. No such work for me. I am the Standard Bearer. Think of the glory that will shine like a halo about my name. When posterity shall gently drop a tear for memory's sake, and in the language of the poet thus speak of one you knew so well:
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
I declare, Bijah, jest as much of a poet as ever. Do you remember some of your poetry at the exhibition of the Oldtown School?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Indeed I do. When old Deacon Sasafrass visited the school he always wanted something original; so, one day, thought I'd give it to him. Let me think—yes, I have it. Ha, ha, Polly! Those were good times in Oldtown. Do you remember them?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Do I? Don't I?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
When I thought you were the purtiest girl in town; when the sight of you in your best bib and tucker made me feel as though there were an ice - cream factory in full operation on one side, and a hot air furnace on the other.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Oh, Bijah!
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
But times are changed. The girls are changed, but you, Polly, are still a purty—
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Oh, Bijah!
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Old girl.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Bijah!
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Now, don't get excited, Polly; I'm by no means a blooming flower in the garden of youth myself. I've lived long enough to find out that money is the root of all evil; that an old rat is more capable from experience of keeping out of traps than a young one; that life may be worth living, but it isn't worth much of anything else; that an old sweetheart is at least a blessed memory; and so, when this cruel war is over, I'm going to lay my heart at the feet of—Miss Polly Primrose.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Oh, Bijah!
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
In the meantime, as I am rather hungry, a bite of something from the cupboard wouldn't go bad.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Then come with me.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Thanks, Polly; but before I accept of your hospitality, who is the proprietor of this establishment?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Colonel Gordon Graham.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
What? You don't mean it. Here's luck. That grand old fellow?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Do you know him?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Know him? Wal, I guess. Shot in the back. A dastardly trick.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Bijah, give me your hand; you are my friend for life. The colonel is one of the bravest and best of men. The shot that brought him down could not keep him there: for, beckoning to two of his men, he was carried in their arms to the head of his regiment; and, waving his sword, led them on, driving the enemy in all directions. Mr. Randolph Newcomb, one of the fine gentlemen of the city, professes great friendship for the colonel; but, I've heard it whispered about, that he tries to make him out a coward. Oh, I just hate him.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
He does, does he? I say, Polly, do they ever speak of Roger Carruth?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Law, no; poor Miss Dorothy. She's just as bright as ever: but mind you, way down deep, she just grieves and grieves. I know, for I've seen her, when she thought she was alone. You see, Mr. Newcomb is down on Mr. Roger, and he is so intimate with the colonel, who believes that he is something of a saint, that he has made the colonel down on him too. That just breaks poor Mrs. Graham's heart, for Mr. Roger is her brother, you know. I should think Mr. Roger might send Miss Dorothy some word, at least, and not leave her to fret her heart out. Oh, these men, they make me tired. Haven't a thought for any one besides themselves.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Hush, Polly, don't say that. Haven't I marched from Oldtown just to catch a glimpse of your sweet face?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Indeed you haven't. You've done all that for glory, or, for all I know, some other girl.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Oh, come, Polly, don't be hard on a fellow. You don't know how much stock you hold in that tender heart of mine. Its value is getting higher; better hold on to it, or some day, when the war is over, and it is above par, you will wish that you hadn't sold out. Besides, Polly, don't be down on Roger Carruth; he's “pure gold.” He'll come to the front one of these days, and Mr. Randolph Newcomb won't stand the fire.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
What do you know about Mr. Newcomb, Bijah?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Never you mind. Sufficient unto the day, is the gossip thereof. And O Polly, while that heart of mine is beating a regular nightly tattoo for you on one side, the other organ of my being, the stomach, in the most unromantic manner is clamoring for mid - day rations.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Poor thing, so active a poetical brain should not be allowed to starve. Come with me.
#DOROTHY.
Well done, Pinky, that last leap was too much for you. That's your punishment for insisting upon pouring into my tired ears, a whole battalion of pretty speeches. Pride must have a fall. If your shots in battle do not find a more responsive target, your record will not be an enviable one.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
How can I help it? Such bright eyes and glowing cheeks cannot but provoke such thoughts to utterance. I say, Miss Dorothy, you do like a fellow, just a little, don't you?
#DOROTHY.
Like you? Indeed yes. You are one of the nicest men I know. There is a large corner of my heart quite devoted to you.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Well, to be liked is something. But, if you only knew, how much I thought of you by day, and dreamed of you by night.
#DOROTHY.
Ha, ha! to think of Pinky Potts assuming the sentimental rôle. Dear me. I never dreamed of such a thing. Why, you are too old a friend. What should I do, if I were to fall in love with you? It would spoil all the fun, and now, you are my devoted slave.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
What's the matter with my being in love and playing the devoted too?
#DOROTHY.
Never. Now, Pinky, you are just the dearest fellow in the world, and I am awfully fond of you; you are no end jolly. So come , let's be friends forever, and keep sentiment out of the question. And you know, Pinky, I can never forget Roger Carruth.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
No, Miss Dorothy, and I would not have you. Roger and I are too old friends. I would not mar his happiness or yours, for all the world.
#DOROTHY.
Well said, my noble major. Some day a fascinating little woman will cross your path who won't say “nay” to your devotion. I hope it will be some one that I shall know, Pinky, for I shall love her with my whole heart. When the war is over and Roger comes back—he will come back, won't he, Pinky?
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Indeed he will. Never doubt his loyalty, and some day you will have your reward. Roger is under a heavy cloud, but penetrated by the warmth of your love it will in time disperse. Then, Miss Dorothy, you will say “good - by” to tears, and revel in the happiness and sunshine about you.
#DOROTHY.
Pinky, you were wrongly named. You are true blue every time. Pinky, come here. Do you see that man walking with the Colonel and Mrs. Graham? That is Mr. Randolph Newcomb—and—I don't like him.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
What, that beastly cad? don't blame you.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Good - morning, major. Ah, Dorothy, you here? What a glorious morning for a ride. I see you have taken advantage of it. But major, your appearance indicates a mishap—nothing serious, I hope?
#DOROTHY.
He made a thrilling leap, but missed the mark. O Ruth, I wish you could have seen his lordship ignominiously turning a somersault in the mire. Don't be surprised, if the next news that you hear is that Major Pinkerton Potts, formerly officer in the Union Army, had reached the zenith of success, and was now dazzling all Europe by his acrobatic feats. Pinky, don't forget your old friends when fortune smiles upon you, and send us a box.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Yes, Newcomb, I must rejoin my regiment to - day. No more holidays for me. The wound is healing. Back again with my men, breathing the atmosphere of patriotism, strength will return to me. Ah, Newcomb, a glorious cause. I wish you were on our side.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Glad to see you, major; our time is up, old fellow. Ah, been for a ride with madcap Dorothy? I tell you, major, if every man in the regiment was fired with the enthusiasm which this brave - hearted girl possesses, we should have no deserters. Major, allow me to introduce my friend, Mr. Randolph Newcomb.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Newcomb, since you are not on our side, I cannot say “Come and join us” in the fight. No doubt, you are doing your duty equally well, by remaining here.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
There is other work besides fighting, Colonel, and mine lies close at hand.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
True. And that reminds me of mine. Come, major, escort me to my room. We will talk over the plans for our return. Dorothy, dear, I must lean upon you, too. Ruth, I leave Mr. Newcomb to your kind care. Good - morning, Newcomb.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Won't you be seated, Mr. Newcomb?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
The colonel insists upon a return; do you think this wise, Mrs. Graham?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
His heart is so full of patriotism, every hour's delay irritates him. Since he cannot be persuaded, I think it wiser to let him go. Yet, I fear for his safety. That shot in the back was mysterious. Some foe, calling himself friend, lurks near him; why, I cannot imagine. He is everything that is true and noble; and whoever fired that shot had some motive, which one attempt upon the colonel's life will not satisfy.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
My dear Mrs. Graham, you are morbid. A colonel's life is at hazard as well as that of a private. Why could not the shot from an enemy's rifle have done the work?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Impossible! the enemy were in front. Only a coward would do so contemptible a deed.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
True, there are some without honor, Mrs. Graham. Your brother, Roger Carruth, for instance.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
How dare you, Mr. Newcomb, in my own home, speak so slightingly of my brother? Why have you turned against him? When he was first accused of the crime, you acted as his friend. Since his escape, you never lose an opportunity to taunt me with his downfall.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Because the evidence against him has strengthened.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Mr. Newcomb, you call yourself friend. I do not believe you. Roger is as innocent of that crime as I am, and you know it. Not content with attempting to overturn my faith in my brother, you have spared no time or trouble to turn the colonel against him. He believes in your friendship so thoroughly, he never thinks to doubt your word.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
That is as it should be, Mrs. Graham. And, I hope, some day, the colonel's wife will favor me with her confidence.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Never. Your very presence is hateful to me, and could I have my wish you would never again cross this threshold. The time will come when Roger's innocence will be proved, and woe to those who are his accusers.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
If you please, Mrs. Graham, the colonel is asking for you.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Very well, Polly. I fear the walk has been too much for the colonel. Will you excuse me?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Certainly. It will be a long time before that day, my dear Mrs. Graham. The plot cannot so easily be unravelled. Suspects some foe of the colonel's, does she? She shall have a better cause. The shot will be more telling next time.
#GIBBS.
Is the colonel at home?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
What business brings you here?
#GIBBS.
To inquire after the colonel's health.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
I can give you full information. He has quite recovered, and is to rejoin his regiment to - day. What next?
#GIBBS.
To ascertain if he has ever found a clew to the perpetrator of the foul outrage.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
If not, to turn traitor.
#GIBBS.
Yes, for I can give him the name of the man who planned his murder.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
And what do you expect to get for this startling piece of news?
#GIBBS.
Well, say fifty dollars.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
I will give you a hundred to say nothing about it, on one condition, that you yourself try your hand. That man Dowling was worse than nothing. It was a bad shot; we need better marksmen in our armies.
#GIBBS.
You are bound to murder him?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Murder? no indeed. “All's fair in love and war.” Are we not enemies? Is he not the invader of the sacred soil that was my birthplace? Has he not won the heart of the woman I once loved? That affection is now dead, and hatred has risen from the ashes. She scorned me once, and I shall not rest until her happiness is wrecked.
#GIBBS.
Then that explains your treachery towards her brother, Roger Carruth.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
What do you know of Roger Carruth? The world looks upon him as a criminal; he is beyond recall and as good as dead.
#GIBBS.
You are sure?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Yes, I am confident of that.
#GIBBS.
And the family; do they not suspect?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Suspect? not much; they are too simple for that. You are still in the colonel's regiment?
#GIBBS.
Yes. What are your orders?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Are you at any time placed as sentinel near the colonel's quarters?
#GIBBS.
Yes, any night may find me there.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Well, I must take my chances. To inquire after the colonel's health is sufficient excuse for my appearance in camp at any time. The colonel has given me a standing invitation.
#GIBBS.
Which you will have no hesitation in accepting, I see.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
What time are you placed there on guard?
#GIBBS.
Just before taps.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Good, just the thing. After taps will be the time. Lights out, everything quiet. Can I depend upon you, Gibbs?
#GIBBS.
You have my word, sir.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Ha, ha! word? do you think that yours is worth anything?
#GIBBS.
Sometime I hope it will be.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Remember, you owe much to me. Should you turn traitor, your reckoning will be a sorry one.
#GIBBS.
I shall not forget all that you have done for me. Some day I will pay it back with interest.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
I wonder if I can trust him? He seems docile enough; but sometimes I fancy there's a look in his eye—pshaw! what nonsense. Newcomb, my boy, a clever trick, a bold scheme; but you will win it, never fear.
#DOROTHY.
What do I hear? A scheme to take the colonel's life, and by his best friend too. There he goes, oh, the hypocrite. Now I know why I hate him so. With all his fine manners, I have not been deceived. Ugh! I hate even to shake hands with him. Oh dear, if I were only a man, that I might be near the colonel. Whom shall I tell? Who will help me? Ruth must not know, she has enough to bear. They call me gay, Roger, frivolous and heartless. Perhaps I am, but if they could only look down deep into my heart, they would find the love for you, burning a strong and steadfast flame. O, Roger, why did you leave me? We all believed in your innocence and could have helped you bear the burden, which now alone must be so heavy. Oh, if you were only here to help me now.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
That was the best piece of pie, Polly. If I could only have my knapsack as a receptacle for such samples of your cooking, I wouldn't need drum and fife to spur me on.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Hush, Bijah, Miss Dorothy is here.
#DOROTHY.
A visitor, Polly?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes ma'am. A friend from Oldtown; and only think, Miss Dorothy, he knows your Mr. Roger.
#DOROTHY.
Knows my Roger? Oh, tell me of him; where is he?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
That I cannot tell you , but here is a letter, which he bade me give you should I ever come to Baltimore.
#DOROTHY.
MY DARLING DOROTHY.—That you still have faith in me I have no doubt. Your heart is too pure for anything else. I have enlisted in the army, and only as private will serve my country with heart and soul. When the war is over, I will return to you; my innocence established, and the foe, not only my country's but my own, defeated and trodden under foot. Bijah Bright, the bearer of this letter, is a true and loyal friend. He is worthy of your greatest respect, for he stood by me in my darkest hours. My love to dear sister Ruth. Until we meet again, yours in life or in death.
#DOROTHY.
Mr. Bright, I am more than grateful to you for bringing this letter; it fills my heart with renewed hope. Believe me , your loyalty to Roger makes us warm and steadfast friends.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
I shall see him again, Miss Dorothy, and, when I do, I shall say to him, that the stars in heaven never shone brighter than the love in your eyes when you spoke his name.
#DOROTHY.
You are a true knight. Will you take an answer to this letter?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Indeed, I will.
#DOROTHY.
Thank you so much.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
No thanks, Miss Dorothy, the pleasure's mine.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Isn't she just sweet, Bijah?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
You've hit it this time; were it not for the dazzling brightness of the orbs of fascinating Miss Polly Primrose the palpitation of my heart would be greatly increased; as it is—
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Indeed, I won't.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Ha, ha, Polly, that wee brain of yours isn't an idle one. It won't do for us to separate, but make a stock company and spring our poetic effusions upon the public together.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Is Miss Dorothy at home?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Why—Mr. Roger here?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Land of living! Where did you come from?
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Was marching by; could not resist the temptation of a stolen glance at Dorothy.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Have just given her your letter, and she is now writing one in answer.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
But I must see her.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Then I won't wait for that answer. And, as I know the sensations of a fluttering heart, I'll step out and let you flutter alone.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
All right, Bijah. Where are you going?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Back to camp. I've had a taste of Polly's pies. That's joy enough for one day.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Take these to the captain, and I will soon follow.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
All right. Polly, should I on the cold earth lie, remember this—I loved your pie.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Pity sakes alive! Mr. Roger, how shall I break the news to Miss Dorothy?
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Your wits were always lively, Polly. I shall leave it to you.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Dear me, she may come at any moment. Here, hide behind this.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Oh, dear, every idea in my brain is playing tag with the other. Such a horrid sensation I feel, as if some one had proposed and I had said “No,” when I meant “Yes.” Shade of my departed grandsire, aid me.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Oh, how good to be in my own home again. They say that stolen goods are always the sweetest; one look and kiss from Dorothy will indeed be worth the stealing—hark, they are coming.
#DOROTHY.
What is the matter, Polly? From the vigorous manner in which you called my name, I should think the house was on fire, or besieged by burglars.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Hush, Miss Dorothy, it ain't a fire—it's worse—it's burglars.
#DOROTHY.
Oh!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Don't, Miss Dorothy; some one entered the house while you were in your room, and has stolen something.
#DOROTHY.
Stolen something! What?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Something that belongs to you. It is very precious.
#DOROTHY.
My rings are all here.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Oh,—no—not that, something worse; it's your heart.
#DOROTHY.
Polly, tell me instantly, what do you mean?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
I mean—I mean—no, I don't mean, yes—I do—
#DOROTHY.
Polly, if you can talk sensibly, pray do, and not as if your brain were congested.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, my brain is all right—but look behind that portière.
#DOROTHY.
What is it? You make my very blood run cold.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Behind that portière , is—is—
#DOROTHY.
Roger!
#ROGER CARRUTH.
My own dear Dorothy.
#DOROTHY.
Oh, Polly, you frightened me so.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Thank heaven, that's over—it's worse than having a tooth pulled.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
You did nobly, Polly. Will you tell Mrs. Graham that I am here?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Indeed I will.
#DOROTHY.
Oh. Roger, I have wanted you so much.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
What do you think of me? my lonely hours so far away from you all.
#DOROTHY.
But where have you been? Tell me, Roger.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Hush, Ruth is coming. I will tell you both together.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Roger, my dear brother. Why this long silence? this uniform? What does it all mean?
#ROGER CARRUTH.
It means, dear sister, that my heart responded to my country's call, and I could not stay away.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But why did you not confide in us? we all believed in your innocence.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
All?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, all; for at heart the colonel believes in your honor. He must, but his friend Newcomb has so woven his influence about him, that the poison has done its work. Oh, Roger, that man, how I despise and fear him.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
And well you may. Never mind, Ruth, some day my name will stand without a blemish, and the colonel will be made to forget his doubts. Now, I shall serve my country with my heart and soul, believing and trusting that justice in good time will right my wrongs.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Yes, major, a capital plan.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
The colonel! he must not see you. I fear he may forget that you are my brother.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Never mind, Ruth, his words cannot hurt me.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Ruth, dear, I am quite myself again. The major's active brain has helped to clear my cobwebbed intellect, and our united forces have conceived a most brilliant scheme. Roger Carruth, what are you doing here?
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Calling upon my sister and my fiancée.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
And do you think, sir, that I, their only protector, will allow one whose name is sullied to hold an interview with them?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Gordon, you forget that you are speaking to my brother.
#DOROTHY.
And please remember, Gordon, that this man I love and honor above all others.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Stop, I say. In my own house, I will speak my mind. Roger Carruth, leave this house. All here bear honored names. We do not associate with dishonest men.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Gordon, how can you be so cruel?
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Colonel Graham, you forget to whom you are speaking. We once called ourselves brothers; that tie remains. We shall both fight for our country's honor. Mine will be a double duty. My good name shall stand again, and you, who spurn me now, shall live to crave my pardon. Farewell, Dorothy.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Gordon, you have broken my heart.
#DOROTHY.
You call yourself a soldier. If I were your country, I would disown you.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Hush, Ruth, don't condemn me. Dorothy, I have done what seemed my duty.
#DOROTHY.
There are some duties it is wiser to overlook.
#DOROTHY.
Pinky, what do you think of all this? downright dirty piece of business, but don't blame the colonel. Newcomb is at the bottom of this.
#DOROTHY.
Newcomb? Oh, yes. Pinky, what do you think? I overheard him talking to one of the colonel's men, and he's plotting murder.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
What! Murder? Who is the victim?
#DOROTHY.
The colonel. That shot in the back was a first attempt, and he is going to try it again.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Not by a large majority.
#DOROTHY.
You must help him in some way.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
I'll do my best; and if Newcomb isn't “laid out” before we're done with him, my name isn't Pinkerton Potts.
#DOROTHY.
Find Roger; he will help you. He's too loyal to harbor the Colonel's words when his life is in danger.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Come, Ruth, my cloak and hat.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Must you leave me?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Ruth, dearest, you are a soldier's wife, remember. Forgive my harsh words to Roger, but by the fireside or on the battle - field, our honor must be upheld. When the bugle calls me to active service, with heart and soul to lead my men in battle, it calls you to be brave and to conquer all fears, giving inspiration to those who march to meet the foe, and waiting with patient love and hope our safe return. Good - by, Dorothy. Come, major.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Major, watch over him and bring him back to me.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
I will do my best, Mrs. Graham.
#DOROTHY.
Good - by, major; don't forget the sacred trust imposed upon you. Care for them both.
#DOROTHY.
Ruth, dear, be brave. Roger will be near Gordon, I know. He has suffered much, but he will forget his own wrongs. We have faith in him and know him to be steadfast and true. Some time the world will know it. Keep hope alive in your heart, and believe with me, that Roger will some day make that shot in the back rebound, and the traitor will meet his just deserts.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Wal, that's a true story, and don't you forget it.
#PATRICK KILROY.
Faith, it's an injy rubber memory yees have any way. An' divil a bit does it trouble yees to stretch it. Be jabers! it makes me dhry to listen to yees. Shure, it's toime I was on watch.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Ha, ha! I've given them chaff enough for one day. It will give them something to talk about and keep them out of mischief.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Ah, major, already new life fills my veins; to know that I am with my men again. That seven days' fight is over at last; poor fellows! how many have answered their last call, and lie with white faces upturned to the sky; only the heavy dew for a winding - sheet; while the wounded are waiting for transports to take them back to Washington.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Those were hard days, colonel; but we must succeed in the end. When we have gained the victory, some of those brave fellows, whose souls are as white as their faces, will, if they can look down upon their country, rejoice that they gave their lives for so glorious a cause.
#SENTINEL.
Halt! who comes there?
#GUARD.
Friend.
#SENTINEL.
Advance, friend, and give the countersign.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Any orders, colonel?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
No, major, go amongst the men if you will, and speak words of encouragement; I shall be my old self to - morrow.
#PATRICK KILROY.
Halt! who comes there? Plague take it! only the wind.
#PATRICK KILROY.
Halt! who comes there? Advance, and give the countersign.
#PETE.
'Deed I can't sign nuffin, massa.
#PATRICK KILROY.
Well, by the powers, if it ain't a shmall nagur.
#PETE.
'Deed, massa, I done mean no harm; I's scared blue, I is.
#PATRICK KILROY.
Blue, is it? faith it must be navy blue thin, wid a coat of tan outshide it. Phat are yees doing here?
#PETE.
I's only come to find my mammy.
#PATRICK KILROY.
Foind yees mammy. It's a foine place yees come to luk for her; p'raps yees thinks she's a bowld sojer by in petticoats, ha, ha!
#PETE.
Please, massa, I tought maybe, when she runned away, der Union men would be good to her, and let her stay wid dem.
#PATRICK KILROY.
Bliss his heart, a good bit of faith he has thin, and Patrick Kilroy is the last man, though he has an Irish heart, that would lit any harm come to this shmall spal - peen. Corporal of the guard, post four.
#PATRICK KILROY.
Look here, sir. See what I've found crossing the line. Shure it's a bit of ould Africa.
#CORPORAL.
All right, I'll show him to the colonel.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Well, what is it? contraband discovered crossing the lines.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Very well, leave him to me.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
My fine fellow, what is your name?
#PETE.
Dey neber done gib me one, massa, only Pete.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
How old are you?
#PETE.
Dunno, 'specs I'se purty old; I'se had heaps of fun.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Where did you come from?
#PETE.
Ober dere. Powerful hard time I'se had too, massa. I'se runned away.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Why did you come here?
#PETE.
Ole massa, he sold my brudder, an' I jest feared he'd make me gwine too. An' I knowed der Union men was heaps good to de poor niggers, an' I tought p'raps yer might tell me whar my mammy is.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
No, Pete, my boy, I don't know where your mammy is. What are you going to do?
#PETE.
Dunno! 'Specs I should jes lub to stay wid you.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Stay with me? What could you do?
#PETE.
I can brack yer boots, massa. An' oh, massa Colonel, I do so lub a horse! Let me take care ob yours. I can handle 'em, massa, if dey be eber so debblesome. Please jes try me; an' I do eberyting yer axes me, sho's yer born.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I havn't a horse, Pete; but you look like a pretty good boy. I think I can trust you. Yes, I will give you a trial.
#PETE.
Yer really means it? Ki - yi!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Ha, ha! I'll make you my bodyguard.
#PETE.
I ain't got no uniform, massa; 'specs I needs a sword for dat.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
That is a ragged coat you have on for this time of year. Here, put this on. You won't grow to it this year , but it is better than nothing.
#PETE.
I jes wish my ole mammy see me now, she'd be proud, she'd be.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Pete, you are to take good care of everything that belongs to me; and some day, when the war is over, we will go North and try to find your mammy.
#PETE.
Has you a mammy, Massa Colonel?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
No, Pete; she died long ago; but a dear wife and sister are praying for a safe return.
#PETE.
Massa Colonel, I'll do jes de bery bes I knows.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Well said, Pete. Now go into my tent and put it in order.
#PETE.
All right, massa.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Ah, major! Whom have we here?
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Bijah Bright, the standard - bearer of your regiment. grave duty, Mr. Bright. May it not be trodden beneath your feet.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Wal, I guess not, colonel: not while this right arm is strong. Jest feel that muscle.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Ha, ha! There's no doubt about that, or your heart either.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Only one corner reserved; the rest belongs to my country.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
And may I ask who possesses so great a treasure?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Why, don't you know? My Polly, your Polly.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
My Polly? Ah, I see. You mean Polly Primrose. Mr. Bright, you are to be congratulated; she's a treasure.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Don't be in a hurry with good wishes, sir. She's on the wing, and my shot has not yet brought her down.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
On the anxious seat, are you? I can at least wish you success.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Thank you, sir.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Major, if you see a small darky about here, it is all right. He crossed the lines, and I will take care of him.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Very well, sir. He shall not be molested.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
But tell me more of this Newcomb, Bijah. What can be his motive in planning the colonel's death?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Wal, before Mr. Roger's sister married Colonel Graham, Newcomb was all - fired gone on her. I know, for I was about Baltimore at the time and heard no end of gossip. You see, Mrs. Graham didn't take to him, and snubbed him on all occasions. By Jiminy, wasn't he mad! The whole truth of the matter is, he's bound to be revenged, and takes what's nearest and dearest. He was the means of the colonel's injury, and I'm scared blue for fear that he will try it again. Roger Carruth has his eye on him, for he has a double debt to pay.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
What's this? Who are you?
#PETE.
Please; massa, I's only Pete.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Where did you come from?
#PETE.
Ober dar, massa, and de colonel he's gwine to let me stay wid him.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Well, give us a tune.
#PETE.
Deed, massa, dis yer belongs to de colonel; 'specs he wouldn't like to hab me gib yer dat.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Yes, he will; I can answer for that.
#PETE.
All right, massa. I'll play de bes I know.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Good, and here's a quarter for inspiration.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Bravo, bravo! I tell you what, Bijah, music and a song like that cheer a man up. If we have many more days of dead calm and quiet, I shall be tempted to desert the cause and soothe my troubled spirit with the society of some fair maiden.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
You're a great one, you are. Where did you get that coat?
#PETE.
Massa Colonel gib me dat; he's heaps good to me, he is. I takes care ob eberyting, and I's his guard.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
His what? Guard? Oh, ho! You mean body - guard. Wal, I vum, here's an idea. We'll work him. Go back to your work, Pete. Major, I have an idea.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Isn't it rather dangerous to give it away?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
How can we look out for the colonel? We can't always be at his side, or he will suspect something. He must not be warned, his health won't stand that. That small specimen of black humanity calls himself the colonel's guard; body - guard, he means. Now, why can't he be warned of the colonel's danger, and I'll trust him for the rest? He's mightily taken with the colonel, and you know what a darky's devotion is.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Bijah, you're a trump! If that is a specimen of your stock of ideas, you are a valuable man. Pete, come here.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Come here; we wish to talk with you.
#PETE.
I's all ready, sar; bof years wide open.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
That's all right. Keep your mouth shut.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
You like the colonel pretty well, don't you?
#PETE.
Like him, massa? Deed I does. He's heaps good ter me. Look at des yer cloe's.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
You can pay him back for them, if you will.
#PETE.
Please, massa, I can't gib yer nuffin.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
I don't mean money.
#PETE.
Does yer mean I can do somefin for him?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Yes, that's jest the pint.
#PETE.
Deed, I'd just like dat. Does yer know what he's gwine ter do for me? When dis yer war is ober he's gwine to help me find my mammy. Don't yer tink I 'specs him for dat?
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Gad, you're a lucky fellow to find such a friend as that. I wish the colonel would help me find a sweetheart.
#PETE.
'Specs for such a fine - lookin gennleman as you is, massa, de colonel would not have to work bery hard.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Thank you, Pete. That's praise worth having.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
I say, Pete, there's some one in this world, that doesn't love the colonel: you must take good care of him. One of these fine days some one will try to shoot him.
#PETE.
Shoot massa Colonel? Not if Pete can help it.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Mind, you keep both eyes wide open.
#PETE.
Deed I will, massa.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Pete, my boy, the colonel is one of my dearest friends. I promised his wife that I would take good care of him, but I may be called away at any moment. I commend him to your care. And remember, the trust is a sacred one.
#PETE.
I'll do de bes I knows. Golly, 'specs I didn't jine de army for nuffin.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
My gracious! thankful enough, I am, that we are out of sight of those horrid soldiers. One of them tried to kiss me. Ugh! it makes me shiver to think of it. Miss Dorothy, here we are at last.
#DOROTHY.
Indeed, I am thankful too. I am so tired. Where are we, Polly?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Right in camp, miss; see that tent? I wonder who lives there? Let's look in and find out.
#DOROTHY.
Look, Polly, Mrs. Graham's picture. It must be the colonel's.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Pity sakes alive! so it is. He must not see us here.
#DOROTHY.
No indeed. I wonder how I can find Roger; ever since I overheard that plot, sleep has forsaken me.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Some one is coming this way. And I really believe it is Major Potts.
#DOROTHY.
They say “Fortune favors the brave.” This is indeed a lucky find.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Why, Polly Primrose, what are you doing here? Miss Dorothy, have you lost your senses? In camp! How did you enter?
#DOROTHY.
Behold my disguise. I am Polly's antiquated aunt. She has cakes to sell.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, do have one.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
But what means this masquerading?
#DOROTHY.
I must see Roger, Pinky, and could think of no way but this. I must tell him of the plot I overheard.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
I thought you were to leave that to me. Lost your faith in your old friend?
#DOROTHY.
Don't think that for a moment. I could not remain at home. I did not dare tell Ruth, and I must tell my thoughts to some one; they were driving me frantic. Do find Roger for me—that's a dear fellow.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
That is easier said than done. He must keep out of the colonel's way, and that is his tent.
#DOROTHY.
You have wits enough to manage that. Don't tell him who is here, leave that to me; I mean to give him a surprise.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Let a woman alone for keeping a secret. You will undeceive him in five minutes. I know enough of the fair sex for that.
#DOROTHY.
If you were not Roger's best friend, I should say something that you would not like.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
I fly to do your bidding. Don't empty your vial of pent - up wrath over my defenceless shoulders. I should not dare to look a pretty girl in the face for a week.
#DOROTHY.
What a vacation the pretty girls would have! Come, do hurry, or the colonel will return and spoil everything.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Au revoir!
#DOROTHY.
My heart is fluttering like an imprisoned butterfly. Hark! Polly, some one else is coming.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Pity sakes alive! It's Bijah Bright; seat yourself on this log and don't speak.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Wal, I agree with the major. This is getting monotonous; my blood boils for excitement; even the sight of a pretty face wouldn't go bad. That reminds me. If I can't do that, there is no law to prevent me from looking at a pretty girl's picture; and “by gorry,” she is worth looking at.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Well, I never! Now, I should just like to know—another girl, has he? I'll pay him well for that; deceiving me with his soft speeches.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Bless my soul! if here isn't a sweet lass now. What! ho! my pretty maid; where are you going?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
If you please, sir, I have cakes to sell.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Here's luck. Just what I've been looking for. I'll take half a dozen. My! what cakes! “Is this heaven, Uncle Tom?” These bring to me visions of Polly's kitchen and her pies. This is richness. Why do you hide your face? Let me look at you.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Indeed I can't.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
You can't. Wal, I can. Come now, give me a kiss.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Polly—Polly Primrose!
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, Polly—Polly Primrose. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? You're a nice kind of a man, you are, pretending to be fond of me.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Oh, come, Polly, I didn't mean any harm.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Oh no, no harm, of course not. Kissing every girl you meet. Don't speak to me—I'll never trust you or any other man again.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
What is this? An indignation meeting? Bijah quarrelling with a pretty woman? No, yes, it is—Polly Primrose; but who is this?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
That's my aunt, she came with me.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Poor old lady; she seems tired.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
That she is; but she's never too tired to tell fortunes; wouldn't you like to hear yours?
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Anything to kill time. Come, let's hear it. My time is short. No danger of the colonel's appearance, is there, Potts?
#PINKERTON POTTS.
No, Roger, he is busily engaged. I've looked out for that.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Good! Now, what is the wheel of fortune to bring me? Oh! I remember, no golden treasure disclosed, unless the key be silver.
#DOROTHY.
Young man, you have had serious trouble; some cloud hangs over you. You are suspected of some crime.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
What witchcraft is here?
#DOROTHY.
But you are innocent. If you have patience, your name will soon be cleared.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
I hope so with all my heart.
#DOROTHY.
You have a good heart, and, let me see—yes—that line is crossed—you have given it to some one.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
You are hard hit, old man. Even the witches can read your heart.
#DOROTHY.
Your time is coming, sir. “He laughs best who laughs last.”
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Ha, ha! Potts, some time that heart of yours won't stand the fire. Then I will charter a Gatling gun to return all your volleys.
#DOROTHY.
But what is this? Some danger lurks near a friend; perhaps a brother.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
I have no brother.
#DOROTHY.
No; not a real brother, but—
#ROGER CARRUTH.
The colonel?
#DOROTHY.
Yes, yes. You must save him. He shall owe his life to you. Some one calling himself friend is his foe. He has done you a grievous wrong, but you will forgive that?
#ROGER CARRUTH.
That voice! Dorothy?
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Cleverly done, little maid. You actually waited eight minutes.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Major! Dorothy, what does this mean? well - laid scheme, Roger, to hold a stolen interview with you. Miss Dorothy, you can talk with Roger just five minutes, no longer. The colonel will return by that time.
#DOROTHY.
Forgive me for coming, Roger, but I was so anxious.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Anxious, little one? Why, what is the trouble? Is it a quarrel with “my dearest friend Mollie”?
#DOROTHY.
Don't speak like that. No one ever gives me credit for any depth of feeling, just because I laugh and take the good of life as it comes along.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Which I hope you will always do, Dorothy dear. Come, forgive me, and tell me your trouble.
#DOROTHY.
Before the colonel left home after his illness, Mr. Newcomb called one day. I entered the drawing - room, and overheard a conversation which he was having with some man,—a soldier in the colonel's regiment.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Did you hear the man's name?
#DOROTHY.
Yes; Mr. Newcomb called him Gibbs. Oh, I was so frightened, for I heard them plan to kill the colonel.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Kill the colonel? How? When?
#DOROTHY.
This man was, some night, to be placed as the colonel's sentinel. That was to be the time and place. “After Taps” they said.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Have you told any one of this?
#DOROTHY.
Only the major. It would never do to tell Ruth. She worries enough without that.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
And you have kept it all to yourself? No wonder you were anxious. Dorothy, you are a treasure.
#DOROTHY.
But tell me, how can you save Gordon?
#ROGER CARRUTH.
He says and thinks hard things of me, Dorothy.
#DOROTHY.
But you know at heart he does not mean it. It is all through that horrid Newcomb.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Yes; that horrid Newcomb.
#DOROTHY.
Promise me that you will do your best to save him.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
No need to promise that. He is your brother; for that, if for no other reason, I must forget and forgive.
#DOROTHY.
Roger, you have made me so happy.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Then, for all I have suffered, I ask no better reward.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Time's up. Where is Polly?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Here I am, sir.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Bijah, escort them both. Give the countersign, that they may cross the lines safely.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
We do not need his assistance. He had better wait for another girl. Come, Miss Dorothy.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Good - by, sweetheart. No more anxious moments, remember.
#DOROTHY.
Never. Good - by, Pinky.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Poor Bijah looks unhappy, because the maid of his heart won't smile upon him. He has a good heart, and is “true as steel.”
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Indeed he is. No one knows it better than I. He stood my friend in my darkest hours. Ah, Potts! I have a hard battle yet to fight. Newcomb must not win the day. My plan is a bold one. Stand by me, old man; your friendship will be tried. But those honest eyes of yours never failed me yet. This firm pressure of your hand, and the knowledge of Dorothy's faith and love, give me strength and courage to do my duty.
#PETE.
Golly, I feels powerful big, I does, wid dis yer coat ob de colonel's. 'Specs some time, dey will mistook us, and I gets all de salutes. Dey will 'proach me dis yer fashion. Massa Colonel. Yas, sar. A 'spatch from de general. Very well, sar.
#PATRICK KILROY.
Faith, and if it ain't the shmall heathen we saved from the other soide. Luk at the shtyle of him,—parading about wid the colonel's shtripes and buttons. Whist, honey, phat are yees doing wid that coat?
#PETE.
I's habin' heaps of fun, I is. Massa Colonel gib me dis yer coat, an' I's playin' wid my 'magination, an' tinks I'se de colonel.
#PATRICK KILROY.
Playin' wid phat is it? The nixt thing you know, it may be powder phat's playin' wid you.
#PETE.
Does yer 'member, sah, when I comed across de line?
#PATRICK KILROY.
Will, indade I does. A foine specimen yees were. Shure, for a minit, I thought it was the divil himself, coming to give me a surprise party.
#PETE.
Den yer don't trabel wid him all de time, massa?
#PATRICK KILROY.
Oh, yer shpalpeen! shmart one, by the powers! Travel with the divil is it? Faith, and he goes it so fast, niver a bit cud I kape up wid him. If that shmall imp don't show more respict to his betthers, a shmall chance he'll get to travel with any one.
#SENTINEL.
Halt! Who comes there?
#GUARD.
Friend.
#SENTINEL.
Advance, friend, and give the countersign.
#GIBBS.
I wonder if Newcomb is on the watch. Yes; here he comes. Too clever to miss the game.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
What's the matter, Newcomb? Not nervous, are you?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
It's nothing. Thought I saw a shadow. Do you have any of those black devils hanging about here?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Yes, occasionally one; but they never give us any trouble. One little fellow crossed the line to - day, and he was so bright and clever,—wanted to stay here with me; so I have set him to work, and I expect he will take excellent care of me. I admire the devotion of that race; treat them kindly, and you are always sure of plenty of friends.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
I prefer a higher type of humanity for associates.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
What a pity, Newcomb, that two such warm friends as we should not have heart for the same cause! However, some day you will be of my opinion, I hope.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Hardly that, yet. Whatever the end may be, I trust we shall still be good comrades.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
That sentiment I echo with my whole heart. But tell me, Newcomb, do you ever hear anything of Roger Carruth?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Never. He won't show himself in this part of the country again.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
You are sure that you have evidence of his guilt? I would not misjudge the boy for all the world; I am too fond of him for that.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Why should I, his friend and yours, seek to turn you against him?
#GIBBS.
Why, indeed!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I cannot understand it—so true and honorable, always. Some fearful temptation must have stood in his way.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Evil will show itself. If the seed is there, time will surely make it grow.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
No, no, Newcomb; don't say that. Why, man, would you have me think for a moment that it was more than a sudden pitfall?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
The evidence grows stronger and stronger against him.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Oh, Newcomb, this is so hard to bear!
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Never mind, old fellow. You have some friends left who have not played the knave.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
True, Newcomb; I have much to thank you for. This kindly interest in my welfare, I trust the time will come when I can repay it.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Don't worry about that. It is almost time for taps.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Won't you stay and smoke with me?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Not to - night. Early hours are prescribed for you. Good - night.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Good - night.
#PETE.
I wonder if he lubs de colonel. 'Specs I jes listen to der comversation.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Well, are you ready for your work?
#GIBBS.
Yes, sir.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
No chicken - hearted business about this. Is your aim a true one?
#GIBBS.
Yes; true as steel.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
I can depend upon you?
#GIBBS.
You can, sir. I feel a special interest in the work to - night.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
At what time?
#GIBBS.
After taps.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
It will soon be here.
#GIBBS.
That is the call. Ten minutes more; before the lights are out.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
All right. Make your shot tell.
#GIBBS.
I will do my best, sir.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Good - night.
#PETE.
Golly, my hair just frozen stiff; bof my knees powerful confectionate. Dey's plotting mischief, dey is. An' if Pete don't keep bof eyes wide open, dere will be trouble in de camp.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Newcomb is about the camp. I fear mischief is brewing.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
I'd jest like to see the sport. I wonder who he is working this time.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
All right for the night, colonel?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Yes, major; good - night.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Good - night.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Major, look there! I'll bet you a fiver, that's Newcomb.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
You're right. Let us hide and watch him.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I wonder where that snowball of mine is? Pete! Pete!
#PETE.
Here I is , massa!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
What are you doing at this time of night?
#PETE.
I's watchin' somefin, massa. I heard a crackling in der bushes; 'specs it possum. Yer don't mind if I looks, massa?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
No; only don't stray away too far.
#PETE.
'Deed I won't, Massa Colonel.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
You bet he scents the game.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I wonder why it is my thoughts are all of Roger to - night. Poor Ruth! how heavy her heart is; and I spoke words which did not lighten the burden. Down deep in my heart I cannot think him guilty. Yet Newcomb is so sure,—and Newcomb knows. Everything all right?
#GIBBS.
All right, sir.
#GIBBS; COL.
turns as shot is fired; SOLDIERS appear; stage grows light; KIL. runs to PETE and raises head.)
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
The traitor! I'll pay him well for this.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
What does this mean? Treason in the camp?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
It means, colonel, that this man attempted your life. I overheard his plotting and came to warn you. He missed fire, and my wrist caught the shot.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Where is the sentinel?
#PATRICK KILROY.
Faith, and there he is.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
So, sir, placed here on honor to guard your colonel's life, you turn traitor. Speak, man, why have you done this?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Poor little fellow! You have killed him.
#PATRICK KILROY.
If yees plaze, colonel, his sinses are only knocked out of him.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Man, why are you silent?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
He is too great a coward to defend himself. He dare not speak.
#GIBBS.
Dare not? Be careful, Newcomb; the game is not yet yours. You call me traitor: coward. Yet beneath the stars in heaven there is not one who wears, beneath his coat, a blacker heart than yours.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
What do you mean? Who are you that dares to accuse me?
#GIBBS.
One who has suffered much at your hands; who has borne with patience your taunts and slurs; who, knowing of the colonel's danger, tried to save his life. One whom you thought “as good as dead” stands before you. A victim of your treachery. Roger Carruth.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
staggers back and leans against soldiers, who support him; and BIJAH each holding one of ROGER'S hands, looking at him; ROGER looking at NEW., who stares at him horror - stricken.)
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Now, Pete, make everything bright and cheerful. Mr. Roger is expected home to - night; we must do our share towards a warm welcome. The poor colonel is so unhappy. Between the treachery of his friend, and Mr. Roger's brave deed, he is torn with conflicting emotions.
#PETE.
I's powerful sorry for dear Massa Colonel. Wish I could do somefin for him.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
You do your work well, that will satisfy him. But I tell you what, Pete, you can do something for me. Play a dance tune on this banjo. I haven't heard one since I left Oldtown. I can tell you what, Pete, I knew how to dance once.
#PETE.
Yer don't need to tell me dat, Polly; I kin see de dancin' peeking out ob yer shoes. What yer gwine ter have?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Give me a Virginia Reel. My gracious! I just adored that dance.
#PETE.
All right, Polly. You do der dancin', an' I play de tune.
#PETE.
Golly, Polly, yer jest took my bref away. You must have been to a powerful heap of corn shuckings; an' de gennlemen dey must lub to dance wid you. Golly, 'specs dey don't all hab a 'sprise party like I did.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Pete, that was just glorious! I'm ever so much obliged to you for playing.
#PETE.
I's right proud ob you, I is. If dis yer heart ob mine didn't belong to a nigger, 'specs I should frow it at yer feet.
#PATRICK KILROY.
Faith, and it's an Irish heart she can have, anyway.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Pity sakes alive! What are you doing here?
#PATRICK KILROY.
It's a missage I have for the colonel.
#PETE.
Lor, Polly. Dis yer is de soger what didn't shoot when dis yer nigger crossed de line. I's heaps glad to see you, sah. Does yer disremember me?
#PATRICK KILROY.
Faith, an' it's Pete, the colonel's guard. What a foine by yees grown to. Shure it's a betther fitting coat yees have on, anyway.
#PETE.
Yas, indeed. I's Buttons, now, I is. Don't yer tink dis yer coat obercomes me?
#PATRICK KILROY.
Faith, it's a foine picture yees look in it.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
I remember; you are the soldier that was so kind to Pete.
#PATRICK KILROY.
Oh, yees make me blush,—the sight of those bright eyes, and the swate words yees be afther saying. Shure, a foiner jig I never saw in the ould country. Will yees be afther telling the colonel I am here?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, Pete will do that. Ask if the messenger shall be sent to his room.
#PETE.
All right, Polly. Who is de message from, sah?
#PATRICK KILROY.
Mr. Randolph Newcomb, if yees plaze.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Should think that Mr. Newcomb had done mischief enough. You can't be very proud of your master.
#PATRICK KILROY.
Faith, and it's little I care about him. I applied for the situation to plaze Mr. Roger. Shure, it's a policeman I am in foine livery.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Oh, I see, something more mysterious.
#PETE.
Massa Colonel will receib de message, sah. Yer is to follow me.
#PATRICK KILROY.
An' phat if that foine man, the divil, be afther kaping me company?
#PETE.
Den I goes first, massa, ebery time. I wouldn't for de world disturb de confections dat exist between you two.
#PATRICK KILROY.
Faith, an' if yees have a foiner coat, you're a black guard shtill.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Pete's bright enough for him. I've taken quite a shine to my black diamond. How devoted he is to the colonel! Heigho! wish some one was devoted to me. Nonsense; I don't care. I am so happy, now that horrid war is over. I am ready to embrace anybody and everybody.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
And I am just the man to appreciate it, Polly.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Bijah Bright! Bless my soul, how you frighten me! Back from the war, are you?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Yes, Polly. When I left you, patriotism filled my breast. I carried the flag, torn and tattered as it was, and, contrary to your expectations, was not suspended in mid - air. I lived for glory by day, and at night dreamed sweet dreams. They were all of you, Polly.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Dreaming of me! Stuff and nonsense. Do you take me for a brainless Down - Easter, that you come with your sweet words and “palaverin” smiles. Away! “I'll have none of you.”
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Won't you ever forgive me, Polly, for that day in camp?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Never! Besides, what should I have to say to you? A man who carries in his pocket other girls' pictures, and spends all his time kissing them.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Oho! I see where the shoe pinches. Why shouldn't I? That's what I'd like to know. One moment you smile upon me, and my blood frantically and joyfully perambulates through my veins; and the next time my eager orbs behold you, an animated iceberg would be a more cheerful companion. You needn't flatter yourself that because you don't want me, no one else does. You can bet your sweet life, Bijah Bright doesn't mean to get left. No, ma'am. Not when he has such a sweet face as this to look at.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Don't flatter yourself that you can make me jealous. Precious little thought I give to you or your picture.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
You are just dying to see who it is.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Indeed, I'm not. Some baby - faced simpleton.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Come, Polly, it is too bad for you to treat me so when I returned, hoping to share with you a secret.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Secret! Oh, tell it to me, do.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Oh, no, Miss Primrose; I only make a confidant of my friends.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Well, I'll be friends for just ten minutes.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Will you though? Not by a large majority. No friendship for me on the instalment plan.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
I'll be friends. Now, tell me quick.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Ha, ha, ho, ho! I thought that would fetch it. A woman's curiosity is not fireproof against a volley of gossip.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
If you talk like that, I shall leave the room.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
No, you won't, you are just dying to stay here.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Oh, Bijah!
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
You had better hide your face, Polly. Jealous of your own picture. That settles it: no more “Nays” for me. We'll give the folks in Oldtown a surprise, Polly, and the wedding shall be in the old church.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Oh, Bijah! But don't be in a hurry. Be serious and tell me about Mr. Roger.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
You know how he did old Newcomb up that day in camp?
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, that was the time when Pete was injured and was sent home by the colonel.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Wal, Newcomb ain't done for yet. You see, when Mr. Roger was in the bank, I was there too. Of course, I wasn't president or director, Polly; only had to sorter keep my eye on everybody, and I jest did. I saw something that when it's known will be worse than dynamite, you jest bet.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
It seems to me that you are a rolling - stone, Bijah. The last time I heard of you before the war, you were poultry farming in Oldtown.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
I could not make that work. I had read about the money in raising poultry. Fortunes made in no time; and my fancy pictured this enormous poultry farm. The name of Bijah Bright immortalized. Oh, yes, there's money in it, Polly; for I left all mine there, and had only experience to put in my pocket.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
But what is the wonderful news you have to tell?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Just wait. You want to be proud of me. It will be a scorcher.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Don't be so mysterious, Bijah; you don't know everything in this world.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
No, and I don't want to. Let me be sure that the heart of Miss Polly Primrose beats for me alone, and that will satisfy my cravings for knowledge. Come, let us depart to the charms of the culinary department. Methinks I see visions of your pies, Polly. There in each other's genial society we will partake of pie, and talk over that coming wedding in Oldtown.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Tell your master, Mr. Newcomb, that I will see him this evening.
#PATRICK KILROY.
Indade, sir, he shall have your orders. Faith, it's a foine pie they be afther baking for Newcomb. By me powers, I wouldn't loike to be here at the cutting of it.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
It is hard to believe in Newcomb's treachery; he has always seemed so warm a friend.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Gordon, what did that messenger want? Who sent him?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Randolph Newcomb.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I thought as much; what was the message?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Asking permission to see me!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You did not consent?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Yes, Ruth, I am to see him this evening.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He shall not see you.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Ruth!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Gordon, why will you let him poison your heart against Roger? He is wily and cunning; you have proof of his treachery, yet your heart, once loyal to your friend, cannot without a struggle believe in his dishonor. Think no more of this man, but tell me of Roger, and that night in camp.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Poor fellow, his experience has been a bitter one. Shall I tell you the whole story, little one?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, Gordon, every word.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
When the call for volunteers was heard throughout the country, Roger's heart responded to the call. Entering the service as a private, he tried to forget his wrongs in earnest work. Knowing the attempt upon my life, he sought the man who fired the shot. Dowling was confined as prisoner, awaiting sentence. Roger promised to help him, if he would confess the name of the instigator of the crime. Dowling at last did so, and you know who the guilty one proved to be. Oh, Ruth, to think a tried and old friend could be so base.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Never mind, Gordon; perhaps better now to learn his falseness than later; go on.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Roger, knowing that Newcomb would not stop at one attempt, determined to place himself in his way and act the knave. Assuming a disguise, he so completely lost his identity that Newcomb was well deceived, and before many meetings employed Roger to finish the work which had proved a blunder in the beginning. It was, as you know, planned for the night that Roger would act as my sentinel: the time after taps. Newcomb, always solicitous for my welfare, was a daily visitor in camp, and that night was on the watch to be sure that there was no blundering in the work.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Gordon, it chills my blood to think of it.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
To deceive him, Roger aimed at me, but fired at him, and would have killed him on the spot, but Pete, having been warned that my life was in danger, was on the watch, and sprang upon Roger's back and caught his arm; the shot grazed Newcomb's wrist.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Brave Pete and noble Roger.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
And to think, Ruth, that this was all for revenge. Thank Heaven, he did not succeed in winning the heart that, full of love and noble devotion, has been my inspiration in my darkest hours.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yet you will see Newcomb again.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
He wishes to compromise. Ruth, how pale you look. When are the roses coming back to your cheeks?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
When all is well with Roger, and you are happy again.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
My heart will not be lighter until I ask Roger's forgiveness for doubting him. I wonder why he does not return?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He is seeking more evidence to clear his name.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
I am going to my study, Ruth. My head feels heavy; perhaps a short sleep will refresh me. Ruth, you too have much to forgive. I have doubted your brother.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
But not in your heart, Gordon. I have always been sure of that.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Thank Heaven that my harsh words have not crushed out all your faith.
#DOROTHY.
Go on, Pinky, I am just dying to hear.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
You see, we knew it all the time, but just how and when Roger was to square it with Newcomb was beyond our knowledge. You ought to have been there—just a jolly row. When Roger threw off his disguise, you should have seen Newcomb's face. Old Nick himself could not have looked more insane.
#DOROTHY.
Then the plot I overheard was no news to Roger?
#PINKERTON POTTS.
No, for under the disguise of Gibbs he held that interview with Newcomb.
#DOROTHY.
Right in this room, and I didn't know it. Well, I never! But isn't it just glorious, Pinky. How did Roger escape arrest?
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Hard as it was for the colonel to believe Newcomb guilty, he, of course, took Roger's side. Newcomb tried a game of bluff, but it didn't work. He is at large, but we are only waiting for some new development. It will come, and with it the downfall of Newcomb.
#DOROTHY.
He richly deserves it. Think of the wrong he has done Roger.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Your faith and devotion to Roger have just made me hungry. I want some one to have faith in me, too. Now, don't breathe it, but I've just “gone and done” it myself.
#DOROTHY.
Pinky, what do you mean? You are in love with a girl?
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Why, of course. You would not have me fall in love with a spinster of many summers, would you? Guess who it is.
#DOROTHY.
I cannot for the very life of me imagine who it can be.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Let me whisper it.
#DOROTHY.
No, really? Mollie? My dearest friend. There, I knew she had some secret. Pinky, I could just hug you, but I won't. I will reserve that demonstration for Mollie. Do you remember what I told you about the fascinating little woman? Now Roger will have an opportunity to return some of your happy remarks. Polly, my hat and wrap.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Yes, miss.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Why, where are you going?
#DOROTHY.
To see Mollie, of course, and talk it all over. I will tell her what a sweet lamb I think you are.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Good enough, Potts: your ears will burn steadily for just one hour. No, I will follow and save my reputation.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
The colonel will see me in his private room?
#PETE.
Yes, sah; dis way, sah.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
What would you have, Mr. Newcomb?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
I would speak with the colonel, madam.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Not in this house. You have done mischief enough with your treachery. My house shall see no more of it.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Harsh words from you, an old friend, Mrs. Graham.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Don't call us friends, Mr. Newcomb. The time is past for that. From the first, your presence has been distasteful to me. I tried to be courteous, for you posed as my husband's friend. Now that we know you in your true colors, I can speak freely. I loathe and despise you; leave this house.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Excuse me, Mrs. Graham, but your husband has given me his word that he will see me.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And you have mine—you shall not see him.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
You are a clever woman, Mrs. Graham, and though you once scorned my love, I cannot but admire your courage.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Your love! That is an emotion which has never entered your being. Your heart is too cold and treacherous; it cannot harbor that which is loyal and true. I am only too thankful that I escaped such pretensions.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Have a care, madam; I am too dangerous to trifle with. Let me pass! No woman shall stand in my way!
#ROGER CARRUTH.
What are you trying to do, sir?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Roger Carruth! You here?
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Yes, I am here.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
He wishes to hold a private interview with the colonel, and I object.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Pete, tell your master I would like to see him here.
#PETE.
Yas, massa. Golly, tribulations am a - comin'. Massa Newcomb wish he were a deader.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Mr. Carruth, this interview is for the colonel alone.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Sorry, Newcomb, but as I take an active interest in your welfare, you must submit to my presence.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Roger and Newcomb together?
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Yes, colonel. Newcomb wishes to see you on a matter of business; I surely think I have the right to hear.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
No one has a better. Speak, Newcomb, before us all.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Very well; I have no hesitancy. I thought possibly Mrs. Graham—
#ROGER CARRUTH.
If you have anything worth saying, speak, and don't waste words.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Your scheme was a bold one, young man, and perhaps you think that we are quits; but you have not yet been acquitted of the crime of forgery. I alone hold the key to that mystery , and it will be well for you to listen to what I have to say. You accuse me as instigator of the crime of attempting the life of the colonel. Branded as a forger, who will take your word for that?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Newcomb, leave this house!
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Wait, colonel. Let me deal with him. What compromise do you wish to make?
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Let all suspicion fall from me, and I will give you my word that your name shall be cleared.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
You would buy my silence, sir, as you thought you did that of your accomplice. You, deeply scarred as you are by depravity and guilt, dare to make me such an offer? No; a thousand times, no. You will meet your deserts. For myself, time will prove my innocence.
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Will it, indeed? You overrate your ability. I hold you in my power.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
And I hold you in mine.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Bijah!
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Bright, the bank's private detective!
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Exactly so. Mr. Newcomb, I am afraid your nice little scheme will be “smashed to smithereens,” for it's my turn to play my hand. You forget that, as private detective, it was my duty to shadow every one ,—even your Royal Highness; and you can jest bet your life, I did my duty.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
What is it? Have you any proofs?
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Proofs? Yes; that Roger Carruth is innocent of forgery, and that Mr. Randolph Newcomb has that honor.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Newcomb!
#RANDOLPH NEWCOMB.
Man, it is false.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Don't blacken your soul with another lie. I hold the trump card.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Two gentlemen are at the door.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Yes; friends of Mr. Newcomb. Colonel, shall we not bid him good - evening?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Newcomb, leave my house; and may you never enter it again.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
No fear of that. He has two accounts to settle.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Bijah, how much I have to thank you for!
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Mr. Bright, you have done your work well. I have seen your bravery on the battlefield, your honor and loyalty here. Your country may well be proud of you.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
Thank you, colonel. If I could only hear Polly say that.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Indeed I will, if you will give me the chance.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
That's well said, Polly.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Gordon, are you satisfied?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Roger, can you ever forgive me?
#ROGER CARRUTH.
With my whole heart, sir. We have much to be grateful for, that fate led me into Newcomb's way. But where is Dorothy?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Here she comes, laughing as usual. If she were wrecked in mid ocean, that silvery laugh of hers would wake echoes on the waves.
#DOROTHY.
Another ripple on the matrimonial sea. Somebody's engaged. Guess who it is.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Engaged? I give it up.
#DOROTHY.
Allow me to present Major Pinkerton Potts as the culprit, and his victim is —Roger!
#ROGER CARRUTH.
That is news to me, major.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Back again, old man. I am glad to see you.
#DOROTHY.
Well, you needn't make fun of me. It's my dearest friend Mollie.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Major, I indeed congratulate you.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Thought you would follow my example, eh, old man?
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Yes; yours was such a lucky prize, thought I would try my hand.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Mollie is well worth winning, major.
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Thank you, Mrs. Graham.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Dorothy, what is the best news you could wish for?
#DOROTHY.
Your name cleared, and all happy once more.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Then it is yours. I am an accused man no longer.
#DOROTHY.
Honor bright? How did you find it out?
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Through that good friend of ours, Bijah Bright.
#DOROTHY.
Mr. Bright, I come to thank you once more. Polly, you can trust this man. He has proved loyal every time.
#POLLY PRIMROSE.
Thank you, Miss Dorothy. It's pleased I am to hear you say so.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
She has promised to marry me, and we invite you to Oldtown for the wedding.
#DOROTHY.
I accept upon the spot. Be good to him, Polly; he deserves it.
#BIJAH BRIGHT.
That she will. I can trust her for that.
#PETE.
O Massa Colonel, such a time; it's jest orful. Massa Newcomb he jests rants and tears like a house afire. Down in de hall am two gennlemen a - talking to him right smart. Shall I ax 'em up?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
No, Pete. They will settle it amongst themselves. Do you remember what I promised you? That when the war was over I would help you find your mammy.
#PETE.
'Deed, Massa Colonel, I 'members, but 'specs der ain't no great hurry for dat. Yer's been so good to me, an' de missis, too. I should jes lub to stay wid you. Please massa, don't send me away.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
No; no fear of that. As long as you are a good boy, you shall stay with me. I shall not forget what you did for me.
#PETE.
Please, massa, I done de bes I knows.
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
We all know that, and when your mammy does find you, she will be proud of her boy. And now, Pete, for the sake of the good old times in camp, give us one of your songs.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
Those songs brought the tears to our eyes when we thought of you all at home.
#DOROTHY.
But no more tears now. No more trouble: only sunshine. Just think of it, Roger. Pinky is to be married, you his best man, and I maid of honor.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
I like that. Why not reverse things?
#DOROTHY.
Oh, no; my last chance for that dignity. Wouldn't miss it for worlds. Besides, I promised for us both; didn't I, Pinky?
#PINKERTON POTTS.
Indeed you did. No backsliding, old man.
#ROGER CARRUTH.
As this little maid has signed the compact, I will help her keep it.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Is your heart lighter, Gordon?
#COLONEL GRAHAM.
Yes, Ruth; and already the color is coming to your cheeks. That, with Roger's forgiveness, makes me happy again. Ah! we all have suffered much, and have gained the happiness which I trust the future will bring. Ruth, the household enemy is routed at last. There are bright days before us, but ever and anon will cross our paths memories of these dark days: the treachery of a friend; the bravery of our brother , who could forget and forgive, and, at the risk of his own life, come to your husband's rescue “After Taps.”
