#ACTRESS.
Ah, Count.
#VON BREMER.
Your mother said I might, otherwise I would not—
#ACTRESS.
Please, come closer.
#VON BREMER.
I kiss your hand. Pardon me—when you come in from the street … I can’t see a thing yet. So … here we are I kiss your hand.
#ACTRESS.
Please sit down, Count.
#VON BREMER.
Your mother said, My daughter isn’t well… Nothing serious, I hope.
#ACTRESS.
Nothing serious? I was on the verge of death.
#VON BREMER.
Oh, dear, oh, dear, is it possible?
#ACTRESS.
It is very good of you to have taken the trouble to call.
#VON BREMER.
On the verge of death! And only last night you acted divinely.
#ACTRESS.
It was a great triumph, wasn’t it?
#VON BREMER.
Tremendous!… The audience was carried away. I won’t say anything about myself.
#ACTRESS.
Thanks, for the beautiful flowers.
#VON BREMER.
Nothing at all, Mademoiselle.
#ACTRESS.
There they are.
#VON BREMER.
You were literally overwhelmed with flowers and wreaths yesterday.
#ACTRESS.
They are still in my dressing - room. All I brought home was your flowers.
#VON BREMER.
How sweet of you.
#VON BREMER.
But, Mademoiselle.
#ACTRESS.
Don’t be frightened, Count, it doesn’t put you under any obligations.
#VON BREMER.
You are a strange being … a sort of a problem almost—
#ACTRESS.
Miss Birken, I suppose, is much less of a problem.
#VON BREMER.
That little lady isn’t a problem at all, although … I really know her only very slightly.
#ACTRESS.
Oh!
#VON BREMER.
That’s the actual truth. But you are a problem. I’ve always had a yearning for a problem. It’s really been a deep personal loss to me, that until yesterday… I never saw you act.
#ACTRESS.
Really?
#VON BREMER.
Yes! You see, going to the theater is so complicated. I am used to dining late … then when I get there, the best part of the play is over. Isn’t that true?
#ACTRESS.
From now on, I suppose, you will dine earlier.
#VON BREMER.
I’ve thought of that too. Or maybe I won’t dine at all. Dining isn’t a special pleasure anyhow.
#ACTRESS.
Are there any pleasures left to an old man like you?
#VON BREMER.
That’s a question I often ask myself. But I am not an old man. There must be some other reason.
#ACTRESS.
Do you think so?
#VON BREMER.
Yes. Bobby, for instance, says, that I am a philosopher. You know he means that I do too much thinking.
#ACTRESS.
Yes … thinking is a misfortune.
#VON BREMER.
I have too much time, that’s why I reflect. You see, I’ve often thought if they would transfer me to Vienna, things would be better. There’s diversion here, stimulation. But at the bottom, it’s not really very different from up there.
#ACTRESS.
What do you mean by “up there”?
#VON BREMER.
Well, down there, you know, in Hungary, in the God forsaken country towns, where I’ve been stationed most of the time.
#ACTRESS.
And what did you do in Hungary?
#VON BREMER.
Well, as I am telling you, military service.
#ACTRESS.
Yes, but why did you stay in Hungary so long?
#VON BREMER.
Oh, things happen that way.
#ACTRESS.
But it must be enough to drive one mad.
#VON BREMER.
But why? You have a lot more work there, than here. You know, drilling recruits, breaking in mounts … and the country really isn’t as bad as they say. They are really quite beautiful, the lowlands—and marvelous sunsets. Too bad I’m not a painter, I’ve often thought if I were, I would paint them. We had a young chap, Splany, in our regiment, who could do it.—But, dear me, what dull stories I am telling you.
#ACTRESS.
Please go on; they are delightful!
#VON BREMER.
Do you know, the nice thing about you is the way one can chat with you, Bobby told me all about it. And it’s so seldom one can find any one like that.
#ACTRESS.
Down there in Hungary, I suppose.
#VON BREMER.
But it’s quite the same in Vienna! People are always the same. Where there are more of them, the crowd is larger. That’s the whole difference. Tell me, do you really like people?
#ACTRESS.
Like them—? I hate them! I hate to look at them. I never see any one. I’m always alone. Nobody enters my house.
#VON BREMER.
You see, I sort of thought that you hated people. It must often be the case with artists. If one lives in the higher regions… Well, you are lucky, you know at least why you live!
#ACTRESS.
Who told you that? I haven’t the slightest notion what I’m living for!
#VON BREMER.
But really—to be famous—to be fêted—
#ACTRESS.
Does that mean happiness?
#VON BREMER.
Happiness? There really is no such thing as happiness. All the things that people talk about most, don’t exist … for instance, love. That’s one of them.
#ACTRESS.
I suppose you are right.
#VON BREMER.
Enjoyment … intoxication … very good, nobody can deny them … they are something real. Now, when I am enjoying myself … very good, I am aware that I am enjoying myself. Or I am intoxicated, good. That also is something real. And when it’s over, well then it’s over.
#ACTRESS.
It is over.
#VON BREMER.
But as soon as one does not, how shall I express it, as soon as one does not give oneself up to the moment, I mean, if one thinks of the future or the past … well, everything is over in a moment… Afterwards … there is sadness … before … there is uncertainty … in a word, one only becomes confused. Isn’t that so?
#ACTRESS.
It seems, you have grasped the essence of things.
#VON BREMER.
And, you see, when you have once clearly grasped this, it really doesn’t matter whether you live in Vienna or in the Puszta or in Steinamanger. You see, for instance … where may I put my cap? Yes, thank you … what were we talking about?
#ACTRESS.
About the Puszta.
#VON BREMER.
Of course. Well, as I said, there isn’t much difference, whether I spend the evening in the officers’ mess or at the club. It’s all the same.
#ACTRESS.
And what about love?
#VON BREMER.
If you believe in it, some one will always be there who will love you.
#ACTRESS.
Like Miss Birken, for example.
#VON BREMER.
I really don’t see why you always have to come back to that little lady.
#ACTRESS.
But she’s your mistress, isn’t she?
#VON BREMER.
Who says so?
#ACTRESS.
Everybody knows it.
#VON BREMER.
Except myself, strange to say.
#ACTRESS.
But you fought a duel on her account!
#VON BREMER.
Maybe. I was even killed without my knowing it.
#ACTRESS.
You are a gentleman, won’t you sit closer to me?
#VON BREMER.
With pleasure.
#ACTRESS.
Here. I knew you would come to - day.
#VON BREMER.
How did you know?
#ACTRESS.
I knew it last night in the theater.
#VON BREMER.
You saw me from the stage, then?
#ACTRESS.
But man alive! Didn’t you notice that I acted for you alone?
#VON BREMER.
No, really?
#ACTRESS.
I was as on wings, when I saw you sitting in the first row.
#VON BREMER.
As on wings? On my account? I hadn’t the slightest suspicion that you noticed me!
#ACTRESS.
Your aristocratic reserve is enough to drive one to despair.
#VON BREMER.
But…
#ACTRESS.
“But”!… At least, take your saber off!
#VON BREMER.
If you permit.
#ACTRESS.
And now give me a kiss.
#ACTRESS.
It would have been better if I had never seen you.
#VON BREMER.
But this seems better to me.
#ACTRESS.
Count, you are a poseur!
#VON BREMER.
I—why?
#ACTRESS.
Can’t you imagine how happy many a man would be if he were in your place!
#VON BREMER.
I’m perfectly happy.
#ACTRESS.
Well, I thought happiness didn’t exist. Why do you look at me that way? I believe you are afraid of me, Count!
#VON BREMER.
I told you, Mademoiselle, you are a problem.
#ACTRESS.
Oh, don’t bother me with your philosophy … come to me. And ask me for anything at all … you can have whatever you want. You are so handsome.
#VON BREMER.
Well then, may I ask that I may call again this evening?
#ACTRESS.
This evening … but I have to act then.
#VON BREMER.
After the play.
#ACTRESS.
And you ask for nothing else?
#VON BREMER.
I shall ask for everything else after the play.
#ACTRESS.
You can beg a long while then, you abominable poseur.
#VON BREMER.
But, see, we’ve been perfectly frank with each other so far … it seems to me it would be so much more beautiful after the play … much cozier than now, when … I have a sort of feeling the door might open any moment…
#ACTRESS.
It does not open from the outside.
#VON BREMER.
Well, you see, I have an idea one shouldn’t lightly spoil in advance something which may be very beautiful.
#ACTRESS.
Possibly!…
#VON BREMER.
To tell the truth, love in the morning seems rather horrible to me.
#ACTRESS.
Well—you are about the worst case of lunacy I have ever met!
#VON BREMER.
I am not talking about women in general … because in general it doesn’t make any difference anyway. But women like you … no, you may call me a fool a hundred times over. But women like you … one doesn’t take them before breakfast. And so … you know … so…
#ACTRESS.
Oh, but you are a darling!
#VON BREMER.
You understand, what I have said, don’t you? I sort of imagine it like…
#ACTRESS.
How do you imagine it?
#VON BREMER.
Like this… I wait for you in a carriage after the play, then we drive somewhere for supper—
#ACTRESS.
I am not Miss Birken.
#VON BREMER.
I didn’t mean to say you were. Only, it seems to me, you have to be in the right sort of mood for everything. In my case the mood doesn’t come until supper. The most beautiful thing of all is when we drive home together, and then…
#ACTRESS.
And then?
#VON BREMER.
And then … well, that depends upon circumstances.
#ACTRESS.
Do sit closer. Closer.
#VON BREMER.
Seems to me, that out of the pillows comes a fragrance … mignonette—isn’t it?
#ACTRESS.
It’s very warm in here, don’t you think so?
#ACTRESS.
Oh, Count, that is contrary to your program.
#VON BREMER.
Who said anything about “program.” I never have any program.
#VON BREMER.
It really is very warm.
#ACTRESS.
Do you think so? And so dark, just as if it were evening… It is evening … it is night… Close your eyes, if there is too much light for you. Come!… Come!…
#ACTRESS.
And what about atmosphere now, you poseur?
#VON BREMER.
You are a little devil.
#ACTRESS.
What a thing to say!
#VON BREMER.
Well, then an angel.
#ACTRESS.
You should have been an actor! Really! You understand women! And do you know, what I shall do now?
#VON BREMER.
Well?
#ACTRESS.
I shall tell you that I shall never see you again.
#VON BREMER.
But why?
#ACTRESS.
Never, never. You are too dangerous! You would drive a woman mad. Here you are standing before me, as though nothing had happened.
#VON BREMER.
But…
#ACTRESS.
Please remember, Count, I have just given you everything.
#VON BREMER.
I shall never forget it!
#ACTRESS.
And what about to - night?
#VON BREMER.
What do you mean?
#ACTRESS.
Well—you wanted to wait for me after the theater?
#VON BREMER.
Oh, yes, let’s say, the day after to - morrow.
#ACTRESS.
What do you mean by “the day after to - morrow”? We were talking about to - day.
#VON BREMER.
There wouldn’t be much sense in that.
#ACTRESS.
Old man!
#VON BREMER.
You don’t quite understand me. What I mean has rather to do, how shall I express myself, rather concerns the soul.
#ACTRESS.
What concern of mine is your soul?
#VON BREMER.
Believe me, it has much to do with it. It seems all wrong to me, this notion, that you can separate the two.
#ACTRESS.
Don’t bother me with your philosophy. If I want any of that, I can read books.
#VON BREMER.
One never learns from books.
#ACTRESS.
Very true! And that’s why you ought to wait for me to - night. As to the soul, we will come to some sort of an understanding, you villain!
#VON BREMER.
Well, then, if I may, I shall wait in my carriage…
#ACTRESS.
You shall wait for me here in my home—
#VON BREMER.
… After the play.
#ACTRESS.
Of course.
#ACTRESS.
What are you doing?
#VON BREMER.
It seems to me it is time for me to go. For a formal call I have stayed a bit too long as it is.
#ACTRESS.
Well, this evening it shall be a formal call.
#VON BREMER.
Do you think so?
#ACTRESS.
I’ll take care of that. And now give me a last kiss, you darling little philosopher. Here, you seducer, you … sweet child, you seller of souls, you … panther. Count, you have done me a great honor.
#VON BREMER.
Not at all, mademoiselle! Au revoir.
#ACTRESS.
Good - by, and love to Steinamanger.
