#MICHAEL MISKELL.
Isn't it a hard case, Mike McInerney, myself and yourself to be left here in the bed, and it the feast day of Saint Colman, and the rest of the ward attending on the Mass.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Is it sitting up by the hearth you are wishful to be, Michael Miskell, with cold in the shoulders and with speckled shins? Let you rise up so, and you well able to do it, not like myself that has pains the same as tin - tacks within in my inside.
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
If you have pains within in your inside there is no one can see it or know of it the way they can see my own knees that are swelled up with the rheumatism, and my hands that are twisted in ridges the same as an old cabbage stalk. It is easy to be talking about soreness and about pains, and they maybe not to be in it at all.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
To open me and to analyze me you would know what sort of a pain and a soreness I have in my heart and in my chest. But I'm not one like yourself to be cursing and praying and tormenting the time the nuns are at hand, thinking to get a bigger share than myself of the nourishment and of the milk.
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
That's the way you do be picking at me and faulting me. I had a share and a good share in my early time, and it's well you know that, and the both of us reared in Skehanagh.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
You may say that, indeed, we are both of us reared in Skehanagh. Little wonder you to have good nourishment the time we were both rising, and you bringing away my rabbits out of the snare.
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
And you didn't bring away my own eels, I suppose, I was after spearing in the Turlough? Selling them to the nuns in the convent you did, and letting on they to be your own. For you were always a cheater and a schemer, grabbing every earthly thing for your own profit.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
And you were no grabber yourself, I suppose, till your land and all you had grabbed wore away from you!
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
If I lost it itself, it was through the crosses I met with and I going through the world. I never was a rambler and a card - player like yourself, Mike McInerney, that ran through all and lavished it unknown to your mother!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Lavished it, is it? And if I did was it you yourself led me to lavish it or some other one? It is on my own floor I would be to - day and in the face of my family, but for the misfortune I had to be put with a bad next door neighbor that was yourself. What way did my means go from me is it? Spending on fencing, spending on walls, making up gates, putting up doors, that would keep your hens and your ducks from coming in through starvation on my floor, and every four footed beast you had from preying and trespassing on my oats and my mangolds and my little lock of hay!
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
O to listen to you! And I striving to please you and to be kind to you and to close my ears to the abuse you would be calling and letting out of your mouth. To trespass on your crops is it? It's little temptation there was for my poor beasts to ask to cross the mering. My God Almighty! What had you but a little corner of a field!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
And what do you say to my garden that your two pigs had destroyed on me the year of the big tree being knocked, and they making gaps in the wall.
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
Ah, there does be a great deal of gaps knocked in a twelve - month. Why wouldn't they be knocked by the thunder, the same as the tree, or some storm that came up from the west?
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
It was the west wind, I suppose, that devoured my green cabbage? And that rooted up my Champion potatoes? And that ate the gooseberries themselves from off the bush?
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
What are you saying? The two quietest pigs ever I had, no way wicked and well ringed. They were not ten minutes in it. It would be hard for them to eat strawberries in that time, let alone gooseberries that's full of thorns.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
They were not quiet, but very ravenous pigs you had that time, as active as a fox they were, killing my young ducks. Once they had blood tasted you couldn't stop them.
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
And what happened myself the fair day of Esserkelly, the time I was passing your door? Two brazened dogs that rushed out and took a piece of me. I never was the better of it or of the start I got, but wasting from then till now!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Thinking you were a wild beast they did, that had made his escape out of the traveling show, with the red eyes of you and the ugly face of you, and the two crooked legs of you that wouldn't hardly stop a pig in a gap. Sure any dog that had any life in it at all would be roused and stirred seeing the like of you going the road!
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
I did well taking out a summons against you that time. It is a great wonder you not to have been bound over through your lifetime, but the laws of England is queer.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
What ailed me that I did not summons yourself after you stealing away the clutch of eggs I had in the barrel, and I away in Ardrahan searching out a clocking hen.
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
To steal your eggs is it? Is that what you are saying now? The Lord is in heaven, and Peter and the saints, and yourself that was in Ardrahan that day put a hand on them as soon as myself! Isn't it a bad story for me to be wearing out my days beside you the same as a spancelled goat. Chained I am and tethered I am to a man that is ram - shacking his mind for lies!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
If it is a bad story for you, Michael Miskell, it is a worse story again for myself. A Miskell to be next and near me through the whole of the four quarters of the year. I never heard there to be any great name on the Miskells as there was on my own race and name.
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
You didn't, is it? Well, you could hear it if you had but ears to hear it. Go across to Lisheen Crannagh and down to the sea and to Newtown Lynch and the mills of Duras and you'll find a Miskell, and as far as Dublin!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
What signifies Crannagh and the mills of Duras? Look at all my own generations that are buried at the Seven Churches. And how many generations of the Miskells are buried in it? Answer me that!
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
I tell you but for the wheat that was to be sowed there would be more side cars and more common cars at my father's funeral than at any funeral ever left your own door. And as to my mother, she was a Cuffe from Claregalway, and it's she had the purer blood!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
And what do you say to the banshee? Isn't she apt to have knowledge of the ancient race? Was ever she heard to screech or to cry for the Miskells? Or for the Cuffes from Claregalway? She was not, but for the six families, the Hyneses, the Foxes, the Faheys, the Dooleys, the McInerneys. It is of the nature of the McInerneys she is I am thinking, crying them the same as a king's children.
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
It is a pity the banshee not to be crying for yourself at this minute, and giving you a warning to quit your lies and your chat and your arguing and your contrary ways; for there is no one under the rising sun could stand you. I tell you you are not behaving as in the presence of the Lord.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Is it wishful for my death you are? Let it come and meet me now and welcome so long as it will part me from yourself! And I say, and I would kiss the book on it, I to have one request only to be granted, and I leaving it in my will, it is what I would request, nine furrows of the field, nine ridges of the hills, nine waves of the ocean to be put between your grave and my own grave the time we will be laid in the ground!
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
Amen to that! Nine ridges, is it? No, but let the whole ridge of the world separate us till the Day of Judgment! I would not be laid anear you at the Seven Churches, I to get Ireland without a divide!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
And after that again! I'd sooner than ten pound in my hand, I to know that my shadow and my ghost will not be knocking about with your shadow and your ghost, and the both of us waiting our time. I'd sooner be delayed in Purgatory! Now, have you anything to say?
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
I have everything to say, if I had but the time to say it!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Let me up out of this till I'll choke you!
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
You scolding pauper you!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Wait a while!
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
Wait a while yourself!
#MRS. DONOHOE.
They bade me come up here by the stair. I never was in this place at all. I don't know am I right. Which now of the two of ye is Mike McInerney?
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Who is it is calling me by my name?
#MRS. DONOHOE.
Sure amn't I your sister, Honor McInerney that was, that is now Honor Donohoe.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
So you are, I believe. I didn't know you till you pushed anear me. It is time indeed for you to come see me, and I in this place five year or more. Thinking me to be no credit to you, I suppose, among that tribe of the Donohoes. I wonder they to give you leave to come ask am I living yet or dead?
#MRS. DONOHOE.
Ah, sure, I buried the whole string of them. Himself was the last to go. The Lord be praised he got a fine natural death. Sure we must go through our crosses. And he got a lovely funeral; it would delight you to hear the priest reading the Mass. My poor John Donohoe! A nice clean man, you couldn't but be fond of him. Very severe on the tobacco he was, but he wouldn't touch the drink.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
And is it in Curranroe you are living yet?
#MRS. DONOHOE.
It is so. He left all to myself. But it is a lonesome thing the head of a house to have died!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
I hope that he has left you a nice way of living?
#MRS. DONOHOE.
Fair enough, fair enough. A wide lovely house I have; a few acres of grass land ... the grass does be very sweet that grows among the stones. And as to the sea, there is something from it every day of the year, a handful of periwinkles to make kitchen, or cockles maybe. There is many a thing in the sea is not decent, but cockles is fit to put before the Lord!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
You have all that! And you without e'er a man in the house?
#MRS. DONOHOE.
It is what I am thinking, yourself might come and keep me company. It is no credit to me a brother of my own to be in this place at all.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
I'll go with you! Let me out of this! It is the name of the McInerneys will be rising on every side!
#MRS. DONOHOE.
I don't know. I was ignorant of you being kept to the bed.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
I am not kept to it, but maybe an odd time when there is a colic rises up within me. My stomach always gets better the time there is a change in the moon. I'd like well to draw anear you. My heavy blessing on you, Honor Donohoe, for the hand you have held out to me this day.
#MRS. DONOHOE.
Sure you could be keeping the fire in, and stirring the pot with the bit of Indian meal for the hens, and milking the goat and taking the tacklings off the donkey at the door; and maybe putting out the cabbage plants in their time. For when the old man died the garden died.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
I could to be sure, and be cutting the potatoes for seed. What luck could there be in a place and a man not to be in it? Is that now a suit of clothes you have brought with you?
#MRS. DONOHOE.
It is so, the way you will be tasty coming in among the neighbors at Curranroe.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
My joy you are! It is well you earned me! Let me up out of this! That now is a good frieze coat ... and a hat in the fashion....
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
And is it going out of this you are, Mike McInerney?
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Don't you hear I am going? To Curranroe I am going. Going I am to a place where I will get every good thing!
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
And is it to leave me here after you you will?
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Every good thing! The goat and the kid are there, the sheep and the lamb are there, the cow does be running and she coming to be milked! Plowing and seed sowing, blossom at Christmas time, the cuckoo speaking through the dark days of the year! Ah, what are you talking about? Wheat high in hedges, no talk about the rent! Salmon in the rivers as plenty as hurf! Spending and getting and nothing scarce! Sport and pleasure, and music on the strings! Age will go from me and I will be young again. Geese and turkeys for the hundreds and drink for the whole world!
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
Ah, Mike, is it truth you are saying, you to go from me and to leave me with rude people and with townspeople, and with people of every parish in the union, and they having no respect for me or no wish for me at all!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Whist now and I'll leave you ... my pipe ; and I'll engage it is Honor Donohoe won't refuse to be sending you a few ounces of tobacco an odd time, and neighbors coming to the fair in November or in the month of May.
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
Ah, what signifies tobacco? All that I am craving is the talk. There to be no one at all to say out to whatever thought might be rising in my innate mind! To be lying here and no conversible person in it would be the abomination of misery!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Look now, Honor.... It is what I often heard said, two to be better than one.... Sure if you had an old trouser was full of holes ... or a skirt ... wouldn't you put another in under it that might be as tattered as itself, and the two of them together would make some sort of a decent show?
#MRS. DONOHOE.
Ah, what are you saying? There is no holes in that suit I brought you now, but as sound it is as the day I spun it for himself.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
It is what I am thinking, Honor.... I do be weak an odd time.... Any load I would carry, it preys upon my side ... and this man does be weak an odd time with the swelling in his knees ... but the two of us together it's not likely it is at the one time we would fail. Bring the both of us with you, Honor, and the height of the castle of luck on you, and the both of us together will make one good hardy man!
#MRS. DONOHOE.
I'd like my job! Is it queer in the head you are grown asking me to bring in a stranger off the road?
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
I am not, ma'am, but an old neighbor I am. If I had forecasted this asking I would have asked it myself. Michael Miskell I am, that was in the next house to you in Skehanagh!
#MRS. DONOHOE.
For pity's sake! Michael Miskell is it? That's worse again. Yourself and Mike that never left fighting and scolding and attacking one another! Sparring at one another like two young pups you were, and threatening one another after like two grown dogs!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
All the quarreling was ever in the place it was myself did it. Sure his anger rises fast and goes away like the wind. Bring him out with myself now, Honor Donohoe, and God bless you.
#MRS. DONOHOE.
Well, then, I will not bring him out, and I will not bring yourself out, and you not to learn better sense. Are you making yourself ready to come?
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
I am thinking, maybe ... it is a mean thing for a man that is shivering into seventy years to go changing from place to place.
#MRS. DONOHOE.
Well, take your luck or leave it. All I asked was to save you from the hurt and the harm of the year.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Bring the both of us with you or I will not stir out of this.
#MRS. DONOHOE.
Give me back my fine suit so , till I go look for a man of my own!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Let you go so, as you are so unnatural and so disobliging, and look for some man of your own, God help him! For I will not go with you at all!
#MRS. DONOHOE.
It is too much time I lost with you, and dark night waiting to overtake me on the road. Let the two of you stop together, and the back of my hand to you. It is I will leave you there the same as God left the Jews!
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
Maybe the house is not so wide as what she says.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Why wouldn't it be wide?
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
Ah, there does be a good deal of middling poor houses down by the sea.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
What would you know about wide houses? Whatever sort of a house you had yourself it was too wide for the provision you had into it.
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
Whatever provision I had in my house it was wholesome provision and natural provision. Herself and her periwinkles! Periwinkles is a hungry sort of food.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Stop your impudence and your chat or it will be the worse for you. I'd bear with my own father and mother as long as any man would, but if they'd vex me I would give them the length of a rope as soon as another!
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
I would never ask at all to go eating periwinkles.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Have you any one to fight me?
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
I have not, only the Lord!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Let you leave putting insults on me so, and death picking at you!
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
Sure I am saying nothing at all to displease you. It is why I wouldn't go eating periwinkles, I'm in dread I might swallow the pin.
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Who in the world wide is asking you to eat them? You're as tricky as a fish in the full tide!
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
Tricky is it! Oh, my curse and the curse of the four and twenty men upon you!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
That the worm may chew you from skin to marrow bone!
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
I'll leave my death on you, you scheming vagabone!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
By cripes! I'll pull out your pin feathers!
#MICHAEL MISKELL.
You tyrant! You big bully you!
#MIKE MCINERNEY.
Take this so, you stabbing ruffian you!
