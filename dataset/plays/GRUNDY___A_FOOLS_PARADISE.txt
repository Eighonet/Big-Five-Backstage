#TOM.
Come, Mildred dear, say "Yes."
#MILDRED.
But I can't say "Yes."
#TOM.
You might help a fellow a bit. I never proposed to anybody before, and I daresay I've done it very badly -
#MILDRED.
No, Tom, you've done it very well.
#TOM.
Say "Yes," then. Of course, I'm not good enough for a girl like you. But I may be some day. My brother Ned's a confirmed bachelor, and it's just on the cards I may be the next Earl of Normantower.
#MILDRED.
Yes, Tom, that's just it. I'm not fit to be a Countess.
#TOM.
Not fit to be a Countess? Why, some of 'em are awful.
#MILDRED.
My brother wouldn't hear of it, I'm sure.
#TOM.
Well, then, you shan't be a Countess. A confirmed bachelor's always the first to get married; and if Ned has a family, I shan't come in for the title. You wouldn't mind being Mrs. Verinder, would you?
#MILDRED.
Oh, Tom! I know ought to say I should, but I shouldn't.
#TOM.
Say "Yes," then.
#MILDRED.
Someone's coming!
#KATE.
Well, children!
#TOM.
Children!
#KATE.
Why aren't you out of doors this beautiful morning?
#MILDRED.
Oh, I wanted to finish this slipper.
#KATE.
Really? And you, Mr. Verinder? I was reading Hiawatha.
#KATE.
You don't say so! Now, how dare you tell me such stories?
#TOM.
It's no use trying to deceive you, Miss Derwent. I've been making love to Mildred.
#KATE.
Making love at ten o'clock in the morning? I'm ashamed of you. It's almost as bad as playing cards by daylight.
#TOM.
I want her to marry me and she won't! She says my family's too good for her - as if anything could be too good for Mildred! I'm sure the Verinders are poor enough. As for me, she forgets my father was cut off with a shilling, and blew'd the lot?
#KATE.
Blew'd the lot.
#MILDRED.
Tom means, his father spent it.
#KATE.
Spent the shilling?
#TOM.
Every penny of it. Oh, we're a reckless lot, we Verinders!
#CINDERELLA.
door, hat on small table up R.C., and goes slowly down to fire - place, R.)
#MILDRED.
And why was he cut off with the shilling?
#TOM.
Because he married the girl he wanted; instead of a girl he didn't want; and his son's going to do the same.
#KATE.
Ah, Mr. Verinder! Marriage is a serious responsibility.
#TOM.
It's serious when you marry the wrong person, but I'm going to marry the right one.
#KATE.
Yes, but who is the right one?
#PHILIP.
Surely, the right one is the one we love.
#TOM.
You think so, Mr. Selwyn?
#KATE.
Because you have been fortunate in your choice, but how many have made a mistake! Even love matches are often unfortunate. Love has a habit of being so one - sided.
#PHILIP.
I haven't found it so! and mine was a love match, if ever there was one. I met my wife quite casually at Brighton - fell in love, proposed, was accepted and married, all within a month.
#KATE.
You married in haste.
#PHILIP.
And by all the laws of cynical philosophy, I ought to have repented at leisure. But I haven't repented. To the confusion of the philosophers, I'm the happiest husband and have the best wife in the world.
#TOM.
There, Miss Derwent! What do you say to that?
#KATE.
That is one side of the picture, but I've seen the other. My mother also married for love.
#PHILIP.
And what was the consequence?
#KATE.
That her daughter will never marry.
#BEATRICE.
Don't say that, Miss Derwent. You are always severe on the gentlemen, but don't be so hard on them as that.
#PHILIP.
Good gracious, Mousey, how you startled me! Your footsteps are so fairy - like, one never knows where you are.
#BEATRICE.
Moral: never tell secrets to Miss Derwent, when you think I'm not listening.
#PHILIP.
My dear, it's no secret that I have the best wife in the world.
#TOM.
Everybody thinks that, Mrs. Selwyn.
#BEATRICE.
Not everybody. To wit - Sir Peter Lund.
#MILDRED.
Oh, what does it matter what that grumpy old bear thinks?
#BEATRICE.
My dear Mildred, Sir Peter Lund is a most able and distinguished man. Having made his fortune as a fashionable physician, he has almost retired from the active pursuit of his profession to devote himself to his innumerable appointments, and to the transactions of all sorts of royal and learned societies, where the clearing of his erudite throat is the signal of the most reverential attention.
#KATE.
And well it may be.
#BEATRICE.
Forgive me, I quite forgot he was a friend of yours.
#PHILIP.
And mine as well, my dear. When Sir Peter was an ordinary family practitioner, he brought both Mildred and myself into the world, he attended my father in his last illness, and in spite of the multitude of his engagements, he is good enough to take an interest in us still. What could be kinder than his voluntary proposal to run down here and see me, simply because he had heard casually that I was rather out of sorts?
#KATE.
Sir Peter is coming here?
#PHILIP.
I expect him this morning.
#BEATRICE.
I can only wonder that in "the multitude of his engagements" he can find the leisure.
#PHILIP.
Sir Peter is one of those wonderful men, who get through the work of a dozen, yet never seem to have anything to do.
#KATE.
Who can always find time for an act of kindness, and are never too busy to remember an old friend.
#BEATRICE.
Well, I will make him as comfortable as I can.
#PHILIP.
I know you will, and the more you see of him the more you will like him. Hallo! Tom, a letter from your brother.
#TOM.
Ned!
#PHILIP.
"A thousand thanks, old man, for your kind invitation to stay with you while Normantower is being prepared for the reception of my august person! How glad I shall be to shake hands with you once more! Expect me when you see me. Yours as always, Ned. P.S. - Fancy you putting up my cub of a brother! Surely the stables were good enough for him."
#MILDRED.
Well, I declare!
#TOM.
Ned always talks like that; but he's a very good brother to me, and always down with the dust, when he's any dust to down with.
#BEATRICE.
You see, Phil, Lord Normantower is quite grateful for your invitation.
#PHILIP.
It was a happy thought of yours to suggest it; but when aren't your thoughts happy? They are always of others.
#PRI.
Sir Peter Lund.
#PHILIP.
Welcome to Ravenhurst! I scarcely expected you so soon. You must have risen early this morning.
#SIR PETER.
Always get up at five. How are you? How d'ye do? How are you, boy?
#BEATRICE.
Always get up at five?
#PHILIP.
And never goes to bed before two. It's a marvel to me how you do it!
#SIR PETER.
It's a marvel to me how you don't do it. That's why you are out of sorts. You eat too much.
#PHILIP.
Sir Peter!
#SIR PETER.
Drink too much.
#BEATRICE.
Sir Peter!
#SIR PETER.
Sleep too much.
#KATE.
Sir Peter!
#SIR PETER.
So do you!
#BEATRICE.
Oh!
#SIR PETER.
Of course you do. Everybody does. What time's the next up train?
#PHILIP.
You're not thinking of going already?
#SIR PETER.
Certainly not. Not going for ten minutes.
#BEATRICE.
Surely you'll stay to lunch?
#SIR PETER.
Lunch, what d'you want with lunch? If you've an appetite for dinner, thank heaven for it, and don't go and spoil it with lunch.
#BEATRICE.
Do you ever eat?
#SIR PETER.
Eat? Like a cormorant.
#PHILIP.
Drink?
#SIR PETER.
Like a fish.
#KATE.
Sleep?
#SIR PETER.
Like a humming - top!
#BEATRICE.
But you say, you oughtn't.
#SIR PETER.
Well? Do you never do what you oughtn't! I do.
#BEATRICE.
Since Sir Peter is so pressed for time -
#SIR PETER.
Pressed for time? Not at all.
#BEATRICE.
I understood you -
#SIR PETER.
You misunderstood me.
#BEATRICE.
At any rate we'd better leave you with your patient. Come, Miss Derwent -
#SIR PETER.
Well, what's the matter with you?
#PHILIP.
Really, Sir Peter! That's what I want you to tell me.
#SIR PETER.
You have a high opinion of the medical profession. Do you suppose we can tell you anything, if you don't tell us first?
#PHILIP.
I have always supposed so.
#SIR PETER.
Error, sir. You tell us everything we tell you. The only difference is, you tell us in English, and we tell you in Latin. You take a fee out of your pocket; we put one in ours.
#PHILIP.
Well, doctor, I can't tell you what's the matter with me. I should very much like to know.
#SIR PETER.
Why! What has it to do with you?
#PHILIP.
A great deal unhappily.
#SIR PETER.
Vulgar fallacy. A patient's complaint concerns nobody but his doctor.
#PHILIP.
I have no energy. I don't take my usual interest in what goes on around me. One day I'm restless - another, lethargic. There's nothing particular the matter with me, but I seem to have no pleasure in existence; and instead of getting better, I get worse.
#SIR PETER.
Happy at home?
#PHILIP.
Perfectly.
#SIR PETER.
How has your marriage answered?
#PHILIP.
My wife is simply a treasure.
#SIR PETER.
Oh! Any money difficulties?
#PHILIP.
None. My father left me beyond reach of any trouble of that sort.
#SIR PETER.
Any pain?
#PHILIP.
No.
#SIR PETER.
I see, Miss Derwent is still with you.
#PHILIP.
And I hope, will remain. Beatrice wouldn't be without her for the world, and I think Mildred almost worships her. I can't sufficiently thank you for the introduction.
#SIR PETER.
How's your appetite?
#PHILIP.
It varies.
#SIR PETER.
I thought Miss Derwent would suit you. I picked her up at Guy's. She was a nurse there. Something about her struck me. Has it struck you?
#PHILIP.
What?
#SIR PETER.
Her likeness to your father.
#PHILIP.
Well, now you mention it, there is a likeness.
#SIR PETER.
Sleep pretty well?
#PHILIP.
Too well. I'm always drowsy.
#SIR PETER.
So, altogether, you're quite a happy family?
#PHILIP.
Yes, doctor. With more money than I know what to do with, heir to a name that is honoured wherever it is known, the husband of the dearest wife in the world, I sometimes think I am the happiest man on earth.
#SIR PETER.
Humph.
#PHILIP.
You smile.
#SIR PETER.
I seem to have dropped into a little paradise.
#PHILIP.
Yes, doctor.
#SIR PETER.
Where's the serpent?
#PHILIP.
The serpent?
#SIR PETER.
There was a serpent even in paradise.
#PHILIP.
There's none in mine.
#SIR PETER.
I'm sorry to hear it. There is only one sort of paradise in which there is no serpent.
#PHILIP.
What sort do you mean?
#SIR PETER.
A fool's.
#PHILIP.
You are plain spoken, Sir Peter. Now tell me with equal candour what is the matter with me. Perhaps that is the serpent.
#SIR PETER.
Shall I tell you the truth?
#PHILIP.
Of course.
#SIR PETER.
I don't know.
#PHILIP.
Surely, with your experience -
#SIR PETER.
Sir, I have no experience.
#PHILIP.
Well, with your knowledge -
#SIR PETER.
Sir, I have no knowledge. Knowledge is the monopoly of extremely young practitioners. I have been doctoring for forty years; and now, I stand here on your hearthrug, sir, a monument of triumphant ignorance.
#PHILIP.
Nonsense, Sir Peter.
#SIR PETER.
Sense, sir, sense.
#PHILIP.
Be candid and tell me frankly what is wrong with me.
#SIR PETER.
Your liver, probably.
#PHILIP.
Only my liver?
#SIR PETER.
Don't speak disparagingly of your liver, sir. That eminently respectable organ has been much misunderstood. It is commonly supposed to serve certain functional purposes in the physical economy. Another fallacy! The liver was made, by a beautiful provision of nature, for the benefit of the medical profession.
#MILDRED.
Phil, here's Lord Normantower.
#PHILIP.
Ned!
#TOM.
He's so brown, and he's grown such a beard!
#NORMANTOWER.
Well, Phil, old man, how are you?
#PHILIP.
My dear Ned! I can't tell you how glad I am to see you. Sir Peter Lund - Lord Normantower. How kind of you to come and stop with us! How pleasant it will be to chat over old times! But first of all, let me congratulate you on your new dignity.
#NORMANTOWER.
Dignity? My dear Phil, I have no dignity. I am a born Bohemian, and the idea of me dropping in for a peerage strikes me as so ludicrous, I've done nothing but laugh ever since I became a hereditary legislator.
#TOM.
Ha, ha, ha!
#NORMANTOWER.
What's the matter with you?
#TOM.
Fancy Ned a legislator!
#NORMANTOWER.
Even Tom sees the joke.
#PHILIP.
Lord Normantower and I were at Oxford together. We became great friends; and though circumstances have kept us a good deal apart - we've never quite lost sight of one another.
#NORMANTOWER.
I haven't the pleasure of knowing Sir Peter myself, but I believe other members of my family have had that privilege.
#SIR PETER.
Sir, I had the honour of attending the last three Earls of Normantower. Your uncle - gout; your cousin Richard - lungs; your cousin John - delirium - humph - delirium!
#NORMANTOWER.
That branch of the family disposed of, the peerage devolved on me as the eldest son of my poor father - the only Verinder who never enjoyed the title, and the only one who deserved it.
#SIR PETER.
I quite agree with you.
#PHILIP.
Let us hope his son will be worthy of him.
#NORMANTOWER.
Ah, well, I'll do my best; but ten thousand a year, paid quarterly in advance, would have suited Ned Verinder's book better than an empty honour without a shilling to support it.
#PHILIP.
Well, there's one consolation. If it's a difficult matter for a peer to make money, it's very easy for him to marry it.
#NORMANTOWER.
Marry? Not me! No! I was born a bachelor, and am not going to fly in the face of Providence.
#PHILIP.
You don't believe in marriage?
#NORMANTOWER.
Of course there are exceptions; and I hope from the bottom of my heart, yours is one of them. I haven't seen your wife yet, you know.
#PHILIP.
I've married a most charming woman, Ned - haven't I, Sir Peter?
#SIR PETER.
Sir - your wife is my hostess, and one's hostess is always charming. charming woman? You arouse painful memories. I once knew a charming woman. To be quite frank, I was engaged to one.
#PHILIP.
You have been engaged to be married! I never heard of it.
#NORMANTOWER.
No, I kept it quiet. So did she. At the time, there was not the remotest likelihood of my ever succeeding to the title, and of course I was hard up. I always was. A gilded calf appeared upon the scene; and the charming woman wrote me a charming letter, protesting eternal fidelity, and announcing her approaching marriage.
#PHILIP.
To the calf?
#NORMANTOWER.
To the gilt.
#PHILIP.
You had a lucky escape.
#NORMANTOWER.
Luckier than I thought: for I discovered afterwards that the charming creature was a regular adventuress - a garrison hack - a boarding - house belle - the sole support of an aged father - a venerable old gentleman, with the manners of a patriarch and the morals of a welsher! She was a charming woman, for all that.
#PHILIP.
I congratulate you on your escape. But who was the unfortunate calf?
#NORMANTOWER.
I never took the trouble to inquire.
#BEATRICE.
And the charming creature? Pray, who was she?
#NORMANTOWER.
Miss Challoner!
#PHILIP.
My wife. You know one another.
#BEATRICE.
I believe, now that I see Lord Normantower, I once had the pleasure of meeting him. Let me see - where was it?
#NORMANTOWER.
It sounds ungallant to say so, but I really forget for the moment.
#BEATRICE.
Well, never mind that now. Tell us who was the lady who used you so shamefully. I am dying to know.
#NORMANTOWER.
You must excuse me. Though I am ungallant enough to forget where I met Mrs. Selwyn, I am not so unchivalrous as to betray a lady's secret.
#BEATRICE.
Phil, dear, your friend is quite a hero of romance. If you have any more such friends, please lose no time in introducing them.
#PHILIP.
My love, don't make me jealous.
#BEATRICE.
Thank you, Lord Normantower.
#NORMANTOWER.
For what, Mrs. Selwyn?
#BEATRICE.
For your loyalty - to my sex.
#PHILIP.
You've had a narrow escape, evidently; but don't make the mistake of letting the unworthiness of one woman blind you to the merits of the rest. Believe me, there is no happiness like that of married love.
#NORMANTOWER.
Love! there is no such thing. We think we are in love, but we aren't. What is called love is an affliction of the brain, not an affection of the heart. Luckily, we soon get over it.
#BEATRICE.
Men may - but women, never. Do they, Sir Peter?
#SIR PETER.
I never offer an opinion on matters I don't understand - unless, mark, they are strictly medical. Love has no place in the British pharmacopæa.
#PHILIP.
Yet it exists. I have even known cases of love at sight.
#NORMANTOWER.
Love at sight! Now you're going too far for anything. I can imagine an enthusiast believing even in love, but love at sight! No, my dear Phil, that's too ridicu -
#KATE.
Stay where you are! I'll get it for you, children! Has anybody seen - Oh! there it is!
#NORMANTOWER.
Allow me -
#KATE.
Thank you, very much. Here you are! Catch!
#NORMANTOWER.
Who is that lady?
#PHILIP.
That's Miss Derwent.
#NORMANTOWER.
And who is Miss Derwent?
#BEATRICE.
Only a companion.
#PHILIP.
You'll be delighted with her, when you know her, as of course you will, if you stay with us for a week or two.
#NORMANTOWER.
I'll stop for a month.
#SIR PETER.
Well, my ten minutes are up. Before I go I'd like to see you alone.
#PHILIP.
Come to my room. We shan't be very long. Meanwhile, I leave you in good company.
#BEATRICE.
Good - bye, Sir Peter - if I don't see you again.
#SIR PETER.
You will see me again. I'll stay to lunch after all.
#PHILIP.
That's right, doctor. Give yourself a holiday for once.
#BEATRICE.
But your patients? What will they do without you?
#SIR PETER.
What will they do? Recover.
#NORMANTOWER.
Are they gone?
#BEATRICE.
Yes. Oh, Ned, can you ever forgive me?
#NORMANTOWER.
Forgive you? I forgave you long ago. Indeed I am grateful to you for teaching me a lesson which I shall never forget.
#BEATRICE.
You are cruel; but I suppose I deserve it.
#NORMANTOWER.
My grievance is a thing of the past. I have no wish to injure you or to cause you pain, and I should not have expressed myself so freely just now, had I known that you were present or that I was speaking of the wife of a friend.
#BEATRICE.
You have been misinformed. There is not a word of truth in what you have heard about me.
#NORMANTOWER.
No doubt. People exaggerate so.
#BEATRICE.
They invent so.
#NORMANTOWER.
They invent so.
#BEATRICE.
And you have believed them! What must you think of me?
#NORMANTOWER.
To be perfectly frank, Mrs. Selwyn, I endeavour not to think of you at all.
#BEATRICE.
You have forgotten me? You have stripped me from your mind?
#NORMANTOWER.
I have done my best to forget you.
#BEATRICE.
And this is constancy!
#NORMANTOWER.
Constancy! I am not more punctilious than most men, but surely it is scarcely my duty to be constant to a woman who has become the wife of another.
#BEATRICE.
Ah! it is easy to talk of one's duty but it is not always so easy to do it. Ned - may I call you so? Let me tell you the secret of my life.
#NORMANTOWER.
You have a secret?
#BEATRICE.
Yes - I was always constant. I was forced into this marriage. The letter I wrote breaking off our engagement was dictated to me. I never loved my husband.
#NORMANTOWER.
Mrs. Selwyn, you forget, your husband is my friend. If you didn't know it when he asked me here, you know it now.
#BEATRICE.
I always knew it. It was I who suggested the invitation. I could bear my unhappiness no longer. I felt I must see you again. Oh, if you could only look into my heart! Ned! Though I used you badly, you are bitterly avenged!
#NORMANTOWER.
I have no wish to be avenged. I loved you - I lost you - and there is an end of it.
#BEATRICE.
Why was I born a woman? Why was I not a man? To amuse myself just for the moment, and then to be able to forget!
#NORMANTOWER.
You do us an injustice. We men are not so inconstant as you think. Sometimes we pretend to forget what we are half ashamed to remember. But the past is past. You are a wife now.
#BEATRICE.
If I were not a wife?
#NORMANTOWER.
Then, it would be different.
#BEATRICE.
Hush! I have said, I do not love my husband; and if you say that, you will make me hate him. To think that he - and he alone - stands between me and happiness.
#NORMANTOWER.
Beatrice!
#BEATRICE.
Don't shrink from me! Is it so wicked to want to be happy?
#NORMANTOWER.
Happy?
#BEATRICE.
If I were only free!
#NORMANTOWER.
You forget, though I have dropped in for a title, I am almost as poor as ever.
#BEATRICE.
But I am not. Philip has left me everything if I survive him.
#BEATRICE.
Well, doctor, how do you find your patient?
#SIR PETER.
Your husband is more seriously ill than I anticipated.
#NORMANTOWER.
Ill!
#BEATRICE.
What is the matter with him?
#SIR PETER.
Something occult - that's why I call it serious. There is nothing so serious as the unknown.
#BEATRICE.
Something you can't make out? It must be occult indeed.
#SIR PETER.
But something I hope to make out before I go.
#BEATRICE.
Then you propose to stay here?
#SIR PETER.
With your permission - for to - night, at any rate.
#BEATRICE.
I'll have a room prepared for you at once.
#SIR PETER.
Don't trouble. The orders are already given. I've taken the liberty of choosing my own quarters. They open on the terrace, so I can take the air in the morning without disturbing the household.
#KATE.
That'll do, children, I'm quite out of breath.
#BEATRICE.
I am afraid the children give you no rest, Miss Derwent.
#LUND.
of table)
#KATE.
Oh, I don't mind. I like it. I was a dreadful tomboy myself, when I was their age. I haven't forgotten how to play leap - frog yet.
#BEATRICE.
Your memory is really wonderful.
#KATE.
And I believe I could give as good a back -
#BEATRICE.
Lord Normantower - Miss Derwent.
#KATE.
How d'ye do?
#BEATRICE.
You have not been here lately - Philip has made such improvements! You'll scarcely know the old place again. May I have the pleasure of showing it you?
#NORMANTOWER.
I shall be delighted. Perhaps Miss Derwent will come with us.
#SIR PETER.
Miss Derwent will stop here. I want to speak to her.
#KATE.
You, doctor?
#NORMANTOWER.
Good - bye then, for the present.
#KATE.
Au revoir!

to R.)
#SIR PETER.
Sit down.
#KATE.
Don't order me about in that way, doctor. We're not in the hospital now.
#SIR PETER.
Sit down. First let me deliver my messages. The entire medical staff at Guy's send you their kindest regards.
#KATE.
That's very nice of them. On your return, doctor, will you be so good as to give my kindest regards to the entire medical staff at Guy's?
#SIR PETER.
The house - surgeon, Mr. Kennedy, I regret to say, sends you his love.
#KATE.
Will you also give my love to Mr. Kennedy?
#SIR PETER.
The students send you a kiss apiece.
#KATE.
Will you please kiss the students all round.
#SIR PETER.
Are you sorry you changed your position?
#KATE.
No, Sir Peter. I have been very happy here. Mr. Selwyn has always treated me with such consideration that, I am afraid, sometimes I forget that I am not one of the family; Mrs. Selwyn has never been unkind to me, and Mildred I have learnt to love almost as a sister.
#SIR PETER.
Good. My object in introducing you here being accomplished, I feel myself at liberty to explain it. The medical profession has its romantic episodes. I am going to tell you one.
#KATE.
Go on. I love romances.
#SIR PETER.
Three years ago, a patient of mine died - nothing remarkable in that - it's a habit my patients have - leaving a grown - up son and a young daughter to inherit his very considerable fortune. He died beloved by his children and respected by all who knew him, but on his deathbed he confided to me a secret. He was a thief and a bigamist. When very young he had married a rich lady. This marriage he had concealed, and under a false name had married again. For some years he had lived a double life and had two families. By his first and lawful wife he had one child - a daughter; and having contrived to possess himself of the whole of this lady's fortune, ultimately he deserted her. The fortune of the first wife he left to his children by the second, who are to this day quite unconscious of their father's crime.
#KATE.
Sir Peter!
#SIR PETER.
In his later years, he had searched privately for his first wife and child, but he could find no trace of them. That search he bequeathed to me, and a pretty legacy it's been! For a long time my inquiries were unavailing, but at last I discovered that the mother was dead.
#KATE.
And the daughter?
#SIR PETER.
Was one of my own nurses at Guy's Hospital.
#KATE.
At Guy's!
#SIR PETER.
I had known her by sight for months, but had not happened to hear her name - Kate Derwent.
#KATE.
I?
#SIR PETER.
Sit down. What was I to do? All this man's children were my personal friends. The two, who had legally inherited your mother's fortune, morally were not entitled to a shilling. You, who legally are penniless, morally are entitled to it all. If ever there was a case for an amicable arrangement, this was one; and I thought it would facilitate a settlement, if you were all made acquainted with one another. With that object I introduced you into this house.
#KATE.
Surely you cannot mean -
#SIR PETER.
I can - I do.
#KATE.
That Mr. Selwyn -
#SIR PETER.
Is your brother.
#KATE.
Mildred -
#SIR PETER.
Your sister.
#KATE.
And their father -
#SIR PETER.
Yours. Now comes the question; what is to be done?
#KATE.
Nothing.
#SIR PETER.
How nothing?
#KATE.
You say they don't know anything. Not that their father was - scoundrel? No.
#KATE.
Not that their mother -
#SIR PETER.
Was his victim? No.
#KATE.
Not who I am?
#SIR PETER.
Not who you are.
#KATE.
Then, let them never know it.
#SIR PETER.
Nonsense. I must see you properly provided for.
#KATE.
I am provided for. I have earned my living for years, and I can earn it to the end. I am not used to wealth, and should not know what to do with it. They are, and could not be happy without it. Let them remain in ignorance of the truth.
#SIR PETER.
Miss Derwent, you are a most extraordinary person. I tell you, you are entitled to a fortune, and you don't ask how much it is. A woman - and no curiosity.
#KATE.
I don't care how much it is or how little. I don't want to know.
#SIR PETER.
This is a matter of no less than two hundred thousand pounds. Well?
#KATE.
I said nothing.
#SIR PETER.
Then will you please say something?
#KATE.
I have nothing to say. woman - and nothing to say. You regard two hundred thousand pounds with contempt. Think, how many new frocks it would buy.
#KATE.
I do not regard money with contempt; for money can sometimes buy happiness. But we are all perfectly happy as we are. Why do you want to disturb us?
#SIR PETER.
You think only of the present; but consider the future. Some day, you may have a daughter of your own -
#KATE.
No, I shall never marry.
#SIR PETER.
Never what?
#KATE.
I am in earnest. woman - and not want to be married! Hang me, if I believe you're a woman at all!
#KATE.
Why? Because I want to be generous?
#SIR PETER.
Miss Derwent, there is a higher virtue than generosity, and that is justice. It is easy enough to be generous, but it hard indeed to be just - especially to oneself. This is a question of pounds, shillings, and pence.
#KATE.
Pardon me, Sir Peter - this is a question of breaking the hearts of those who were kind to me when I needed kindness, who befriended me when I was alone in the world, whom I have already learned to love almost as what they are - my brother and sister. Their father - my father - is dead, but his memory is dear to them. I know they loved him - and I know they honoured him. How can I imperil that love, and how can I stultify that honour? How can I cloud the sunshine of my sister's life with the shadow of her father's sin? No, Sir Peter! If that is justice, justice is beyond me. I am only equal to generosity. I am a woman, only a woman - and I can't do it. Not for a hundred fortunes! Not for all the world.
#SIR PETER.
Yes, you are a woman after all - and as self - willed and silly as the rest. To throw away two hundred thousand pounds! Why, I've decimated my fellow creatures for half that. It's wicked - positively wicked. You deserve to die in a ditch.
#KATE.
I will die where heaven wills it, but I shall at least have the consciousness that I have done something to repair my father's wrong.
#SIR PETER.
Rubbish - romantic rubbish.
#KATE.
Promise me that you will keep this secret - that you will say nothing to my brother - promise me, Sir Peter.
#SIR PETER.
I shall promise nothing. I shall use my own discretion, as I always do.
#KATE.
Sir Peter!
#SIR PETER.
You are a foolish, obstinate, absurd - good, generous, true - hearted girl, and I am your friend always! Look here! I'm old enough to be your father - Damn that man!
#CINDERELLA.
from R.)
#TOM.
Lunch, at last! Aren't I ready for it?
#MILDRED.
Tom! Wait for me.
#BEATRICE.
You must be hungry after your journey.
#NORMANTOWER.
Yes, thank heaven, my appetite is as redoubtable as ever. Miss Derwent may -
#BEATRICE.
Sir Peter, will you bring Miss Derwent?
#PHILIP.
Stop, doctor, stop. Don't monopolise all the good things. Suppose we go shares.
#KATE.
Don't be scandalised. Mr. Selwyn often gives me his arm. Here - I am more like a friend than a dependant.
#PHILIP.
More like a sister than a friend.
#SWELL MUSIC.
Quick Act Drop.
#BEATRICE.
Good morning, Miss Derwent.
#KATE.
Good morning, Mrs. Selwyn.
#BEATRICE.
At work, as usual. How industrious you are!
#KATE.
Yes - I've been saying good - bye to all my favourites. How is Mr. Selwyn this morning?
#BEATRICE.
He is not so well.
#KATE.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he will be well enough to shake hands with me before I go.
#BEATRICE.
Then you are determined to leave us?
#KATE.
I can't tell you how sorry I am, but I mustn't stop here for ever. Mildred learnt all that I can teach her long ago; and if I stay much longer, I shall be the pupil. Since Mr. Verinder's arrival I have had several lessons in the English language as it is spoken at Eton, and I flatter myself I shall soon be able to "cackle" as well as if I wore a remarkably short jacket and remarkably tight inexpressibles.
#BEATRICE.
You under - rate your accomplishments. I don't think there is much that Mildred could teach you.
#KATE.
Don't make me blush, my dear.
#BEATRICE.
You make me blush sometimes.
#KATE.
Then you ought to be extremely obliged to me, for nothing becomes you better. Mrs. Selwyn, we are now quite old friends. I cannot leave Ravenhurst without some little memento of our companionship - There are no horrid men about to hear us - Before I go, tell me oh, tell me -
#BEATRICE.
Well?
#KATE.
The secret of your complexion.
#BEATRICE.
It's a very simple one - Arsenic.
#KATE.
Arsenic! But that's a poison.
#BEATRICE.
Yes, if you take too much of it; but if you take a little, it -
#KATE.
It what!
#BEATRICE.
Improves the complexion.
#KATE.
Does it? Where do you get it?
#BEATRICE.
From the chemist's, of course.
#KATE.
But will they sell it you?
#BEATRICE.
Yes, if you're candid and confide in them. My love, if you want to look better than Nature intended you -
#KATE.
As, of course, I do -
#BEATRICE.
Confide in your chemist. Make some ridiculous excuse - say that the family cat is in convulsions - and they will sell you nothing. They know it's absurd. Say that you want to improve your complexion, and they will sell you anything; they know it's the truth.
#KATE.
My dear Mrs. Selwyn - for this information much thanks.
#BEATRICE.
Where are you going?
#KATE.
To the chemist's.
#NORMANTOWER.
May I come in?
#KATE.
It seems to me you've come.
#NORMANTOWER.
Yes; when I want to do anything particularly, I do it first and ask permission afterwards. It prevents disappointment, and it's so very easy to apologise.
#BEATRICE.
In this case no apology is needed.
#NORMANTOWER.
Mrs. Selwyn! excuse me for not seeing you. How is Philip to - day?
#BEATRICE.
I'm sorry to say my husband is not at all well this morning.
#NORMANTOWER.
Old Lund seems to be making him worse instead of better.
#BEATRICE.
Sir Peter has now been here a week, and Philip has grown worse every day.
#NORMANTOWER.
I'm sure I oughtn't to find fault with Lund; he's polished off nearly all my relations for me; but I'm not certain that I quite believe in the old boy. There's too much M.D.F.S.A. about him. I never knew a fool who hadn't half the alphabet at the end of his name.
#KATE.
At which end my Lord Edward, Arthur, Henry, Earl of Normantower?
#NORMANTOWER.
Now, that's too bad of you, Miss Derwent. It's not my fault that I've enough names to christen the family of a curate.
#KATE.
Let this be a lesson to you. Don't throw stones at a friend of mine!
#NORMANTOWER.
Mine was a very little stone; yours was half a brick.
#PHILIP.
Beatrice!
#BEATRICE.
My husband! I must leave Miss Derwent to console you. She won't have many more opportunities.
#PHILIP.
Beatrice!
#BEATRICE.
Yes, dear! I'm coming!
#NORMANTOWER.
Not many more opportunities? What does she mean?
#KATE.
Mrs. Selwyn means that I am leaving Ravenhurst.
#NORMANTOWER.
You're going away!
#KATE.
This afternoon. }
#NORMANTOWER.
For good? }
#KATE.
For Mrs. Selwyn's good.
#NORMANTOWER.
You don't mean to say she's given you notice.
#KATE.
Mrs. Selwyn is too amiable to give anybody notice; but when she wants to get rid of them, in the most charming manner in the world, she makes them so exceedingly uncomfortable that they give notice themselves.
#NORMANTOWER.
But she can't possibly want to get rid of you?
#KATE.
Why not?
#NORMANTOWER.
We're all in love with you.
#KATE.
Are you? Perhaps that's the reason. Do you like plants?
#NORMANTOWER.
Blow plants!
#KATE.
What plants?
#NORMANTOWER.
Any plants - all plants - I hate 'em.
#KATE.
I love them. I have been watering my pets for the last time.
#NORMANTOWER.
I see. You've been standing them a parting drink.
#KATE.
My lord!
#NORMANTOWER.
By the way, isn't tobacco very good for plants?
#KATE.
Excellent. Why do you ask?
#NORMANTOWER.
I was just thinking, while you are watering the plants in the conservatory, it might be doing them a service if I were to smoke a cigarette in the conservatory.
#KATE.
Not for the world! Lord Normantower, let me tell you a shocking fact. The very odour of tobacco has such an effect upon me, that if you were to light a cigarette -
#NORMANTOWER.
It would make you uncomfortable?
#KATE.
No! I should want to join you.
#NORMANTOWER.
No!
#KATE.
There! you're shocked.
#NORMANTOWER.
Not a bit of it. I like you, Miss Derwent, because you say what you mean.
#KATE.
Sometimes I say a great deal more than I mean.
#NORMANTOWER.
And sometimes I mean a great deal more than I can say. Miss Derwent -
#KATE.
Lord Normantower?
#NORMANTOWER.
What a strange thing it is that you have grown this old - I mean, this young, without being married.
#KATE.
I shall never marry.
#NORMANTOWER.
That's exactly my case. I've had one disappointment, and I don't mean to have another. Once bit, twice shy, they say.
#KATE.
You have been bitten?
#NORMANTOWER.
Badly. But it's all for the best. It's made me distrustful of women and a confirmed bachelor. Why do people want to get married?
#KATE.
I've often wondered.
#NORMANTOWER.
Miss Derwent, I've been so awfully glad I'm a confirmed bachelor, ever since I met you.
#KATE.
What difference can that make?
#NORMANTOWER.
Well, you see, if I wasn't a confirmed bachelor, I might have been married.
#KATE.
Well?
#NORMANTOWER.
And if I was married, I couldn't marry again.
#KATE.
Of course not.
#NORMANTOWER.
And if I couldn't marry again, I couldn't marry -
#KATE.
Go on. Finish your sentence.
#NORMANTOWER.
You!
#SIR PETER.
Ah! I saw you!
#KATE.
Sir Peter, I believe you have eyes in the small of your back.
#SIR PETER.
Yes - and ears too. I heard you.
#NORMANTOWER.
Then, why did you interrupt us?
#SIR PETER.
I thought it was time. You forget, that I am in the next room - that the rooms communicate through the terrace - and that you had not taken the precaution of shutting the outer door of the conservatory.
#BEATRICE.
Ah, doctor! Philip was asking for you. He has just got up. What time's your train, Miss Derwent?
#KATE.
Half - past two. I must be getting ready.
#SIR PETER.
Then, it's decided, you are going?
#KATE.
Quite. But I shall see you again.
#BEATRICE.
The brougham is quite at your service.
#SIR PETER.
So Miss Derwent is leaving you?
#BEATRICE.
She wished to go. She has always been allowed to do as she pleased here, and she has availed herself of the privilege.
#SIR PETER.
I see.
#BEATRICE.
Ah, here is Philip!
#PHILIP.
Good morning, doctor. Morning, Normantower.
#NORMANTOWER.
Sorry to hear you're not so well this morning.
#PHILIP.
I ought to get better, if the best of doctors and the most devoted of nurses are of any use; but somehow I don't.
#SIR PETER.
You get worse.
#PHILIP.
I shouldn't mind so much, if I didn't find my temper giving way - just now, I spoke quite crossly to poor little Mousey here - and she was only carrying out your instructions.
#BEATRICE.
The fact is, doctor, he's a very naughty boy, and won't take his medicine, though I always give it him with my own hands. He hasn't taken any to - day.
#SIR PETER.
Oh, you won't take your medicine?
#PHILIP.
It's such horrid stuff; and somehow, I always feel worse after taking it.
#SIR PETER.
So much the better. Shows it's doing you good.
#NORMANTOWER.
That's all my eye, doctor.
#SIR PETER.
No, sir, it's all his liver. Oblige me by not interrupting.
#BEATRICE.
Come, Lord Normantower. Sir Peter would like to be alone with Philip.
#NORMANTOWER.
And I'd like to be alone with Miss Derwent.
#PHILIP.
Now I am at your service.
#SIR PETER.
Have you made your will?
#PHILIP.
Well, you're a lively doctor!
#SIR PETER.
Have you made your will?
#PHILIP.
Am I so ill as that?
#SIR PETER.
Yes, sir - you are.
#PHILIP.
But if it's only my liver.
#SIR PETER.
It is not your liver.
#PHILIP.
Is it my heart? Is anything wrong there?
#SIR PETER.
Nothing of any consequence. It's rather too large, and rather too soft - that's all that's wrong with your heart.
#PHILIP.
What is it then?
#SIR PETER.
I can account for your condition, only on one hypothesis, and that one is out of the question.
#PHILIP.
Mayn't I know what it is?
#SIR PETER.
Since it's out of the question, it's no use discussing it. You haven't answered me. Have you made your will?
#PHILIP.
Yes - long ago. It was a very simple matter. Mildred is provided for; so I have left everything to my wife, absolutely.
#PHILIP.
Do you want anything?
#SIR PETER.
Yes. The name and address of your solicitor.
#PHILIP.
Old Merivale, of High Street! why?
#SIR PETER.
Mr. Selwyn's compliments to Mr. Merivale, Solicitor, High Street, and will he kindly come here at once?
#PHILIP.
What for?
#SIR PETER.
To draw your will.
#PHILIP.
But I tell you, I've made it.
#SIR PETER.
You must make another.
#PHILIP.
Sir Peter, you are incomprehensible!
#SIR PETER.
Let me make myself clear. Your father, Philip Selwyn, was married to your mother, Mildred Kent, in July, 1865. I need not show you the certificate.
#PHILIP.
Of course not.
#SIR PETER.
Two years before, in March, 1863, one Philip Derwent was married to one Kate Graham.
#PHILIP.
Derwent? Kate? Miss Derwent's father, I presume?
#SIR PETER.
Yes. There is the certificate.
#PHILIP.
I don't want to see it.
#SIR PETER.
But I want you to see it.
#PHILIP.
How does it concern me?
#SIR PETER.
It concerns her, doesn't it?
#PHILIP.
Of course.
#SIR PETER.
And she being your half - sister, it concerns you.
#PHILIP.
Miss Derwent, my half - sister! What do you mean?
#SIR PETER.
That Philip Selwyn and Philip Derwent were one and the same person.
#PHILIP.
Sir Peter!
#SIR PETER.
Of that I have no proof, except your father's word.
#PHILIP.
My father's word?
#SIR PETER.
Given to me on his death - bed. Do you doubt his word? Do you doubt mine?
#PHILIP.
No - but I cannot grasp it! Am I awake, or am I dreaming? I have such strange dreams.
#SIR PETER.
You are awake - and for the first time in your life. Till to - day, you have been living in a dream.
#PHILIP.
My father was a widower, when he married my mother? Why did he not say so? Why did he change his name?
#SIR PETER.
Because he was not a widower.
#PHILIP.
Not a widower!
#SIR PETER.
Because his first wife was alive -
#PHILIP.
Alive!
#SIR PETER.
There is the certificate of her death - twenty years later.
#PHILIP.
Incredible!
#SIR PETER.
I haven't half done yet.
#PHILIP.
Go on - go on.
#SIR PETER.
You inherited from your father everything you possess?
#PHILIP.
Everything!
#SIR PETER.
He bequeathed to you, and your sister Mildred, all his fortune?
#PHILIP.
All.
#SIR PETER.
Where did he get that fortune?
#PHILIP.
Well?
#SIR PETER.
From his first wife.
#PHILIP.
It's false! it must be false!
#SIR PETER.
I have his word for it, and it can be proved. He left her penniless; and left his child to struggle with the world as best they could - and nobly they did it. Yes, sir, it is too true. The father you have loved and honoured was -
#PHILIP.
My father!
#SIR PETER.
Was your father - just so. Takes it very well.
#PHILIP.
I want to ask you one question. Dare I?
#SIR PETER.
You mean, your mother.
#PHILIP.
Yes.
#SIR PETER.
She knew nothing of this.
#PHILIP.
Thank heaven for that - thank heaven!
#BEATRICE.
Philip dear, Miss Derwent has come to say good - bye to you. She is going.
#PHILIP.
She is not going.
#KATE.
The brougham is at the door, Mr. Selwyn, and I have left myself barely time to catch the train; but I could not go without shaking hands with you, and thanking you for all your kindness. I came here a stranger, and I have found almost a brother.
#PHILIP.
Yes, you have found a brother; and I have found a sister.
#KATE.
Mr. Selwyn!
#PHILIP.
Whom I have wronged without knowing it - of whose very existence I was unaware till this moment; but whom I know at last, and to whom I will make restitution.
#BEATRICE.
Philip?
#KATE.
You have broken your promise!
#SIR PETER.
I made no promise.
#PHILIP.
Yes, Beatrice, this is my sister -
#KATE.
But you need not acknowledge me. I ask for nothing but to go away. Let the past be forgotten. Of what use is it to revive a sorrow that is dead, and to publish a sin that is unknown? It cannot be right to make three beings unhappy, to do justice to one, when all that one asks is to go away.
#PHILIP.
You know, then?
#KATE.
Everything!
#PHILIP.
And you have said nothing!
#KATE.
Because you have taught me to love you! I want you to be happy - I want to be happy myself - and if I wreck your happiness, I shall destroy my own. All I ask is to go - let me go! let me go!
#PHILIP.
It is for me to go. This place belongs to you.
#BEATRICE.
To her?
#PHILIP.
Yes, all I have is hers. Beatrice, my father was not married to my mother legally - he was married before - Kate is his lawful child - the money he left me was her mother's - and to her it must be restored, to the last shilling.
#SIR PETER.
Nonsense! this is quixotic!
#PHILIP.
I know what my duty is, and it shall be done. Am I not right?
#BEATRICE.
Yes, Philip.
#PHILIP.
You have battled with the world long enough. Now it is my turn. Till to - day I have been living in a fool's paradise, but now I have awaken from my dream. I am not afraid, because I am not alone. Many things have been taken from me. My fortune, my good name, my father's memory - all these are gone! but you are left to me. I have a wife to work for, whose love will sustain me; who will share my trials as she has shared my prosperity. Don't fear for me. I will fight and I will conquer. Ah, if I were only stronger!
#SIR PETER.
You have said enough. Remember, your brother is an invalid.
#PHILIP.
But I won't be an invalid - I'll make my will to - day.
#BEATRICE.
Another will?
#PHILIP.
Leaving Kate everything.
#KATE.
Philip! I must speak, for our sister's sake. If you have no thought for yourself, have some for her.
#PHILIP.
Mildred is provided for already. I cannot deal with her money; but I can with my own.
#KATE.
It is not a question of money. Remember, if this secret is made known -
#PHILIP.
Ah!
#KATE.
What will be said of her?
#PHILIP.
That never crossed my thoughts.
#KATE.
Think of it now. It is not too late.
#PHILIP.
Oh! What am I to do?
#KATE.
Do what is best for everyone. Accept a favour from a sister who asks you - on her knees! Keep our secret! Remain here - the master of Ravenhurst. Philip! For Mildred's sake.
#PHILIP.
Kate! may God bless you!
#KATE.
Brother!
#SIR PETER.
There, that's settled. Now, let my patient have a little rest.
#PHILIP.
You won't go far? You won't leave Ravenhurst?
#SIR PETER.
No.
#KATE.
No.
#PHILIP.
You will stay here - under this roof?
#SIR PETER.
Yes.
#KATE.
If I am welcome - for the present - yes.
#PHILIP.
And for the future?
#BEATRICE.
Yes. Your sister will be always welcome here.
#SIR PETER.
Damn'd good actress, that woman!
#PHILIP.
How can I thank you, Beatrice? How can I tell you bow proud I am of you, and how I love you? Oh, my darling wife, how can I soften this blow which has fallen upon you?
#BEATRICE.
Philip, don't think of me.
#PHILIP.
But I must think of you, who never think of yourself. If I were to die?
#BEATRICE.
Dearest, don't talk of death.
#PHILIP.
I am more ill than I seem - more ill than anybody knows. I can't help thinking of death, for every day it seems to draw nearer and nearer. I can feel it coming - slowly, mysteriously, weirdly - gathering about me - wrapping me round and round.
#BEATRICE.
Hush, Philip, hush! You are tired. Shall I leave you for a while?
#PHILIP.
No, no! Don't go away. You are all I have left, mousey. I am not tired; but oh, I feel so drowsy! I seem to get worse every day.
#BEATRICE.
And why, my dear? Because you won't take your medicine. Come. Let me bring it you now.
#PHILIP.
That beastly medicine! Perhaps I'd better take it; but I shall have no head to talk to old Merivale, when he comes.
#BEATRICE.
You've sent for him?
#PHILIP.
I expect him every minute.
#BEATRICE.
Then, there's no time to be lost. I'll bring it you at once.
#PHILIP.
I'm doing right, aren't I, mousey?
#BEATRICE.
In what way?
#PHILIP.
In making this new will.
#BEATRICE.
You always do right, Philip.
#PHILIP.
I have your acquiescence?
#BEATRICE.
Certainly.
#PHILIP.
Then, I will lose no time. It shall be made to - day.
#PHILIP.
Who is it?
#TOM.
Only me, Mr. Selwyn.
#MILDRED.
Only I, Tom.
#TOM.
Oh, bother grammar!
#PHILIP.
Well, children? How are you to - day?
#TOM.
Oh, we're all right; but, I say, Mr. Selwyn, I wish everybody wouldn't call us "children." I don't like it.
#MILDRED.
And it's not true.
#TOM.
I'm turned sixteen.
#MILDRED.
And I'm fifteen next birthday!
#PHILIP.
Well, then, my man and woman, what do you want?
#TOM.
You tell him, Mildred! }
#MILDRED.
No - you tell him, Tom! }
#TOM.
Are you quite well enough to stand a shock?
#PHILIP.
What, are you studying electricity? Or is it some toy?
#TOM.
Electricity! toy!
#TOM.
Mr. Selwyn, you make it jolly hard for a fellow to say what he wants to say - just when he wants a leg up.
#MILDRED.
Tom! "A leg up?"
#TOM.
Oh, bother style! Let me say what I mean.
#PHILIP.
And what do you mean, my lad?
#TOM.
If you please - we want to get married.
#PHILIP.
Want to get married?
#MILDRED.
That's the shock!
#TOM.
Now for it. Don't run away - I won't!
#PHILIP.
You are both too young to think about such things!
#TOM.
I'm sure we're not too young -
#MILDRED.
To think about such things.
#PHILIP.
Well, to talk about them.
#MILDRED.
Philip!
#TOM.
Mildred, this is no place for you. Leave me alone with Mr. Selwyn.
#MILDRED.
Tom! You won't come to blows?
#TOM.
I will control myself. I will not forget the respect that is due to the brother of my affianced wife.
#MILDRED.
That's right, Tom.
#TOM.
Wait for me - on the mat. Now, Mr. Selwyn, we are alone. We can discuss this matter as men of the world.
#PHILIP.
My dear Tom - Mr. Verinder - Such a thing as marriage at your early age is, of course, preposterous; but I wish you distinctly to understand that the remotest idea of an engagement between you and Mildred is equally out of the question.
#TOM.
May I ask why, sir?
#PHILIP.
You belong to a very proud family; and there are reasons which you would scarcely understand -
#TOM.
Mr. Selwyn!
#PHILIP.
Which, at any rate, I can't enter into - that make it impossible you should ever marry my sister.
#TOM.
That is your ultimatum?
#PHILIP.
Yes.
#TOM.
Good day, sir.
#PHILIP.
Poor Tom! He's only a boy, but he's a gentleman!
#BEATRICE.
Here it is, Philip.
#PHILIP.
Oh dear me, how tired I am of the horrid stuff! Surely you have given me too much?
#BEATRICE.
No - just the right measure. See!
#PHILIP.
How many doses are there left?
#BEATRICE.
Only three more. Now, drink it up without thinking about it; and if, like a good boy, you don't leave a drop, you shall have a kiss afterwards, to take the taste away.
#PHILIP.
Well, I suppose I must.
#JOHN GALE.
Oh, if you please'm!
#BEATRICE.
What's the matter, Johnson?
#JOHN GALE.
Miss Mildred -
#PHILIP.
What of Miss Mildred?
#JOHN GALE.
She is in hysterics.
#PHILIP.
Mildred ill!
#BEATRICE.
Never mind Mildred! Philip dear! Only another second and -
#PHILIP.
Beatrice!
#TOM.
Oh, Mrs. Selwyn, please do come to Mildred! She's in a fit, or something.
#BEATRICE.
Nonsense!
#TOM.
Do come, please! The shock has been too much for her.
#PHILIP.
Beatrice! Quick!
#BEATRICE.
In a moment!
#TOM.
Come along!
#PHILIP.
Beatrice! do come!
#SIR PETER.
Nobody here. Perhaps he's lying down. Nobody there. They've gone downstairs. He must be better, then. Peter, my boy, if anyone had told you, you could study a case as you have studied this, for a week, and not be able to make head or tail of it, you would have kicked - pulled his nose for him. What is the matter with this man? Of course it might be - but that's out of the question. Ah, there's his medicine. What did he say? He always felt worse after taking it. I don't know why he should. Only a tonic, with a nasty flavour. People like nasty medicine. Think it does 'em good. Well - it is nasty. Nothing's out of the question! I ought to have known it. That's all right.
#PHILIP.
She's better now; but I was rather alarmed.
#BEATRICE.
Poor child!
#PHILIP.
She'll soon get over it. Only a girlish fancy. Where did I put that medicine?
#BEATRICE.
Here it is, dear.
#PHILIP.
You can't think how I hate it.
#BEATRICE.
Don't be so absurd. I declare, you're as great a baby as she is.
#PHILIP.
One - two - three! Ugh! Give me some water.
#BEATRICE.
Why, the tumbler is gone! Who can have taken it?
#PHILIP.
Johnson, I daresay. All right; I'm better now. That's one dose less to take. Three more, I think you said.
#BEATRICE.
But there are only two! Someone's been here!
#SIR PETER.
Yes, I have.
#BEATRICE.
You!
#SIR PETER.
Your husband complained of his medicine. I thought I'd test it; so I took a dose.
#BEATRICE.
You took it?
#SIR PETER.
Yes. doctor take a dose of his own medicine!
#SIR PETER.
Only to my room. Allow me to return you the glass.
#PHILIP.
And you have tested it?
#SIR PETER.
Yes.
#BEATRICE.
With what result?
#SIR PETER.
With none. As I expected, just what I prescribed.
#PHILIP.
And what did you prescribe, Sir Peter? What is this stuff you're giving me? very common medicine.
#PHILIP.
But what is it?
#SIR PETER.
Arsenic. Quick Act Drop.
#NORMANTOWER.
Thanks, awfully!
#KATE.
That's Mr. Selwyn's favourite - the music's pretty, but such stupid words.
#NORMANTOWER.
Yes, but you sing them with such an expression.
#KATE.
Such an appropriate expression?
#NORMANTOWER.
Yes, that's what I meant. Such an appropriate expression!
#KATE.
Of stupidity?
#NORMANTOWER.
No, no! That isn't what I meant. Oh dear, I never can say what I want to say, to you.
#KATE.
Shall I assist you?
#NORMANTOWER.
If you only would!
#KATE.
I mean to sugar.
#NORMANTOWER.
I meant to sugar.
#KATE.
Cream?
#NORMANTOWER.
Thanks awfully.
#NORMANTOWER.
I didn't mean sugar, but I must agree with her.
#KATE.
Is that as you like it?
#NORMANTOWER.
This is just as I like it. So, it's quite settled, you're going to stay here?
#KATE.
Yes, I find I can't tear myself away from Ravenhurst - I'm a fixture.
#NORMANTOWER.
I say! are you a landlord's or a tenant's fixture?
#KATE.
Oh, I'm attached to the freehold - very much attached to it.
#NORMANTOWER.
That's a pity. I thought perhaps you were removable.
#KATE.
What if I were?
#NORMANTOWER.
I should like to remove you, that's all.
#KATE.
I thought you were a confirmed bachelor?
#NORMANTOWER.
That's just it. That's what makes it so jolly, I being a confirmed bachelor, and you being a confirmed old maid -
#KATE.
Old maid?
#NORMANTOWER.
I mean, you will be an old maid - in time.
#KATE.
You didn't say so.
#NORMANTOWER.
But I meant, in time. So there's no danger. We can do what we like.
#KATE.
Of course, we can do what we like.
#NORMANTOWER.
We can talk together.
#KATE.
We can walk together.
#NORMANTOWER.
We can sing together!
#KATE.
Do you mean, in time?
#NORMANTOWER.
Miss Derwent, it was you who were out of time yesterday. That was a crotchet.
#KATE.
Nay, it was a quaver. crotchet. }
#NORMANTOWER.
Here is the music - see.
#KATE.
What did I tell you?
#NORMANTOWER.
You said a quaver.
#KATE.
No, I said a crotchet.
#NORMANTOWER.
Oh!
#KATE.
Certainly, a crotchet. This is how it goes.
#NORMANTOWER.
Thanks - oh thanks, awfully.
#BEATRICE.
Rather high for you, isn't it, my dear?
#NORMANTOWER.
Mrs. Selwyn!
#KATE.
I beg your pardon?
#BEATRICE.
Your voice is so charming, it is a pity to strain it.
#KATE.
I wasn't aware I had an audience. I was simply endeavouring to convince Lord Normantower that a crotchet is not a quaver. I was not attempting to sing.
#BEATRICE.
My love, you are too modest. I never heard you sing better.
#NORMANTOWER.
I think, I'd better turn the conversation. How is Philip, this evening?
#KATE.
Yes, how is Mr. Selwyn?
#BEATRICE.
I'm glad to say, much stronger.
#NORMANTOWER.
That's good news. I was afraid, as Sir Peter did not dine with us, your husband was worse.
#BEATRICE.
Sir Peter has been with him all the afternoon, and has announced his intention of remaining till he has solved the mystery of Philip's illness. It is really very kind of Sir Peter.
#KATE.
Sir Peter is kindness itself.
#BEATRICE.
You can imagine what a satisfaction it is to me, to know that my husband is in such excellent care.
#NORMANTOWER.
But has he formed no opinion as to what is the matter with Philip?
#BEATRICE.
He seems to think, it is nothing worse than an aggravated case of dyspepsia, and he attaches the greatest importance to diet. He has forbidden poor Philip almost everything. Sir Peter is a little crotchety, but he is paying the greatest attention to the case. And he's so clever! I am charmed with him.
#TOM.
Could you die, Mildred?
#MILDRED.
I want to, Tom.
#TOM.
Then let's die together!
#MILDRED.
Yes - but how?
#TOM.
I don't know. That's the worst of me. I'm so beastly ignorant.
#MILDRED.
There's a pond at the bottom of the garden.
#TOM.
Is there?
#MILDRED.
Six feet deep.
#TOM.
Let's go at once.
#MILDRED.
And throw ourselves in?
#TOM.
We'll have a look at it first.
#KATE.
Surely that's Mr. Selwyn!
#NORMANTOWER.
Here they are, both of them.
#KATE.
You, Mr. Selwyn. Then you're better!
#PHILIP.
Yes - feeling another man. I've even been attending to business, with my solicitor. I must admit, Sir Peter's treatment is justified by the result, but I can't say I altogether relish it. What do you think he's giving me?
#NORMANTOWER.
What?
#PHILIP.
Arsenic.
#NORMANTOWER.
Gracious me!
#KATE.
Arsenic! That's nothing! Many ladies take it.
#NORMANTOWER.
Ladies take arsenic!
#KATE.
Don't they, Mrs. Selwyn?
#BEATRICE.
I should hope not, Miss Derwent.
#KATE.
You never heard of such a thing, of course?
#NORMANTOWER.
What do they take it for?
#SIR PETER.
My dear young gentleman, have you lived six and twenty years without discovering that the female complexion is usually an artificial product?
#NORMANTOWER.
Well, I know a powder - puff when I see one, but arsenic!
#SIR PETER.
Pooh! a common drug!
#BEATRICE.
Miss Derwent, so sorry to trouble you - but the night dews are falling, and Mildred has gone out without a shawl.
#KATE.
I'll get one at once.
#NORMANTOWER.
Yes - we'll get one at once.
#PHILIP.
I must say, I agree with Normantower. When you told me what you were giving me, it was rather a shock even to me, and it nearly frightened poor Beatrice out of her life.
#BEATRICE.
Philip, don't speak of it. Don't you remember what happened?
#PHILIP.
You broke a glass.
#BEATRICE.
And breaking glass is so unlucky.
#PHILIP.
Mousey, you'll make Sir Peter laugh at you.
#SIR PETER.
Why should I?
#PHILIP.
Surely you don't believe in luck?
#SIR PETER.
Everybody believes in luck, except fools, who attribute their successes to their merits. My experience teaches me differently. I know, one may study a case for a week, and master it only by accident - as I have mastered yours.
#BEATRICE.
You've mastered Philip's?
#SIR PETER.
Yes. As I suspected. Liver.
#BEATRICE.
Ah! Then, after all, it is only dyspepsia?
#SIR PETER.
Only dyspepsia, madam! What's the word suffering from? - vice - crime - drink - poverty? What are they all? Indigestion.
#PHILIP.
My wife means, nothing dangerous - one can hardly die of dyspepsia.
#SIR PETER.
Sir, one can die of anything. If you only knew the number of things one can die of, you'd wonder any of us are alive. What have you there?
#PHILIP.
Only some coffee.
#SIR PETER.
Put it down, sir, instantly.
#BEATRICE.
Mayn't he have coffee, doctor?
#SIR PETER.
Coffee! Most indigestible! Have I not given my orders? He is to taste nothing more to - day, except one dose of medicine before going to bed.
#PHILIP.
Another dose, to - night?
#SIR PETER.
One more; it's most important.
#BEATRICE.
Is Mr. Merivale still here?
#PHILIP.
Oh no, he went some time ago.
#BEATRICE.
Then have you made the will?
#PHILIP.
Not yet. Merivale insists on making his own inquiries before taking any other steps in the matter. If Sir Peter's information is confirmed, he will accept my instructions. I am to see him again at twelve o'clock to - morrow.
#BEATRICE.
Twelve o'clock?
#SIR PETER.
Now you must rest. You've had a trying day
#BEATRICE.
You needn't trouble, doctor. I will go with Philip.
#SIR PETER.
Thank you - it is no trouble. Come, my boy.
#PHILIP.
How can I repay you for all your attention?
#SIR PETER.
By obeying me to the letter. Diet's the great thing; and the less the better. Eat nothing - drink nothing.
#PHILIP.
But one dose of medicine.
#SIR PETER.
Just one more.
#BEATRICE.
One more! My last chance - and I dare not take it. At twelve o'clock to - morrow, all I have worked for, all I have schemed for, all I have married for, slips through my fingers. And I can do nothing! No, it is too dangerous; and if I stop now, I am safe enough. But what is safety worth? Tied to my husband for his life, and at his death, a pauper! Whilst she - she will be the Countess of Normantower! Unless - unless - He doesn't know that she is Philip's sister. It is arranged it shall be kept a secret. Then, why is Philip leaving her his fortune? If I could make him think there was another reason. He is in love, and love is always jealous. If I could only sow a doubt between them. Countess of Normantower! What I have thrown away!
#NORMANTOWER.
It's all right. We've found the shawl.
#BEATRICE.
Did it take two to find it?
#NORMANTOWER.
It took two to look for it. Miss Derwent looked everywhere for the shawl, and I looked everywhere for Miss Derwent.
#BEATRICE.
You are great friends.
#NORMANTOWER.
Oh, yes; we get along splendidly. I like Miss Derwent! she is just my sort.
#BEATRICE.
I thought you hated all women.
#NORMANTOWER.
On the contrary, I am never so happy as in the society of ladies.
#BEATRICE.
You, who are always raving against marriage.
#NORMANTOWER.
That's the reason. To marry is to devote oneself to an individual; whilst a bachelor can devote himself to the sex. Besides, I have to study economy - and it comes cheaper on taking a quantity.
#BEATRICE.
Perhaps, you are right. Marriage is a terrible lottery.
#NORMANTOWER.
You should be thankful you have drawn a prize.
#BEATRICE.
Don't mock me.
#NORMANTOWER.
I'm sure you couldn't have a better husband than Philip. He's one of the best fellows in the world.
#BEATRICE.
Ah! there's only one prize - to a woman.
#NORMANTOWER.
She means me.
#BEATRICE.
All the rest are blanks. And sometimes worse than blanks.
#NORMANTOWER.
This is damn'd awkward!
#BEATRICE.
Lord Normantower, I owe you an explanation which I have had no opportunity of giving you. Your time is so much occupied, and we are so seldom alone.
#NORMANTOWER.
I wish somebody'd come!
#BEATRICE.
When you first came to Ravenhurst, I made what must have seemed a very strange avowal.
#NORMANTOWER.
Mrs. Selwyn, I have tried to forget it, and I hope you will assist me. And the best way to forget it, is not to say anything about it.
#BEATRICE.
I have tried to be silent - but in justice to myself, I must speak. You know my marriage was not my own wish; but having married, do me the justice to believe I would have been a true and loyal wife, if Philip had been all you think he is.
#NORMANTOWER.
Philip?
#BEATRICE.
I have accepted my lot without a murmur. Even now, my only wish is that you should not think too harshly of my indiscretion; but at the sight of you, the old times came back so vividly, that words sprang to my lips which I should not have spoken, even under such provocation as mine.
#NORMANTOWER.
I have known Philip nearly all my life, and this is the first breath I ever heard against him. I can't help thinking you must be mistaken.
#BEATRICE.
Think so - by all means think so! I do not ask for pity or for sympathy. I only said so much in self - defence. Now I have done.
#NORMANTOWER.
Thank goodness!
#BEATRICE.
But you are quite right to remain a bachelor. Marriage is a mistake.
#NORMANTOWER.
There are two ways of looking at it; and, after all, one ought to see both sides. I've looked at one for so long, I'm seriously thinking of taking a turn at the other.
#BEATRICE.
You contemplate being married?
#NORMANTOWER.
Well, I have had some thoughts of it.
#BEATRICE.
Whom shall I have the pleasure of congratulating?
#NORMANTOWER.
Oh, I don't know. I haven't asked her yet - at least, not properly. I'm sort of - feeling my way.
#BEATRICE.
I don't think you need fear.
#NORMANTOWER.
D'you think she'll have me - really!
#BEATRICE.
Of course, I don't know who the lady is.
#NORMANTOWER.
Oh, yes you do, Miss Derwent.
#BEATRICE.
Miss Derwent?
#NORMANTOWER.
Yes, of course. You must have seen I'm awfully gone on her.
#BEATRICE.
And you propose to marry her.
#NORMANTOWER.
Well I should like to.
#BEATRICE.
What am I to say?
#NORMANTOWER.
What do you mean?
#BEATRICE.
Nothing. I only meant - rather a mésalliance, isn't it?
#NORMANTOWER.
I don't see that at all. I'm no great catch. I'm as poor as a church mouse. coronet is something.
#NORMANTOWER.
Pooh! What's a coronet? A thing they stick about on hansom cabs. Sixpence a mile.
#BEATRICE.
And don't you owe a duty to your family?
#NORMANTOWER.
My family owe a great deal more to me, but there's precious little chance of their stumping up.
#BEATRICE.
Let me see. How long have you known Miss Derwent?
#NORMANTOWER.
About a week.
#BEATRICE.
And don't you think it's dangerous, to marry on so short an acquaintance?
#NORMANTOWER.
To marry anybody else, it would be. Not to marry her.
#BEATRICE.
Have you told Philip?
#NORMANTOWER.
No - what's he to do with it?
#BEATRICE.
Nothing, of course! No, nothing. Why should I tell you! Why should I publish my own humiliation? And yet, we are such old friends, how can I stand by, and see your whole life ruined? No! Lord Normantower, this marriage is impossible.
#NORMANTOWER.
I don't see that at all.
#BEATRICE.
You are in love, and blind! Has it never struck you? Why is Miss Derwent here?
#NORMANTOWER.
Isn't she Mildred's governess?
#BEATRICE.
Mildred requires no governess.
#NORMANTOWER.
Well, her companion - yours.
#BEATRICE.
Mine! My companion! Yes, you are right there. Yes, my companion - in my husband's heart.
#NORMANTOWER.
Surely, you cannot mean -
#BEATRICE.
My rival! Yes! I mean, that Philip is her lover.
#NORMANTOWER.
Mrs. Selwyn!
#BEATRICE.
Now I have told you my secret, and I leave it to your honour to respect it.
#NORMANTOWER.
You accuse Miss Derwent - you accuse your husband -
#BEATRICE.
Yes, I accuse them both. You know what happened this morning; Miss Derwent was going away, and my husband insisted on her remaining; but you don't know what happened this afternoon. So mad is Philip's infatuation that he is even making a new will, bequeathing her every shilling he possesses, leaving me an outcast and a beggar.
#NORMANTOWER.
Surely you are mistaken.
#BEATRICE.
I am not mistaken! Sir Peter knows of this will. He will tell you what I say is the truth. But not a word about my secret? I leave that to your honour.
#NORMANTOWER.
I wish she wouldn't leave my honour legacies.
#SIR PETER.
Where are you going?
#BEATRICE.
Only to sit with Philip.
#SIR PETER.
He is lying down, and must on no account be disturbed.
#BEATRICE.
Surely a wife -
#SIR PETER.
Is the most likely person to disturb her husband.
#BEATRICE.
Sir Peter, I will see him!
#SIR PETER.
But you can't.
#NORMANTOWER.
How can I ask Sir Peter? How can I say, has Selwyn made a will, leaving his wife a beggar? I know what his answer would be. "Sir, what the devil has that to do with you?" And yet it has a lot to do with me. I regard Miss Derwent's reputation as my own, and I'm not going to have aspersions cast on it. If I could clear things up, I might be able to convince Mrs. Selwyn of her mistake. But how can I broach the subject? It's a teazer.
#SIR PETER.
Now, what am I to do? Give her a chance, or nail her to the counter? If I gave her a chance, would she take it? Not she! She would appeal to her husband - he would believe her implicitly and kick me out of the house - there would be an end of me - and there would be an end of him. I must convict her - there's no alternative. But how? If she plays any tricks to - night, I have her. But if she doesn't? She has me! Well, the first thing to be done is, to make things safe for the night.
#NORMANTOWER.
I have it! Sir Peter knows I'm poor - I'll tell him I have thoughts of marrying, but I must marry money. I will inquire about Miss Derwent's circumstances - say, I've heard a rumour. Then I shall find out all about this will. Sir Peter will think I'm an awful cad, but what does it matter what Sir Peter thinks? Upon my word, statesmanship is hereditary, after all. I feel a regular Machiavelli! Sir Peter! May I have a word with you?
#SIR PETER.
How long are you likely to be?
#NORMANTOWER.
Only a second.
#SIR PETER.
That means half - an - hour. I limit my consultations to ten minutes.
#NORMANTOWER.
Ten minutes, then.
#SIR PETER.
Go on.
#NORMANTOWER.
It is about Miss Derwent.
#SIR PETER.
Oh, Miss Derwent!
#KATE.
He's talking about me. I should like to know what he thinks of me. It's a mean thing to do - but I'll do it - just for fun.
#SIR PETER.
Well, sir.
#NORMANTOWER.
You know Miss Derwent very well, I think?
#SIR PETER.
Very well indeed - go on!
#NORMANTOWER.
She's all right, isn't she?
#SIR PETER.
All right?
#NORMANTOWER.
I mean, there isn't a screw loose anywhere?
#SIR PETER.
Screw loose?
#NORMANTOWER.
You know, I have some thoughts of marrying.
#SIR PETER.
Her!
#NORMANTOWER.
Well, yes, of marrying her.
#SIR PETER.
Then marry her, and don't bother me about it.
#NORMANTOWER.
But I'm as poor as a rat, and I can't afford -
#SIR PETER.
Then, don't marry her.
#NORMANTOWER.
But it has reached my ears, that Selwyn's going to leave her everything. If that is really so, it would suit my book to a T; and I thought you might know something about it.
#SIR PETER.
Well, sir?
#NORMANTOWER.
And tell me.
#SIR PETER.
In what capacity? As a physician?
#NORMANTOWER.
No - as a friend.
#SIR PETER.
As Mr. Selwyn's friend - betray his confidence?
#NORMANTOWER.
No - as my friend.
#SIR PETER.
But I am not your friend.
#NORMANTOWER.
Well, as between two men of the world. Miss Derwent's an awfully nice girl, but you know, one must look after the dibs.
#SIR PETER.
Sir, I may be a man of the world, or I may not, but I do not hold consultations in that capacity. Good evening.
#NORMANTOWER.
Sir Peter! One moment!
#NORMANTOWER.
There she is.
#KATE.
I don't care.
#NORMANTOWER.
Miss Derwent, you've been crying. Something's the matter.
#KATE.
Don't trouble about me. I'm "all right."
#NORMANTOWER.
"All right?" Do sit down!
#KATE.
Thanks, I prefer to stand.
#NORMANTOWER.
But I don't like you to stand.
#KATE.
I'm sorry if my attitude is not sufficiently elegant to satisfy your lordship's fastidious taste.
#NORMANTOWER.
Miss Derwent!
#KATE.
But I was not born graceful. I don't think I was properly finished off. Nature has left "a screw loose" somewhere.
#NORMANTOWER.
"A screw loose?"
#KATE.
What perplexes your lordship?
#NORMANTOWER.
Miss Derwent, tell me - why did you ever want to leave Ravenhurst? Don't think me impertinent. I have a reason for asking.
#KATE.
And I had a reason for leaving.
#NORMANTOWER.
Were you uncomfortable?
#KATE.
Oh dear, no! Mr. Selwyn has always insisted on my being treated with every consideration.
#NORMANTOWER.
Ah! Philip thinks a lot of you, doesn't he?
#KATE.
I think, he likes me. I don't know about "a lot."
#NORMANTOWER.
Perhaps you felt yourself in rather a false position?
#KATE.
What do you mean?
#NORMANTOWER.
Nothing - I only meant - I don't know what I meant.
#KATE.
Perhaps I thought, that I might better my position.
#NORMANTOWER.
But if you were so comfortable -
#KATE.
Comfort isn't everything. Ravenhurst's an awfully nice place: but - "You know, one must look after the dibs."
#NORMANTOWER.
Then, you heard my conversation with Sir Peter?
#KATE.
Every word of it.
#NORMANTOWER.
Well, it serves me right.
#KATE.
And me as well - for listening - but I'm glad I did. Now, I know what you are, and what you want. You are for sale! Heart, soul, mind, body and estate - without reserve, and open to all bidders. I am only a governess - I have no money to buy you, and I don't want to buy you! Knock yourself down to anyone you please! What do I care?
#NORMANTOWER.
Hear me, one moment. I have been misled.
#KATE.
And so have I. I thought, at last, that I had met a man! - A man whom I could love -
#NORMANTOWER.
Miss Derwent!
#KATE.
Whom I could honour - whom I could even obey!
#NORMANTOWER.
Kate!
#KATE.
Don't call me "Kate." It wasn't you. It was another man altogether - a creature of my fancy - whom I had met in dreams - but whom I loved - with such a love as never entered into your sordid soul - for whom I would have died - for whom I would have worked, toiled, slaved, from morning until night - who possessed the whole heart of a woman who has never loved before, but who has cast it from him and has broken it!
#NORMANTOWER.
My last appearance as Machiavelli!
#TOM.
I don't like the look of the pond.
#NORMANTOWER.
What pond? What are you talking about?
#TOM.
Oh, by the bye, I haven't told you what we're going to do.
#NORMANTOWER.
Who's going to do?
#TOM.
Why, me and Mildred. Drown ourselves. At least we were going to drown ourselves, until we saw the pond. Now, we are going to think of something else.
#NORMANTOWER.
Look here, Tom! it's quite time little boys were in bed. You'll have plenty of time to - morrow.
#TOM.
Ah! You don't know what it is, to love - and get the key of the street!
#NORMANTOWER.
Don't I? I've got it.
#TOM.
You've got it, Ned?
#NORMANTOWER.
Miss Derwent has just given it me.
#TOM.
I say, let's drown one another! You go first!
#NORMANTOWER.
No, thank you, Tom. I'll go and make things up.
#TOM.
Sir Peter - the very man - I say, Sir Peter!
#SIR PETER.
Mr. Verinder?
#TOM.
Aren't you a doctor?
#SIR PETER.
I had the honour to belong to the medical profession before you were born. lot of things seem to have happened before I was born - and everybody takes care to let me know it.
#SIR PETER.
It is impossible to know too much.
#TOM.
Then, tell me. What's the pleasantest way of committing suicide?
#SIR PETER.
Hem! The question is scarcely usual. I regret to say, the etiquette of my profession precludes me from replying.
#TOM.
Pompous old ass! I don't believe he knows.
#MILDRED.
Tom, Tom!
#TOM.
What's that you've got?
#MILDRED.
"Kennedy on Poisons." I found it in Miss Derwent's dressing - room.
#TOM.
Just what we wanted - let me have a look.
#SIR PETER.
Give me that book.
#TOM.
But it's not hers - it's -
#SIR PETER.
Give that book to me. How dare you take this from Miss Derwent's dressing - room?
#MILDRED.
I didn't know that I was doing wrong. Mousey is always at Miss Derwent's bookcase.
#TOM.
How dare you take that from Miss Selwyn! Is it yours?
#SIR PETER.
By force of arms.
#TOM.
Force is not argument.
#SIR PETER.
Go away, boy, go!
#SIR PETER.
"Kennedy - Poisons" - "Kate Derwent - from her friend, the Author - Guy's Hospital, 17th April, 1888." Kennedy's pet lamb! Gives it right and left, and not got through the first edition yet. Nothing remarkable in that. But why does it open at arsenic? "Mousey is always at Miss Derwent's book - case."
#PRI.
Mr. Learoyd, the chemist, is here, sir.
#SIR PETER.
I'll see him at once. Stop - give this key to your mistress, with my compliments. You'll find her in her room.
#BEATRICE.
What is it?
#PRI.
Sir Peter told me to give you this, madam, with his compliments.
#BEATRICE.
The key! Price! I am going to bed. I shall not want Johnson. Put all the lights out, lock the outer door of the conservatory, and make up the house.
#PRI.
Yes, madam, but Sir Peter -
#BEATRICE.
Do as I tell you.
#PRI.
Good - night, madam.
#BEATRICE.
Good - night. Then, he does not suspect me! When I found Philip's door locked, I was half afraid. Why am I such a coward? - Is he with Philip? No! Philip is fast asleep. Can he be watching? No! Good night, Sir Peter! pleasant dreams to you! He suspects nothing. It is a great temptation! Strange! how this fascinates me! With my life at stake, I scarcely can resist it. It possesses me! But, I suppose, I dare not. Who can that be? Who's there?
#SIR PETER.
It's I - Sir Peter Lund!
#BEATRICE.
What an escape! Come in, Sir Peter. I was just getting Philip's medicine.
#SIR PETER.
So I see. It's all right. I'm in time -
#BEATRICE.
I scarcely expected to see you again to - night. Do you want Philip?
#SIR PETER.
No, Mrs. Selwyn, it is you I want.
#BEATRICE.
Me?
#SIR PETER.
I have something of the greatest importance to tell you. First, let me make sure that my patient cannot overhear us.
#BEATRICE.
He was asleep just now.
#SIR PETER.
But he may have awakened.
#BEATRICE.
Shall I see?
#SIR PETER.
Thank you. Into there! Quick!
#KATE.
But what am I to do? Why have you brought me here?
#SIR PETER.
Keep your ears open, and you'll understand. That's her confounded train.
#BEATRICE.
What was that noise?
#SIR PETER.
Ten thousand pardons: I've upset a flowerpot.
#BEATRICE.
You've been in the conservatory?
#SIR PETER.
Yes - to make sure that nobody was listening. In a case like this, one cannot be too careful.
#BEATRICE.
Sir Peter, you alarm me. What dreadful secret are you going to tell me?
#SIR PETER.
Mrs. Selwyn, you are a woman of strong nerves, and you can bear a shock.
#BEATRICE.
I think so.
#SIR PETER.
Well, I'm going to give you one - I've found it!
#BEATRICE.
What?
#SIR PETER.
The serpent.
#BEATRICE.
The serpent?
#SIR PETER.
Which Mr. Selwyn said did not exist, but the existence of which I suspected from the first. serpent in Ravenhurst?
#SIR PETER.
And a remarkably fine specimen, it turns out to be. Your husband is being poisoned. I can quite understand your emotion.
#BEATRICE.
Poisoned?
#SIR PETER.
By arsenic, administered in his medicine.
#BEATRICE.
But you put it there yourself. You told him, you were giving him arsenic.
#SIR PETER.
I was not. I did not prescribe arsenic.
#BEATRICE.
Might not the chemist - by mistake -
#SIR PETER.
I've seen him, and he assures me there was no mistake. Besides, though there was arsenic in the glass, there was none in the bottle. While you were all having your dinner, I took the liberty of analysing that. Mr. Selwyn is now in such a condition that the next dose may be fatal. The first thing to be done is, to protect his life. I have not left him since morning; but at the precise moment when the criminal, whoever it is, will probably administer the poison, I shall not be there to prevent it, because that moment will be when he takes the final dose of physic which I have ordered him, just before going to bed.
#BEATRICE.
And knowing this, you have ordered it?
#SIR PETER.
With the object of detecting the culprit. Here I want your assistance. We must lay our plans carefully; for whoever is doing this, she is a very clever woman.
#BEATRICE.
Woman! Then, you suspect -
#SIR PETER.
Miss Derwent. What was that?
#BEATRICE.
Miss Derwent!
#SIR PETER.
I thought I heard a noise in the conservatory.
#BEATRICE.
No one is there. The doors have been locked.
#SIR PETER.
Someone may have opened them. Let us make sure.
#BEATRICE.
Miss Derwent!
#SIR PETER.
Only the flower pot - caught in a plant, which must have given way.
#BEATRICE.
Well? You were saying -
#SIR PETER.
I suspect Miss Derwent - She has, as humanity goes, a powerful incentive to this crime. On Mr. Selwyn's death, she expects to come into a large fortune.
#BEATRICE.
Not until he has made a will in her favour.
#SIR PETER.
He said he would make it to - day. She heard him say so, and she knows that he has seen his solicitor.
#BEATRICE.
Yes, but my husband has been ill some weeks. Miss Derwent had nothing to gain by his death until this will was made.
#SIR PETER.
Therefore, she has not killed him. The process has been admirably timed. She began to compass his death when she had nothing to gain by it, and therefore was not open to suspicion; and on the point of its consummation, adroitly threw herself upon his generosity. You must admit the ingenuity of the scheme.
#BEATRICE.
But the evidence?
#SIR PETER.
That is where you must help me. It is incomplete. But it is obvious enough, the criminal, whoever it is, is familiar with the properties of arsenic, which are not so simple as is commonly supposed. A bungler would have killed him long ago; but Miss Derwent is half a doctor. She was at Guy's for years. She is a particular friend of Dr. Kennedy's - and, strongest evidence of all, his book on toxicology is here - inscribed with her name - and has evidently been considerably studied. Especially, one chapter.
#BEATRICE.
Which is that?
#SIR PETER.
Open it.
#BEATRICE.
"Arsenic"!
#SIR PETER.
Look at the title page.
#BEATRICE.
"Kate Derwent - from her friend, the Author."
#SIR PETER.
I submit that the case against her is one of the gravest suspicion
#BEATRICE.
Then you accuse your friend and protégée.
#SIR PETER.
Science has no friendships. Someone is poisoning your husband. I suspect Miss Derwent. Accept my theory or reject it - Watch that glass! If anybody touches it -
#BEATRICE.
Who can, but me! When you have gone, and I have locked the door, no one can get into this room to - night. Where is this poison coming from?
#SIR PETER.
Wherever it comes from, I know where it goes; into that glass. Therefore, please, watch the glass! If anybody tampers with it, ring this bell.
#BEATRICE.
What, the alarm - bell?
#SIR PETER.
It will rouse the house. A miscreant will be brought to justice, and your husband's life will be saved.
#BEATRICE.
If no one touches it?
#SIR PETER.
He is safe for to - night, at any rate. Madam, I have the honour to wish you a very good evening.
#BEATRICE.
Thank you, Sir Peter! thank you very much! The case you have begun, I will complete. Now, I can not only save myself, but triumph! If I convict Miss Derwent of this crime, the will must be abandoned. It is worth some risk! I can but fail: and if I do - I'll make this strong enough. There! Now to bring Miss Derwent. I will say Philip's dying, and has asked to see her. Then I will rouse the house, and she shall be found here - alone with this! Sir Peter will corroborate me, Philip will be convinced, and my Lord Normantower - ha, ha! - can marry her! Thank you, Sir Peter, thank you!
#KATE.
Oh!
#PHILIP.
Beatrice!
#KATE.
My brother's voice - if I were found here now!
#PHILIP.
Beatrice!
#PHILIP.
Not here? Where can she be? Good gracious, I've been asleep for nearly three hours. Well, I suppose she won't be very long; Ah, there's the medicine! That last dose, which old Lund said was so particular. I'd forgotten all about it. But Mousey hadn't. She forgets nothing - nothing! Well, the sooner I take it, the sooner it's over.
#KATE.
Philip! Stop!
#PHILIP.
Kate?
#KATE.
It's poison!
#PHILIP.
Poison?
#KATE.
Yes! She is killing you!
#PHILIP.
Who?
#KATE.
Beatrice! Your wife!
#LUND.
Lights worked up imperceptibly)
#SIR PETER.
Who rang the bell?
#BEATRICE.
I rang!
#NORMANTOWER.
What is the matter?
#BEATRICE.
Sir Peter, you were right. This girl is poisoning my husband.
#PHILIP.
Beatrice!
#KATE.
Oh!
#SIR PETER.
Let Mrs. Selwyn speak.
#BEATRICE.
You asked me to watch, and I have watched. I found her hidden here. My husband was about to drink this stuff -
#PHILIP.
When she prevented me -
#BEATRICE.
Because, of course, she heard my conversation with Sir Peter. Knowing she was suspected, she has sought to cast this horrible suspicion upon me!
#KATE.
Philip - I saw her!
#BEATRICE.
Since I poured out that draught, I have not touched it.
#KATE.
Oh!
#BEATRICE.
If it is poisoned - she has poisoned it.
#SIR PETER.
But when? Besides, you would have seen her - you were watching. This was not poisoned, when I left the room.
#BEATRICE.
It must have been!
#SIR PETER.
I think not - and I tested it.
#BEATRICE.
I didn't see you.
#SIR PETER.
No - I took care you shouldn't.
#BEATRICE.
You suspected me!
#SIR PETER.
From the beginning.
#BEATRICE.
This is a plot to ruin me! Philip, you don't believe this hideous charge? What was Miss Derwent doing in the room? If she is innocent, why was she hiding here?
#SIR PETER.
Perhaps I can throw some light upon that matter. I brought Miss Derwent here.
#BEATRICE.
You brought her - when?
#SIR PETER.
When you were in the other room, naturally. I took the liberty of putting her into the conservatory, where, you will remember, she had the misfortune to upset a flower - pot.
#BEATRICE.
I understand. You laid a trap for me?
#SIR PETER.
I took that liberty.
#BEATRICE.
And you say, this is poisoned?
#SIR PETER.
I should think, fatally.
#BEATRICE.
If I am guilty, why do I not get rid of it? You have given me plenty of opportunity.
#SIR PETER.
For a very excellent reason. Because you are quite clever enough to know, that to do so would be an admission of your crime.
#BEATRICE.
I am not guilty, and this is not poison.
#SIR PETER.
Sorry I am to contradict you -
#BEATRICE.
See! I will prove it!
#SIR PETER.
Mrs. Selwyn!
#BEATRICE.
You are too late, Sir Peter. Now - good night to all of you.
#NORMANTOWER.
What was the object?
#LUND.
of him, R. of sofa)
#PHILIP.
Normantower, Kate is my sister. The fortune which I have enjoyed for years is hers, and I was anxious to restore it. The object was, to prevent me. Oh, Kate, my heart is broken!
#KATE.
But time will heal it, Philip; for your heart is good; goodness and happiness are not strangers long.
#PHILIP.
Only to think, this woman is my wife!
#SIR PETER.
But not for long. And she is better dead! Moderate Curtain.
