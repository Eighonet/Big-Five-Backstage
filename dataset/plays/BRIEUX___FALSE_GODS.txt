#SITSI.
Did you not know? She, on whose left hand a black ibis has been painted, is certain of a happy day. happy day! Why then, 'tis I, perhaps, who will be chosen to - night!
#DELETHI.
More slowly! - more slowly!... you must make them think of the swaying of a lotus flower, that the Nile's slow - moving current would bear away, and that raises itself to kiss again the waters of the stream.
#NAGAOU.
Yes, yes.... Begin again!
#NAHASI.
Nagaou would let herself be borne away without a struggle.
#MOUENE.
We know that she goes to the bank of the Nile, at the hour when the palm - trees grow black against the evening sky, to listen to a basket maker's songs.
#HANOU.
And this morning I anointed my whole body with Kyphli, mixed with cinnamon and terrabine and myrrh.
#DELETHI.
'Tis well ... you may dance the great prayer to Isis with the rest.
#NAGAOU.
Yes! I do go to listen to songs at dark. You are still too little for anyone, basket maker or any other, to take notice of you.
#MOUENE.
You think so!... who gave me this little bird? Who caught thee, flower - of - the - air, who gave thee to me? Do not tell! Do not tell....
#HANOU.
Sitsinit ... the black line that lengthens this eye is too short ... make it longer with your reed. I think the more beautiful I am, the more chance I shall have to be chosen for the sacrifice.... Is it not so, Zaya?... What are you doing there without a word?
#ZAYA.
I was watching the flight of a crane with hanging feet, that melted away in the distant blue of heaven.... Do not hope to be chosen by the gods, Hanou.
#HANOU.
Wherefore should I not be chosen?
#ZAYA.
Neither you nor any who are here. The gods never demand the sacrifice two years together from the same village.
#HANOU.
Never?
#ZAYA.
Rarely.
#HANOU.
'Tis a pity. Is it not, Nagaou?
#NAGAOU.
I know not.
#SITSI.
Would it not make you proud?
#NAGAOU.
Yes. But it makes me proud, too, to lean on the breast of him whose words still the beating of my heart.
#DELETHI.
To be taken by a god! By the Nile!
#HANOU.
Preferred to all the others!
#MOUENE.
For my part I should prefer to live....
#SITSI.
Still, if the God desired you....
#ZAYA.
Oh! one can refuse....
#DELETHI.
Yes, but one must leave the country, then.... None of the daughters of Haka - Phtah could bring themselves to that.
#YAOUMA.
Perhaps!
#NAHASI.
What do you say, Yaouma?
#YAOUMA.
Nothing. I was speaking to my soul.
#MOUENE.
Yaouma's eyes weep for weariness because they watch far off for him, who comes not.
#YAOUMA.
Peace, child.
#ZAYA.
One thing is certain, someone must go upon the sacred barge?
#DELETHI.
Without the sacrifice the Nile would not overflow, and all the land would remain barren.
#HANOU.
And the corn would not sprout, nor the beans, nor the maize, nor the lotus.
#DELETHI.
And all the people would perish miserably.
#HANOU.
So that she who dies, sacrificed to the Nile, saves the lives of a whole people. That is a better thing, Nagaou, than to make one man's happiness.
#YAOUMA.
Perhaps.
#HANOU.
And on the appointed day one is borne from the house of the god to the Nile, surrounded by all the dwellers in the town.... The Pharaoh - health and strength be unto him!...
#DELETHI.
You do not know, Hanou, you tell us what you do not know.
#HANOU.
But it is so, is it not, Zaya? Zaya knows about the ceremony, because last year it was her sister who was chosen.
#MOUENE.
Tell us, Zaya.
#NAHASI.
Yes, tell us the manner of it.
#ZAYA.
On the fifth day of the month of Paophi....
#MOUENE.
To - day - that is to - day?
#NAHASI.
Yes. What will happen.... The prayer of Isis.... But afterwards? Before?
#ZAYA.
Before the sun has ended his day's journey, the people, summoned to the terraces by a call from the Temple, will intone the great hymn to Isis, which is sung but once a year. Within the house of the god the assembled priests will await the sign that shall reveal the virgin to be offered to the Nile to obtain its yearly flood. The name of the chosen will be cried from the doorway on high, caught up by those who hear it first, cried out to others, who in turn will cry it running towards the house that Ammon has favored with his choice. Then shall the happy victim of the year stand forth alone, amid her kinsfolk bowed before her, and to her ears shall rise the shoutings of the multitude.
#ALL.
Oh!
#DELETHI.
And after a month of purification she will be borne to the house of the god!
#ZAYA.
And on the day of Prodigies....
#NAHASI.
Oh, the day of Prodigies!
#ZAYA.
She will be the foremost nearer to the Sanctuary than all the rest. She will pray with the praying crowd, she will behold the lowering of the stone that hides the face of Isis....
#DELETHI.
She will behold Isis - face to face....
#ALL.
Oh!
#ZAYA.
She will beg the goddess graciously to incline her head, in sign that, yet another year, Egypt shall be protected. And when the fervor of the crowd's united prayer is great enough, the head of the Goddess of Stone will bow. That will be the first prodigy.
#DELETHI.
The head of the Goddess of Stone will bow - that will be the first prodigy.
#ZAYA.
And in the crowd there will be blind who shall see, and deaf who shall hear, and dumb who shall speak.
#DELETHI.
Perhaps Mieris, our good mistress, will be cured of her blindness at last.
#HANOU.
And when she who is chosen goes forth from the house of the God.... Tell us, Zaya, tell us the manner of her going forth.
#ZAYA.
Three days before the appointed day, in the town and throughout the land, they will begin the preparations for the festival. When the moment comes, the crowd will surge before the temple, guarded by Lybian soldiers. And she, she, the elect, the saviour, will come forth, ringed by the high priests of Ammon in purple and in gold, and aloft on a chariot where perfumes burn, deafened by sound of trumpet and cries of joy, she will behold the people stretch unnumbered arms to her....
#ALL.
Oh!
#DELETHI.
And she will be borne to the Nile....
#ZAYA.
And she will be borne to the Nile. She will board the barge of Ammon....
#DELETHI.
And the barge will glide from the bank....
#ZAYA.
And the barge will glide from the bank where all the crowd will bow their faces to the dust. And when the barge returns she will be gone.
#ALL.
And when the barge returns she will be gone.
#ZAYA.
And after two days the waters of the Nile will rise.
#ALL.
The waters of the Nile will rise....
#DELETHI.
And as far as the waters flow they will speak her name, who made the sacrifice, with blessings and with tears.
#HANOU.
If it were I!...
#ALL.
If it were I!...
#ZAYA.
If it were you, Yaouma?
#YAOUMA.
Perhaps I should refuse.
#ALL.
Oh!
#MOUENE.
I know why! I know why!
#DELETHI.
We know why.
#ZAYA.
Tell us....
#YAOUMA.
Tell them....
#DELETHI.
'Tis the same reason that has held you there this many a day.
#YAOUMA.
Yes.
#MOUENE.
She watches for the coming of the galley with twenty oars, bearing the travellers from the North. There is a young priest among them, the potter's son. young priest, the potter's son, who went away two years ago.
#YAOUMA.
He is my betrothed.
#NAHASI.
But you know what they say?
#ZAYA.
They say that on the same boat there comes a scribe who preaches of new gods....
#YAOUMA.
I know.
#DELETHI.
Of false gods.
#MOUENE.
The priests will stop the boat, and eight days hence, perhaps, Yaouma will still be awaiting her betrothed.
#YAOUMA.
I shall wait.
#DELETHI.
The mistress sends word the hour is come to go indoors.
#STEWARD.
There. Draw near, potter, and look. By some mischance, the horn and the plume of Goddess Thoueris have been broken. The master must not see them when he comes back for the feast of the Nomination. There is the horn - there is the plume. Replace them.
#PAKH.
I - must I ... to - day when my son is coming home?
#STEWARD.
Are you not our servant?
#PAKH.
I am.
#STEWARD.
And a potter?
#PAKH.
I am.
#STEWARD.
Did you not say you knew how to do what I ask?
#PAKH.
I did not know that I must lay hands on the Goddess Thoueris.
#STEWARD.
Obey.
#PAKH.
I pray you! I pray you ... I should never dare. And then ... my son ... my son who is coming back from a long, long journey....
#STEWARD.
You shall have twenty blows of the stick for having tired my tongue. If you refuse to obey me you shall have two hundred.
#PAKH.
I pray you.
#STEWARD.
Bid Sokiti help you.
#PAKH.
He says we must lift down the Goddess.
#PAKH.
You and I.
#SOKITI.
I am afraid.
#PAKH.
I too - I am afraid.
#SOKITI.
If you touch her you die.
#PAKH.
You will die of the stick if you do not obey.
#SOKITI.
Why cannot they leave me at my work. I was happy.
#PAKH.
We must - we must tell her that it is in order to repair her crown.
#SOKITI.
Yes. We must let her know.
#PAKH.
Oh, Mighty One! - thou who hast given birth to the gods, pardon if our miserable hands dare to touch thee! Thy horn and thy right plume have fallen off. 'Tis to replace them.
#SOKITI.
We are forced to obey - O breath divine - creator of the universe.... It is to mend thee.
#PAKH.
Come!
#SOKITI.
She has not said anything.
#PAKH.
She must be laid on her belly.
#SOKITI.
Gently....
#PAKH.
Hold that. Here ... the plume ... so ... there ... we must let her dry. In the meantime let us go look upon the Nile; we may see the boat that brings my son.
#SOKITI.
You will not see him.
#PAKH.
I shall not see him?
#SOKITI.
He is a priest.
#PAKH.
Not yet.
#SOKITI.
But he was brought up in the temple ... 'tis to the temple he will go.
#PAKH.
He will come here ... because he would see his father and mother once more.
#SOKITI.
And Yaouma his betrothed.
#PAKH.
And Yaouma his betrothed.
#SOKITI.
There is nothing in sight.
#PAKH.
No.... You saw the crocodile?
#SOKITI.
Yes.... There is a woman going to the Nile with her pitcher on her head.
#PAKH.
That is my wife, that is Kirjipa, that is mine. She seeks with her eyes the boat that bears her son - Satni.
#SOKITI.
She is going into the stream.
#PAKH.
How else can she draw clear water?
#SOKITI.
But at the very spot where the crocodile plunged.
#PAKH.
What matter? She wears the feather of an ibis ... and I know a magic spell. Back, son of Sitou! Dare not! Seize not! Open not thy jaws! Let the water become a sheet of flame before thee! The spell of thirty - seven gods is in thine eye. Thou art bound, thou art bound! Stay, son of Sitou! Ammon, spouse of thy mother, protect her!
#SOKITI.
It is gone.
#PAKH.
It could not do otherwise.
#SOKITI.
She is dry now, perhaps?
#PAKH.
Yes, come.
#SOKITI.
I am afraid still.
#PAKH.
So am I, but come and help me.
#SOKITI.
She has done us no harm.
#PAKH.
No.
#SOKITI.
Ha! ha!
#PAKH.
Ha! ha! ha! ha! It is the chief of the Nome. They are bearing him to the city of the dead. At this moment his soul is before the tribunal, where Osiris sits with the two and forty judges.
#SOKITI.
May they render unto him all the evil he has done!...
#PAKH.
The evil he has done will be rendered unto him a thousand fold.... He will pass first into the lake of fire.
#SOKITI.
Pakh! Pakh! picture him in Amenti - in the hidden place -
#PAKH.
I see him ... the pivot of the gate of Amenti set upon his eye, turns upon his right eye, and turns on that eye whether in opening or in shutting, and his mouth utters loud cries.
#SOKITI.
And he who ate so much!... He who ate so much! He will have his food, bread and water, hung above his head, and he will leap to get it down, whilst others will dig holes beneath his feet to prevent his touching it.
#PAKH.
Because his crimes are found to outnumber his merits....
#SOKITI.
And we - we - say - what will happen to us?
#PAKH.
We shall be found innocent by the two and forty judges.
#SOKITI.
And after? - after?
#PAKH.
We shall go to the island of the souls - in Amenti -
#SOKITI.
Yes, where there will be.... Speak. What shall we have in the island of the souls?
#PAKH.
Baths of clear water....
#SOKITI.
What else ... what else?
#PAKH.
Ears of corn of two arms' length....
#SOKITI.
Yes, ears of corn, of two arms' length.
#PAKH.
And bread of maize, and beans....
#SOKITI.
And blows of the stick - say, will there be blows of the stick?
#PAKH.
Never again.
#SOKITI.
Never again....
#PAKH.
I shall forget all I have endured.
#SOKITI.
I shall be famished; and I shall be able to eat until my hunger is gone ... every day!
#BITIOU.
And I - I shall be tall, with straight strong legs, like the rest of the world.
#PAKH.
That will be better than having been prince on the earth.
#STEWARD.
What are you doing there? Your mistress comes! Begone!
#MIERIS.
Leave me, Yaouma - I shall be able to find my way to her, alone.
#YAOUMA.
Yes mistress....
#MIERIS.
I can feel you do not obey. Be not afraid. You see, I do not lose my way. I have come every day to bring her flowers, a long, long time.... Leave me.
#YAOUMA.
Yes, mistress.
#MIERIS.
Yes, thou art Isis. I know thy face, and I can guess thy smile. Behold my daily offering! I know this for a white lotus flower. It is for thee. I am not wrong, this one, longer, and with the heavier scent, is the pink lotus. It is for thee. And here are yet two more of these sacred flowers. At dawn, they come from out the water, little by little. At midday they open wide. And when the sun sinks they, too, hide themselves, letting the waters of the Nile cover them like a veil. Men say they are fair to see. Alas, I know not the beauty of the gifts I bring! Here is a typha ... here an alisma; and by the overpowering perfume, this, I know, is the acacia flower. I have had them tell me how the light, playing through the filmy petals, tints them with color sweet unto the eyes. May the sight gladden thine! I know not the beauty of the gifts I bring! But all the days of my life, a suppliant I shall come, and weary not to ply thee with my prayers, until in the end thou absolve me, until thou grant me the boon that all save I enjoy, to behold the rays of the shining God, of Ammon - Ra, the Sun divine. O Isis, remember the cruel blow that did befall me! I had a little child. Unto him sight was given, and when he first could speak, it was life's sweetest joy, to hear him tell the color and the form of things. He is dead, Isis! And I have never seen him - Take thou my tears and my prayer, bid this perpetual night, wherein I scarce can breathe, to cease - And if thou wilt not, deliver me to death - She - who - loves - the - silence, and after the judgment I may go to Amenti, and find my well - beloved child - find him, and there at last behold his face. Isis, I give thee all these flowers. Come, Yaouma. Stay - I hear - yes! Go, bring the ewer and the lustral water. It is the master - He is here.
#MIERIS.
Be welcome unto your house, master!
#RHEOU.
Gladly I greet you once more in your house, mistress! Well! potter, do you not go to meet your son?
#PAKH.
I would fain go, master, but I looked upon the Nile a while ago; there is nothing in sight.
#RHEOU.
The galley came last night at dusk, and, by order of the priests, was kept at the bend of the river till now. Go!
#PAKH.
I thank you, master.
#RHEOU.
Is all made ready for the solemn prayer to Isis? The Sun is nearing the horizon.
#MIERIS.
Yaouma, go and warn them all.
#YAOUMA.
Mistress -
#MIERIS.
What is it?
#YAOUMA.
The galley.
#MIERIS.
Well? - Ah, yes! you were betrothed to the potter's son - But to - day you must not go forth. Who shall say you are not she whom the God Ammon will choose?
#YAOUMA.
The God Ammon knows not me.
#MIERIS.
Did he choose you, he must know you.
#YAOUMA.
Me! Me! A poor handmaiden - Is it then possible - truly?
#MIERIS.
Truly - Yaouma, go.
#YAOUMA.
The God Ammon - the God of Gods -
#MIERIS.
Rheou, what ails you?
#RHEOU.
It was a fresh insult that awaited me -
#MIERIS.
Insult?
#RHEOU.
When I came into the audience chamber I prostrated myself before the Pharaoh. "What would you?" he cried in that hard voice of his. You know 'tis the custom to make no reply, that one may seem half dead with fear before his majesty -
#MIERIS.
Did you not so?
#RHEOU.
I did, but he -
#MIERIS.
Have a care! Is no one there who might overhear you?
#RHEOU.
No one - but he, in place of ordering them to raise me up, in place of bidding me speak - Oh, the dog of an Ethiopian! - he feigned not to see me - for a long while, a long, long while - At length, when he remembered I was there, anger was choking me; he saw it; he declared an evil spirit was in me, and having ridiculed me with his pity, he bade me then withdraw. He forgets that if I wished -
#MIERIS.
Be still! Be still! Know you not that there, beside you, are the Gods who hear you!
#RHEOU.
Oh! the Gods!
#MIERIS.
What mean you?
#RHEOU.
I am the son of a high priest; I know the Gods - The Pharaoh forgets that were I to remind the people of my father's services, were I to arm all those who work for me, and let them loose against him -
#MIERIS.
Rheou! Rheou!
#RHEOU.
Think you they would not obey me? I am son of that high priest, the Pharaoh's friend who wished to replace the Gods of Egypt, by one only God. The court cannot forgive me for that. Little they dream, that were I to declare my father had appeared to me, all those who know me, all the poor folk whose backs are blistered by the tax - gatherer's whip, all who are terrorized by schemes of foreign war - all, all would take my orders as inspired, divine.
#MIERIS.
The fear of the Gods would hold them back.
#RHEOU.
How long - I wonder!
#MIERIS.
I hear them coming for the prayer.
#RHEOU.
Yes. Let us pray - that they may have nothing to reproach me with before I choose my hour.
#MIERIS.
What hour?
#RHEOU.
Could I but realize the work my father dreamed of - and at the same stroke be avenged - avenged for all the humiliations -
#MIERIS.
Be silent - I hear -
#RHEOU.
The sun is not yet down upon the hill. But look - upon the Nile - see, Yaouma! 'tis the galley that bears your betrothed.
#YAOUMA.
'Tis there! 'Tis there! - See - it has stopped - they take the mallet, and drive in the stake. The boat's prow is aground. Now they have prayed - they disembark. Look, there is the strange scribe!
#RHEOU.
A stranger - he - I do not think it.
#YAOUMA.
I thought, from his garments, perhaps -
#RHEOU.
Did you not wait for your son?
#PAKH.
Master, on the road that leads to the Nile, I beheld two dead scarabs -
#RHEOU.
None, then, save the High Priest, may pass till the road be purified.
#PAKH.
I have warned the travellers they must go a long way round.
#RHEOU.
Did you not recognize your son?
#PAKH.
No, he will be among the last to land, perhaps.
#YAOUMA.
But look - look! Behold that man - the stranger who comes this way alone - Pakh! where were they, Pakh - the scarabs?
#PAKH.
Near to the fig tree.
#YAOUMA.
He is about to pass them - Oh! He does not know - Ah! at last, they warn him.
#RHEOU.
He stays.
#YAOUMA.
Near to the fig tree, said you! But he is going on - He moves - he comes - He is past them - Come, mistress, come! Oh Ammon! Ammon!
#RHEOU.
'Tis to our gates he comes - he is here.
#SATNI.
Rheou, I salute you!
#RHEOU.
What do I behold! Satni - 'tis you -
#PAKH.
My son!
#SATNI.
Father!
#PAKH.
'Twas you! - you, who came that way, despite the scarabs?
#SATNI.
It was I.
#PAKH.
You know then some magic words, I do not doubt; but I - I who saw them - I must needs go purify myself before the prayer - to - day is the feast of the Nomination - did you know?
#SATNI.
I knew - and Yaouma?
#PAKH.
She is here - in a little you shall see her.
#RHEOU.
Satni!
#SATNI.
You called me?
#RHEOU.
Yes. Did not you see the two scarabs that lay upon your path?
#SATNI.
I saw them.
#RHEOU.
And you did not stop?
#SATNI.
No.
#RHEOU.
Why?
#SATNI.
I have learned many things in the countries whence I come.
#RHEOU.
You are a priest. Was not your duty to go unto the temple, even before you knelt at your father's feet?
#SATNI.
Never again shall I enter the temple.
#RHEOU.
It is the signal for the prayer.
#RHEOU.
O Isis! Isis! Isis! Three times do I pronounce thy name.
#ALL.
O Isis! Isis! Isis! Three times do I pronounce thy name.
#RHEOU.
O Isis! thou who preservest the grain from the destroying winds, and the bodies of our fathers from the ruinous work of time.
#ALL.
O Isis! thou who preservest the grain from the destroying winds, and the bodies of our fathers from the ruinous work of time.
#RHEOU.
O Isis! preserve us.
#ALL.
O Isis! preserve us.
#RHEOU.
By the three times thy name is spoken.
#ALL.
By the three times thy name is spoken.
#RHEOU.
Both here, and there, and there.
#ALL.
Both here, and there, and there.
#RHEOU.
And to - day, and all days, and throughout the ages, as long as our temples are mirrored in the waters of the Nile.
#ALL.
And to - day, and all days, and throughout the ages, as long as our temples are mirrored in the waters of the Nile.
#RHEOU.
Isis!
#ALL.
Isis!
#RHEOU.
Isis!
#ALL.
Isis!
#RHEOU.
Isis!
#ALL.
Isis!
#RHEOU.
We beseech thee, Ammon! Deign to make known the virgin who will be offered to the Nile. Ammon, deign to make her known!
#ALL.
Deign to make her known.
#RHEOU.
Rise! The God has made his choice.
#RHEOU.
You, alone, did not pray, and stood the while. Wherefore?
#SATNI.
I have come from a land where I learned wisdom.
#RHEOU.
You! - You who were to be priest of Ammon!
#SATNI.
I shall never be priest of Ammon.
#VOICES.
Listen! Listen! - The name! They begin to cry the name!
#RHEOU.
The name! The name!
#SATNI.
At last I find you again, Yaouma. And you wear still the chain of maidenhood. You have waited for me?
#YAOUMA.
Yes, Satni, I have waited for you.
#SATNI.
The memory of you went with me always.
#YAOUMA.
Listen! -
#A WOMAN.
Methinks 'tis Raouit of the next village.
#A MAN.
No! No! 'Tis not that name.
#SATNI.
What matter their cries to you. Have you forgot our promises?
#YAOUMA.
No - Listen! -
#A WOMAN.
'Tis Amterra! 'Tis Amterra!
#ANOTHER.
No! 'Tis Hihourr!
#ANOTHER.
No! Amterra lives the other way.
#ANOTHER.
One can hear nothing clearly now.
#ANOTHER.
They are passing behind the palm grove.
#SATNI.
Answer me - you have ears only for their clamor - I love you, Yaouma.
#A VOICE.
They are coming! They are coming!
#ANOTHER.
Then 'tis Karma, of the next house.
#ANOTHER.
No! 'tis Hene. Ahou, I tell you - or Karma! Karma!
#SATNI.
Have you, then, ceased to love me?
#YAOUMA.
No, no, I love you - Satni - but I seem to hear my name amid the cries -
#SATNI.
Let them cry your name - I will watch over you.
#YAOUMA.
Oh, Satni! If the God have chosen me?
#SATNI.
What God? It is the priests who make him speak.
#A VOICE.
'Tis Yaouma! they come here! Quick, quick, let us do them honor on their coming.
#ANOTHER.
No!
#ANOTHER.
Yes!
#ANOTHER.
'Tis she!
#ANOTHER.
No!
#ANOTHER.
Yes! yes! Yaouma!
#SATNI.
Do not be fooled. The God is but a stone.
#YAOUMA.
I have heard. It is my name - my name!
#A VOICE.
They are coming! -
#ANOTHER.
They are here!
#ANOTHER.
'Tis Yaouma!
#STEWARD.
Master, it is Yaouma.
#RHEOU.
Go, as 'tis custom, let all go forth to meet those who come.
#SATNI.
'Tis you -
#YAOUMA.
'Tis I!
#SATNI.
You may refuse.
#YAOUMA.
And leave Egypt -
#SATNI.
We will leave it together.
#YAOUMA.
'Tis I! Think of it, Satni! The God, out of all my companions, the God has chosen me!
#SATNI.
Do not stay here. Come with me.
#YAOUMA.
Yes - yes - You hear them? It is I!
#SATNI.
You are going to refuse!
#YAOUMA.
You would love me no longer, if I refused.
#SATNI.
But know you not, it is death?
#YAOUMA.
Yes, Satni, it is death!
#SATNI.
You are mine - You are plighted to me - Come - Come!
#YAOUMA.
Satni - Satni - you would not have me refuse?
#SATNI.
I would. I love you.
#YAOUMA.
Refuse to answer the call of the Gods.
#SATNI.
The call of the Gods is death.
#YAOUMA.
The God has chosen me, before all he has preferred me. He has preferred me to those who are fairer, to those who are richer. And I should hide myself!
#SATNI.
It is out of pride then that you would die?
#YAOUMA.
I die to bring the flooding of the Nile - to make fertile all the Egyptian fields. If I answer not to the voices that call me, my name will be a byword wherever the rays of the sun - God fall. Another than I will go clothed in the dazzling robe. Another will hear the shouting of the multitude. Another will be given to the Nile.
#SATNI.
Another will die, and you, you will live, for your own joy and for mine.
#YAOUMA.
For my own shame and for yours.
#SATNI.
Light the world with your beauty. Live, Yaouma, live with me! Bright shall your breast be with the flower of the persea, and your tresses anointed heavy with sweet odor.
#YAOUMA.
The waves of the Nile will be my head - dress. Oh! fair green robe, with flowers yet more fair.
#SATNI.
Yaouma, you loved me - Remember, remember my going away, but two years since, how you did weep when I embarked. You ran by the bank, you followed the boat that bore me. I see you still, the slim form, the swift lank limbs; I can hear still the sound of your little naked feet upon the sand. And when the boat grounded - do you remember? For hours the oarsmen pushed with long poles, singing the while, and you clapping your hands and crying out my name. And when at length we floated, there was laughter and cries of joy - but you, you did stand all on a sudden still, and I knew then that you wept. You climbed to a hillock, and you waved your arms, you grew smaller, smaller, smaller, till we turned by a cluster of palms. Oh, how you promised to wait for me!
#YAOUMA.
Have I not waited?
#SATNI.
We had chosen the place to build our home. Do you remember?
#YAOUMA.
Yes.
#SATNI.
And dreamed of nights when you should sleep with your head upon my breast - And now you seek a grave in the slime of the river.
#YAOUMA.
The slime of the river is holy, the river is holy. The Nile is nine times holy. It makes grow the pasture that feeds our flocks. It drinks the tears of all our eyes.
#SATNI.
Listen, Yaouma, I will reveal the truth to you. The Gods who claim your sacrifice - the Gods are false.
#YAOUMA.
The Gods are true -
#SATNI.
They are powerless.
#YAOUMA.
It is their power that subdues me - it is stronger than love. Until to - day I loved you more than all the living things upon the earth - the breath of your mouth alone gave life to my heart. Even this very day, I dreaded being chosen of the Gods. But now, who has so utterly transformed me if it be not the Gods? You are to me as nothing, now. And I who trembled at a scorpion, who wept at the pricking of a thorn, I am all joy at the thought of dying soon. How could this be if the Gods had not willed it?
#SATNI.
Hear me a little - and I can prove to you -
#YAOUMA.
No words can take away the glory of being chosen by the Gods.
#SATNI.
By the priests.
#YAOUMA.
'Tis the same, the priests are the voice of the Gods.
#SATNI.
'Tis they who say so. The Gods of Egypt exist only because men have invented them.
#YAOUMA.
The peoples from whose lands you come have made you lose your reason. Say that our Gods exist not! Think, Satni!
#SATNI.
Neither the Gods, nor the happy fields, nor the world to come, nor hell.
#YAOUMA.
Ah! Ah! I will prove you mad - you say there is no hell - But we know, we know that it exists, look there! When the sun grows red at evening, is it not because the glow of hell is thrown upon it from below? You have but to open your eyes. The Gods not exist!
#SATNI.
They do not. In the sanctuaries of our temples is nothing save beasts, unclean, absurd, and lifeless images; believe me, Yaouma - I love you - I will not see you die. Your sacrifice is useless. Not because you are offered up will the waters of the Nile rise! Refuse, hide yourself, the waters will still rise. Ah, to lose you for a lie! To lose you - you! How can I convince you? - I know! Yaouma, you saw me cross the dead scarabs on my path. And yet I live! Oh! it angers me to see my words move you not. Your reason, your reason! Awaken your reason -
#YAOUMA.
I am listening to my heart.
#SATNI.
I will save you in spite of you - I will keep you by force -
#YAOUMA.
If you do, I shall hate you -
#SATNI.
What matter I shall have saved you.
#YAOUMA.
And I shall kill myself.
#SATNI.
Will you not understand! The God - bull, the God - hippopotamus, the God - jackal - they are naught but idols!
#YAOUMA.
My father worshipped them.
#SOME MEN.
Yaouma! Yaouma!
#ANOTHER.
Up to the terrace!
#OTHERS.
Up to the terrace! Let her go up to the terrace!
#ANOTHER.
And let her lift her arms to heaven!
#ANOTHER.
Let her show that she will give herself to the Nile.
#SATNI.
Stay! Stay with me! Then together -
#YAOUMA.
He has chosen me from among all others!
#ALL.
Yaouma!
#SATNI.
She has refused! She has refused! And I will take her away.
#ALL.
No! No! To the terrace! The prayer! The prayer!
#RHEOU.
Yaouma, go and pray.
#SATNI.
She has refused!
#MIERIS.
Choose, Yaouma, between our Gods and a man.
#RHEOU.
Between the glory of sacrifice -
#SATNI.
Between falsehood and me, Yaouma -
#YAOUMA.
The God has called me to save my brothers!
#SATNI.
You are going to death!
#YAOUMA.
To life - the real life - the life with the Gods.
#SATNI.
They lie!
#YAOUMA.
Peace!
#SATNI.
In spite of you, I will save you. Hear me, my brothers, I know of better Gods, of Gods who ask for no victims -
#THE PEOPLE.
They are false Gods!
#SATNI.
They are better Gods -
#STEWARD.
Rheou! Rheou! bid him cease!
#RHEOU.
No - let him speak.
#SATNI.
I come to save you from error, to overthrow the idols, to teach you eternal truths -
#RHEOU.
What have you seen?
#STEWARD.
The preparations for the festival continue.
#RHEOU.
At the Temple?
#STEWARD.
At the Temple.
#RHEOU.
For the Feast of Prodigies?
#STEWARD.
For the Feast of Prodigies.
#RHEOU.
And the priests believe they can celebrate it to - morrow?
#STEWARD.
I have seen no reason to doubt of it.
#RHEOU.
Without Yaouma?
#STEWARD.
I do not know.
#RHEOU.
You are mistaken perhaps. Did you go down as far as the Nile?
#STEWARD.
Yes, master.
#RHEOU.
Well?
#STEWARD.
They have finished the decoration of the sacred barge.
#RHEOU.
I do not understand it.
#STEWARD.
Nor I, for I know that a certain number of the soldiers have refused to renew the attempt of yesterday -
#RHEOU.
They have refused?
#STEWARD.
Yes.
#RHEOU.
What did they say?
#STEWARD.
That they were afraid.
#RHEOU.
Of what - of whom?
#STEWARD.
Of Satni.
#RHEOU.
Of Satni?
#STEWARD.
Yes. They say it was he who caused the miracle of yesterday.
#RHEOU.
What - what do they say? Their words - tell me?
#STEWARD.
That it was he -
#RHEOU.
He, Satni? -
#STEWARD.
Yes.
#RHEOU.
Who caused the miracle of yesterday?
#STEWARD.
Yes.
#RHEOU.
The miracle that prevented them from carrying out the order of the High Priest?
#STEWARD.
Yes.
#RHEOU.
The order to come here and seize Yaouma?
#STEWARD.
Yes.
#RHEOU.
So that is what they say?
#STEWARD.
Every one says it.
#RHEOU.
Come, it is time you learned the truth, that you may repeat it all. In the countries whither he went Satni learned many things - great things. Come hither, lend your ear. He declares there be other gods than the gods of Egypt - and more powerful. If you remember, my father and the Pharaoh Amenotep likewise declared this, and would have made these gods known to us. How they were frustrated you know. It seems - for my own part I know not, 'tis Satni says so, ceaselessly, these two months since his return - it seems then, the time is come when these Gods would make them known to us. They have endowed Satni with superhuman power. That I know, and none may doubt it now. Satni is resolved to keep his betrothed, and the Lybian Guards were not deceived, it was he who yesterday called down the thunder and the floods from Heaven upon the soldiers sent here to seize Yaouma.
#STEWARD.
The oldest remember but one such prodigy.
#RHEOU.
What I have told you, tell to all; and this, besides, say to them: each time that any would cross the will of Satni - they who dare the attempt will be scattered, even as the guards were scattered yesterday. Add this, that Satni is guided by the spirit of the dead Pharaoh, that I last night beheld my father's spirit, and that great events will come to pass in Egypt.
#STEWARD.
I shall tell them.
#RHEOU.
Behold, the envoy of the new gods! Leave me to speak with him. Go, repeat my words.
#SATNI.
Before which God do you still bow down?
#RHEOU.
Before you. If you be not a God, you are the spirit of a God.
#SATNI.
I do not understand your words.
#RHEOU.
Who can call down thunderbolts from heaven, unless he be an envoy of the Gods?
#SATNI.
I am no -
#RHEOU.
'Tis well, 'tis well. You would have us blind to your power of working miracles. After yesterday you can hide it no more. Henceforth, Satni, you must no longer confine your teaching to Mieris, to me, to your parents, Yaouma, to a few - henceforth you may speak to all, all ears are opened by this miracle.
#SATNI.
Let us leave that! I pray you rise and tell me rather what has befallen Yaouma.
#RHEOU.
Yaouma! - Did she not at first interpret the thunderclap as sign of the wrath of Ammon against her?
#SATNI.
She believes still in Ammon, then, despite all I have said to her.
#RHEOU.
Happily I undeceived her. I made her understand that 'twas you the elements obeyed, that the thunder that frighted her, was but a sign of your power.
#SATNI.
Why should you lie to her?
#RHEOU.
It was not wholly lying. Besides, it was fortunate I could thus explain the event. Had you but seen her -
#SATNI.
All my efforts of these two months past, in vain!
#RHEOU.
You remember when you left us yesterday. You might have thought that all her superstitions were banished at last. She no longer answered you, she questioned you no more, and at your last words her silence confirmed the belief that at length you had won her away from Ammon. Yet after you were gone, at the moment of entering her hiding place, she was swept with sudden fury as though an evil spirit had entered her, wept, cried and tore her hair -
#SATNI.
What said she?
#RHEOU.
"To the temple! to the temple! I would go to the temple! The God has chosen me! The God awaits me! Egypt will perish!" In short, words of madness. She would have killed herself!
#SATNI.
Killed herself!
#RHEOU.
We had to put constraint on her. And 'twas only when I led her to this terrace, after the thunderbolt, and pointed out the scattered soldiery, that she came to herself, that at length she perceived that your God was the most powerful. "What," she cried, "'tis he, he, my Satni, who shakes the heavens and the earth for me! For me!" she murmured, "for me!" She would have kissed your sandals, offered you a sacrifice, worshipped, adored you. See where she comes, with Mieris! Stay.
#SATNI.
No.
#MIERIS.
Is he there?
#YAOUMA.
No.
#MIERIS.
Leave me.
#MIERIS.
If it be only of wood!
#RHEOU.
Why, Mieris - do you bring flowers to Isis still?
#MIERIS.
It is the last time. Listen, Rheou - We mast ask Satni to heal me. Do not tell me it is not possible; he has healed Ahmarsti.
#RHEOU.
Healed Ahmarsti? MIERIS, Yes. He made her drink a liquid wherein no doubt a good genius was hidden, and the evil spirit that tormented her was driven forth.
#RHEOU.
Is't possible?
#MIERIS.
Every one saw it. And Kitoui -
#RHEOU.
Well?
#MIERIS.
Kitoui, the cripple, went this morning to draw water from the Nile, before all her neighbors who marvelled and cried with joy. And she had merely touched the hem of his garment, even without his knowing it. He has healed the child of Riti, too, he knows gods more powerful than ours - younger gods, perhaps, our gods are so old - If it were not so, how could he have walked unscathed the road where the scarabs lay, that day when he came home? Since then, men have seen him do a thousand forbidden things, have seen him defy our gods by disrespect. Without the protection of a higher power, how could he escape the chastisement whereof another had died? Who are his gods? Rheou, he must make them known to you.
#RHEOU.
He refuses.
#MIERIS.
For what reason?
#RHEOU.
The reason he gives is absurd - he says there are no gods -
#MIERIS.
No gods! no gods! - he is mocking you.
#RHEOU.
He is bound to secrecy, perhaps.
#MIERIS.
Rheou, know you that this Ahmarsti - these two years now, on the day of Prodigies, have I heard her at my side howling prayers at the goddess that were never answered.
#RHEOU.
I know. Satni declares he could have healed all whom the goddess has relieved.
#MIERIS.
He relieves even those women whom she abandons - He must teach you the words that work these miracles.
#RHEOU.
He refuses.
#MIERIS.
Force him!
#RHEOU.
He says there are none.
#MIERIS.
Threaten him with death - he will speak.
#RHEOU.
No.
#MIERIS.
But you do not understand me! - he has healed Ahmarsti, he has healed Kitoui, wherefore should he not heal me?
#RHEOU.
Ah! Mieris, Mieris, think you I waited for your prayer, to ask him that?
#MIERIS.
Well - Well - ?
#RHEOU.
I could gain nothing but these words from him: "Could I overcome the evil Mieris suffers from, even now should she rejoice in the splendor of day."
#MIERIS.
Nothing is impossible to the gods, even to ours; how much more then to his! - He did not yield to your prayers! - Insist, order, threaten! Force him to speak. You have the right to command him. He is but the son of a potter after all. Let him be whipped till he yield. Do anything, have him whipped to the point of death - or better, offer him fields, the hill of date - trees that is ours; offer him our flocks, and my jewels and precious stones - tell him we know him for a living god - but I would be healed. I would be healed! I would see! See! Ah! you know not the worth of the light, you whose eyes are filled with it! You cannot picture my misery, you who suffer it not! You grieve for me, I doubt not, but you think you have done enough, having given me pity! - No, no, I am wrong - I am unjust. But forgive me; this thought that I might be healed has made me mad. Rheou! - Think, Rheou, what it means to be blind, to have been so always, and to know that beside one are those who see - who see! - The humblest of our shepherds, the most wretched of the women at our looms, I envy them. And when, at times, I hear them complain, I curb myself lest I should strike them, wretches that know not their good fortune. I feel that all you, you who see, should never cease from songs of joy, and hymns of thanksgiving to the gods - I speak of sight! Think, Rheou, I have not even a clear idea of what it means "to see." To recognize without touch, to know without need to listen. To perceive the sun another way than by the heat of its rays! - They say the flowers are so beautiful! - I would see you, my well - beloved. Oh! the day when I shall see your eyes! - I would see, that you may show me some likeness of the little child we lost. You shall point out, among the rest, those that are most like to him. This misery - O my beloved! - I do not often speak of it - but I suffer it! I suffer it! They have taken from me the hope that our gods will heal me, if they give me nothing in its place, know you what I shall do? - I shall go away, alone, one night, touching the walls, and the trees - and the trees, with my arms outstretched; I shall go down as far as the Nile and there, gently, I shall glide away to death.
#RHEOU.
Peace, O my best beloved!
#MIERIS.
I hear him - he comes. I leave you with him! Lead him to my door - love me - save me!
#NOURM.
Yes! Thou who art mighty! - Yes! Yes! Make me rich - I have had blows of the stick so long! I would be rich to be able to give them in my turn! - You have but to speak the magic words.
#SATNI.
Leave me! I am no magician.
#SOKITI.
I, I do not ask for money. Listen not to him; he is bad. I, I only ask that you make Khames die; he has taken from me the girl I would have wed. Grant it, I implore you - I implore you! - My life is gone with her - make him die, I pray you.
#SATNI.
Leave me!
#SOKITI.
Hear me.
#BITIOU.
Begone! Begone! He would not hear you! Listen - listen - you see I made him go. All - all whom you will, I shall beat them for you. Listen - if you could make me tall like you, and steady on my legs - See - here - I have hidden away, safe, three gold rings, that I stole a while since; I will give them you.
#SATNI.
Go, take them to the high priest -
#BITIOU.
I have given four to him already.
#RHEOU.
What do they want of you?
#SATNI.
They came here, following me. They believe me gifted with supernatural power, and crave miracles of me, as though I were a God, or a juggler. I am neither, and I work no miracles.
#RHEOU.
None the less you have worked two miracles.
#SATNI.
Not one.
#RHEOU.
And you will work yet one more.
#SATNI.
Never. I came hither not to perform miracles, but to prevent them.
#RHEOU.
You will heal Mieris.
#SATNI.
No one can heal her, nor I, nor any other.
#RHEOU.
Give her a little hope.
#SATNI.
How can I?
#RHEOU.
Tell her you will invoke your God, and that some day perhaps -
#SATNI.
I have no God. If there be a god, he is so great, so far from as, so utterly beyond our comprehension, that for us it is as though he did not exist. To believe that one of our actions, to believe that a prayer could act upon the will of God, is to belittle him, to deny him. He is himself incapable of a miracle; it would be to belie himself. Could he improve his work, he would not then have created it perfect from the first. He could not do it.
#RHEOU.
Our ancient gods at least permitted hope.
#SATNI.
Keep them.
#RHEOU.
In the heart of Mieris, you have destroyed them.
#SATNI.
Do you regret it?
#RHEOU.
Not yet.
#SATNI.
What would you say?
#RHEOU.
Even if it be true that sight will never be given her, do not tell her so. Far better promise that she will be healed.
#SATNI.
And to all the others, must I promise healing too? Because in a house I relieved a child, whose illness sprang from a cause I could remove; because a woman, ill in imagination, did cure herself by touching my garment's hem; must I then descend to play the part of sorcerer? I had behind me there, but now, a rabble of the wretched imploring me, believing me all powerful, begging for them and theirs unrealizable miracles. Should I then cheat them too, all those poor wretches, promising what I know I cannot give? I came hither to make an end of lies, not to replace them with others.
#RHEOU.
Ah! You would not lie. You would not lie to the wretched. You would not lie to Mieris. You would lie to no one, is it so?
#SATNI.
To no one.
#RHEOU.
We shall see! Yaouma! - Let them send Yaouma! Not to her either, then? Good; if you speak the truth to her, if you deny that you have supernatural power, if you force her to believe you had no hand in the miracle that saved her yesterday, she will give herself to the priests, or she will kill herself! What will you do?
#RHEOU.
He is there!
#STEWARD.
In person.
#RHEOU.
'Tis an order of the Pharaoh then?
#STEWARD.
Yes.
#RHEOU.
I am troubled.
#SATNI.
What is it ails you? Why are you so sad?
#YAOUMA.
You will want nothing more of me, now that you are a god.
#SATNI.
Be not afraid: I am not a god.
#YAOUMA.
Almost. 'Tis a daughter of the Pharaoh you will marry now.
#SATNI.
I will marry you.
#YAOUMA.
You will swear to.
#SATNI.
Yes.
#YAOUMA.
By Ammon? - By your god?
#SATNI.
My god is not concerned with us.
#YAOUMA.
Who then is concerned with us?
#SATNI.
No one.
#YAOUMA.
You do not want to tell me. You treat me as a child - mocking me.
#SATNI.
Why do you need an oath? I love you, and you shall be my wife.
#YAOUMA.
I shall be your wife! - I, little Yaouma, I shall be wife to a man whom the heavens obey! - When I think that you loosed the thunder for my sake -
#SATNI.
No, vain child, I did not loose the thunder.
#YAOUMA.
Yes, yes, yes - I understand. You want no one to know that you have found the book of Thoth - fear not, I know how to hold my peace. Tell me, how did you find it?
#SATNI.
I have not found the book of magic spells; besides, it would have profited me nothing.
#YAOUMA.
Sit - you would not sit? They say 'tis shut up in three caskets, hidden at the bottom of the sea.
#SATNI.
I tell you again I neither sought, nor found it.
#YAOUMA.
What do you do then, to strike fire from heaven?
#SATNI.
I did not strike fire from heaven.
#YAOUMA.
Oh! I do not love you now! - Yes, yes, yes, I love you! So it pleased you then, when you were going away in the galley, to see me run barefoot on the bank - ?
#SATNI.
Yes.
#YAOUMA.
But speak! speak! You wanted to weep? No? You said you did. For my part I know not, then, I could see nothing. But the day of your return, when you learned I was chosen for the sacrifice, then, then I saw your eyes - You love me - You said to me you would prevent me going to the Nile. I believed you not - you remember - Why! even yesterday, yes, yesterday again, in spite of all your words, I was resolved to escape and go to the temple. It needed this proof of your power! - tell me, it was you who shook the heavens and the earth for me.
#SATNI.
No.
#YAOUMA.
Again! - You must think but little of me, to believe I should reveal what you bade me keep secret. It was you, was it not?
#SATNI.
No, no, no! a thousand times no!
#YAOUMA.
It was your gods then, your gods whom I know not.
#SATNI.
No.
#YAOUMA.
Who was it then?
#SATNI.
No one.
#YAOUMA.
No one! You possess no power that other men have not?
#SATNI.
No.
#YAOUMA.
You seem as one speaking truth.
#SATNI.
I speak the truth.
#YAOUMA.
'Tis a pity!
#SATNI.
Why?
#YAOUMA.
It would have been more beautiful. To go in the barge, on the Nile, that too had been more beautiful.
#RHEOU.
Go in, Yaouma. Conduct her to her mistress - and make known to her what has passed. Satni, terrible news has come to me: the Pharaoh, finding the people's enmity increase against him, has taken fright, and striking first, the blow has fallen on me. My goods are confiscated. I am sent to exile. The palace Chamberlain, but now, brought me the order to quit my house to - day, and deliver myself to the army leaving for Ethiopia.
#SATNI.
Can you do nothing against this order?
#RHEOU.
Yes. I can kill those who gave it.
#SATNI.
Kill!
#RHEOU.
Listen. I bring you the means to win the triumph of your ideas, and at the same time serve my cause. I can arm all the dwellers on my lands. We two must lead them. They will follow you, knowing you all powerful. Nay, hear me - wait. The soldiers, who fear you, will not dare resist us, we shall kill the high priest, the Pharaoh if need be - we shall be masters of Egypt.
#SATNI.
I would not kill.
#RHEOU.
So be it. Enough that you declare yourself ready to repeat the miracle of yesterday.
#SATNI.
I would not lie.
#RHEOU.
If you would neither kill nor lie, you will never succeed in governing men.
#SATNI.
I would fight the priests of Ammon, not imitate them.
#RHEOU.
You will never triumph without doing so. Profit by events. Do not deny the power they believe to be yours. Men will not follow you, if you speak only to their reason. You are above the crowd by your learning; that gives you rights. You would lead them to the summits; to get there, one must blindfold those who suffer from dizziness.
#SATNI.
I refuse.
#RHEOU.
One would think you were afraid of victory!
#SATNI.
Rheou, 'tis not the victory of my ideas you seek, 'tis your own vengeance, your own ambition.
#RHEOU.
They wish to rush the people of Egypt into an unjust and useless war. They hesitate; they feel the people lacking zest, that is why they have delayed the going of the army till the feast of Prodigies. To - morrow they will make the goddess speak, and all those poor creatures will be led away. You can save thousands of lives by sacrificing a few.
#SATNI.
I refuse. The truth will prevail without help from cruelty or falsehood.
#RHEOU.
Never. The crowd is not a woman to be won by loud wooing, but one who must be taken by force, whom you must dominate before you can persuade.
#SATNI.
Say no more, Rheou, I refuse.
#RHEOU.
Blind! Fool! Coward!
#MIERIS.
Rheou! - where are you? where are you? It is true, this that I hear? - Exile - Misery?
#RHEOU.
It is true.
#MIERIS.
Courage - As for me, a palace or a cottage - I know not the one from the other.
#RHEOU.
Satni, can you still refuse?
#SATNI.
You torture me! No, I will not be credited with power that is not mine; to stir men up against their fellows - I would not kill, I tell you.
#MIERIS.
I understand you, Satni - it is wrong to kill! - But look once more upon me - I am poor now, I am going away, will you not consent to heal me?
#SATNI.
Mieris - Could I have healed you, would it not be done already?
#MIERIS.
You can do it! I know you can do it! Work a miracle. miracle! Show that your god is more powerful than our gods.
#A MAN.
Heal us!
#SATNI.
I am not able.
#ANOTHER.
Work a miracle.
#SATNI.
There are no miracles!
#A MAN.
Then your gods are less mighty than ours.
#SATNI.
Yours do not exist.
#THE PEOPLE.
Oh!
#A MAN.
Why do you lead us away from our gods, if you have no others to give us?
#ANOTHER.
You shall not insult our gods!
#ANOTHER.
We will hand you over to the priests lest the gods smite us for hearing you!
#ANOTHER.
Ammon will chastise us!
#SATNI.
No.
#A MAN.
Isis will abandon us!
#SATNI.
It will not make you more wretched.
#ANOTHER.
Then show us you are stronger than our gods. miracle!
#RHEOU.
He is stronger than our gods! } miracle or I die! }
#SATNI.
You demand it! You demand a miracle. Well, then, you shall have one, I will do this, but in the presence of all! Go! go! go throughout the domains - bring hither those you find bowed on the earth, or hung to poles for drawing water. Go you others, summon the slaves, the piteous workers - call hither the drawers of stones, bid them drop the ropes that flay their shoulders, bid them come.
#MIERIS.
What would you do?
#SATNI.
Convince them.
#MIERIS.
Now of a sudden, brutally?
#SATNI.
Brutally.
#RHEOU.
Do you believe them ready?
#SATNI.
You are afraid.
#RHEOU.
Day comes not suddenly on night, between them is the dawn.
#SATNI.
I would have day, broad daylight - Now, at once, for all! 'Tis a crime to promise them reward for their suffering. How do we know that they will ever be paid?
#RHEOU.
They are so miserable -
#SATNI.
The truth - is the truth good only for the rich? Will you add that injustice to all the others? Behold them! Yes, behold them, the victims, behold the wretched! I know you all. You, you are shepherd, you are worse nourished than your flocks, and your beasts, at least, are not given blows. They do not beat the cows nor the sheep. You, you sow and you reap; beneath the sun, tortured by flies, you gather abundant crops. You sleep in a hole. Others eat the corn you made grow, and sleep on precious stuffs. You, you are forever drawing water from the Nile; betwixt you and the ox they harness to another machine, there is no difference, and yet you are a man. You, you are one of those who drag great stones, to build the monuments of pride. You are a digger in the tombs, you live a month or more without sight of day. To glorify the death of others, you give your life. You are a trainer of lions for war; your father was eaten - they would have wept had the lion died - How can it be that you accept all this, when you see beside you happiness without work, and abundance without effort? I will tell you. 'Tis because, in the name of the god Ammon - Ra, they have said to you: "Have patience, this injustice will last but a life - time." Fools! nothing but that! All the time you are on earth, suffer, produce for others. Content ye with hunger, you who produce food. Content ye with worse usage than the swine, you who have guard of them. Content ye to sleep in the open, you who build palaces and temples. Content ye with all miseries, you carvers of gold, and setters of precious stones. Look without envy, without anger, on the welfare of those who do nothing, all this will last only the whole of your lives! After, in another world, you shall have the fulness of all the crops, and the joy of all the pleasures. Well, they lied to you: there is no island of souls, there are no happy fields, there is no life of atonement after this. They have set up these gods for your servile adoration; they have counselled you: "Bow down, these gods will avenge you." They have said: "Prostrate yourselves, these gods are just." They have said: "Throw yourselves to earth, these gods are good." They have declared them all powerful; shut them in sanctuaries of awful gloom, whence you are shown them once a year, to keep alive your terror of the Gods; and last, they have made you believe no man may touch these images and live. I tell you they lied - I will show you they lied to you. Behold the most mighty Ammon - the father of the gods - I spit my hate at him! Thou art but an idol; I curse thee for evil men have done in thy name! I curse thee in the name of all the enslaved, in the name of all those they have cheated with hopes of an avenging life; in the name of all who for thousands of years have groaned and wept; suffered insult, outrage, blows, death, without thought of revolt, because promises made in thy name had soothed their rage to sleep! And I curse thee for the sorrow that now fills me, and for the ills that must come even of thy going! Die! You others do as I. Go, climb their pedestals! Lay hold of their hands, they are lifeless! Strike, 'tis but an image! Spit in their faces, they are senseless! Strike! Ruin! All this is nothing but hardened mud!
#RHEOU.
Now, let them open my granaries, that each may help himself; and take from my flocks to sate you all.
#BITIOU.
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
#DELETHI.
Mistress, they would take Isis!
#MIERIS.
Let me keep her -
#RHEOU.
No, Mieris.
#MIERIS.
Take her - Stay!
#RHEOU.
Wherefore?
#MIERIS.
Can you part from her, and feel nothing? Even now, Satni, in denouncing the gods to the fury of the crowd, you did not say everything - You, who can see her, behold this little image, think how many tears were shed before her, in the years since she was made. She has been ours for generations. Call up the countless crowds of those who have fixed their anxious looks upon her eyes, dead even as mine are. It is for all the anguish she has looked upon, we must respect her. Tears make holy. I doubt not you are right: she must be broken too - but not without farewell. Where is she, Yaouma? I would say my last prayer to her. Oh, them who didst not heal, but didst console me; O thou who hast heard so many entreaties and thanksgivings, thou art but clay! Yet men have given thee life; thy life was not in thee, it was in them - and the proof is that thou diest, now they have taken their soul from thee. I give thee over to those who would break thee, but I revere thee, I salute thee, and I thank thee for all the hope thou hast given me; and I thank thee in the name of all the sorrows that thou hast sent to sleep. Take her hence - let them destroy her with respect.
#SATNI.
There is nothing so sad or so great as the death of a god! Behold, Yaouma! The gods are dead and I live - behold them! Do you believe me - do you believe me?
#KIRJIPA.
Son.
#SATNI.
Mother.
#KIRJIPA.
And so you do not believe that when the moon grows little by little less, 'tis because it is eaten by a pig?
#SATNI.
No, mother.
#KIRJIPA.
Then what beast eats it?
#SATNI.
None.
#KIRJIPA.
You have ideas that are not reasonable. What makes me marvel, is that your father seems to understand them. I must haste to make the bread, that he find it when he returns.
#SATNI.
Here comes the messenger from Rheou.
#KIRJIPA.
The messenger of him who kills the gods.
#SATNI.
We do not kill what has no life.
#KIRJIPA.
I would not see him.
#SATNI.
Why?
#KIRJIPA.
Brrr! - To - morrow I shall burn some sacred herbs here.
#STEWARD.
Satni, I have been seeking you. Since this morning unhappy things have come to pass -
#SATNI.
Yaouma is not in danger, or Mieris, of Rheou?
#STEWARD.
No. All three are safe in the palace.
#SATNI.
Well?
#STEWARD.
You remember the order the master gave me this morning, after the death of the gods?
#SATNI.
No.
#STEWARD.
Yes, to open his granaries to all.
#SATNI.
Yes, yes, well?
#STEWARD.
When I went to obey, to my amazement I beheld the men stand by the door in earnest converse, then without entering they withdrew. This is what happened. They went to the house of the neighboring master, roused his servants and laborers, and strove to force them to overthrow the statues of his gods, and rob him of his corn. They killed his steward. Soldiers came - Nepk had been killed, others too. Then all were scattered. The master sent me to bid you reason with those whom you might find. Look! there are some who have taken refuge here! Enter - come - Satni would speak with you!
#SATNI.
Whither go you?
#STEWARD.
Whither go you? Whence come you?
#BITIOU.
I followed the others -
#STEWARD.
Whence come you?
#BITIOU.
I came back with the others, Sokiti and Nourm.
#SATNI.
Where are they?
#BITIOU.
There.
#STEWARD.
Bid them enter.
#SATNI.
Sokiti, Nourm, come.
#STEWARD.
Why do you hide yourselves?
#NOURM.
We do not hide from you, but from the Lybian soldiers.
#SATNI.
Why do you fear them?
#SOKITI.
Because they are chasing us.
#STEWARD.
And why are they chasing you?
#SATNI.
Bitiou, answer.
#BITIOU.
Bitiou knows not.
#STEWARD.
You know it, you.
#NOURM.
They took us for the others.
#SATNI.
What others?
#NOURM.
Perhaps they took us for the servants of the neighboring master.
#STEWARD.
They have done mischief, then, the servants of the neighboring master? Answer - you!
#NOURM.
They did that at his house, that you made us do at yours.
#STEWARD.
The priests heard of it?
#NOURM.
No, but the master sent for the soldiers.
#SATNI.
Only for that!
#NOURM.
I know not.
#SATNI.
Had there been nothing else, he would not have sent for the Lybian soldiers. He knew our projects - he is with us. There is something else, eh! -
#SOKITI.
Yes.
#SATNI.
What?
#SOKITI.
Tell.
#NOURM.
They were angered with the master. He was bad, the master.
#STEWARD.
He is hard, but he gives much to those who have nothing.
#SOKITI.
He gave here, that he might receive hereafter.
#NOURM.
After his death.
#SATNI.
And now he gives no more?
#NOURM.
Nothing.
#SATNI.
Ah!
#BITIOU.
Nothing - and so, all stomachs empty, very much.
#NOURM.
He gives only blows of the stick now.
#SOKITI.
One cannot live on that alone.
#NOURM.
And so his servants asked him for corn?
#BITIOU.
No good - only blows of the stick.
#STEWARD.
They took the corn that was refused them?
#BITIOU.
Hunger!
#SATNI.
You knew they were going to do that?
#SOKITI.
Yes.
#SATNI.
It was for that you went to join them?
#NOURM.
Yes.
#STEWARD.
Why?
#NOURM.
It came into our heads like this: better not take corn from the good master, but take it from the bad one.
#SOKITI.
Justice!
#BITIOU.
You content. You still got all your corn.
#NOURM.
You, we like you.
#BITIOU.
You - good! We - good!
#SOKITI.
See!
#BITIOU.
Wait: neighboring master bad. They bad. Heh? - Heh? - you see - Heh? Heh? And the steward he bad, he dead - well done!
#SATNI.
What would he say?
#SOKITI.
They took the steward and then -
#NOURM.
They gave him back all the blows of the stick they had had from him.
#SATNI.
You saw that?
#NOURM.
Yes.
#SOKITI.
Me too, me too -
#BITIOU.
I laugh very much - because - because - Steward, very big, strong, and then when very much beaten, fell down - fell on the ground - like me! like me! He, big, he fell down just the same - he like Bitiou - I very glad.
#STEWARD.
What they have done is bad.
#NOURM.
No. The steward had been happy all his life. He was old.
#SOKITI.
He was old. So 'tis not bad to have killed him - He had finished - He was fat - and he had lost his appetite -
#NOURM.
Only just, he should leave his place to another.
#SATNI.
We must not kill.
#SOKITI.
What does that mean?
#NOURM.
Yes, kill a good one, that is bad. But kill a bad one, that is good.
#SATNI.
And if you are mistaken?
#SOKITI.
No, he is bad, I kill him.
#SATNI.
What if he be not bad, and you think him so?
#SOKITI.
If he were not bad, I should not think it.
#STEWARD.
You do not understand - Listen, I am not bad, am I?
#SOKITI.
But we do not want to kill you.
#STEWARD.
Let me speak. You remember Kob the black. He thought me bad.
#NOURM.
Yes.
#STEWARD.
And if he had killed me?
#SOKITI.
We are not blacks -
#STEWARD.
You do not understand me. Consider. He thought me bad. I am not bad. What you were saying, would justify him if he had killed me.
#SOKITI.
I understand. You say: If the slave had killed me - no, it is not that.
#SATNI.
Human life must be respected.
#STEWARD.
What are you carrying there?
#NOURM.
Nothing, 'tis mine -
#BITIOU.
That is a necklace - show.
#NOURM.
Yes, a necklace.
#SATNI.
From whom did you take it?
#NOURM.
From the neighboring master.
#SATNI.
Do you think you did well?
#NOURM.
Why - yes.
#SATNI.
You are wrong.
#NOURM.
Be not afraid, no one saw me.
#SATNI.
It is wrong.
#NOURM.
No. What can wrong me, is wrong. Since no one saw me, they will not punish me. So it is not wrong.
#SATNI.
Wrong not to you, but to the neighboring master.
#NOURM.
He has many others.
#SOKITI.
Has had them for years, he has! Nourm never had one. Not just. I, I never had, this -
#SATNI.
You have taken this bracelet!
#SOKITI.
It is mine.
#SATNI.
We are content.
#NOURM.
And Bitiou -
#SATNI AND SOKITI.
Yes, Bitiou -
#NOURM.
He took the best thing.
#STEWARD.
What? woman.
#STEWARD.
By force?
#BITIOU.
No woman would come willingly with Bitiou.
#SOKITI.
But she escaped from him.
#BITIOU.
Yes.
#SATNI.
You must give back the necklace and this bracelet to the neighboring master.
#NOURM.
Give back, but he has others!
#SATNI.
You cannot make yourself the judge of that. If you were selling perfumes, for instance, would you think it natural that a man should come and take them from you, because you had plenty and he had none?
#NOURM.
You tell me hard things.
#SATNI.
You must give back this bracelet, Sokiti.
#SOKITI.
Yes, master.
#SATNI.
And you the necklace.
#NOURM.
Yes, master.
#SATNI.
See, you are sad. You perceive that you did wrong.
#SOKITI.
Yes, we did wrong -
#SATNI.
Ah!
#SOKITI.
We did wrong to tell you what we did, because you are not pleased.
#SATNI.
'Tis for your sake I am grieved.
#NOURM.
Then you have not told the truth; there is a hell, and there is an island of souls.
#SATNI.
No.
#NOURM.
If the gods do not punish, and men, not having seen, do not punish either - Well - I shall give it back.
#SOKITI.
I, I shall not give back. Not stolen. Another, a servant of the neighboring master stole the bracelet, not I!
#STEWARD.
Yet 'tis you who have it.
#SOKITI.
I took it from the other.
#STEWARD.
He let you do it?
#SOKITI.
Yes. Could not help it, he was wounded.
#SATNI.
You should have succored him.
#SOKITI.
I did not know him.
#SATNI.
He was a man like you.
#SOKITI.
There are plenty of them.
#SATNI.
We must do good to others.
#SOKITI.
What good will that do to me?
#SATNI.
You will be content with yourself.
#SOKITI.
I would rather have the bracelet -
#SATNI.
It is only by refraining from doing one another harm that mankind may hope to gain happiness; nay more, only by lending one another aid. Do you understand?
#SOKITI.
Yes.
#SATNI.
And you, and you -
#NOURM AND BITIOU.
Yes, yes.
#STEWARD.
Repeat it then.
#SOKITI.
If men did not steal bracelets -
#STEWARD.
Well?
#SOKITI.
Bracelets -
#SATNI.
And you?
#NOURM.
He was wrong to take the bracelet.
#SATNI.
Why?
#NOURM.
Because you are not pleased.
#SATNI.
No, no, 'tis not for that.
#SOKITI.
I was not wrong -
#NOURM.
Yes! wait! I understand - If you steal, another may steal from you. Likewise if you kill -
#SATNI.
Right. And why is it necessary to be good?
#NOURM.
Wait If you do good to one whom you know not, another who knows you not, may do good to you.
#STEWARD.
Ah! - Do you understand, Sokiti?
#SOKITI.
I think so.
#SATNI.
Explain.
#SOKITI.
You do not want us to steal bracelets from you -
#SATNI.
I do not want you to steal from any one - Do you understand?
#SOKITI.
No.
#STEWARD.
And you? have a pain in my head -
#STEWARD.
Look at them -
#SATNI.
The tree that was bent from its birth, not in one day can you make it straight?
#STEWARD.
We must leave it what it is, or tear it down?
#SATNI.
No, we must seek patiently to straighten it. And above all we must keep straight those that are young.
#STEWARD.
What cries are those?
#SATNI.
Women in distress.
#YAOUMA.
Come, mistress - come - We are at the house of the potter, the father of Satni - Satni help - quick! quick! Run! your father, Satni!
#SATNI.
Mieris, Yaouma, how come you here?
#YAOUMA.
They will tell you - go!
#MIERIS.
Fly to the rescue, he is wounded! - I have sent to the palace for those who drive out the evil spirits.
#YAOUMA.
We were set upon by some men.
#MIERIS.
He defended us - But they will kill him - go!
#MIERIS.
Yaouma! He is wounded! Wounded in saving us -
#YAOUMA.
Alas!
#MIERIS.
Who is there?
#NOURM.
I, mistress.
#MIERIS.
Nourm! Run to the palace, bid them send hither those who drive forth the evil spirits -
#YAOUMA.
Alas! mistress, I do fear - already he has fallen - struck to earth.
#MIERIS.
They will save him, they will bear him hither -
#YAOUMA.
Will they bear him hither alive?
#MIERIS.
Run! - You hear! - Run to the palace, bid those who assist at the last hour be ready to come. If he have died defending us, the same honors shall be paid him as though ourselves were dead! Go! Now, Yaouma, lead me out upon the road to the Nile.
#YAOUMA.
Mistress, you seek to die? Many then must be your sorrows!
#MIERIS.
Alas! Alas! Why did you discover my flight? Why did you seek me, find me, and bring me back -
#YAOUMA.
Had I not guessed your purpose?
#MIERIS.
What have I left to live for?
#YAOUMA.
You have lived all these years in spite of your affliction, what is there that is changed?
#MIERIS.
What is there that is changed! You ask me what is changed! Until now I lived in the hope of a miracle.
#YAOUMA.
Perhaps it would never have come.
#MIERIS.
Even at my last hour I should have still looked for it.
#YAOUMA.
Then you would have died believing in a lie - if what they say be true.
#MIERIS.
What matter, I had smiled as I died, thinking death but the journey to a land where my lost child was waiting for me. The death of a child! No mother ever can believe, at heart, in that. It is too unjust - too cruel to be possible. One says to oneself: it is but a separation! Oh! Satni, thy doctrines may be the truth. But they declare this separation eternal; they make the death of our loved ones final, irreparable, horrible, therefore I foretell thee this: Women will never believe them! What is there that is changed? - Yesterday, children came playing close to us. You know how their cries and laughter made me glad - the voice of one of them was like the voice of mine. I made him come, I put out my hand, in the old way. I felt, at the old height, tossed hair, and the warmth of a living body. And I did not weep, but my voice spoke in my heart and said: "Little child, thy years are as many as his, whom she - who - loves - the - silence took from me. But in Amenti, where he is, in the island of souls, he is happier than thou, for he is safe from all the ills that threaten thee. He is happier than thou. He lives beneath a sun of gold, amid flowers of strange beauty, and perfumed baths refresh him. And when she - who - loves - the - silence takes me in my turn, I shall see him, I shall see him for the first time - and I shall fondle him as I fondle thee, and none, then, may put us asunder. Go, little child, the happy ones are not on this side of the earth!" Now have I lost the hope of a better life before death, and the hope of a better life beyond as well. If you took both crutches from a cripple, he would fall. Only this twofold hope sustained me. They have taken it from me. And so, it is the end, it is the end - 'tis as though I were fallen from a height, I am broken, I have no strength left to bear with life: I tell you, it is the end, it is the end!
#YAOUMA.
Mistress, they speak not the truth!
#MIERIS.
Our gods, did they exist, would already have taken vengeance.
#YAOUMA.
Before the outrage, already, they had taken vengeance on you.
#MIERIS.
Good Yaouma, you would give me back my faith, you who could not keep your own.
#YAOUMA.
Mistress, I lied to you; nothing is destroyed in me.
#MIERIS.
You refuse to give yourself in sacrifice! - Oh, you are right....
#YAOUMA.
I do not refuse.
#MIERIS.
You do not?
#YAOUMA.
No. Know you how I learned, a while ago, that you were gone?
#MIERIS.
How?
#YAOUMA.
I, too, was seeking to escape.
#MIERIS.
You?
#YAOUMA.
To go to the temple, to place myself in hands of the priests, to give to Ammon the victim he has chosen.
#MIERIS.
Do you believe in all these fables still?
#YAOUMA.
Mistress, I have seen Isis.
#MIERIS.
Has one of her images been spared then?
#YAOUMA.
It was not an image that I saw. It was Isis herself, the goddess - I have seen her.
#MIERIS.
You - you have seen - what is it? I know not what you say - to see - that word has no clear sense for me.
#YAOUMA.
She has spoken to me -
#MIERIS.
You have heard her voice -
#YAOUMA.
I have heard her voice.
#MIERIS.
How! How! - You were sleeping - 'twas in a dream -
#YAOUMA.
I did not sleep. I did not dream. I saw her. I heard her. I was alone, and I wept. A great sound filled me with terror. A great light blinded me. Perfumes unknown ravished my senses. And I beheld the goddess, more beauteous than a queen. Then all was gone -
#MIERIS.
But her voice -
#YAOUMA.
The next day she came again, she spoke to me, she called me by name and said to me: "Egypt will be saved by thee."
#MIERIS.
Why did you not speak of it?
#YAOUMA.
I feared they would not believe me.
#MIERIS.
Oh, Yaouma, how I envy you! If you but knew the ill they have done me. They have half killed me, killing all the legends and all the memories that were mine. They made me blush at my simplicity. I felt shamed to have been so easily fooled by such gross make - believes. And now, what have I gained by this revelation? My soul is a house after the burning, black, ruined, empty. Nothing is left but ruins, ruins one might laugh at. I am parched with thirst, I hunger, I tremble with cold. They have made my soul blind, too. I cry out for help, for consolation. Oh! for a lie, some other lie, to replace the one they have taken away from me!
#YAOUMA.
Why ask a lie? Why not forget what they have said. Why not recall what you learned at your mother's knee - Why not, yourself, set up in your heart again, those images which they threw down -
#MIERIS.
Yes! Yes! I will do it. They have awakened my reason, and killed my faith. I shall kill my reason, to revive our gods. Though I no longer believe, I shall do the actions of believers - and, if my god be false, I shall believe so firmly in him that I shall make him true! - Yes, the lowest, the most senseless superstitions, I venerate them, I exalt - I glory in them! The ugliest, the most deformed, the most unreal of our gods, I adore them, and I bow down before their impossibility. Oh, I stifle in their petty narrow world, sad as a forest without birds! Air! Air! Singing! The sound of wings! Things that fly!
#YAOUMA.
Let me be sacrificed!
#MIERIS.
Let me have a reason for living!
#YAOUMA.
I would give my life to the gods who gave me birth!
#MIERIS.
I would believe that there is some one above men!
#YAOUMA.
Some one who watches over us!
#MIERIS.
Who will console as with his justice!
#YAOUMA.
Some one to cry our sorrows to!
#MIERIS.
Yes, some one to pray to, and to thank!
#YAOUMA.
Oh! the pity of it, to feel we were abandoned!
#MIERIS.
I would not be abandoned!
#YAOUMA.
We are not! Gods! Gods!
#MIERIS.
Gods! We need gods! There are too many sorrows, it is not possible this earth should groan as it groans beneath a pitiless heaven - Ammon, reveal thyself.
#YAOUMA.
Isis, show thyself! Have pity! Mistress, I think she is going to appear to me again! - Isis! - mistress - do you hear -
#MIERIS.
I hear nothing.
#YAOUMA.
Singing - the sound of harps - 'tis she -
#MIERIS.
I do not hear -
#YAOUMA.
She speaks! Yes - goddess!
#MIERIS.
Do you see her?
#YAOUMA.
I see her! She is bending down above us -
#MIERIS.
O goddess! -
#YAOUMA.
She is gone - Mistress, you could not see her, but did you hear the sound of her feet?
#MIERIS.
Yes, I believe I heard it - I believe and I am comforted.
#YAOUMA.
I am happy! To the temple! She beckoned me! To the temple! Come!
#EXORCIST.
Pakh! Son of Ritii! Through thy wound an evil spirit has entered thee. I am about to speak the words that shall drive him out: "The virtues of him who lies there, and who suffers, are the virtues of the father of the gods. The virtues of his brow are the virtues of the brow of Thoumen. The virtues of his eye are the virtues of the eye of Horus, who destroys all creatures."
#PAKH.
Begone!
#EXORCIST.
His upper lip is Isis. His lower lip is Neptes, his neck is the goddess, his teeth are swords, his flesh is Osiris, his hands are divine souls, his fingers are blue serpents, snakes, sons of the goddess Sekhet -
#PAKH.
Begone! I no longer believe in your power!
#EXORCIST.
Horus is there! Ra is there! Let them cry to the chiefs of Heliopolis -
#PAKH.
Have done!
#EXORCIST.
The evil spirits are strongest in him. He will die. Only his son has the right to be with him at death.
#SATNI.
My father -
#PAKH.
You are there, my son - 'tis well - I am glad - that that maker of spells is gone. Heal me.
#SATNI.
Yes, father, you shall be healed. But you must have patience.
#PAKH.
Heal me, now, at once.
#SATNI.
I cannot.
#PAKH.
Why do you not want to heal me? - See you not that I am wounded - I suffer - come, give me ease -
#SATNI.
I would give all, that it were in my power to do so.
#PAKH.
You know prayers that our priests know not -
#SATNI.
I know no prayers.
#PAKH.
You are not going to let me die?
#SATNI.
You will not die - have confidence.
#PAKH.
Confidence? In what? You cannot heal me?
#SATNI.
I cannot.
#PAKH.
All your knowledge, then, is but knowledge of how to destroy - My son! - I pray you - my blood goes out with my life - I do not want to die! I pray you - give me your hand. I seem to be sinking into night - hold me back - you will not let me die - your father! I am your father. I gave you life - hold me back - all grows dim around me - But at least do something - speak - say the incantations - No! No! I refuse to die! I am not old. I will not! I will not! Do not let go my hand! I would live, live - All my life, I have worked, I have sorrowed, I have suffered - Satni - will you let me go before I share the peace and happiness you promised -
#SATNI.
Oh! My father!
#PAKH.
You weep - I am lost, then - Yes - I have seen it in your eyes. And the silence deepens around me. To die - to die - And after? And so this is a poor man's life! Work from childhood, blows. Then work, always, without profit. Only for bread. And still work. For others. Not one pleasure. We die. And 'tis finished! You came back to teach me that - Work - blows - misery - the end. What did you come here to do? Is that your work? Satni, Satni! Give me back my faith! I want it! Ah! Why were you born a destroyer? Is that your truth? You are evil - you were able to prove that all was false. Prove to me now that you lied! I demand it! Give me back my faith, give me back the simple mind that will comfort me.
#SATNI.
Do not despair -
#PAKH.
I despair because the happy fields do not exist -
#SATNI.
Yes, father, yes, they exist -
#PAKH.
You lied, then!
#SATNI.
I lied.
#PAKH.
They exist - and if I die -
#SATNI.
If you die, you will go to Osiris, you will become Osiris.
#PAKH.
It is not true. 'Tis now you lie - There is no Osiris! There is no Osiris! Nothing! there is nothing - but life. I curse you, you who taught me that Ah! accursed! Accursed! I die in hate, in rage, in fear. Bad son! Bad man! I curse you, come near. Oh! If I were strong enough! - I would my nails might pierce your throat - Ah! Ah! accursed All my life lost! All my suffering useless! - Forever - Never! Never! shall I know - Pity!
#SATNI.
He is dead! - Father! For me, too, at this moment there would have been comfort in a lie -
#KIRJIPA.
The master is dead! The master is dead! The master is dead! The master is dead!

If it please the gods, when the day of eternity comes, we shall see thee, for behold thou goest towards the earth that mixeth men.

Towards Abydos! Towards Osiris!

O my husband! O my brother! O my beloved! Stay, live in thy place. Pass not away from the earthly spot where thou art! Leave him! Leave him! Wherefore are ye come to take him who abandons me.

#DELETHI.
When I have spoken, and after me Hanou, and after her Nazit, thy son will speak the magic words, whose power shall make thee go even unto Osiris, before the two and forty judges. They shall place thy heart in the balance, and thou shalt say: "I have done wrong to no man, I have done nothing that is abominable in the sight of the gods."
#SATNI.
No, I will not speak the magic words.
#ALL.
Despair not! Thy son is there!
#HANOU.
Despair not, thy son is there. When I have spoken and after me Nazit, thy son will say the magic prayers whose power shall bring thee even unto Osiris, and thou shalt say: "I have starved none, I have made none weep, I have not killed, I have not robbed the goods of the temples."
#SATNI.
No, I will say no useless words.
#ALL.
Despair not! Thy son is there!
#NAZIT.
Despair not! Thy son is there! When I have spoken he will say the sacred words whose power shall bring thee even unto Osiris and thou shalt say: "I did not filch the fillets from the mummies, I did not use false weights, I did not snare the sacred birds. I am pure - "
#ALL.
I am pure! I am pure! -
#KIRJIPA.
Give to me what is my due, to me who am pure. Give me all that heaven gives, all that the earth brings forth, all that the Nile bears down from its mysterious springs. Despair not! Thy son is there! Thy son will say the sacred words!

No, I will not say words that are lies!
#KIRJIPA.
Speak the sacred words!
#SATNI.
No!

Accursed!
#THE OFFICER.
Pharaoh! may Ammon - Ra preserve thy life in health and strength!
#THE PHARAOH.
My orders! My orders!
#THE OFFICER.
Lord of the two Egypts, friend of Ra, favorite of Mentu, may Ammon -
#THE PHARAOH.
Enough! my orders!
#THE OFFICER.
I would have died -
#THE PHARAOH.
The wish shall be granted, be assured, and soon! My orders! Dog, why did you not carry out my orders?
#THE OFFICER.
Satni -
#THE PHARAOH.
Satni! Yes, Satni, the impostor! Where is he?
#THE OFFICER.
Pharaoh - may Ammon, Soukou Ra, Horus -
#THE PHARAOH.
I will have you whipped till your blood run - Satni! Where is Satni! I sent you to seize him! Where is he?
#THE OFFICER.
No one knows.
#THE PHARAOH.
Scoundrel! You are his accomplice!
#THE OFFICER.
O Ammon!
#THE PHARAOH.
Did you go to the house of his father, to Rheou?
#THE OFFICER.
We searched them in vain.
#THE PHARAOH.
He has taken flight, then?
#THE OFFICER.
I know not.
#THE PHARAOH.
You are a traitor! You shall die! Take him out! And you others, hear the commands of the High Priest and begone.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Let each fulfil the mission he is charged with. Let the young priests mix with the crowd, the moment it enters the Temple. Let them excite the people's fervor, that as many prodigies as possible may be won from the goddess. Now when you are gone the stones that screen the sanctuary will roll away before the Pharaoh and the High Priest; and, first by right, they shall behold the goddess face to face. Humbly prostrated we shall speak to her the mysterious words that other men have never heard. Bow down before the Pharaoh, may he live in health and strength Let the man Satni be taken from the crypt where he is imprisoned When I give the signal let them bring him here. While the Pharaoh goes in procession through the town let them do what I have told you Rise! Son of Ammon - Ra, bow down before him who represents the god. Withdraw, we would pray.
#THE PHARAOH.
I would all the flies of Egypt might eat thy tongue.
#HIGH PRIEST.
The flies of Egypt are too many and my tongue is too small, for your wish to be realized, Pharaoh.
#THE PHARAOH.
This is the result of my weakness!
#HIGH PRIEST.
The Pharaoh, Son of Ammon - Ra - Lord of the two Egypts - Friend of Ra -
#THE PHARAOH.
Enough! Enough! We are alone. There are none whom your words may deceive. And your mock - reverence fools not me. You would not let me put Satni to death, your subtleties confused my mind, I gave in to you, and now Satni escapes us.
#HIGH PRIEST.
You should not let anger master you for that.
#THE PHARAOH.
Satni has foretold to thousands of ears that there will be no miracle.
#HIGH PRIEST.
The miracle will be.
#THE PHARAOH.
Who knows that?
#HIGH PRIEST.
I.
#THE PHARAOH.
Satni has declared he will enter the temple -
#HIGH PRIEST.
'Tis possible.
#THE PHARAOH.
He has declared he knows the secret recess, whence one of your priests makes the head of the image move.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Most like he speaks the truth.
#THE PHARAOH.
He declares the miracle will not take place. If the people suffer this disappointment, tell me what chance can there be for the war of conquest I would wage in Ethiopia?
#HIGH PRIEST.
Why wage a war of conquest in Ethiopia?
#THE PHARAOH.
I need gold. I need women. I need slaves. There will be a share of the spoil for your temple.
#HIGH PRIEST.
I like not bloodshed.
#THE PHARAOH.
The treasury is empty. Our whippings are useless now. Our blows no longer bring forth taxes. If the people lose confidence in the gods, what will happen to - morrow? Who will follow me, unless they believe the gods confirm my orders?
#HIGH PRIEST.
Satni will not prevent the miracle.
#THE PHARAOH.
What do you know of it?
#HIGH PRIEST.
I know.
#THE PHARAOH.
Is Satni dead?
#HIGH PRIEST.
He lives.
#THE PHARAOH.
You are hiding him!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Yes.
#THE PHARAOH.
You knew I was about to rid me of him, and you took him to prevent me?
#HIGH PRIEST.
Yes.
#THE PHARAOH.
What do you intend?
#HIGH PRIEST.
It shall be done with him as I wish, not as you wish.
#THE PHARAOH.
His crime is a crime against Egypt. crime against me. That is still more grave. Therefore be satisfied.
#THE PHARAOH.
Why then all these ceremonies before you kill him?
#HIGH PRIEST.
That all may know his faults.
#THE PHARAOH.
Satni was one of yours, and you defend him.
#HIGH PRIEST.
We must not make martyrs - if we can avoid it. In killing Satni you would have killed only a man. If what I dream succeed, I shall kill his work. That is a better thing.
#THE PHARAOH.
What will you make of him? priest. priest?
#HIGH PRIEST.
He was initiated before he went away. He was then a young man, pious and wise. On his travels he lost some piety, and gained some wisdom.
#THE PHARAOH.
Have I not always said: "it is not good to travel."
#HIGH PRIEST.
I think like you. Travellers learn too much. Yet am I hopeful. I shall bring him back to our gods.
#THE PHARAOH.
You will fail.
#HIGH PRIEST.
He who for long has breathed the air of temples can never wholly clear his breast of it. If he give way, he shall never leave the house of the Gods again, if he be still rebellious, he shall leave to go to his death.
#THE PHARAOH.
I order you to give Satni up to me.
#HIGH PRIEST.
I would I might bow to your will. But he is a priest: his life is sacred. And I may not transgress the orders given me by the Gods.
#THE PHARAOH.
Prate not of these follies to me - do you take me for one of your priests? Obey! I command you!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Do you take me for one of your soldiers?
#THE PHARAOH.
I command it.
#HIGH PRIEST.
The gods forbid.
#THE PHARAOH.
I laugh at your gods.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Beware lest your people hear.
#THE PHARAOH.
I would be master, in truth. And more, I refuse to submit to the humiliation that again you put on me a while ago.
#HIGH PRIEST.
How should that humiliate you? Before you, the highest bow down.
#THE PHARAOH.
Yes. And straightway, then, I must bow me down before you.
#HIGH PRIEST.
You salute, not me, but the god whom I represent.
#THE PHARAOH.
I pay homage to the god, it is the priest who receives it.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Rest assured! I pass it on to him.
#THE PHARAOH.
And you mock me, besides! Oh! if I but dared to kill you, hypocrite!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Vain man!
#THE PHARAOH.
You tremble at sight of a sword, coward!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Being a butcher, you know only how to kill.
#THE PHARAOH.
Liar!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Who made you Pharaoh?
#THE PHARAOH.
Beware lest one day I have you thrown to my lions!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Beware lest one day I strike the crown of the two Egypts from your head, telling the people the god has set his face against you! Come, we must work together. We complete each other. To govern men, we have both the reality of the evils you inflict on them, and the hope of the good I promise them. Believe me, we must work together. The day that one of us disappears, the fate of the other will be in jeopardy - I perceive they make sign to me. They think our prayers are long and fervent. The hour is come for you to receive the acclamation of your people, and follow them to the shrine of Isis - when Satni will not prevent the miracle, I pledge my word to that.
#HIGH PRIEST.
You know me again!
#SATNI.
Yes, you are the High Priest.
#HIGH PRIEST.
I, too, I know you again. Your father is a potter. You were brought up and taught by us. In the crowd of neophytes I singled you out by your gentleness, your great intelligence; and I saw you destined for the highest dignities. I esteemed you, I was fond of you. We took you from wretchedness. What you know, for the most part, you owe to us. This thing that you have done should anger me - I am only sad, my son. You are troubled.
#SATNI.
Yes, I looked for threats, for torture. The kindness of your voice unmans me.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Be not distressed. Forget who I am. None hear us. Let us talk together as father and son. Or better, since your learning makes you worthy, as two men. You have proclaimed broadcast that the miracle will not come to pass.
#SATNI.
The goddess is stone. Stone does not move itself. The image will not bow its head unless man intervene.
#HIGH PRIEST.
That is evident.
#SATNI.
You admit it?
#HIGH PRIEST.
To you, yes. We give to each one the faith he deserves. Had you remained with us, at each step in the priesthood you would have beheld the gods rise with you, become more immaterial, more noble, as you became more learned. We give to the people the gods they can understand. Our god is different. He is the one who exists in essence. The one who lives in substance, the sole procreator who was not engendered, the father of the fathers, the mother of mothers. The one and only. And we crave his pardon for belittling him by miracles. But they are part of that faith which alone contents the simple - minded. You are above them - I admit freely that the miracle could be prevented. You declared it would not take place - you have found the means to make it impossible?
#SATNI.
I said that, left to herself, the goddess would not move.
#HIGH PRIEST.
To say only that, would not have served you. You intended to prevent the miracle. Come, admit it - it is so.
#SATNI.
Perhaps.
#HIGH PRIEST.
By seizing you, I prevent your committing the sacrilege. Your purpose will not be realized. In an hour the festival of the Prodigy will take place, and you are my prisoner. It follows then, the miracle will be performed - you believe that, do you not?
#SATNI.
Yes, I believe it.
#HIGH PRIEST.
And so your cause is lost. Listen to me; the priests who have taken their final vows are as wise and as little credulous as you. I offer you a place among them. Return to us. A little wisdom banishes the gods - great wisdom brings them back.
#SATNI.
I refuse.
#HIGH PRIEST.
My son, my son, you will not cause me this sorrow. Think what you will drive me to, if you refuse - Satni, do not force me to send you before the tribunal, whose sentence must be death. Death, for you, so young, whose future is so bright!
#SATNI.
I do not fear death.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Besides - I mind me - you were betrothed to that little Yaouma whom the god has chosen as victim. You know she may be saved from the sacrifice, if she become the wife of a priest. They guarded her but ill at Rheou's house, she is here. I have seen her; she is kind and gentle, and you would lead a happy life with her.
#SATNI.
Yaouma! Yaouma!
#HIGH PRIEST.
So that on one side is Yaouma's death and yours; on the other, happiness with her - and power. Say nothing. I speak as a father might, you can see. I say besides, that you will better serve the crowd in leaving them their gods. I wish to convince you of it, and you will stay with us - weep no more. You will stay, will you not? Wait! Hear me, before you answer. You seek happiness for the lower orders? There is no happiness for them without religion. Already you have seen what they become, when it is taken from them. The riots of yesterday cost your father his life. He suffered much, they tell me. Is it true? I do not know the details. You saw him die, did you not? Tell me how it happened.
#SATNI.
Ah! I was right. It was in truth torture that awaited me here. You have guessed you would gain nothing racking my body - you keep your torments for my heart.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Have I said other than what is true? The conversions that your preaching made were followed by disorders - was it not then that your father was wounded? I knew him. He was a man, simple and good. You are the cause of his death, as you will be the cause of Yaouma's.
#SATNI.
Peace! You would have my sorrows crush my will!
#HIGH PRIEST.
I shall speak of them no more. But think of the people of Egypt, what evils you would bring on them! If you take away their religion, what will keep them virtuous?
#SATNI.
What you call their virtue, is only their submission.
#HIGH PRIEST.
You let loose their vilest instincts, if you remove the fear of the gods.
#SATNI.
The fear of the gods has prevented fewer crimes than were needed to create it.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Be it so. But it exists.
#SATNI.
It is your interest to spread the belief, that the fear of the gods is a restraint. And you know that it is not. You do not leave the punishment of crime to the gods. You have the lash, hard labor in the mines; you have scaffolds, you have executioners. No one believes sincerely in the happy life beyond the grave. If we believed, we should kill ourselves, the sooner to reach the Island of the Souls, the fields of Yalou.
#HIGH PRIEST.
By what then are the appetites restrained?
#SATNI.
By the laws, by the need of the esteem of others -
#HIGH PRIEST.
We have just seen that, in sooth. So then it was virtue that the people showed yesterday, after you made them break their gods? They seemed to care little for the esteem of others, for they stole, they pillaged, they killed. Do you approve of that? Have they gained your esteem, those who have done what they have done?
#SATNI.
Oh, I know! I know! That is your strongest argument. Creatures degraded by centuries of slavery, drunk with the first hours of freedom, commit crimes. You argue from this, that they were meant for slaves. Yes, it is true that if you take a child from the leading strings that upheld it, the child falls down. But you who watch over it, you rejoice at the fall, for then you can assert that the child must go back to its leading strings - and be kept in them till death.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Then you declare that all supports must be suppressed? Religion is a prop. It soothes - consoles. He does evil who disturbs it.
#SATNI.
Many religions died before ours. The passing of each caused the sorrows you foresee. Should we then have kept the first, to prevent some suffering?
#HIGH PRIEST.
Ours is yet young, though so old; look in the halls of our temples, behold the countless thank - offerings brought there for prayers that were granted.
#SATNI.
Your temples could not hold the offerings, unthinkable in number, that those whose prayers were not granted might have made, and who none the less prayed as well as the others.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Even unanswered their prayers were recompensed. They had hope, and it is likewise a boon to the poor to promise them welfare in the world to come.
#SATNI.
You promise them welfare in the world to come, to make them forget that all the welfare in this world is yours.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Can you give happiness to all who are on earth? We are more generous than you; at least we give them consolation.
#SATNI.
You make them pay dear for it.
#HIGH PRIEST.
In truth the granaries of our temples are full to overflowing. Left to themselves, the people would not think of the lean years, in the years of abundance. We think for them, and they bring us, gladly, what they would refuse did they not believe they gave to the gods. We proclaim the Nile sacred; it is forbidden to sully its waters. Is that to honor it as a god? Not so, it is to avoid the plague. And all the animals we deified are those man has need of. You did not learn all things on your travels -
#SATNI.
You would have the peasant remain a child, because you fear the reckoning he would demand of you, if you let him grow up. You know you could not stay him then by showing him the god - jackal, the god - ram, the god - bull, and the rest that do not exist.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Are you certain they do not exist?
#SATNI.
Yes.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Know you where you are?
#SATNI.
In the temple.
#HIGH PRIEST.
In the temple; where you were brought up. There was a time when you dared not have crossed the first sacred enclosure. You are in the third. Look round! There is the holy of holies. At my will the stones that mask the entrance will roll back, and the goddess will be unveiled. Except the High Priest and the Pharaoh, no mortal, if he be not priest himself, may look on her and live - save at the hour of the annual Festival of Prodigies, which is upon us now. Do you believe that you can endure to be alone in her presence?
#SATNI.
I do believe it.
#HIGH PRIEST.
We shall see. If you be afraid, call and prostrate yourself. Afterwards you shall go and tell what you have seen, to those whom you deceived.
#SATNI.
Ah! I am alone! Alone in the temple, within sight of the goddess almost. I know 'tis but an image - yet am I steeped in terror, even to the marrow of my bones. Ah! - I thought I beheld in the darkness - No - I know that there is nothing - Oh! coward nature! Because I was cradled amid tales of religion, because I grew up in the fear of the gods, because my father and my father's father, and all those from whom I come, were crushed by this terror even from the blackest night of time, I tremble, and my reason totters. All this is false, I know - the god obeys the priest. Yet, from these towering columns, horror and mystery descend upon me - The holy of holies opens - I am afraid - I am afraid - 'Tis the beast in me that is afraid - Ah! coward flesh! I shall conquer thee - I would chastise my weakness. I am shamed - I am shamed - In spite of all I will look her in the face. I have the will! but I must fight against so many memories, against all the dead whose spirits stir in mine. I shall conquer the dead. My life, and my will - courage!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Terror does not move you. Let us see if you be proof against pity. Come - Look! 'Tis by pressing this lever that one of ours, in a little while, will bring about the miracle. I leave you in his place. At my signal the doors of the sacred enclosure will open, and the people draw near the sanctuary. Listen to them. And if you are moved to pity by their prayers, you - you shall give them the consoling lie for which they pray.
#SATNI.
There will be no miracle.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Watch and hear. All is ready?
#A PRIEST.
All.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Listen.
#HIGH PRIEST.
Now, let them come in.
#YOUNG WOMAN.
Nearer, lay me nearer the goddess! She will drive forth the evil spirit that will not let me move my legs.
#A BLIND GIRL.
When the stone rolls back and the goddess appears, watch well her face, to tell me if she will not give me back my sight.
#THE PARALYTIC.
I would be quite near, quite near! In a little while I shall walk.
#A WOMAN.
She will speak, she will say "yes." She will reveal herself again as protectress of Egypt.
#ANOTHER.
They say not. They say that great calamities are in store for us.
#ANOTHER.
If she answer not?
#ANOTHER.
Silence!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Ammon is great!
#THE PEOPLE.
Ammon is great!
#HIGH PRIEST.
The sanctuary is about to open.

Rise! Behold and pray! O goddess! Thy people adore thee, and humble themselves before thee!
#ALL.
Isis, we adore thee!
#HIGH PRIEST.
This year, once more, show to us by that miraculous sign of thy divine head, that still thou art our protectress. O goddess, if thou hast pity on those who suffer, thou wilt bend thy head. Pity! Pity! we suffer! The evil spirits torment us.
#THE PEOPLE.
We suffer! Drive forth the evil spirits!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Neith! Mother of the Universe! The evil spirits torment us! Neith! Virgin genetrix! Isis, sacred earth of Egypt, bend thy head! Sati, queen of the heavens! Bend thy head!
#THE MOTHER.
The soul of a dead man has entered the body of my child, O Isis! And he is dying. I hold him towards thee, Isis. Behold how he is fair, behold how he suffers. Look, he is so little. Let me keep him! Isis! Isis! Let me keep him!
#ALL.
Pity! Pity!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Show us that thou dost consent to hear us! Isis, bend thy head!
#BLIND GIRL.
Open my eyes! Ever since I was born a demon held them closed. Let me see the skies of whose splendor they tell me. I am unhappy, Isis! He whom I love, he who loves me, I have not looked upon his countenance! I am unhappy, Isis!
#ALL.
Pity! Pity!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Anouke! Soul of the Universe! Pity! We are before thee like little children who are lost.
#THE PEOPLE.
Yes! Yes! like little children who are lost!
#THE SON.
For my father who is blind, Isis, I implore thee!
#ALL.
Isis! Father! Pity!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Thmei, Queen of Justice! Mirror of truth! Bend thy head!
#THE PARALYTIC.
I have offered up ten lambs to thee. Let me get up and walk!
#THE MAN.
An unseen monster devours my face making me howl with pain.
#PARALYZED MAN.
I drag through the mire, like a beast unclean. Let me walk upright like a god.
#THE TWO SONS.
Behold our mother, Isis, behold our mother, who knows us no more, who knows not herself even, and who laughs! -
#THE MOTHER.
Isis! Thou art a mother. Isis, in the name of thine own child, save mine. Let me not go with empty arms, bereft of my tender burden. Thou art a mother, Isis!
#HIGH PRIEST.
All! All! Pray! Supplicate! Fling you with your faces to the ground - yes! yes! again! Silence! She is about to answer. Your prayers are lukewarm. Your supplications need fervor! Pray! Weep! Cry out! Cry out!
#ALL.
Isis! Drive out the evil spirits! Answer us! Answer us!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Louder! Louder!
#THE PEOPLE.
Sorrows! Tears! Sobs! Cries! Have pity!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Once more, though you die!
#THE PEOPLE.
Thou dost abandon Egypt! What ills will overwhelm us! Help! Help us! Have pity!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Have pity! Have pity! Oh! unhappy people, Isis, if thou dost abandon them.
#VOICES.
She hears us not! She answers not. Evil is upon us! Evil overwhelms us!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Desperate! We are desperate!
#ALL.
We are desperate!
#A CRY.
Her head is bending! No! Yes!
#HIGH PRIEST.
O mother! O goddess!
#THE MOTHER.
O Isis! mother of Horus! the child god! Wilt thou let die my child? Behold him! Behold him!
#THE PARALYTIC.
Thy heart is hard, O goddess!
#PARALYZED MAN.
Thou hast but to will it, Isis, and I walk!
#THE MAN.
Heal my sores! I sow horror around me! Heal my sores!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Answer us! Bend thy head!
#ALL.
Pity!
#SATNI.
Oh! the poor wretched souls!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Rise! The divine images are again in their places. You have shown that you repent. You have begged for pardon. You have testified your horror of the terrible crime you were driven to commit. You await your chastisement. The gods now permit that we proceed to the sacrifice, that will bring about the overflowing of the Nile, and give for yet another year, life to the land of Egypt. She who has chosen, the elect, the savior, is she here?
#YAOUMA.
I am here!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Let her go to clothe her in the sacred robe. Form the procession to bear her to the threshold of the abode of the glorious and the immortal.
#YAOUMA.
Come!
#HIGH PRIEST.
To - day, at the hour when Ammon - Ra came forth from the underworld, I entered the sanctuary. Face to face with the god, I heard his words, which now you shall hear from me. These are the commands of the God. Rheou! You have been to make submission to the Pharaoh - Light of Ra - you have implored his mercy. You have sworn on the body of your father, to serve him faithfully, and you have given that body to him in pledge of your obedience. You have denounced to his anger and justice those who conceived the impious plot to dethrone the Lord of Egypt. You have declared that if you did permit the images of the gods to be thrown down before you, it was because the spells of Satni had clouded your reason. Ammon has proclaimed to me that you are sincere! You are pardoned, on conditions which I shall presently impart. Satni! Satni, you have admitted and proclaimed the power of the gods, whom you dared to deny. You have bowed you down before them. Once, in the temple, you took the first priestly vows; your life is therefore sacred. But you stand now reproved. This very day you will quit Egypt. Withdraw from the Gods! Ammon has spoken other words. All you who are here, you are guilty of the most odious, the most monstrous of crimes. You are all deserving of death. Such is the decree of the God.
#ALL.
O Ammon! Pity! Pity! Ammon!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Cease your sobs! Cease your cries! Cease your useless prayers! Hear the God who speaks through my mouth.
#ALL.
Be kind! Thou! Thou! Have pity! Beseech the God for us, we implore thee! We would not die. Not death! not death! not death!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Yes - I - I have pity on you. But your crime is so great! Have you considered well the enormity of your sin? None can remember to have seen the like. The Gods! To overthrow the Gods! And such Gods! Ammon and Thoueris! I would I might disarm their wrath. But what shall I offer them in your name that may equal your offence?
#PEOPLE.
All! Take all we possess, but spare our lives.
#HIGH PRIEST.
All you possess! 'Tis little enough.
#PEOPLE.
Take our crops.
#HIGH PRIEST.
And who then will feed you? Already you pay tithes. I will offer a fourth of your harvests for ten years. But 'tis little. Even did I say you would give half of all that is in your homes, should I succeed? And would you give it me?
#PEOPLE.
Yes! Yes!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Still it will not be enough. Hear what the God hath breathed to me. There must be prayers, ceaseless prayers in the temple. Every year ten of your daughters must enter the house of the God to be consecrated.
#PEOPLE.
Our daughters! Ammon! Our daughters!
#HIGH PRIEST.
The God is good! The God is good! Lo! I hear him pronounce the words of pardon. But further, you must needs assist the Pharaoh to carry out the divine commands. Ammon wills that the Ethiopian infidels be chastised. All who are of an age to fight will join the army, that is on the eve of departure.
#PEOPLE.
Oh! the war! the war!
#HIGH PRIEST.
Proud Ethiopia threatens invasion to Egypt. You must defend your tombs, your homes, and your women. Would you become slaves of the blacks?
#PEOPLE.
No, no, we would not!
#HIGH PRIEST.
You will go to punish the foes of your kings?
#PEOPLE.
We will go.
#HIGH PRIEST.
And what will be your reward? Know you not that victory will be yours, because the god is with you. And if some fall in battle, should we not all envy their fate, since they leave this world to go towards Osiris. The arrows of your foes will fall harmless at your feet, like wounded birds. Their swords shall bend on your invulnerable bodies. The fire they light against you will become as perfumed water. All this you know to be true. You know that your gods protect you. You know they are all - powerful, because, yesterday, you all did see how the stone image of the goddess Isis did bow, to show you she protects you.
#PEOPLE.
To the war! To the war! To Ethiopia!
#SATNI.
I have been coward too long! The miracle of yesterday - 'twas I - 'twas I who worked it.
#HIGH PRIEST.
I deliver this man to you, and I deliver you to him. You will not let him deceive you twice.
#SATNI.
I was in the temple -
#PEOPLE.
That is a lie!
#SATNI.
It was I who made the head of the image bow.
#PEOPLE.
He blasphemes. Have done! Have done! Let him not blaspheme!
#SATNI.
It was I! And I ask your forgiveness.
#A MAN.
Why should you do it, if you despise our gods?
#SATNI.
I did it out of pity.
#PEOPLE.
We have no need of your pity.
#SATNI.
That is true. You have need only of my courage. And I failed you. I was touched by your tears. I was weak, thinking to be kind.
#A MAN.
You are not kind. You would have handed us over to foreign gods.
#PEOPLE.
Yes! yes! that is true!
#SATNI.
I gave you the lie that you begged for. I wanted to lull your sorrows to sleep.
#A MAN.
You have brought down on us the anger of the gods.
#ANOTHER.
The evils that crush us, 'tis you have let them loose on us.
#ALL.
Yes, yes! Liar! Curse you! Let him be accursed!
#SATNI.
Curse me. You are right. I am guilty. I had not the strength to persevere; to lead you, in spite of your tears, to the summits I would lead you to. To still a few sobs, to give hope to some who were stricken, I worked the miracle; and, beholding that false miracle, you made submission. I have confirmed, I have strengthened the empire of the lie.
#A MAN.
'Twas you who lied.
#SATNI.
I have given back your minds, for another age, to slavery and debasement. I have given back to the priests their power that was endangered. I have given them means to increase your burdens, to take your daughters, to send you to a war, covetous, murderous, and unjust.
#A MAN.
You are a spy from Ethiopia!
#ANOTHER.
You are a traitor to your country!
#ALL.
Yes! a traitor! Death to the traitor!
#SATNI.
And to defend your tyrants, you will kill men as wretched as yourselves, dupes like you, and like you enslaved.
#A MAN.
We know you are paid to betray Egypt!
#ALL.
Yes, we know it! We know the price of your treason!
#ANOTHER.
You would sell Egypt, and 'tis to weaken us you would overthrow our gods.
#ALL.
Traitor! Traitor!
#SATNI.
If I am a traitor, 'tis to my own cause! But a while ago I was proud of my deed, thinking I had sacrificed myself to you. Alas! I only sacrificed your future to my pity. I wept for you; to weep for misfortune - what is that but an easy escape from the duty of fighting its cause? I pitied you. Pity is but a weakness, a submission - To perpetuate the falsehood of the miracle, and the life of atonement to come is to drug misery to sleep.
#A MAN.
Misery! - can you give us anything to cure it?
#SATNI.
They have implanted in you, the belief that misery is immortal, invincible. By my falsehood, I too have seemed to admit this; and thus I have helped those, in whose interest it is that misery should last for ever.
#A MAN.
He insults the Pharaoh!
#ANOTHER.
Do not insult our priests!
#SATNI.
Had there been no miracle, you would have despaired - you would have sorrowed. I ought to have faced that. I ought to have faced the death of a few, to save the future of all. We go forward only by destroying. What matter blood and pain! Pain and blood - never a child is born without them! I would -
#A WOMAN.
Kill him! Kill him! He says we must put our children to death!
#SATNI.
All are glorious who preach new efforts -
#PEOPLE.
Death! Death to the traitor!
#SATNI.
All are infamous who preach resignation -
#PEOPLE.
Enough! Kill him! Death!
#SATNI.
It is in this world that the wretched must find their paradise, it is here that every one's good must be sought with a zeal that knows no limit, save respect for the good of others.
#PEOPLE.
He is mad! He knows not what he says! He is mad!
#PEOPLE.
Yaouma! The chosen of Ammon - Ra! Glory to her who goes to save Egypt!
#SATNI.
Yaouma! Yaouma! One word! One look of farewell! Yaouma! 'Tis I, Satni! Look on me!
#MIERIS.
Lead me to Satni - go - Satni, your words have sunk deep in my heart - Yaouma, they tell me, did not hear your voice. She is lost in the joy of sacrifice. The need to make sacrifice is in us all. If the gods are not, to whom shall we sacrifice ourselves?
#SATNI.
To those who suffer.
#MIERIS.
To those who suffer.
#BITIOU.
Look! He too, he will fall down!
#SATNI.
It was you who struck me, Bitiou - I pity you with all my heart - with all my heart.
#DELETHI.
Mistress, come and pray!
#MIERIS.
No, I do not believe in gods in whose name men kill.
