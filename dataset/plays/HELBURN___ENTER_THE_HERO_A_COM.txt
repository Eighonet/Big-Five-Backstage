#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, Anne, here's another box of flowers! Anne, where are you?
#ANNE.
In here. I thought you had gone out.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I was just going when the expressman left these - and I wanted to see them. Oh, how pretty your dress is. Turn round. Just adorable! May I open these?
#VALSIN.
Yes, but hurry. It's late.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
You dear! It's almost like having a fianc√© of my own. Three boxes in two days! He's adorably extravagant. Oh, Anne, exquisite white roses! Come, look!
#ANNE.
Yes, lovely. Get a bowl, Ruth. Quickly.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I will. Here's a card. What does he say, Anne? May I see?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
: "The red rose whispers of passion And the white rose breathes of love; Oh, the red rose is a falcon, And the white rose is a dove. "But I send you a cream - white rosebud With a flush on its petal tips, For the love that is purest and sweetest Has a kiss of desire on the lips. Oh, how beautiful! Did he make that up, do you suppose? I didn't know he was a real poet.
#ANNE.
Any one in love is a poet.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It's perfectly beautiful! May I copy it in my "Harold Notebook"?
#ANNE.
Your what?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I call it my "Harold Notebook." I've put down bits of his letters that you read me, the lovely bits that are too beautiful to forget. Do you mind?
#ANNE.
You silly child!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Here, you may see it.... That's from the second letter he wrote you from Rio Janeiro. I just couldn't get over that letter. You know I made you read it to me three times. It was so - so delicate. I remembered this passage - see. "A young girl seems to me as exquisite and frail as a flower, and I feel myself a vandal in desiring to pluck and possess one. Yet, Anne, your face is always before me, and I know now what I was too stupid to realize before, that it was you and you only, who made life bearable for me last winter when I was a stranger and alone." Oh, Anne - that's the sort of love letters I've dreamed of getting. I don't suppose I ever shall.
#ANNE.
Have you shown this to any one?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Only to Caroline - in confidence. But really, Anne, every one knows about Harold. You've told Madge and Eleanor, and I'm sure they've told the others. They don't say anything to us, but they do to Caroline and she tells me. You're not angry, are you, Anne?
#ANNE.
Yes, rather. What do they say?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, all sorts of things. Some of them horrid, of course! You can't blame them for being jealous. Here you are having just the sort of experience that any one of them would give their eye teeth to have. I'd be jealous if you weren't my sister. As it is, I seem to get some of the glory myself.
#ANNE.
But every girl has this experience sooner or later.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Oh, not in this way. Everything that Harold does is beautiful, ideal. Jane Fenwick showed me some of Bob's letters. They were so dull, so prosaic! All about his salary and the corn crop. I was disgusted with them. So was she, I think, when she saw Harold's letters.
#ANNE.
Oh, you showed them to Jane, too?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
No, really I didn't. Caroline did. I lent her my notebook once overnight, and she gave Jane a peek - in the strictest confidence. Jane really needed it. She was getting so cocky about Bob. Girls are funny things, aren't they?
#ANNE.
What do you mean?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
It isn't so much the man, as the idea of a man - some one to dream about, and to talk about. When I think of getting engaged - I suppose I shall get engaged some day - I never think of being really, really kissed by a man -
#ANNE.
What do you think of?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I always think of telling Caroline about it, showing my ring to her and to Madge. Oh, Madge is green with envy. I believe she thought Harold sort of liked her. She was so excited when she saw him in New York. She said she would have got off the bus and chased him, but he went into a house.... Anne, why didn't you tell us - me, at least - that Harold was back from South America, before we heard it from Madge?
#ANNE.
Just because.... I wanted to avoid all this.... It was hard enough to have him within a few hours' distance and know he could not get to me. But it was easier when no one else knew. Don't you understand?
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, dear, of course I do - but still -
#ANNE.
Now, Ruth, it's quarter past four. You promised -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
I'm going ... right straight off ... unless - Oh, Anne, mayn't I stay and have just one peek. I won't let him see me, and then I'll run straight away?
#ANNE.
Oh, for heaven's sake, don't be naughty and silly! Clear out now, quickly, or - Ruth, dear, put yourself in my place. Think how you would feel if you were going to see the man you loved for the first time. That's what it really is. Think of it! Two years ago when he went away we were just the merest friends - and now -
#RUTH GRAHAM.
And now you're engaged to be married! Oh, isn't it the most romantic thing! Of course you want to be alone. Forgive me. Oh, Anne, how excited you must be!
#ANNE.
No, I'm strangely calm. And yet, Ruth, I'm afraid, terribly afraid.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Why, what of?
#ANNE.
I don't know ... of everything ... of the unknown. All this has been so wonderful, if anything should happen I don't think I could bear it. I think I should die.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Nonsense, dear, what can happen? You're just on edge. Well, I'll be off. I'll join Mother at Aunt Nellie's. Give my love to Harold. You know I've never called him anything but Mr. Lawson to his face. Isn't that funny? Good - by, dear. You look so sweet.
#ANNE.
Good - by, Ruth. Good - by.
#MAN'S VOICE.
In here? All right!
#HAROLD.
Hello, Miss Carey, how are you? Splendid to see you again, after all this time. You're looking fine. How's your mother - and little Ruth?
#ANNE.
Welcome home.
#HAROLD.
Oh, thanks. It's rather nice to be back in God's country. But it's not for long this time.
#ANNE.
Are you going away again?
#HAROLD.
Yes. I've another appointment. This one in India, some big salt mines. Not bad, eh? I made pretty good in Brazil, they tell me.
#ANNE.
Sit down.
#HAROLD.
Thanks. Hot for September, isn't it? Though I ought to be used to heat by this time. Sometimes the thermometer would run a hundred and eight for a week on end. Not much fun, that.
#ANNE.
No, indeed.
#HAROLD.
You know I loathed it down there at first. What with all the foreigners and the rotten weather and the bugs - thought I'd never get into the swing. Wanted to chuck engineering for any old job that was cool, but after a while -
#ANNE.
How long have you been home?
#HAROLD.
About three weeks. I'd really been meaning to come out here and have a look round my old haunts, but there was business in New York, and I had to go South and see my family - you know how time flies. Then your note came. It was mighty jolly of you to ask me out here. By the way, how did you know I was back?
#ANNE.
Madge Kennedy caught sight of you in New York.
#HAROLD.
Did she really? How is little Madge? And that odd brother of hers. Is he just as much of a fool as ever? I remember once he said to me -
#ANNE.
Oh, I didn't ask you here to talk about Madge Kennedy's family.
#HAROLD.
No ... no, of course, not. I - I've been wondering just why you did ask me. You said you wanted to talk to me about something.
#ANNE.
Weren't you glad to come?
#HAROLD.
Why, of course I was. Of course. And then your note fired my curiosity - your asking me to come straight to you before seeing any one else.
#ANNE.
Aren't you glad to be here with me?
#HAROLD.
Why surely, of course, but -
#ANNE.
You see, people seemed to expect you would come to see me first of all. I rather expected it myself. Don't you understand?
#HAROLD.
No.... I'm afraid I don't....
#ANNE.
From the way you acted before you went away I thought you, yourself, would want to see me first of all.
#HAROLD.
Before I went away? What do you mean?
#ANNE.
You know well enough what I mean. The parties those last weeks - the theater we went to - the beautiful flowers you sent Mother - the letter -
#HAROLD.
But - but - why, I was going away. You and your people had been awfully nice to me, a perfect stranger in town. I was simply trying to do the decent thing. Good Lord! You don't mean to say you thought -
#ANNE.
Yes, it's true, I thought - and every one else thought - I've been waiting these two years for you to come back.
#HAROLD.
Great Heavens! I never imagined - Why, Miss Carey, I - oh, I'm terribly sorry! Please don't do that - please! I'd better go away - I'll clear out - I'll go straight off to India - I'll never bother you again.
#ANNE.
No. You mustn't go away!
#HAROLD.
But what can I do?
#ANNE.
You mean to say you don't care at all - that you have never cared?
#HAROLD.
Really, Miss Carey, I -
#ANNE.
For heaven's sake, don't call me Miss Carey. Call me Anne.
#HAROLD.
Miss Carey.... Anne.... I.... Oh, you'd better let me go - let me get away before any one knows I'm here - before they think -
#ANNE.
It's too late. They think already.
#HAROLD.
Think what? What do you mean?
#ANNE.
Oh, this is terrible! Sit down, Harold, and listen to me. You see, when you went away, people began to say things about us - you and me - about your caring. I let them go on. In fact I believed them. I suppose it was because I wanted so much to believe them. Oh, what a fool I've been! What a fool!
#ANNE.
And now you want to clear out like a thief in the night, and leave me to be laughed at! No, no, you can't do that! You must help me. You've hurt me to the very soul. You mustn't humiliate me before the world.
#HAROLD.
I'll do anything I can, Miss Carey.
#ANNE.
Anne!
#HAROLD.
Anne, I mean. But how?
#ANNE.
You must stay here. You must pretend for a few days - for a week at most, that we're engaged.
#HAROLD.
I can't do that, you know. Really, I can't.
#ANNE.
Why not? Only a little while. Then you'll go away to India. We'll find it's been a mistake. I'll break it off, - it will only be a pretense, of course, but at least no one will know what a fool I've been.
#HAROLD.
Miss Carey - Anne, I mean, I'll do anything I can, but not that! A man can't do that. You see, there's a girl, an English girl, down in Brazil, I -
#ANNE.
Oh, a girl! Another! Well, after all, what does that matter? Brazil is a long way off. She need never know.
#HAROLD.
She might hear. You can't keep things like this hid. No. I wouldn't risk that. You'd better let me clear out before your family gets home. No one need ever know I've been here.
#ANNE.
You can't go. You can't. It's more serious than you imagine.
#HAROLD.
Serious? What do you mean?
#ANNE.
Come here. I wonder if I can make you understand? It means so much to me that you should - so much! Harold, you know how dull life is here in this little town. You were glad enough to get away after a year of it, weren't you? Well, it's worse for a girl, with nothing to do but sit at home - and dream - of you. Yes, that's what I did, until, at last, when I couldn't stand it any longer, I wrote you.
#HAROLD.
I never got the letter, Miss Carey. Honor bright, I didn't.
#ANNE.
Perhaps not, but you answered it.
#HAROLD.
Answered it? What are you talking about?
#ANNE.
Would you like to see your answer? Here it is - your answer. You see it's post - marked Rio Janeiro.
#HAROLD.
This does look like my writing. "Anne, my darling - " I say, what does this mean?
#ANNE.
Go on.
#HAROLD.
"I have your wonderful letter. It came to me like rain in the desert. Can it be true, Anne, that you do care? I ask myself a hundred times what I have done to deserve this. A young girl seems to me as exquisite and frail as a flower - " Great Scott! You don't think I could have written such stuff! What in the world!
#ANNE.
Here's the next letter you wrote me, from the mine. It's a beautiful one. Read it.
#HAROLD.
"I have been out in the night under the stars. Oh, that you were here, my beloved! It is easy to stand the dust and the turmoil of the mine without you, but beauty that I cannot share with you hurts me like a pain - "
#ANNE.
Yes, that's an exceptionally beautiful one. But there are more - lots more. Would you like to see them?
#HAROLD.
But I tell you, I never wrote them. These aren't my letters.
#ANNE.
Whose are they, then?
#HAROLD.
God knows! This is some outrageous trick. You've been duped, you poor child. But we'll get to the bottom of this. Just leave it to me. I'll get detectives. I'll find out who's back of it! I'll -
#HAROLD.
Good Lord. What's the matter with me! You don't believe those letters. You couldn't think I wrote them, or you wouldn't have met me as you did, quite naturally, as an old friend. You understand! For heaven's sake, make it clear to me!
#ANNE.
I am trying to.... I told you there had to be ... answers.... I was afraid to send my letters to you, but there had to be answers. So I wrote them myself.
#HAROLD.
You wrote them yourself?!?
#ANNE.
Yes.
#HAROLD.
These? These very letters?
#ANNE.
Yes. I had to.
#HAROLD.
Good God! But the handwriting.
#ANNE.
Oh, that was easy. I had the letter you wrote to Mother.
#HAROLD.
And you learned to imitate my handwriting?
#ANNE.
It was very good writing.
#HAROLD.
No one has seen these things, - have they?
#ANNE.
They arrived by mail.
#HAROLD.
You mean people saw the envelopes. Yes, that's bad enough.... But you haven't shown them to any one? Have you?... Have you?
#ANNE.
Only parts - never a whole letter. But it was such a pleasure to be able to talk about you to some one. My only pleasure.
#HAROLD.
Good heavens! You told people I wrote these letters? That we were engaged?
#ANNE.
I didn't mean to, Harold. Really, I didn't. But I couldn't keep it dark. There were your telegrams.
#HAROLD.
My telegrams?!?
#ANNE.
You used to wire me every time you changed your address. You were very thoughtful, Harold. But, of course, I couldn't keep those secret like your letters.
#HAROLD.
My telegrams! Good Lord! "Leaving Rio for fortnight of inspection in interior. Address care Se√±or Miguel - " My telegrams!
#ANNE.
And then there were your flowers. I see you are admiring them.
#HAROLD.
What flowers?
#ANNE.
These - these - all of them. You sent me flowers every week while you were gone.
#HAROLD.
Good God!
#ANNE.
Yes. You were extravagant with flowers, Harold. Of course I love them, but I had to scold you about spending so much money.
#HAROLD.
Spending so much money? And what did I say when you scolded me?
#ANNE.
You sent me a bigger bunch than ever before - and - wait a minute - here's the card you put in it.
#HAROLD.
Are all those my cards too?
#ANNE.
Yes.
#HAROLD.
I'm afraid I was a bit extravagant!
#ANNE.
Here's the one! You wrote: "If all that I have, and all that I am, is too little to lay before you, how can these poor flowers be much?"
#HAROLD.
I wrote that? Very pretty - very. I'd forgotten I had any such knack at sentiments.
#ANNE.
And then, right away, you sent me the ring.
#HAROLD.
Ring! What ring?
#ANNE.
My engagement ring. You really were very extravagant that time, Harold.
#HAROLD.
But I don't see.... You're not wearing...?
#ANNE.
Not there - here, next to my heart. I adore sapphires, Harold.
#HAROLD.
Yes. Yes. Of course. Everyone likes sapphires, Anne. It is a beauty. Yes. You haven't shown your ring to any one, have you, Anne?
#ANNE.
Only to a few people - One or two. few people! Good heavens! Sit down, Anne; we must talk this over a little, - very quietly, you understand, very quietly. Now to begin with, when did you first -
#ANNE.
No, I'm not crazy. Don't be worried. I'm perfectly sane. I had to tell you all this to show how serious it was. Now you know. What are you going to do?
#HAROLD.
Do? I'm going to take the next train back to New York.
#ANNE.
And leave me to get out of this before people all alone?
#HAROLD.
You got into it without my assistance, didn't you? Great Scott, you forged those letters in cold blood -
#ANNE.
Not in cold blood, Harold. Remember, I cared.
#HAROLD.
I don't believe it. You enjoyed writing those letters!
#ANNE.
Of course I enjoyed it. It meant thinking of you, talking of -
#HAROLD.
Rot! Not of me, really. You didn't think I am really the sort of person who could write that - that drivel!
#ANNE.
Oh, I don't know. After a while I suppose you and my dream got confused.
#HAROLD.
But it was the rankest -
#ANNE.
Oh, I'm not so different from other girls. We're all like that. We must have some one to dream about - to talk about. I suppose it's because we haven't enough to do. And then we don't have any - any real adventures like - shop girls.
#HAROLD.
That's a funny thing to say!
#ANNE.
Well, it's true. I know I went rather far. After I got started I couldn't stop. I didn't want to, either. It took hold of me. So I went on and on and let people think whatever they wanted. But if you go now and people find out what I've done, they'll think I'm really mad - or something worse. Life will be impossible for me here, don't you see - impossible. But if you stay, it will be so easy. Just a day or two. Then you will have to go to India. Is that much to ask? And you save me from disgrace, from ruin!
#ANNE.
You must help me. You must. After I've been so frank with you, you can't go back on me now. I've never in my life talked to any one like this - so openly. You can't go back on me! If you leave me here to be laughed at, mocked at by every one, I don't know what I shall do. I shan't be responsible. If you have any kindness, any chivalry.... Oh, for God's sake, Harold, help me, help me!
#HAROLD.
I don't know.... I'm horribly muddled.... All right, I'll stay!
#ANNE.
Good! Good! Oh, you are fine! I knew you would be. Now everything will be so simple. We will be very quiet here for a couple of days. We won't see many people, for of course it isn't announced. And then you will go ... and I will write you a letter....
#HAROLD.
Write me a letter? What for?
#ANNE.
Telling you that I have been mistaken. Releasing you from the engagement ... and you will write me an answer ... sad but manly ... reluctantly accepting my decision....
#HAROLD.
Oh, I am to write an answer, sad but manly - Good God! Suppose you don't release me after all.
#ANNE.
Don't be silly, Harold. I promise. Can't you trust me?
#HAROLD.
Trust you? Trust you? By Jove, no, I don't trust you! This is absurd, I don't stay another moment. Say what you will to people. I'm off. This is final.
#ANNE.
You can't go now. I hear Mother and Ruth coming.
#HAROLD.
All the more reason. I bolt.
#ANNE.
You can't go, Harold! Don't corner me. I'll fight like a wildcat if you do.
#HAROLD.
Fight?
#ANNE.
Yes. A pretty figure you'll cut if you bolt now. They'll think you a cad - an out and out cad! Haven't they seen your letters come week by week, and your presents? And you have written to Mother, too - I have your letter. There won't be anything bad enough to say about you. They'll say you jilted me for that English girl in Brazil. It will be true, too. And it will get about. She'll hear of it, I'll see to that - and then -
#HAROLD.
But it's a complete lie! I can explain -
#ANNE.
You'll have a hard time explaining your letters and your presents - and your ring. There's a deal of evidence against you -
#HAROLD.
See here, are you trying to blackmail me? Oh, this is too ridiculous!
#ANNE.
They're coming! I hear them on the stairs! What are you going to tell them?
#HAROLD.
The truth. I must get clear of all this. I tell you -
#ANNE.
No, no, Harold! Forgive me, I was just testing you. I will get you out of this. Leave it to me.
#HAROLD.
No, I won't leave anything to you, ever.
#ANNE.
Harold, remember I am a woman - and I love you.
#ANNE.
Come in.
#MRS. CAREY'S VOICE.
May we come in?
#ANNE.
Yes!
#MRS. CAREY.
Harold! My door boy!
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Hello, Harold. I am so glad.
#ANNE.
Wait a moment, Mother. Before you say anything more I must tell you that Harold and I are no longer engaged!
#MRS. CAREY.
No longer engaged? Why.... What...?
#HAROLD.
Really, Mrs. Carey, I -
#ANNE.
Mother, dear, be patient with me, trust me, I beg of you - and please, please don't ask me any questions. Harold and I have had a very hard - a very painful hour together. I don't think I can stand any more.
#MRS. CAREY.
Oh, my poor child, what is it? What has he done?
#HAROLD.
Really, Mrs. Carey, I think I can explain.
#ANNE.
No, Harold, there's no use trying to explain. There are some things a woman feels, about which she cannot reason. I know I am doing right.
#HAROLD.
Mrs. Carey, I assure you -
#ANNE.
Oh, please, please, Harold, don't protest any more. I am not blaming you. Understand, Mother, I am not blaming him. But my decision is irrevocable. I thought you understood. I beg you to go away. You have just time to catch the afternoon express.
#HAROLD.
Nonsense, Anne, you must let me -
#ANNE.
No, no, Harold, it is finished! Don't you understand? Finished! See, here are your letters. I am going to burn them. All your letters - Don't, please, continue this unendurable situation any longer. Go, I beg of you, go!
#HAROLD.
But I tell you I must -
#ANNE.
Make him go, Mother! Make him go!
#MRS. CAREY.
Yes, go! Go, sir! Don't you see you are torturing the child. I insist upon your going.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Yes, she is in a dreadful state.
#HAROLD.
All right, I'm going, I give up!
#ANNE.
Not in anger, I beg of you, Harold! I am not blaming you. Good - by.
#ANNE.
Get some water, Ruth. I shall be all right in a moment.
#MRS. CAREY.
Oh, my dear child, calm yourself. Mother is here, dear. She will take care of you. Tell me, dear, tell me.
#ANNE.
I will, Mother - I will ... everything ... later. But now I must be alone. Please, dear, go away ... for a little while. I must be alone with the ruin of my dreams.
#RUTH GRAHAM.
Come, Mother! Come away!
#MRS. CAREY.
Yes, I am coming. We shall be in the next room, Annie, when you want us. Right here.
#ANNE.
Dust and ashes! Dust and ashes!
#ANNE.
"Anne, my dearest.... I am on the train ... broken, shattered.... Why have you done this to me ... why have you darkened the sun ... and put out the stars ... put out the stars?... Give me another chance, Anne.... I will make good.... I promise you.... For God's sake, Anne, don't shut me out of your life utterly.... I cannot bear it.... I...."
