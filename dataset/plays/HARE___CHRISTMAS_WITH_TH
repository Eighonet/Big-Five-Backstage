#MATSY.
Maw, don't you think it's most time fer us to be going?
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Time to be going, is it? Well, I should hope not. Sure, half of the children are not dry yet, and the other half are not dressed. Bridget Honora, darlin', look in the other room and see how they're coming on.
#MATSY.
I think we ought to be there early, so as we can get a good seat on the front row. I don't want to miss nothing.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
True for you, Matsy, and I don't want yeez to be missing anything either. It ain't like as if yeez go to a fine Christmas entertainment ivery night of yer lives.
#MATSY.
It's the first one any of us ever went to at all, at all. Do yeez think they be after having moving pictures?
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Of course not. Not in a Sunday School, Matsy. But belike they'll have a fine, grand Christmas tree with singin' and spaches and fine costumes and prisints for every one. Bridget Honora!
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Yes, maw?
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Come here.
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Melissa and Micky Machree have been scrubbed until they shine. They're sitting in the window drying in the sun. Mary Ann is cleaning Peter Pan in the lard bucket, and Patsy is washing Teddy Magee in the rain - barrel. Nora is curling Clarissa's hair with the poker, and somebody's untied the goat.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Untied the goat, is it? Matsy Mulligan, put on yer hat at once and see what's become of Shamus O'Brien. He's a good goat, is Shamus, but he's like the late Mr. Mulligan, he has a rovin' disposition and a tremenjous appetite. Hurry now, Matsy.
#MATSY.
Aw, now, maw, I can't go and hunt the goat. I'm all dressed up for the entertainment. If I go after the goat, sure it's all mussed up I'll be.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Yis, if I swat you one wid this wet cloth, it's worse than mussed up you'll be. Hurry after the goat. Niver a step does any Mulligan take from this house tonight until Shamus O'Brien is safe in the kitchen, wid his horns tied to the wash boiler.
#MATSY.
Sure, I dunno where to look fer him.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Go over to Mrs. O'Toole's cabbage garden; like as not ye'll find him there. Sure, Shamus has a fine appetite for cabbages.
#MATSY.
Don't let 'em start afore I get back. I don't want to miss nothin'.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Now, Bridget Honora, lave off hanging up the clothes and go in and see if Melissa and Micky Machree are dry yet. And if they are call me in and I'll attend to their costumes.
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Maw, Mary Ann's having an awful time. She's growed so that her skirt and her waist has parted company, and what she'll be after doing I don't know at all, at all.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Is there anything she can use as a sash?
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
No'm. Nora and Clarissa have used up all the sashes.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Look here, now, Bridget Honora, see what I've found in the wash. It's a tidy to go on top of a dresser, but I'm thinking it's just the thing to fill the gap between the skirt and the waist of Mary Ann.
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Yes, maw.
#PATSY.
Oh, maw, maw, come quick! Hurry, or he'll be drowned.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
What is it, Patsy? Spake quick.
#PATSY.
It's Teddy Magee. I was givin' him a wash in the rain - barrel, when all of a sudden, bad luck to him, he slipped through me fingers and fell head - first down in the barrel. Oh, it's drownded dead he'll be. Oh, oh!
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Oh, me baby, me baby!
#NORA.
Now sit right down there, Clarissa, and don't be moving a hair, because you're all fixed and ready for the entertainment.
#CLARISSA.
And how do I look, Nora?
#NORA.
Ye look like a Christmas angel, so you do. Your hair curled just lovely and your striped stockings will be the admiration and envy of the entire Sunday School.
#PATSY.
Oh, Nora Eudora, come on quick. Teddy Magee fell in the rain - barrel and it's drownded dead he is intirely.
#NORA.
In the rain - barrel? How did he get in the rain - barrel?
#PATSY.
Sure, I was washing him, I was. And he was that slippery with the soap that he slid through me fingers and down to the bottom of the barrel.
#NORA.
Oh, the poor little Teddy Magee.
#MARY ANN.
And how de yeez like me new sash, Peter Pan?
#PETER PAN.
Scwumptious.
#MARY ANN.
It's a tidy cover off'n a bureau, and I don't want to wear it at all, at all. Folks'll be after thinking I'm a bureau. Don't it look funny, Peter Pan?
#PETER PAN.
Scwumptious.
#MARY ANN.
I'm not going to wear it, so I'm not.
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Mary Ann Mulligan, and what are yeez trying to do with your nice new sash?
#MARY ANN.
I ain't going to wear no tidy cover. Folks'll be after thinking I'm a bureau.
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Sure they'll think worse than that if yeez take it off. That's what comes of yer growing so fast. Yer skirt is fer six years old, and yer waist is fer six years old, and so you have to wear the sash to help out the other two years. Sashes are awful stylish, anyhow. It's pretty, too, ain't it, Peter Pan?
#PETER PAN.
Scwumptious.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
It's lucky for him that there wasn't any more water in the rain - barrel, or he would have been drownded dead sure. Patsy, yeez had no business to let him drop. Nora, you go out and finish him. Where's Clarissa?
#CLARISSA.
Here I am, maw.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Well, you're all ready. That's one. Nora and Patsy and Matsy are all ready. That makes four. Mary Ann, are you all fixed?
#MARY ANN.
Yes, mum, but I don't like me sash at all, at all. Folks will all know it's a bureau tidy, it's got fringe and everything.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Oh, ho, me fine young lady. I suppose yeez want a peek - a - boo dress all trimmed with mayonnaise ruffles down the bias, do you? It's lucky for you I found that tidy in the wash, so it is. And don't yeez eat too much or breathe hard or ye'll bust it, and then where'll you be at?
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Maw, Mary Ann's chewing her apron.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Mary Ann Mulligan, take that apron out'n your mouth. I niver saw such a girl to be always chewing something. It's first yer dress and then yer apron or your petticoat, whatever happens to be your topmost garment. Clothes were not made to chew.
#NORA.
Here they are, maw, all ready for the party.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Are ye sure they're all clean?
#NORA.
I am that. They've been scrubbed until me two arms ache. And Micky's had a bath in the rain - barrel.
#MICKY.
I have that, and I don't want another one, either.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
All yeez sit down and let me look ye over.
#NORA.
Have ye finished the washing, maw?
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
For the prisint, yes. I have more important duties to perform. Now, first and foremost, don't walk pigeon - toed. Bridget, have ye got a clane handkerchief?
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Yis, mum.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Well, don't forget to use it if the necessity arises, and you'd better set next to Peter Pan so's he can use it, too. He's been kinder nosey all day, and I shouldn't wonder if he wasn't coming down with a cold in his head. How do you feel, Peter Pan?
#PETER PAN.
Scwumptious.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Micky Machree Mulligan, and what are yeez looking cross - eyed for? Do ye think it improves yer beauty?
#MICKY.
I thought there was a speck of dirt on me nose.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Well, there's not, and hold yer head up straight.
#PATSY.
Maw, ain't it most time to go?
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
It lacks two hours yet of the time, and Matsy ain't come back with the goat. Whatever's become of Shamus O'Brien I'd like to know. Which of yeez seen him last?
#NORA.
I saw him this mornin'. He was eatin' a tin tomato can down in the alley.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
The poor thing! Now I suppose I'll have a sick goat on me hands on top of all me other troubles - and tomorrow's Christmas Day.
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all, at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there, and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it, it's bound to be most fashionable and select.
#MARY ANN.
But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and say, "Thank yeez kindly and much obliged." Can ye do that?
#ALL.
Oh, yes, mum.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see anything of Matsy and the goat.
#CLARISSA.
Yes, mum.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.
#CLARISSA.
Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Me goat, is it?
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
It is the same, and it's an injured woman I am this night.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Chase me? He did worse than chase me. He caught up with me.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
And where is he now?
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Niver a know do I know where he is. I left your boy Matsy chasing him down the alley with a rope.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Bridget, go in the far room and get a wee drop of tay for Mrs. O'Toole.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
I can't drink any tay. I'm that injured I can't drink at all, at all. drop of tay will warm ye up. Hurry, Bridget.
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Yis, mum.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
I was out in me cabbage garden picking a bit of cabbage for me owld man's Christmas dinner. I was bending over looking at the cabbage whin all of a sudden I felt meself flying through the air and I landed in the watering trough, so I did. And it was full of water. And I'm almost killed entirely - and it's all the fault of your goat, Mrs. Mulligan.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
There, now, Kathleen, darlin', sit down and take things easy.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
I'll not sit down, Mollie Mulligan. Sure I'm thinking I'll be after spindin' the rist of me life standing up on me two fate.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
So the goat struck ye, did he?
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
He did.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
My, my, the trouble I've had all along of that Shamus O'Brien. He's an awful goat, is Shamus O'Brien.
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Here's the tea, mum.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Thank ye kindly, Bridget. Here, Kathleen, take a cup of tay and let it soothe your wounded feelings.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Sure, it's more than me feelings that is wounded, Mrs. Mulligan.
#CLARISSA.
Maw, ain't it time we were starting for the entertainment?
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
My, my, I've been that excited about the misdeeds of that rascal Shamus O'Brien that I had forgotten the Christmas entertainment entirely.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Sure, your family looks as though they were going out in society, Mollie Mulligan.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
They are that. They're on their way to the fine church entertainment at the Sunday School down the strate.
#NORA.
Maw, here comes Matsy with the goat.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Matsy Mulligan, tie that goat in the back yard and tie all his four fate together. I'll tach him a lesson, if it's the last thing I ever do. Patsy, go out and help your brother tie up Shamus O'Brien.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Nora Eudora, darlin', have ye got a sofy pillow handy. I think if I had a couple of sofy pillows I could set down and enjoy me tay.
#NORA.
Yis, mum. Here's two of 'em.
#MATSY.
Come on, all of yeez, or we'll be late for the show. And I don't want to miss nothin'.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
I think yeez are all ready now. Let me see if there's anyone missing.
#PATSY.
We are all here, maw.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Now, yer all ready. Throw out yer heads. Forward, march!
#CHILDREN.
Good - bye, maw.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Good - bye, and the Lord love yeez all. Have a good time. Good - bye.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Ten of 'em. I don't see how ye ever manage to make both ends meet, Mollie Mulligan, with ten big, healthy children - to say nothing of the goat, Shamus O'Brien.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Good - bye. Have a good time. Mary Ann, don't let yer sash bust in two!
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Ye have a fine family, Mrs. Mulligan. Ye have a fine bunch of boys, and ye have a bunch of girls, and ye have a fine bunch of babies; but ye have an awful goat.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Shamus O'Brien is the pest of me heart, Kathleen O'Toole; so he is; but he's all that's left of me late husband's property. Michael Mulligan thought the world of that goat, he did.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
I'm a peaceful woman, Mollie Mulligan, and a calm, neighborly woman; but I don't like goats.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
I don't blame ye at all, at all, Kathleen. But poor Shamus O'Brien was probably only nosing around fer a bit of Christmas Eve dinner. I'll kape him tied in the future.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Sure and it is Christmas Eve, isn't it?
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Indade it is, and for the sake of the holy eve, I think ye'd best be after forgiving the poor goat and not harbor any ill feeling agin him on Christmas Day.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Harbor ill feeling, is it? Faith, then I'll not, Mollie Mulligan, and it's meself that'll be bringing over a big cabbage head on the morning for Shamus O'Brien's Christmas dinner.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
I'll be after tidying up the house a bit. It's little enough I've got for the children's Christmas tomorrow morning; but at least I can have me house in order and a burning candle shining in the windy.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Your burning candle takes me back again to the days of me childhood in County Clare. Well do I mind me last Christmas Eve in ould Ireland, the little thatched cabin with its one window, the stinging smoke of the peat fire, the lads and the colleens and the ould piper - and the merry dances and songs, do ye remember, Mollie, darling?
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
:
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
:
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
:
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
It's lucky for us, darlin', that me husband is out at his lodge tonight. I can stay with you until the children return from the entertainment, and maybe it's a bit of a Christmas Eve high - jinks we can be having afterwards.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Indade, I'm glad to have ye, Kathleen. Will your husband be long at lodge?
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
He will that. Pat is the Grand Exalted Chafe Ruler of the Benevolent and Obstreperous Order of United Wooden - men, and he won't be home till marnin'.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Is he now? The late Mr. Mulligan was niver much of a lodge joiner but that made no difference to him; he niver came home till marnin', lodge or no lodge.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Remember, Mollie, you're coming over to dinner with us tomorrow. It's at one o'clock.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Oh, Kathleen, I can't be laving the children at all, at all. On Christmas Day, too.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Of course you can't. Ye're going to bring the children over with ye.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
The whole tin of them?
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
And ye're willing for the whole bunch of us to come?
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
All but the goat. I draw the line at Shamus O'Brien. Ye see it's this way. Me man, Pat, won a turkey in a raffle, and it's as big as a billy - goat. Then on top of that me daughter Toozy, that's married and lives in the country, sent us two chickens and a goose. And there's only me and Pat to ate all that.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Kathleen O'Toole, it's a saint ye are.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
I says to Pat, says I, "Christmas ain't Christmas at all, at all, unless there's some children at the dinner." "What'll we do?" says Pat. "Invite the Mulligans," says I. And Pat was tickled to death. We've potatoes and squash and cabbage from me own garden, and we've oyster dressing and cramberries and stewed corn and apple fritters, and it's meself that has made eight mince pies, and four punkin ones - and I think we'll be after having a dinner on Christmas Day that would do credit to ould Saint Patrick himself.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Sure, ye almost make me cry for joy, Kathleen O'Toole, and after the goat trated ye the way he did, too.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
If a woman can't be neighborly and loving on Christmas Day, Mollie Mulligan, sure I'm thinking she niver can be neighborly and loving at all, at all.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
And ye're aven makin' a bit of an iliphant for wee Peter Pan.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
I am that. Here's the little, fat body. And here's the four legs. I'll just stick the legs on with nails - and there he stands. Now, here's a little potato for a head, and an ould skinny carrot for a trunk. I'll stick them on with a hair pin. Now, I'll stick on the ears and put in the shoe - button eyes, and with this wee bit of black paper for a tailpiece, and there ye are. Mr. Mumbo Jumbo Mulligan as natural as life and twice as handsome.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Here's a doll baby I've dressed, but it's no head she has at all, at all.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Use a big yellow apple or a wee yellow punkin, and put on a baby cap - and there ye are. Stick in some buttons for eyes, and a wee nose and mouth of red paper - and stick the head on the body with some hair pins, and the quane herself niver had a better doll baby.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
I'll put her right here on the table alongside of the iliphant.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
It's nine o'clock, it is. Isn't it time for the children to be home?
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
It is that. And here they come now.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
And did ye have a good time at the entertainment?
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
Indade and we did that. It was as good as a circus parade and a picture show together. They treated us just lovely.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Did they now? And you wasn't invited at all, at all.
#MATSY.
They gave us a seat way up in front, and Micky Machree acted like a pig, he did. Sure, he grabbed two oranges.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Why, Micky, it's ashamed of ye I am.
#MICKY.
I grabbed one to bring home to you, maw. I wanted you to have some of the Christmas present, too.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
That's just like your father, Micky.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
And did ye have a good time, wee Peter Pan?
#PETER PAN.
Scwumptious, just scwumptious.
#MARY ANN.
And me sash niver busted in two at all. And I was one of the most stylish young ladies present, so I was.
#MELISSA.
And they had a great, big Christmas tree. Clean up to the ceiling. With lights and toys and candy and little stars and bright fairies and angels and everything.
#PATSY.
And ould Santy Claus was there with a long white beard and a big pack of presents to everyone.
#CLARISSA.
And I pulled Santa Claus' whiskers and they nearly fell off. He must be getting pretty old, 'cause his whiskers is coming loose.
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
And Santy Claus called out all the names and everybody got up when their names was called and he gave 'em a present.
#MICKY.
And they never called our names at all, at all.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
That's because they didn't know them. They didn't expect you at the party.
#MARY ANN.
It was a surprise party, maw.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
How was it a surprise party, Mary Ann?
#MARY ANN.
They all looked surprised when we came in.
#NORA.
When I saw they weren't going to call out our names, I just rose up in me seat and took the whole nine of 'em by the hand and marched right up to Santa Claus. He looked real surprised at the bunch of us.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
I should think he would.
#NORA.
"And who are you?" says he. "We're the ten little Mulligans from Mulligan Alley in Shantytown," says I, as cool as an icicle. "And we're ready for our presents, if it's all the same to you," says I. I thought they was going to fire us out, but what did he do but dive way down in the bottom of the sack and give every last one of us a present?
#TEDDY.
And then he gave us bags of candy and oranges and apples and peanuts and popcorn and a candy cane, and then they had a show and Bridget Honora spoke a piece, she did.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
How did ye happen to spake a piece, Bridget Honora?
#BRIDGET BRUIN.
I just stood up and told 'em I knowed one. There ain't nuthin' bashful about me. And I kind o' thought we ought to do something to help pay fer the good things they gave us.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
That's me good little Bridget Honora.
#MELISSA.
Oh, wee! Lookee there! Where'd she come from?
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Santa Claus was after being here while you were away and he left it for you.
#MELISSA.
Is it all for me?
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
It's the Mulligan dolly. It's fer all ten of yeez.
#PATSY.
She can have my share. I don't want no dolls.
#MICKY.
Oh, look at the efulunt. Look at the efulunt.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
That is Mumbo Jumbo Mulligan from the sunny shores of Africa, way down in Louisiana.
#CHILDREN.
Who's he fur? Who's he fur?
#PETER PAN.
He's fur me. Scwumptious!
#TEDDY.
Maw, they had a show there at the Sunday School. There was a wee little man, about so long , and he stood up on a table and sang a song, so he did.
#PATSY.
Humph! I know how they did that. Matsy and me can show it to you.
#MELISSA.
And they had the Turnover Topsy Turvies, too.
#CLARISSA.
They stood upside down on their heads.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
My, my - but it must have been a wonderful show.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Just think what we missed, Mollie Mulligan.
#MATSY.
I didn't miss nothin'. I never miss nothin' no time.
#NORA.
We could give just as good a show our own selves.
#OTHERS.
Let's do it; let's do it. Let's give a show for maw and Mis' O'Toole.
#TEDDY.
Would you like to see it, maw?
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
If it ain't too late.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
What matters it how late it is? Christmas comes but once a year -
#ALL.
And when it comes it brings good cheer.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Then sure we'll have the show. Poor folks can be just as happy on Christmas Day as rich folks. It's all in the way you feel about it.
#PATSY.
Now, maw, you and Mrs. O'Toole take your seats out there in front.
#MATSY.
I'll help you carry them out.
#PATSY.
Now, we'll have to draw the curtain to get the stage ready.
#NORA.
And while we're getting ready Mary Ann can say her piece.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
My, my, Kathleen, what a large crowd of people are here tonight. I'm afraid I'm not dressed up for the occasion.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Dressed up, is it? Indade you are. Ye have on short sleeves and a low - neck dress. What more would ye want? There's the minister and his wife setting right back there. Good avening, Brother - ; sure, it's a fine avening we're having, is it not?
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
My, my, is it yourself, Mrs. - ? Sure, I'm glad to see ye out. It's a long time since I've had the pleasure of seeing you. And there's - and - and - I'm glad to see all of yeez. Sure, some day yeez must come over to me house in Mulligan Alley and I'll let you play with the goat, Shamus O'Brien.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
I see the young ladies over there, and each one of them has a young man. My, my, it does me ould heart good to see the young folks enjoying themselves. It ain't so many years since me and Pat was courting each other just like the rest of yeez.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Mrs. O'Toole, do you see that young man sitting there all by his lonesome? Ain't it a shame? And him such a good looking young feller, too. I've a good notion to go over there and cheer him up a bit. Maybe his girl is here with another fellow.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Sure, there's plenty of girls here without any fellows at all, at all. Why should a young man sit all alone like a bump on a log, whin there's so many handsome colleens waiting for the chance at him?
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Whist, Mrs. O'Toole, it's making him embarrassed yeez are. Will you look at the red color in his face?
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
If ye ask me my opinion, Mollie Mulligan, sure and I think he's after waiting fer one of yer own lovely daughters.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Well, he might go further and fare worse. Nora Eudora's a fine girl, if I do say it myself.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Whist, here comes Mary Ann out in front of the curtain to spake her piece.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Wasn't that dandy? Sure, little Mary Ann has a wonderful education, so she has!
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
She takes after her own mother. I was just like her when I was that age.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
And you're just like her still, Mollie Mulligan. Sure you're the sunshine of Mulligan Alley and the belle of Shantytown.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Whist now! It's covered I am wid blushes. But, hush! I think the show is about to begin.
#RALPH.
It is covered with a sheet or long cloth reaching to the ground. and TEDDY form the dwarf. PATSY, coatless, has a long pair of striped stockings on over his arms, and a pair of shoes on his hands, ornamented on insteps with large rosettes. TEDDY stands behind him and thrusts his arms as far as they will go under PATSY'S armpits. A kind of a tunic covers both. Wear a large crimped frill or an enormous turned - down collar.) stands behind table and places his shoe - clad hands upon it, which represent the feet of the dwarf. The door curtains are fastened together a few inches above his head, concealing TEDDY. must lean slightly over the table or the legs will not appear to support the body.
#MATSY.
Now, if you will kindly lend me your ears for a moment, I will fill them free of charge with a few words concerning the world's greatest assortment of marvelous monstrosities. In the first cell we have Senor Macaroni Spaghetti from the land of the banana. The senor is thirty - nine inches high, and, strangely enough, thirty - nine years old, to say nothing of the fact that he weighs thirty - nine pounds. He arrived last week by parcel post to join our circus. The senor is looking for a wife. Oh, you needn't laugh! It's true. Some of you near - sighted ladies should have brought magnifying glasses, for Senor Macaroni Spaghetti is the smallest speck of humanity that ever lived in captivity. He stands on a silver dollar and puts his hand in a thimble. The senor will now entertain you in his entertaining way.

And now, ladies and gentlemen, I'll call your attention to the seven little Sunbonnet babies. Behold them, them famous Mulligan twins.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Nora! Bridget! Mary Ann! What do ye mane! You'll kill yourselves entirely. If you stand on your head like that, all your brains will rush down into your fate.
#NORA.
That's the way they did in the show.
#MRS. O'TOOLE.
Well, well, well, wonders will never cease. Sure, I niver spint such a fine Christmas Eve in all me life before.
#MRS. MULLIGAN.
Sure, I think we've had a fine Christmas celebration, don't you? And before ye go let this sink down deep in your hearts and minds - it doesn't take money and fine clothes and costly gifts to make a fine Christmas at all, at all. All it takes is loving hearts and loving hands, and merry faces of happy boys and girls. We didn't have any money - but you see what a lovely time we've had - and it's all because the spirit of Christmas was in our hearts - and the spirit of Christmas means love, and love is the greatest thing in all the world. Merry Christmas to all of yeez, and may ye never regret the time you spent Christmas Eve with the ten little Mulligans.
