#OLD JOE.
How fares ye, Ned? Been a - fishing? So’ve I. Let’s sit down on the bank here and talk it over.
#NED.
Ah, well! or, rather, ah, ill! Another day of vacation gone. Already the store—the busy, crowded, everlasting store—looms up before me. Customers seem beckoning me away. I hear, methinks, the rustle of cambrics mingling with the rustling of the leaves, and—and—
#OLD JOE.
And the birds sing out “Cash, cash!” don’t they? O fiddle - de - dee! the store is fifty miles off,—fifty miles; and six days! Another day gone?—well, don’t fret for that. Didn’t you get enough for it? Now, I never fret about letting a piece of goods go, if I get the worth of it.
#NED.
Really, Joseph, I don’t see what selling goods has to do with the subject.
#OLD JOE.
Why, you’ve let your day go. Old Time took it. He buys up a good many of ’em; but he pays. You got the value of your article: you took your pay in taking comfort. Fair trade enough.
#NED.
Well, you may talk; but the day is gone, and it will never return
#OLD JOE.
But, if we live till to - morrow, there’ll another one come: leastways, I hope so; for I’ve a plan ahead. I’ll do it: I will! I certainly will, dogs or no dogs,—unless the sea dries up; and then I’ll walk. But how was river - fishing?
#NED.
Oh, fair! that is to say, reasonably fair, for the first attempt.
#OLD JOE.
Fine day you had.
#NED.
Charming day. In the morning we rowed up stream, with Nature smiling all around us,—of course I mean the dewy fields, sprinkled with flowers; and anon we glided through the leafy woods, where the birds sang melodiously. All was fair and lovely.
#OLD JOE.
Having fair wind’s the main thing: the rest is well enough. So you made an all - day trip of it?
#NED.
Yes: a really charming little excursion, and the presence of the fair sex—hem!
#OLD JOE.
Made it still more really charming. Yes, I know. They usually have their charms about them.
#NED.
Exactly. And at noon we landed, and spread our repast under the shade of a spreading oak, and there partook of cold chicken, sandwiches, and fruits. At the hour of sunset, with a fair wind, and with now and then a song, we floated calmly down the stream.
#OLD JOE.
All serene. Now I took it in the rough. See! Borrowed real sea - clothes, and sailed on the briny sea. Jingoes, if ’twasn’t sport off the Ledge!
#NED.
Seasick?
#OLD JOE.
Hem! Well, little rily doubling “Hook’s Pint:” soon over it, though, and relished my lunch—oh, hugely! None of your chicken - fixin’s; real fishermen’s fare,—sea - biscuit dipped in the sea.
#NED.
Barbarous fare, I should call that.
#OLD JOE.
Not a bit. Oh, yes! I’m mistaken: good many bits. Fish bit lively, and old skipper chowdered ’em right out o’ the water: then we got into a school o’ mackerel, and so brought in quite a fare of fish. If we’d only landed on that island—But I mean to , dogs or no dogs. What the dogs do I care! Let ’em yelp!
#NED.
Of what island are you speaking?
#OLD JOE.
“Maiden Island” some call it. Skipper said ’twas oftener called “The Isle of Dogs.”
#NED.
Why are these names given to it?
#OLD JOE.
Because there is a maiden there, of course, and dogs abound. But I’ll land I’ll attack the fort. “Let dogs delight,” and so forth.
#NED.
I’m curious to hear more of this isle of the sea.
#OLD JOE.
Listen, then, and I’ll tell you a true story: only it hasn’t any end to it yet. But I’ll make an end ,—I’m resolved upon that,—unless an earthquake swallows it up.
#NED.
Swallows up the end!
#OLD JOE.
The island.
#NED.
Can’t you explain?
#OLD JOE.
Oh, yes! Explain?—certainly. Now hark. In the middle of the sea—that is, off in the harbor—stands a lonely isle; and on that isle stands a hut; and in that hut dwells a stern old fisherman; and that stern old fisherman owns a fair daughter; and, on account of the island being flooded with admirers, he has defended it with dogs, manned it with dogs.
#NED.
Really! Now that isn’t quite fair in the old gentleman.
#OLD JOE.
Fair? Of course it isn’t! But I’ve got a plan. I’ll land: I certainly will, if every dog had as many heads as—now, what was that dog’s name that barked down in that dark place?—no matter; and if every head had as many mouths, I’ll land. “Faint heart never won fair lady.”
#NED.
But what if they all fly at you?
#OLD JOE.
Then I’ll fly at them.
#NED.
We shall be caught in the shower. Come.
#OLD JOE.
Oh, let it rain, let it rain! Better chance of fair weather to - morrow.
#NED.
But will you? will you really dare?
#OLD JOE.
Yes: none but the brave deserve the fair! Well.
#SQUIRE REED.
Well, Benson, how do you prosper? Always at work, hey? What! covered up your well?
#MR. BENSON.
Yes, and got in a pump ; but ’twon’t draw. Something’s the matter.
#SQUIRE REED.
I’m very sorry; not sorry the pump won’t draw, but sorry to lose the well,—sorry, I mean, to lose it out of the landscape. It was a very striking feature, with its long sweep.
#MR. BULBUS.
Wal, to tell the truth, it did go agin my feelings. We’d got used to seeing it. My gran’ther dug it and stoned it up; and I’ve hoisted up a good deal o’ water out of it since I was boy, counting washing - water and all. But then ’twas a heap o’ trouble. Why don’t the critter draw?
#SQUIRE REED.
How did it trouble you?
#MR. BULBUS.
Oh! things kept falling down it. I’d be out in the field, working, you know; and ’twould be all the time, “Mr. Benson, this thing’s tumbled down the well, and that thing’s tumbled down the well.” Then I’d leave, and run; and maybe ’twould be my little gal’s doll, or bub’s hat, or clean clothes off the line. And all the neighbors wanted to hang their things down it to keep cool. Course it put us out; but course we didn’t like to speak: so we had to say, “No trouble at all, no trouble at all;” though ’twasn’t true, you know.
#SQUIRE REED.
Very true; that is, it wasn’t very true.
#MR. BULBUS.
And then ’twas a master place to c’lect young folks together, as ever was. First the gals would come with their pails, and stand talking; then the beaux would come, ’specially about sundown. Says I to my wife, “Guess I’ll break up that haunt.” But this new - fangled thing won’t draw a mite.
#SQUIRE REED.
Let me try.
#MR. BULBUS.
Yes, you work it, and I’ll pour in water to fetch it. Any thing run out?
#SQUIRE REED.
I don’t see any thing.
#MR. BULBUS.
Dry as a grasshopper.
#MR. DOWNING.
Good - morning, sir. I understand you have a pump that doesn’t work well.
#MR. BULBUS.
Exactly: that’s just what I’ve got.
#MR. DOWNING.
I am a pump - doctor.
#SQUIRE REED.
That is to say, I suppose that you can cure a pump, and make it well.
#MR. BULBUS.
Oh, don’t make mine well! It’s been well once.
#MR. DOWNING.
If you will place your pump in my hands, sir, I will pledge myself that it shall give satisfaction.
#SQUIRE REED.
That is to say, give water.
#MR. BULBUS.
Here, take it right into your hands: now let’s see what ’twill give.
#SQUIRE REED.
How do you cure, sir?
#MR. DOWNING.
By circles and opposite electricities. Shall I proceed?
#MR. BULBUS.
Yes, proceed to begin: don’t wait.
#SQUIRE REED.
That is, begin first, and then proceed.
#MR. BULBUS.
And, if the job’s well done, you shall be well paid.
#MR. DOWNING.
I shall require, gentlemen, a little assistance from both of you.
#SQUIRE REED.
Of what nature, sir?
#MR. BULBUS.
Oh, yes! I’m willing to take hold: course you’ll take little something off the price.
#MR. DOWNING.
No labor, no actual labor, will be required of you. My system involves only circles and opposite electricities. In the first place, it will be necessary to ascertain whether your electrical currents are opposite.
#MR. BULBUS.
Well, how will you do it?
#MR. DOWNING.
to SQUIRE R. Have the kindness, now, sir, to touch lightly the circumference of this machine.
#MR. DOWNING.
to MR. B. Now you, sir. Don’t be afraid: it is quite harmless.
#MR. DOWNING.
All is well. The electrical conditions are fulfilled: the one sprang to the east, the other to the west.
#MR. BULBUS.
Mighty powerful!
#MR. DOWNING.
I shall now proceed, gentlemen, to describe two circles around the well. Will you please to advance?
#SQUIRE REED.
Sir, this appears somewhat like trifling.
#MR. DOWNING.
That depends upon yourself, sir. To the light - minded, serious matters appear light. I deal with the truths of science. Will you come nearer, sir?
#MR. BULBUS.
No danger, I hope; no witchcraft?
#MR. DOWNING.
Not the slightest. I will now work the handle. You two, being fully charged, will stand at opposite points , and proceed to revolve silently in these circles,—you, sir , revolving in the external orbit, and you, sir , in the internal: at your third conjunction, water will gush forth.
#SQUIRE REED.
Marvellous! most wonderful!
#MR. BULBUS.
Wal, I declare! Be you a wizard? I hope—I hope it’s Christian doings.
#MR. DOWNING.
What you have witnessed, gentlemen, is merely a new triumph of science.
#MR. BULBUS.
I’m glad it’s science: I was afraid ’twas witchcraft. Send in your bill, stranger. I’m all in a heap. Science!
#MR. DOWNING.
Permit me to inform you, sir, that witchcraft is science; only science doesn’t know it. Good - morning, gentlemen : I have business farther on. Have the goodness to accept my card
#SQUIRE REED.
Will you allow me to accompany you, and give me the pleasure of your conversation?
#MR. DOWNING.
With pleasure, sir.
#SQUIRE REED.
Good - day, neighbor. I’m rejoiced that your troubles are over. “All’s well that ends well.”
#MR. BULBUS.
My well ends pump.
